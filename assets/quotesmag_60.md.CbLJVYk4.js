Fine ink drawings bring the characters to life while T.S. Elliot lets you know why it is cats must have three different names.

Eliot proves with Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats that the rhyming poem is just as valid as free verse. Why some people continue to regard the rhyming poem as the lower form of poetic expression, or as something strictly for the little ones, is beyond me (perhaps it's due in part to the fact that TV advertisers abuse this art form on a regular basis, cheapening it with their cringe-inducing jingles). But whatever the case, these detractors have either never read, or (hard as it is to believe) forgot the magnificent rhyming poetry contained in T.S. Eliot's slim yet thoroughly satisfying masterpiece. The illustrations included in this edition are by Ed Gorey, and they complement Eliot's poetry beautifully. This is a great book. Highly recommended!I also recommendAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland, which like Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, is a collection of brilliant rhyming poetry. As the title suggests, this book contains 'the lost rhymes' of Wonderland, 19 full-length poems that replicate the style of Lewis Carroll so cannily you'd almost swear the legend of the lost rhymes is true.

Eliot is probably known to every literate speaker of English over the age of 18 as the source for most of the material in the very long running Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, \`Cats'. I believe the long dead Eliot even received a posthumous Tony award for his having done the lyrics for most of the songs in \`Cats'.The book \`...Practical Cats' is a part of a very distinguished tradition of animal fantasy works. The most famous contributors to this genre which come to my mind are Lewis Carroll, especially for \`Jabberwocky' and the poem of the walrus and the carpenter, and Don Marquis, author of a series of stories collected as \`archie and mehitibal', where archie is a cockroach and mehitibal is a rather disreputable cat who would be right at home sharing an alley with Mungojerrie and Rumpelteaser. These are all some of the more distinguished precursors to modern comic strips such as \`Garfield', \`Heathcliff', \`Cats with Hands', \`Marmaduke' and \`Mutts', not to mention frequent guest appearances in \`Ziggy' and that most famous of beagles, Snoopy.What is so amazing about this collection of poems is that it comes from the pen of the very proper and immensely precocious Professor Eliot. T. S. Eliot is best known for some of the most famously pessimistic poems of the 20th century, \`The Hollow Men' and \`The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'. By reputation, he is so prissy, he couldn't stand to be a part of our Babbitish American culture and beat a path to English residence and citizenship.One of my most cherished memories of T. S. Eliot is a story I heard first hand from the distinguished Johns Hopkins historian of ideas, George Boas who told the story of Eliot's staying with Boas in Baltimore and requesting an introduction to and visit with that most famous Baltimorean, H. L. Menchen. Boas had Menchen over after dinner and Menchen and Eliot sat down together in armchairs by the fire and Eliot said to Menchen \`I understand you know something of American politics'. At this point, Menchen slipped into his best newspaper reporter barroom persona with stories of backroom dealings while Eliot slipped more and more firmly into his Oxford donnish persona. While I have no reason to doubt Boas memory, I was delighted to have the story verified in one of Menchen's many posthumously published autobiographical works.So what is this priggish don doing writing animal fantasy? I'm afraid I can't answer this. All I can say is that T. S. Eliot certainly deserved his Tony and a lot more for this little collection of poems. Eliot's little book contains fifteen (15) poems. Twelve (12) of these became songs in \`Cats', although the \`Cats' show stopper, \`Memories' is not among these twelve. Also, the character who sings this song, Grizabella, is not the subject of any of the poems, although there are some similarities between Grizabella and Growltiger, the subject of one of the three poems not included.While I have no wish to diminish Eliot's accomplishment with these poems, he certainly knew a good thing when he realized that the animal fantasy genre offers great resources for inventing words and names to facilitate the crafting of great rhymes. Just think about the first verse of \`Jabberwocky' and you will know what I mean.I cannot fail to mention the great Edward Gorey illustrations that come along with this edition. They make the truly tiny price for this little volume more than worth the money. For anyone on the lookout for intelligent things to read to your young'ens, you should add this to your copies of \`Winnie the Pooh', \`The Hobbit', the stories of Narnia, and \`Alice in Wonderland'."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"The marriage of Eliot's words and Gorey's illustrations are superb.

Eliot, is a book of poems about cats. The basis for the wildly successful musical &quot;Cats,&quot; the book stands on its own as a delightful work of literature. The poems are accompanied by wonderful illustrations by Edward Gorey.This book is hilarious and very enjoyable. Eliot's words leap and dance across the pages with a zany musicality. Gorey's accompanying artwork is whimsical and full of interesting details. Eliot has created some great feline characters: the fearsome Growltiger, dapper Bustopher Jones, Magical Mr. Mistoffelees, and more.Yes, these poems are great fun to read. But if you are inclined to look closer and analyze them at a deeper literary level, you will find that each one is a masterpiece of poetic craftsmanship. Eliot uses a wonderful variety of meters, rhyme schemes, and various poetic effects. Each poem stands on its own, and together they form an effective artistic unity.Also noteworthy is the very &quot;English&quot; flavor of the book, which Eliot achieves by spicing his poems with many references to English geography and cultural history. Highly recommended, whether or not you like cats."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"OK, the musical has been going on and on for some time now, PBS has it on tape, but have you actually sat down and read these poems out loud?

Eliot's verse to life in a new way. I strongly recommend both this edition and the old illustrated edition with illustrations by Nicholas Bentley.Gorey brings his wry humour and pathos to bear on poetry that deserves multiple interpretations. Bentley brought a more straight reading to the work, but did a great job nonetheless.Also, HARD TO FIND but well worth it are the childrens' picture-book versions by Errol Le Cain of Growltiger's Last Stand with The Pekes and the Pollicles and the Song of the Jellicles and Mr Mistoffelees with Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer. These are stunning picture-books that I sought out to own as an adult with no kids and no intention of having any, simply because I loved them."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"The poetry - well, there are many editions of the work the Andrew Lloyd-Webber made the most famous of Eliot's books.

Partly because I do like cats, and also because I am of English descent. T.S. has his English cats down to a \\"T\\". Naming them is great fun and his cat names are GREAT. His desciption of their behaviour and antics pretty much lets you know he has been introduced to many a cat in his day. These cats almost come off the page and play with you, they are so true to life. Read this collection if you love cats and want a few moments of private recollection.

There is so much detail in the drawings and so much humor, the book would be worth it for the images alone. Coupled with the poetry of T.S. Eliot makes it all the more worth having. A great way to introduce children of any age to a great poet."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"If are a lover of cats, or have enjoyed the musical &quot;Cats&quot;, or appreciate masterful poetry, or even a student of modernism, you will fall for &quot;Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats&quot; by T.S Eliot (&quot;The Wasteland&quot; &quot;The Lovesong of J.Alfred Prufrock&quot;).However, I especially recommend this book to parents who read to their children. Imagine an older and more conservative grand-master poet focusing his skills in rhythm, rhyme and content into a book of lyrics suitable for 5-year-olds. What you get is a book that not only has the sonority and imagination, combined with an appealing subject matter ( a diverse group of antropomorphized cats), for the children, but also is dense enough to be enjoyable repeated reading for the parent (Who of you still gets turned on by &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;?), and challenging stimulation for the child.If you have a son or daughter who loves cats,this book is a must buy!"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Two of the most dour staid artists of their day have come together to bring you a work of absolute perfection. T.S. Eliot is well known as the author of, \\"The Wasteland\\" and other books of that ilk. So it is undoubtedly odd that he should have decided to write this book, \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\\". Likewise, the somber (though infinitely amusing) Edward Gorey is often attributed with dark Victorian scenes of murder and amusing death. Here he has laid aside his more macabre inclinations and produced a series of pictures featuring roly-poly kitties in all sorts of interesting arrangements. The combination is inspired. If you have ever seen the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \\"Cats\\" then I pity you. You will find yourself unable to read a single one of these poems without the accompanying music jangling in your head. If, however, you don't find this a flaw, then by all means read this book. The poems are nothing if not charming. Where else will you find poetry suitable for children that contains words like, \\"succulent\\", \\"quorum\\", and \\"physiognomy\\"? And as for Gorey, his pen is without equal. The book is delightful, and kids (especially those who've actually seen \\"Cats\\") will like it very much."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Even though one of my degrees is in English lit and even though I've been a poetry lover for half a century or more, I've never been a great lover of TS Eliot, with this one exception.

It helps if you're a cat lover, in which case you're bound to love this even if you think you hate poetry or TS Eliot style poetry.This book's been beaten to death (in a positive way, mostly) by reviewers already, but I stumbled across it here and couldn't resist throwing in my own two cents."},{"Title":"The Lost Wagon Train","review":"Really enjoyed this Zane Gray western. Looking for more of this type of action western. Have only read a few of his works so far."},{"Title":"The Lost Wagon Train","review":"I'm sorry, but this is one Zane Grey book I do not like. I have only managed to read the entire thing just one time. It's boring; it's flat; it's unbelievable. Stephen Latch, the main character, is not some one you can have any sympathy for, or at least be able to think, well, maybe, perhaps; or even have any mercy for. I'm not some one to criticize an author for what he writes because I know he has something he wants to say, or an opinion; but I just don't understand what Zane Grey was doing with this book. My advice is skip it, and pick a better one and then come back to this one. I know not every book an author creates is perfect, or great; Zane Grey just missed this time out."},{"Title":"Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)","review":"As a person with an enduring fascination and respect for the early Dadaists I found this introduction offered a very good and (despite the title) in-depth coverage of most aspects of Dada and Surrealism.The theme is comparison and contrast and also the development of thematic elements in both currents: how they rose to, or challenged each other and society. The basic differences in Dada as Anti-Art and Surrealism as Art-for-arts sake is well considered. The latter bourgoeise taste was very much derided by the original Dadas. The political development of both groups is also analysed, their stances on feminism, colonialism and mass movements.The one thing that I found not covered in this book -- and is also not covered in most books on this subject is, how two movements with such anti-establishment themes fared in the sometimes authoritarian societies that spawned them... how for example were the German Dadaist allowed to escape the Freikorps and later the Nazis? What did Franco think of Dali and Picasso? Some French Dada/Surrealists such as Andre Breton were able to escape from Vichy France to America, but what about the others...?In short, although both streams rebelled against the main thoughts that dominated society -- they were almost all consumate individualists -- how were they able to do so? Since most Dadaists survived WWII I must surmise that either Hitler left them alone, or they lowered their profile to such a degree that they become insignificant. But again, since they were at the forefront of criticising the automaton man that society produced in WWI, the question remains, how did they manage to avoid getting it in the neck when the rest of the world was racing headlong into the twin dispairs of Fascism and Communism?"},{"Title":"Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)","review":"Usually I read these sorts of books when I know little or nothing about the subject in question. In this case, however, I had a considerable familiarity with surrealism and dada. Still, I found this book provided an excellent historical overview of both movements. The greater and even the not-quite-great figures are all present and profiled and their contributions put into context. I thought the level of analysis was actually a cut above what you usually get in these sorts of introductory guides and yet the text remained clear and accessible; even those readers already somewhat knowledgeable about dada and surrealism are likely to find a few fresh and challenging insights.((Two caveats: the major impact of WWI on the Dadaists struck me as seriously understated and the revisionist groping for \\"gender correctness\\" anachronistic and distorting.))In the end, you can't go wrong with this handy little book if what you're looking for is a concise and intelligent dada/surrealist breviary. If, like me, you've read a lot of the primary texts and are a long-time fan of the artistic product of both movements, but found that you've done so in a haphazard and piecemeal fashion, this book will gather up and organize those pieces for you.You'll feel like you took that class in art history that you never -though you wish you had--taken in school."},{"Title":"The Soul of Vermont","review":"I was born and raised in Vermont, have lived out of the state for years, visiting annually. This book really did bring me home to the Soul of Vermont. The photographs are wonderful. They just take you in. If you want to spend some time in Vermont and can't make the trip, this is THE book for you."},{"Title":"The Soul of Vermont","review":"I first remember seeing one of Richard Brown's spectacular photographs on he cover of Country Journal, a magazine devoted to celebrating rural life styles that ran a span of several years in the early to late 1980s. Brown's stunning photographic style showcased the day-to-day confluence of ordinary Vermonters living their lives in the rural splendor of the Northeast Kingdom in the far reaches of the lovely \\"People's Republic Of Vermont\\". Often Country Journal would feature a number of his photos inside each issue, so one subscribing the magazine began to look for them both on the cover and inside, as well. Indeed, his work was what made me search for the latest issue at the beginning of each month.Here he stuns us with the majesty of Vermont as it transpires through its incredibly beautiful cycle of seasons in a way that only a photographer of such obvious abilities could. Herein he shares many of his favorites, and several of these I have seen before in other venues. The problem with a book filled with such gorgeously shot, developed and produced rural photographs is that one is tempted to carefully extract them for framing on the wall. They are really that terrific! Photographs range from shots of landscapes to silhouettes of a farmhouse steaming against the winter cold, from children walking down a dirt-covered tree lined country road exploding into autumn's extravagance to an elderly gentleman leaning against a barn with his favorite cat. One sits transfixed by the sheer variety of scenes and colors so native to the rural landscapes and personal portraits. This is a wonderful travelogue into the heart of New England.Brown shows us all of the changes that transpire in the North country, a place where the changes are so frequent and so momentous that they comprise six seasons, adding both the dreaded mud season of early springtime on the one hand, and the so-called \`off-season' after the autumn glory has been swept away, leaving cold bare trees and a hauntingly spare and vacant atmosphere to settle over the region on the other. Listen a few times to folksinger Tom Rush's rendition of \\"Urge For Going\\" a few times on the CD player and you will get the idea. Brown's imaginative hand is lovingly apparent in this book, displaying both the soulful visages of local inhabitants and the unique flavor of the haunting ever-changing scenery so typically Vermont. This is a distinctive and memorable recreation of what we love so much about being native new Englanders! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Soul of Vermont","review":"Reviewing a book such as this again supports the truth of that old bromide, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words.\\" At least no words of mine can do full justice to Brown's talent as a photographer. He settled in Whitingham in 1968 and began to teach in a small rural school. During the years since then, he has taken thousands of photographs of Vermont in search of what is, to his own eye, that state's unique character. As he explains in the Introduction, over time he shifted his attention from Vermont's natural beauty to what he calls \\"the cultivated landscape.\\" A preponderance of the photographs in this volume (many of which not previously published) were taken in the \\"Northeast Kingdom.\\" He organizes his work according to the seasons which include the \\"Off-Season\\" from late-October until Thanksgiving. For at least a few of those who read this review, my comments about Brown may be of some interest but, I realize, merely suggest a context for the creation of works of art which I lack the talent to describe. If you cannot visit Vermont in person, do so by seeing it through Brown's eyes. If you cherish his book as much as I do, you will also want to have a copy of The Beauty of Vermont, edited by Tom Slayton. As both books clearly indicate, the soul of Vermont is its beauty...and beauty its soul."},{"Title":"The Soul of Vermont","review":"I have a big collection of Vermont coffee table books, and I must say that this is not my favorite, only because I would have liked to see more diversity - a lot of the pictures are of the same area - Peacham- a beautiful place - don't get me wrong. That said, the photography is very nice and the photos really capture the essence of Vermont and the country life. Mr. Brown really does justice to the farm animals as well I just would have like to see more photos of other areas.

Williams published this the same year as The Descent of the Dove: A History of the Holy Spirit in the Church, and it would seem at first that these books cover two sides of the supernatural, but it's not quite that way.Williams is unique, among other things, for his skepticism, as summed in the epigram, \\"Believe and doubt well.\\" His take on witchcraft isn't based on believing or not believing in it but in looking at it in history and in relation to the rest of his ideas. To understand his approach, consider his credentials and the accidents of when he wrote. He was a member of A.E. Waite's Order of the Golden Dawn, a mystical society whose members included Evelyn Underhill, author of Mysticism, and poet W. B. Yeats, known for his poem, \\"The Second Coming.\\" No doubt he derived much of the local color, as it were, and ideas for his novels from this involvement.Aleister Crowley, the self-styled \\"Great Beast\\" tried to wrest control of the Golden Dawn. Whatever one thinks of \\"Mr. Crowley\\" as Ozzy Osbourne sang of him, he seems to be the model for a certain type of magician who appears in Williams' novels. Williams delves briefly into the events surrounding the dark history of the Malleus Mallificarum, the witch trials, the mysteries associated with the Knights Templar, the Illuminati and the \\"secret histories\\" which these days are so much in vogue in contemporary fiction.As in The Descent of the Dove, he often suggests alternate explanations, one being that in eras when the established church seemed to be on the side of the oppressors, by whatever political machinations, people would naturally look for some other power to invoke or side with satan (which means \\"enemy\\") whom Milton depicted as warring in heaven 'gainst heaven's matchless king. If the Knights Templar took pot shots at crosses on church steeples, Williams suggests, it might be for no darker device than to improve their skill as archers.As Williams himself writes, this is not the book for followers of Crowley; it doesn't tell how to conjure the Ape of Thoth or guide the reader through the Necromonicron (a sort of magic in which Williams probably did not believe). As an editor at Oxford University Press, Williams was one of the most widely-read men of his generation (and far more than most in ours). Unlike the recent revisionist \\"histories\\" and fictionalized reversions, Williams presents an brief overview of mostly unkown history and as with all his books, his ideas seem increasingly relevant."},{"Title":"Witchcraft","review":"This is a balanced and realistic history of witchcraft in western civilization. It shows how infectious is suspicion, the desire for power and envy that it can obliterate Christian principles from the practices of the church and lead to horrifying persecutions of suspected witches within Europe and the U.S. It also acknowledges that these same dark forces of envy, desires for power and vengeance have lead some to seek satisfaction through spiritual practices known through the ages as witchcraft. This book does not take sides for or against the institutional church, but is far more realistic and balanced. There are no easy formulae in this book, nor any niave summations of good versus evil in human institutions. It reminds us that evil forces are often most potent when people think their actions most justifiable and right."},{"Title":"Witchcraft","review":"Fascinating. In a world of Narnia and Middle-earth and Hogwarts, we have a real need to understand the distinction between Magic and what Charles Williams calls \\"that perverted way of the soul\\"...the other kind of magic. He doesn't compare any of these literary examples (the book was written years before either Narnia or LOTR were published, and decades before J. K. Rowling was born), but he presents a solid biblical and historical study of true witchcraft that should allow us to draw our own conclusions on any magic we encounter anywhere"},{"Title":"By the Numbers: Using Facts and Figures to Get Your Projects, Plans, and Ideas Approved","review":"Getting an idea or ideas out of your head is often not a difficult task. Most people can do it easily and fast too, even if they are put under time pressure. Sometimes, under time pressures, surprisingly many people can even come up with whacky and yet brilliant ideas.However, idea generation or creativity for that matter, is only a small part of the whole equation. There is no dispute ideas come from individual minds, but innovation will only take place when you are able to promote or sell your idea or ideas to your or other people. It takes teams or a group of interested people to make your ideas to work i.e to make innovation to happen.There are a lot of idea generation and/or creativity books out in the markeptplace, but very hard to find books touching on the promotion and selling of ideas. From my personal pursuit over the years, I have found only a small handful of good books in this genre.I am very glad to have found this one book. The four authors are well qualified, as all of them are business communication professionals.As the authors contend: \\"There are three phases in getting an idea off the ground:1. Get an idea...and sell it!2. Develop the idea..and sell it!3. Move the idea to market...and really sell it!\\"This book describes, in a step-by-step process, the strategic and tactical elements of the promotion and selling proposition, as follows:- research your ideas from all standpoints;- develop a compehensive plan;- build a support network;- develop a winning presentation;- prepare to present;- deliver your winning case;- celebrate;I am very impressed by this book partly because the authors took a comprehensive, broad-based approach to the subject at hand. They wrote it in the context of both organisational and personal perspectives. In the process, the authors covered every conceivable angle of promoting and selling your idea or ideas - from understanding your organisation, educating yourself right through building your case, gaining allies, assessing your audience, and all the way to designing and preparing your case and presenting your information/ideas.The chapter pertaining to 'Building a Business Case' is a gem to read and follow. This is a very important area to note in promoting and selling your idea. Oftentimes, people get carried away by their whacky ideas and they forget that the numbers or bottom-line are also important considerations, especially when you want to get support. This chapter will help you to refine your presentation of numbers.I also enjoy the authors' writing style - concise, crisp and succinct. All key learning points are also captured at the end of each chapter. These make reading and review much easier for the reader.So, if you want to learn how to promote and sell your idea or ideas, this is a 'must-read' book!"},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"I was pleased after opening my Amazon box~this was exactly what I needed. A Grandparent in the family wanted to know what they could give to us as a &quot;Welcome Baby&quot; gift for our son. I wanted not a 'purchased' gift...but one that would last for generations. I bought this book and mailed it to them asking for their gift of 'time'. It's a very big thing to ask someone to sit down and write out their life story. So I was grateful they were willing, and this book was a perfect tool! I saw the &quot;book&quot; version of this, not the journal, had many great reviews. This journal was all I needed. I didn't want to also ask my family to 'read' the how-to book as well. This book has plenty of thought provoking questions on each page, and plenty of room for the answers. So, it's great, for jumping right in and journaling! Great value too."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"Recently, I began sorting through my family's miscellaneous family history files in an effort to organize and update the information. It was with this goal in mind that I purchased this book.Instead of getting something that would help me unify my information, I found that this book encourages the individuality of the people you are trying to &quot;document&quot; for generations to come. Filled with more thought-provoking questions than you will ever find people to answer them, this book is a comprehensive and categorical compilation of just about every question you could ever think to ask *ANYone*. It's questions are appropriate for any age level, whether you are asking your grandparents or your grand-daughter. I found this book to be a wonderful conversation-starter and I learned far more than just &quot;facts and dates&quot; about my ancestors from the older members of the family.Whether you are a seasoned geneologist or just looking for a starting point, this book is the next step of your journey through time. Generations to come will thank you!"},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"I purchased this book for myself because I've always wanted to keep a diary or journal but I don't have the self discipline to do it on my own. It will take me years to answer all the questions since I haven't finished raising my own children...let alone meet my future grandchildren. But I find it helpful to focus my thoughts about my own memories and get them written down for later on."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"I recently bought this book for my Grandmother. We sat together and read the questions together. She talked about her life and I learned things about my grandma that I didn't know. She loves it and is looking forward to writing down her memories. I am going to buy one for my parents, brothers, and other grandparents for Christmas. What a thrill to hear and learn about my family."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"My mom is 89. She's in good health, but her memory is getting spotty. From discussions with my nieces and nephews, I'm well aware of how many \\"family stories\\" already have been lost. So on a recent visit to Mom, I packed along myFlip Videoand a copy of this book. I was almost reluctant to suggest we do an Oral History, but to my great surprise we used up the storage on the video camera that first night -- and she wanted to keep going.I give most of the credit to this book. It's meant to be a sort-of-diary for an individual to fill out. At the top of every page is a set of questions, and the rest of the page is blank, so you can write out the answer. Rather than write in Mom's answers, I used them as queries as I videotaped her; now, thanks to iMovie, I'll turn it into a DVD that I can share with the rest of my family.What makes these questions so good is that they elicit sensory memories. For example, rather than asking, \\"Tell me about your grandparents,\\" the book asks, \\"Did your grandparents have a food smell that you associated with visiting them?\\" My mom said no... but then she proceeded to tell me more about where and how they lived than I ever knew. A question about the view from her childhood window led to a long explanation of why her parents bought everything a teenager might want (Mom had a ping pong table and a pool table?) -- this way, she said, other kids came to THEIR house, so her folks never worried about where THEIR children were. I've known my mom for 51 years, and in an hour she told me at least four stories I hadn't heard before.Not every question grabbed her, of course -- but enough did that I quickly decided the book was absolutely worth the money. I would never have thought to ask her most of these questions. (Even though I'm a writer for a living, and I interview people professionally every day!)Don't wait until your relative is 89. After doing this exercise with my Mom, I'm very tempted to send copies of this book to my sisters and my brother. How many of their own stories have they forgotten, or never taken the time to share with children and grandchildren? I also recommend using this as a starting point for a video; Mom said that writing it out herself wouldn't have happened (I suspect it'd seem like a homework assignment, the sort you put off) but when I asked... well, that was something else entirely."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"My husband and I bought this for his mother, who is English and lives in England.

Some were too technical, others too scattered in their approach. Finally, I found these books by Bob Greene and D. G. Fulford. They are just the ticket for giving to family members to stimulate their recollections, as well as getting me started. I have lost several family members in the last few years. The ones who remain will be writing something their children will keep as precious due to these books."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"I purchased this book for my 83 year old Mother because my niece kept asking her to write down memories from when she was growing up. My Mom did not even where to begin so I thought this would help by asking questions. It did and she's working on it but, from what she tells me, it's quite draining because not all memories are pleasant. She can only do 2 or 3 questions a day. She enjoyed remembering the cat and the canary she had when she was little but was saddened thinking about how her family had struggled during the Depression, lost their house and had to move often or how her brother was killed during WWII. It is interesting to hear stories I've never heard before, but be forewarned that some very sad memories might be stirred up to."},{"Title":"To Our Children's Children Journal of Family Memories","review":"The questions are well thought out and interesting.

That was over ten years ago, and that book was so good, I gave mine away. And this book looks so similar and so similarly named that I purchased it in error. My mistake. The book as a concept is impractical and by design will not be a complete journal. Many questions will results in pages of memories, yet all questions are limited to a single page for handwriting, meaning a complete journal will not be self contained in this one volume. This, of course, was not clearly advertised. This is a pale ripoff of my original purchase purely for profit.

But if you're looking for a sensible introduction to everything from Abstract Expressionism to Pop to Conceptual Art, it's hard to beat Edward-Lucie Smith's little handbook. &quot;Late Modern&quot; is written in a style almost impossible to find today: clear and simple without being condescending; sophisticated without being pretentious. This is a book on art that doesn't try to be a book on philosophy, nor does it assume the reader to be incapable of intelligent thought, like so much written today. Another element that distinguishes &quot;Late Modern&quot; from contemporary textbooks is the author's willingness to take a stand: his indictment of Bernard Buffet is direct and uncompromising, as is her criticism of Giacomo Manzu, R. B. Kitaj, and the late work of Picasso, among others. This boldness, this willingness to stamp a personal interpretation without descending into pointless rhetoric, gives the book a liveliness that, ironically, gives it an immediacy seldom found in works written in the thirty years since. The author's faults are the faults of age: writing so close in time to the creation of these works, Lucie-Smith did not have the advantage of hindsight, and some of his judgements (especially his predictions on the future course of art) seem a little off the ball. But on the whole he succeeded remarkably well in judging which artists would hold up over time, and displayed a remarkably acute sense for analysis. The book offers a dual pleasure: it is both a highly satisfying introduction to modern art and a fascinating insight into the situation of art and art criticism at a pivotal moment in it's history."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This is a fun one, especially on audio tape. The dialogue is hilarious, and you get involved in the pitifulness of the main character. Buy it!!"},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"You can't go wrong.

But this book - this book is brilliant."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. For me, it delves into what it's like to be a creative person in the 'normal' material world. You always feel like an outsider. I identify with this book myself and it is one of my favorites. The book has all the elements of a good book in it, including sex.Without giving any of the plot of the book away, I can say that McMurtry makes some compelling, touching and prolific statements about what it feels like to operate on the fringe, as an observer. What do you hold onto in life as important? What do you let go of? What indeed..."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Updike wrote an entire sequence of books about Rabbit. McMurtry gave us &quot;All my Friends...&quot; and then &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot;, first rate novels both. This one's based on McMurtry's years as a Rice University student. No writer gives the sense of modern Texas like McMurtry."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"&quot;All my Friends are going to be Strangers&quot;, written by Larry McMurtry, published in March 1972, was an outstanding book. The main character, Danny, was fabulous and exciting. McMurtry always has you flipping to the next page. Danny is looking for his life and it takes many road trips to find it. On one of these road trips many crazy things happen and you will be hooked after the first ten pages. My favorite thing about this book is how McMurtry let's you see what Danny's thinking; I always want to hear what he is going to think next. Another highlight is how he can't keep his pant's zipped up with every woman that he meets. There are other great characters in the story such as the first woman that steps into his life named Sally. Sally is a real jerk and uses Danny for just about every thing a man has. Then you find out the rest. Don't be expecting the happiest of endings either. This is no ordinary McMurtry book. He out did himself with this one. If you like McMurtry's writing I highly recommend this book. If you like realistic books with a little adventure this is the book for you."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"i have absolutely no idea why this book is rated 4 stars.

I won't go into the details of the book, but rather give an overall impression. The book starts out with some fairly racy scenes but is well written so the reader doesn't feel too self indulgent. The book would be a major hit with any 18-26 year old male. The book is written from the viewpoint of a writer in his 20's. Sex, drugs, aimless wandering all included. The women portrayed are stereotypical and one dimensional but entertaining just the same. The reader must keep in mind that these women are being written from the viewpoint of a 20 year old depressed man. The writing is clear and concise- very well written. However the ending leaves you hanging."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I loved this novel, and I'm overjoyed, on reading the other related novels about Danny's bunch of friends, that Danny did not actually drown himself as I was afraid he had done at the end. None of his relationships with women work, mainly because his gentle heart has no boundaries, and he is pretty much chronically depressed like many other great artists--and poets. If Mr. McMurtry ever got tired of writing novels, he could always become a poet. The last chapter somehow reminds me of the best music of Counting Crows and Steely Dan, and the poetry of Antonio Machado. The prose is breathtaking.Also in this new edition, the afterword by Raymond Neinstein alone is worth buying the book for. He himself has written a book of criticism of Larry McMurtry's novels. Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it many times b/c it shows truth, and how the world really is.

He doesn't nourish his body with the right foods (just candy bars and junk food), trys to stay drunk most of the time, doesn't bathe, doesn't honor his friendships, sleeps with his friends wives. For awhile he tries to be a writer and actually sells a book. Doesn't know what to do with the money ... could buy his way out of his disintegrating life but doesn't. Gradually loses his way completely. Doesn't know why and, other than being lonely, doesn't seem to care. Somehow he has come this far in life with no core values to help him ... and, consequently, ends up alone and without hope. He may or may not accidentally die in the river ... wouldn't matter to him one way or the other. Or to anyone else either.I have always loved McMurtry's \\"The Desert Rose\\", a story which is the antithesis of this one. Harmony (a Las Vegas showgirl) - in spite of many bad choices in life - has a set of core values and the courage to continue to be hopeful.

As tasty as a very watered down broth. One throw away line after another - such as \\"three very wet dogs swimming\\". The story is oh so empty and oh so predictable - nothing follows - not zany, not comedic, not insightful, not sad nor funny - etc. A total waste of time - the only solice is that you can read through this book in an hour and not be provoked into any thought or emotion at all - I for one would suggest taking a nap instead - even the potential of dreaming holds more interest than this wet noodle of a novel."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Is writing dangerous to one's health and well being? That's one of the themes explored in this novel. Danny Deck, a graduate student in a writing program in Texas, meets Sally Bynum at a party and impulsively marries her a week later. Sally only wants to be a mother, and she does become pregnant. After Deck's first book is accepted for publication, their marriage falls apart, and Danny's life is set spiraling down a long tunnel of despair involving many quick affairs, visitation problems with his child, and even a failed book-signing party when no one shows up. He does meet someone (Jill) who excites him intellectually, but is a very unstable character emotionally and they split up. The book ends with him walking out into the Rio Grande River, high on booze and drugs, as if he might commit suicide while he thinks about the lost chance with Jill. (He obviously doesn't because he reappears in a sequel, but at the time McMurtry didn't know what to do with him.)Danny's writing does not seem as if it's going to help him deal with his problems much, and might even contribute to them, but McMurtry would not want Danny (or anyone) to stop writing because of that. It's frustrating at times reading about Deck and his aimless wanderings because he's the kind of guy who tends to make the same mistakes over and over. Although not as fine as some his other books (a few of which are absolutely great), this book is still pretty good."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I purchased this book because I'm a Larry McMurtry fan. I wish I had read Terms of Endearment and Moving On before this book. Perhaps I would have had a better mental context for the characters. To me, the plot simply rambles without sufficient motivation or purpose and ends in pointless frustration. Perhaps fiction mimics life, but I'm expecting more from fiction than mimicry. As a story, it simply meanders past memorable characters. I was continually frustrated by what seemed to be incompleteness."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This is one of Larry McMurtry's best modern novels (as opposed to his superlative historical fictions). Young writer Danny Deck takes off on a Southwestern odyssey that leads him to the best ending McMurtry has ever written. A good, solid American novel. It's a little dated, but then so is America. Even if you're not necessarily a McMurtry fan, you'll probably like this one."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I was hoping for more of that &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; type of humor that &quot;Texasville&quot; was so filled with, but not this time.

He wanders from bed to bed, even sleeping with his best friend's wife. I did enjoy the scene when Danny visits old Uncle Laredo, an onery, almost decrepit man who slices the throats of goats without a second thought. But much of the book was hum-drum and even quite depressing, especially toward the end of the book. Danny wanders from place to place, trying, struggling, to find happiness, but never does. If you want a lesson on how to be unhappy, read this book."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This novel, McMurtry's fourth, is his most tender and charming. Danny Deck is a young, perpetually perplexed writer to whom things seem to inexplicably happen, yet Danny, who narrates the novel, never presents himself as a victim, and McMurtry successfully keeps the novel from becoming sentimental. McMurtry's finest achievement in this novel, however, is his evocation of a Texas no one else has ever written about--the young, academic, urban, sixties generation of Texans. If you didn't believe such a thing existed, this novel will convince you otherwise. That world gives this novel a funky charm (its frank sexual content was somewhat controversial in some circles when it was published.) Look for the usual McMurtry themes and characteristics, including well-drawn women characters and a perverse spin on the &quot;old cattleman&quot; in the character of mean-as-hell, 92 year old Uncle Laredo, who &quot;was obsessed with last things.&quot; Chapter Thirteen, which concerns Danny's visit to Uncle Laredo out in Van Horn on his way back from San Francisco, is one of the funniest pieces of writing I've ever read, one of the very few times I've actually laughed out loud reading a book. The book is the first of a trilogy (which years later became a tetralogy, then a quinology, etc.) written in the late sixties and early seventies along with &quot;Moving On&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot; It's my favorite of all of McMurtry's novels"},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"One of the best books ever written. This is McMurtry at his finest. I have missed Danny Deck (main character) since I read the last line of this novel. This is the first McMurtry book I ever read. I later read every fictional book he wrote just to hear his \\"voice\\" again. This says volumes seeing that I normally have no interest in western genre; but I'll read the western ones because I grow to care for his characters as they dance off of the pages. After reading this book you should also read Terms of Endearment, Evening Star and Moving On for some of the same characters. This book really should become a film. Thank you Mr. McMurtry!!!"},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I read this book when I was 23 and found it profounding, educational &amp; entertaining. It made a huge impact on my life at the time. Every young man looking for a direction in life should read about Danny Deck. A great read and the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Danny Deck is symbolic of the confusion that living life brings to us. I think everybody has wanted to run away at times and Danny does. Danny let's us run away and enjoy the craziness of life and the twists and turns it brings us. You'll feel for Danny and won't want the end to come. My favorite McMurtry read, barely beating out Lonesome Dove."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I adored this book. The characters, especially Danny, are extremely believable and intriguing. This is one of McMurty's best. This book introduces wonderful characters like Danny and Jill, but it also brings us back with Danny's friends, Emma and Flap Horton. I strongly recommend this nostalgic piece of fiction."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Danny is an amiable, aimless young writer looking for a life. Superb dialogue. Lots of zaniness, sort of like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Lot of road trips to somewheres. A thread of vague sadness runs through it though."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Funny and sad, from start to finish. Who wouldn't love Danny Deck, reluctant writer, adrift in the real world, trying to make a go of it as an artist??? Early McMurtry, worth a very serious look, surely this gives some insight into the author's own conflicted beginnings as a writer. LOVED EVERY WORD!!! And the sequel was pretty darn good, too...."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"Early McMurtry, 1971, I believe, and the first of his books I ever read. Funny, incredibly funny, I laughed out loud over and over, and then really very sad. A book about the struggle between wanting to have a life and trying to be a writer--or, art vs. life. A brilliant novel, touching, clever, resonant. A MUST READ!!!!!"},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"As is usually the case when I get excited about an author's work I tend to delve into all the work in order to see which way he or she is heading. That is the case here with Larry McMurtry. I have just finished reading his The Last Picture Show trilogy (The Last Picture Show; Texasville; and, Duane's Depressed) about coming of age in small town Texas, having one's mid-life crisis there and, in the end, struggling against the strains of mortality there, as well. The cumulative effect of this work was a five-star review. Here we step back to early McMurtry and while the promise is certainly there as well as his quirky look at modern life this is the work of a rising author star not of a master writer.Why? Well, for one thing the subject matter. All fictional writing in the final analysis may be autobiographical, consciously or unconsciously, but here the trials and tribulations of a young Texas writer who heads to California to find himself after the first budding of prominence with the publication of his first book and a movie offer is, well, just a little too precious. Moreover, the inevitable romantic problems of twenty-something males (and, by now in 2008, females) has been done to death. Nothing really jumps out here other than some cogent observations about the foibles of human nature as strained through the California blender. My advice to Danny, the protagonist writer here is -Go east, young man, go east back to Texas. That's where your pot of gold is, Larry, oops Danny. Do you need to read this book? If you have time. Do you need to read The Last Picture Show trilogy. Damn right. That's the different in a nutshell."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This fine book, written in first person, chronicles a few months in the life of a young writer, including his joys, success, and ultimately his decline. The main character is at first a charming individual, with an innocence and confusion often found in intelligent free thinkers, and eager to make a difference in the world through his writing and his friends. Yet as the book progress, we find his innocence eroding as his confusion deepens. Unable to handle the success of his career coupled with the lack of success in his personal life, Danny Deck goes on a journey, searching for meaning through his former friends. In the end, he recognizes that he cannot return to his former life and finds himself in a psychological vacuum with no answer other than to blame his own success for his problems.Amidst the process and the search, we find many funny characters such as Uncle Laredo known as Uncle L, his wife Martha, a cantankerous lady who loves goats, and old man Lorenzo. Danny takes all these people in stride without much emotional response and continues his journey which ultimately is his own mental and social decline. While the book has an eerie sadness that seems to accompany each page, we still find ourselves rooting for Danny to get himself together and write another book.McMurtry's style of using events and characters to define the essence of the story and outline its purpose makes for a smooth and powerful approach to writing. In this case, the sorrow of Danny's life blends with poor judgment to create a memorable character with no future. A rather depressing book, with few redeeming human qualities demonstrated, All My Friends reminds us of the bleak emotions that often bubble beneath the surface of our human facade. While some of McMurtry's later books are a little cavalier in their presentation, this one is a gripping read difficult to put down. Short in plot development, but long in human experience, this book combines the naturalism of Dreiser with the confusion of Salinger, resulting in a captivating but often sad story. Definitely worth reading by all McMurtry fans."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I bought this book after reading the first two pages in the bookstore... I was hooked. I thought I was in store for another hilarious, vivid, and relevent McMurtry great. Instead, after about fifty pages I realized that it was simply a silly sex fest. The main charachter's woes are not a result of the impossibility of having a normal life and relationship while being an artist -- no, his problems come from marrying stupidly and being a male slut. He even chooses child molesters as his friends. His final, rapid decline is a direct result of his sleeping with every woman who wanders into the story ... including his best friend's wife. This has nothing to do with being an artist. McMurtry has written much, much better. Try Texasville."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"I once read somewhere that, early in his career, Larry McMurtry use to wear a sweatshirt with \\"Minor Regional Novelist\\" printed on the front, a kind of self-imposed literary scarlet letter. But whereas Hester Prynne used her talents as a seamstress to transform her scarlet letter into an individual work of art, McMurtry decided to turn his back on regionalism, the basis of his first three novels, and to write about urban Texas and Texans. The resulting so called \\"Urban Trilogy\\" (of which this novel is the middle work) tells the story of several young Texans who try to balance school, sex, careers and wanderlust during the decade of the Sixties. The first of these urban novels (Moving On) was a huge rambling affair, ill conceived and poorly written, and although this novel is better, it is still weak when compared to McMurtry's first three novels.McMurtry's story of the young author, Danny Deck, deals with writing and the various pitfalls of becoming and remaining a writer. Clearly, the author sees himself in Danny and when the book deals with Danny's personal insights into the writing process it is successful. Unfortunately, too much of the book is given to unreal characters, unreal situations and tries to become a kind of Texan \\"On the Road\\". Danny Deck (and Larry McMurtry) is no Jack Kerouac. Even McMurtry's sense of place falls apart once he is outside his native Texas, and the scenes set in California are as artificial as some of the plastic grass that often serves as lawn out there.Throughout the book, McMurtry has Danny ponder the role of the Texan frontier in his own life as well as how it affects the creative process. It seems as if McMurtry (and Danny) knows that this is the important issue and that this is what he should be writing about, but instead falls prey to the lure of Sixties bohemianism, casual sex (I'm sure with a few more pages McMurtry would have gotten Danny and his eighty year old aunt into bed), and trite plot twists. Too bad. Because that part of the novel set at Uncle Laredo's ranch is very good, almost becoming a short story in its economy of words and bare as bone style. The scene of the two aging cowboys tending the watchfire for the possible return of Emiliano Zapata is haunting and is by far the more memorable thing about this book."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This book is being deleted from my Kindle as a waste of time and space...not funny, not good writing...shame on Larry McMurtry...shame on me for buying it..."},{"Title":"All My Friends are Going to be Strangers","review":"This is just a romance novel with a moral."},{"Title":"Napoleon's Commanders (2): c.1809-15 (Elite) (Vol 2)","review":"Not a typical Osprey book in that it covers a number of personalities in such a small space; however, if you understand this, you'll be very happy with the book.

What truly lifts this book above good are the lively colour drawings by Courcelle."},{"Title":"Marlon Brando a Portrait","review":"I thought the book, \\"Marlon Brando: A Portrait,\\" by Paul Ryan was well written and really very interesting. Although there was high praise for Marlon Brando throughout the book, there was also criticism. I found most of the criticisms of Mr. Brando to be undue and unfounded.The photograph of Marlon Brando on page 187 of the book is one I had never seen before. It is also one that instantly brought me to tears. It is the photograph of a good and sensitive man in his darkest, most desperate hour. Anguish is written all over his face. There were those who said Marlon was \\"just acting\\" as he sat on the witness stand at his son's trial, but I strongly disagree.Marlon was a father who loved his children with the whole of his heart and protected them in all of the ways a loving father protects his children. When he learned that his son would have to spend time in prison, he went to great lengths to try to ensure his son's well being in every way possible and he stood by his son through thick and thin, just as a father who loves his child would. At the same time, he was dealing with a suicidal daughter, one who ultimately came to take her own life despite Marlon's efforts to help her and to protect her from herself. It is unbelievable to me that Marlon would be accused of \\"acting\\" in this situation as if, just because he was an actor, he did not have real feelings, especially for his children.Regarding Kenneth Anger's comments included in this book, I find them to be heartless and inhumane. What drives a person to such cruelty toward a fellow human being who is so clearly anguishing? I hope Mr. Anger had opportunity to rethink his comments and that he did so.I believe that Marlon was the best among all actors because he was such a deep-feeling, deep-thinking, sensitive person inside. I think that anyone who can criticize him in the ways he has been criticized could not possibly have seen beyond their own noses when it came to looking at him for the person he was.I was glad to see that the author of this book, Paul Ryan, included aspects of Marlon Brando's life on and off of the stage/screen and that the book was a well balanced piece of work. I disagreed with the author (and with Marlon) that Marlon could not do comedy, though. He cracked me up in \\"A Countess From Hong Kong,\\" \\"Bedtime Story,\\" and in \\"Guys and Dolls\\" when he ordered \\"Dulce Du Leche\\" with the \\"preservative\\" called \\"Bacardi\\" for Sister Sarah who became unwittingly intoxicated. I also had some good laughs watching Marlon in \\"The Freshman\\" and in \\"Free Money\\" as well as in some of the scenes in \\"Mutiny on the Bounty,\\" including the scene in which Marlon Brando's character, Fletcher Christian, is told by Trevor Howard's character, Captain Bligh, to \\"make love to that damn daughter of his,\\" referring to King Hiti Hiti's daughter, and Fletcher, who would love to \\"make love to that damn daughter\\" of King Hiti Hiti asks sarcastically and with a raised eyebrow, \\"Is that an order?\\" and then asks if it might be entered into the log.... :)There was also a comment about Marlon being \\"miscast\\" in a couple of pictures. I do not think he was ever \\"miscast\\" in anything because he could do anything. He even sang in \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" and, even though he said they pieced it together for him, I loved the tone of his voice and the attitude and tenderness he displayed with his singing words that might have been spoken had this not been a musical. I thought his performance outshone all others in the film, including that of Frank Sinatra. I liked the sweetness of Marlon's voice and the sincerity with which he sang so very much. As for him being \\"miscast\\" in \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" or any criticism that he was playing Fletcher Christian as a \\"dandified fop\\" and that this was a mistake, I think that is utterly crazy. Marlon MADE this film what it was and \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is one of the best films ever made. Marlon's interpretation of Fletcher Christian was perfect and he acted the role to perfection just as he acted the roles of Stanley Kowalski in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" Colonel Kurtz in \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" Mark Antony in \\"Julius Caesar,\\" Sir William Walker in \\"Burn,\\" Paul in \\"Last Tango In Paris,\\" Don Vito Corleone in \\"The Godfather,\\" Terry Malloy in \\"On The Waterfront,\\" Ian McKenzie in \\"A Dry, White Season,\\" Quint in \\"The Nightcomers,\\" Matt in \\"The Appaloosa,\\" Weldon in \\"Reflections In A Golden Eye,\\" Val Xavier in \\"The Fugitive Kind,\\" Christian Diestl in \\"The Young Lions,\\" Rio in \\"One-Eyed Jacks,\\" and so many others. His interpretations of his characters were always fresh and he improvised details and actions that always added depth and interest to whatever role he was playing. He was reportedly fluent in French and appeared so in his roles as Bud in \\"Night of the Following Day\\" and as Paul in \\"Last Tango In Paris.\\" He mastered the British accent in films such as \\"Burn\\" and \\"Mutiny On The Bounty\\" and an Irish accent in \\"The Nightcomers\\" as well as a German accent in \\"The Young Lions\\" and \\"Morituri,\\" a southern accent in \\"Sayonara\\" and I think it was also a southern accent in \\"Reflections In A Golden Eye,\\" a perfect Mexican accent in \\"The Appaloosa,\\" and spoke Spanish in parts of \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" with a perfect accent and intonation. I am in amazement of a person who demonstrated such talent and who cared so much about his art (and I do think acting in the manner in which Marlon Brando acted was an artform, even though he seemed not to think so...I do not think there are many who make acting an artform, but I think Marlon surely did) that he worked to perfect accents and actions, emotion, intonation and everything that matters in making each role an intriguing, interesting, fresh, unique, and exciting work of art.I was also impressed with Marlon's talent as a director in his directing of \\"One-Eyed Jacks.\\" What a fantastic film \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" turned out to be. Monterey is one of my favorite places on earth. I live about 2 hours away. I go there when I can. I fell in love with the scenery and the detail Marlon included such as the ocean at high tide and the dust blowing up as he lay looking over it from a hill - the scenes, the sounds, the photography, the acting, the timing, and the perspectives from which scenes were shot. The beauty of the film is in the details - details Marlon always found and made optimal use of. I read that Marlon was a patient and perfectionist director which I am certain lent itself to the exceptional quality evident througout \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" as well as the beautiful acting relationships and the story's unfettered flow.I would like to comment about statements that there were some who, at times, became frustrated with Marlon in rehearsals. They said he \\"mumbled\\" or would not give his all. This is just a thought: I wonder if Marlon did not want to make the mistake of giving his all in a rehearsal and, instead, saved his emotional energy for the take. Even with \\"Julius Caesar,\\" Marlon reportedly sent a tape recording of the \\"Let slip the dogs of war\\" scene to producers or to someone in charge of the film and those in charge were happily astounded and amazed at Marlon's recording, but then, it was said that Marlon \\"mumbled\\" in rehearsing the same scene in their presence. However, when the scene was put on film, everything about it sent chills through me - from Shakespeare's words to Marlon's giving life to those words with a voice and a portrayal that came from I don't know where - someplace deep within him. His actions in the scene to the expression on his face and the undeniable depth of soul in his eyes were chilling. As I once heard someone say, \\"Marlon acted all others in the film off of the screen.\\" My point is that I believe that Marlon not giving his all in rehearsals could be because he saved the best for the actual take. Maybe the reason that some actors are already spent by the time they get to filming is because they have already acted their scene over and over so many times that they are drained and then the emotion is no longer there. Marlon quite obviously knew what he was doing. This is most assuredly reflected in his exemplary work in each and every film he made.I would also like to comment about Louella Parsons who is mentioned in the book and who seemed critical of Marlon Brando - maybe because he would not give her the time of day (and, rightfully so, if that be the case). First of all, who is she? Who are these people who sit back in their chairs in offices with their feet up on their desk, criticizing the performances of others - performances they, themselves, lack the talent to put forth? It reminds me of a scale of justice. One side of the scale is weighted heavily because you have a brilliant actor who works tirelessly and invests his entire self into creating a piece of art. It is difficult, time-consuming, emotional, tedious, and draining at times, but he is creating a complex and beautiful gift for those who appreciate his talent and his willingness to share his unique gift. And, we get tremendous pleasure from it. The \\"weight\\" on the other side of the scale really makes no perceptible change in the scale's balance at all because there you have someone who gets paid to give her \\"opinion,\\" an opinion she probably spent less than 5 minutes thinking up and one which also has no basis in fact or truth. It is just the fanciful whim of a person who believes her opinion is above the opinions of all others and one whose own opinion may be tainted and biased by personal feelings of rejection by the artist she is being paid to critique. Her opinion is like a grain of sand on a vast ocean beach, in my..........uh...................opinion.I have to say that I so appreciated the inclusions of Marlon's humanitarian efforts toward alleviating human suffering and starvation (as a child, I trick-or-treated for Unicef, myself) as well as shedding light here in the U.S. on the struggles of the American Indian and efforts toward Civil Rights. I was happy to see that there were also inclusions about what a good and generous friend he was to Monty Clift and to others in their most desperate hours in life. He cared and it showed.I was very pleased with the last pages of \\"Marlon Brando: A Portrait.\\" Paul Ryan's commentary on these pages is insightful, poignant, heartfelt, and true. I would like to quote this entire part of the book because it was so moving to me, but I will leave that to others to read and judge for themselves."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Prima's Offical Strategy Guide)","review":"I bought this book just to help me out on Minas Tirith - Top of the Wall - because I couldn't figure out exactly what I was supposed to be doing.

The book I received was as advertized."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"This describes briefly his early years in Abyssinia (today Ethiopia and Eritria), followed even more briefly by his schooling in England, before it gets to the juicy stuff, in the form of his friendship with Haile Selassi, his explorations of the least well known corners of North Africa and Arabia, his service in the Sudan and in WW2 in the SAS. I think he's still alive, as I read an account of an interview of his a couple of years ago (1997 or so) and he was still going strong then. Until a few years ago was still living in Africa, where he had been living in a native village in Kenya for about 20 years. I would especially recommend this if you have read his 'Arabian Sands' or the 'Marsh Arabs', as it would give you a much more complete idea of who he actually was."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"Wilfred Thesiger, I'm ashamed to admit, is a new discovery to me. After reading \\"Arabian Sands\\" a few days ago, I felt I had to learn more of his life. \\"The Life of My Choice\\" has many parallels to \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" and was so captivating that I had to read it in one sitting. T.E. Lawrence noted that \\"self-knowledge unfitted me for leadership.\\" Thesiger puts that same sharp sword of introspection to his life. His observations on Lieutenant Colonel Orde Wingate and his thoughts on T.E. Lawrence are among the highlights of this book, as are his thoughts on Islam and Christianity.A son of privilege, son of the Minister of the British Legation in Addis Ababa, the author fell in love with the people of the wilderness, and always found his heroes and soul mates among the harshest tribes in the most forbidding territories. He acknowledges that some of his big game hunting exploits don't go over well 50 years afterwards, but takes care to explain the realities of the situation. He obviously has a strong feeling for the underdog in any fight, not something to be taken for granted in a highly decorated battlefield veteran.Thesiger's detailed account of the League of Nations standing by and watching the Italians brazenly use mustard gas on tens of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers and civilians reminds us of our own cowardice during more recent crimes against humanity.In this age when we are in such great need of heroic figures, I have no knowledge of a single leader of Wilfred Thesiger's caliber alive among us. Then again, Thesiger insisted on not living inside his own society, not seeking to be known by anyone other than himself. No doubt he must serve as the model for more than a few yet to be discovered British and American heroes now posted in remote and dangerous places.Surely one lesson to be taken from Mr. Thesiger's life is that we should live the lives our souls demand of us, consequences be damned. Mr. Thesiger realized as a young man that his path was a lonely one.I highly recommend \\"Fire and the Sword in the Sudan\\" by Colonels Rudolph Slatin and F.R. Wingate to any reader of Wilfred Thesiger. Slatin was held prisoner for 12 years in the Sudan during the 1880s and early 1890s."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"It was his choice. No marriage. Just adventure. It couldn't be mine. Yet one can be envious. Grant him his choice, and it's a great story. Grant him also that he's added something valuable to our better understanding of some important parts of the world that aren't so often understood. This is not the first book he wrote. He's a unique and remarkable man and author, a writer who grabs your interest and whisks you through several hundred pages. Books don't get much better than this."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"Wilfred Thesiger was the scion of a very influential English family; his uncle was the Viceroy of India, that is the highest British official governing what it is now India, Pakistan, Burma and Bangladesh.Thesiger was born in Addis Abeba where his father was with the British legation; some of his earliest memories were of the German-inspired revolt during the first world war being put down. After boarding school and Oxford, he decided to spend his life exploring the most remote parts of the world, rather than a comparatively mundane career in the army or foreign service bureaucracy. He traveled through remote parts of Sudan (the Danakil territories), Iraq (among the Marsh Arabs), Afghanistan, and Arabia (Liwa, Yemen and elsewhere), where white men had never been before. He also fought with the SAS in Northern Africa - where Rommel probably came within 30 feet of him while he was hiding in the sand after being surprised on a commando mission - and then retired to Kenya.To get a sense of what Thesiger was like - and of how our world has changed since his time - allow me to mention the deep disappointment with which he relates that at the outset of an expedition of his he knew that he would not be the first European to go to a particular corner of Ethiopia, because Portuguese Jesuits were known to have preached there in the 1600s, in a time when the Catholic church was trying to convert Coptic Ethiopia to Catholicism. In short, an extremely interesting life.This is an incredible book and a most worthwhile antidote to our MTV - MacDonald's - couch potato society. I most heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"It has been a few years since I read this book, so much of what I write has been pulled from my memory.I heard an NPR review of &quot;The Life of my Choice&quot; and was moved to purchase the book. I was not disappointed. Thesiger takes you by the hand as he explores &quot;The Dark Continent&quot;, from his childhood introduction to Halle Selassie to his life living among the nomadic people in the deserts of Northern Africa.Adventures abound in this book. Written from the point of view of an old (and probably now dead!) British colonialist, it is a bit jaded at times. However, Thesiger truly appreciated the land and the people of Africa and found himself to prefer them to his refined contemporaries in England."},{"Title":"The Life of My Choice","review":"Thesiger's &quot;Life&quot; has the primary benefit of any well-written story by a not-quite-native person who was privileged to be accepted in a strange land -- it takes you someplace new and mysterious. On that basis, I found the book to be very good, an insider view of a place, culture, and terrain I'll never experience myself. As with so many wandering sons of the British Empire, such as T. E. Lawrence and Sir Richard Burton, you get a good feel for the place and time, albeit inevitably filtered through the author's personal prejudices and social values.Thesiger is less a scholar than either Lawrence or Burton, and less able to stand back and place his experiences of Africa in historical, religious, and artistic contexts. Still, he was present at a time when colonialism was fading and new nations were being formed, living out the old Chinese curse/blessing, &quot;may you live in interesting times.&quot; Anyone with an interest in Africa as it is in modern times can't help but be curious as to how things got the way they are, at least in the areas he was familiar with.My only real quibble may be unfair. I'm no scholar of exploration writings, but none I've read that were written by men give particular insight into the lives of African women, certainly not to nearly the degree they do of African men. I realize Thesiger, like any male, would not have much access to the lives of women in cultures where women's existences were so restricted to hearth and home. Still, it's sad to only get half the story of this vanished past, especially since a handful of female explorers did manage to penetrate the life of the veil. Sadly, their books are much less read, although often better written. It must be said, though, that Thesiger in particular shows an astounding lack of interest in women in general, reserving all his descriptive powers and personal observations for the pageantry and color of warrior displays.However, I did finish the book with a better understanding of fundamental differences between Arab north Africa and the rest of the continent. I recommend this book as worthwhile, but best read in context with others written both before Thesiger's time and since. Thesiger's views alone strike me as a little crotchety, a bit too much of an old man resenting how much the world has changed. It never seems to occur to him that the land he so enjoyed, and in which he was privileged to come and go as he pleased as a white sahib, had a cost to it's less fortunate inhabitants. The life he regrets losing is, in some ways, a better life for larger numbers of people than it was in his time."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This book is loaded with very useful information, and it's written clearly and concisely without too much quasi-inspirational nonsense. I had completed my first marathon using the training plans from other books, and was terribly disappointed with my time. I used The Competetive Runner's Handbook to prepare for my most recent marathon and felt much more prepared. I took 48 minutes off of my first marathon time, and felt fine throughout the race.Many marathon training books properly emphasize cross-training and rest, rest, rest, but my experience is that there is too much emphasis on rest. The Glovers' plans (which can be tweaked and customized pretty easily based on your goals and fitness level) called for much more running, much more hard running and more mileage. The plans still emphasize rest, but the cold, hard truth seems to be that the best way to train for a marathon is to log a lot of miles.I also appreciated the tone of the book. It was upbeat, but did not include too much \\"cheerleader-ese.\\" Too many of these books try to be inspirational and egg the reader on, and if that's what a reader needs maybe he or she shouldn't be running a hard race to begin with.I read this book exclusively for marathon training so I can't speak to the shorter, faster race plans, but as a marathon training book I found this to be the best (by far) after having read several others."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"My fiance has owned this book for awhile as he's been a runner since high school. This past summer I began training for my first ever half marathon, running distances longer than I'd ever run before, at least since high school. I spent my summer free time reading through this entire book, and what a great idea it was. I had wanted to actually learn about running while I was training, and I found the information to be incredibly useful. There are sections for each race length from 5K to marathon, with training schedules and pacing tips, as well as sections on hot and cold weather running, injuries, motivation, recovery, stretching, female runners, etc. It's a very complete book that I recommend to anyone who runs or is thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I purchased this book originally on the Kindle, and read it and loved it.

It has lots of details on training, physiology, diet, recovery, pacing, and everything else you can think of pertaining to running. The charts show you if you finished a race at one distance, how that translates into times for other distances, which is very helpful. This book doesn't give a bunch of feel-good you-can-do-it rah-rah, it gives detailed, specific information on how to run faster, how to run longer, how to run if undertrained, etc, etc. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I couldn't give this book 5 stars because it is so text-heavy.

Glover's approach to training is an old-school, no shortcuts method, which is refreshing in an era where quick and easy is the norm.

The book may be bulky. But it is comprehensive, covering every running topic imaginable: preparing 5K to Marathon, speed, mental training, strength, injuries and etc. The authors are incredible writers. The book is never dry. It is a fast read. They explain jargons as well as any 5th grade science teacher.The best part is that the authors are agnostics. Running has become increasingly scientific and technical (especially at the elite level). Coaches have diverse training methodologies. Some are based on heart rates, others lactate threshold. Some believe in high mileages, others in speed/quality. It is intimating for recreational runners to sort thru them. This book covers some of those training methods without siding with any one, thus being agnostic.One minor concern: the second edition came out in 1988, and third edition 1999. A new edition may soon come out if you are considering purchasing it today.To sum it up: this is a great comprehensive intro for any runners who do not have access to coaches, and are not subscribed to any particular training style."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I have read some running books.

With a couple of half marathons and 10k races under my belt, I set out in a quest for the &quot;holy grail&quot; of distance running: the marathon. I picked up this book and found it to be chock full of information that not only helped me achieve my marathon goal (2 days before my 49th birthday) but has helped me to shave minutes off my times in shorter races also. I even managed to pick up a couple of trophies along the way. I have achieved all this benefit while avoiding injury. Mr. Glover spells everything out clearly. Schedules for training for various races are included. Follow these to the letter, and I can almost guarantee that you'll not only cross the finish line, you'll do it with a smile on your face.

I recently ran my first marathon, on a slow, hilly course in San Francisco, in a time I was really pleased with, and only because of the advice from the Glovers. From big picture psychological issues to the most mundane details, I found myself constantly turning to this book and finding the right answers. Everything from diet to race day details are covered in here, in a concise, conversational and accessible way. I would unreservedly recommend this book to any beginning or intermediate runner who is looking either to improve their times in shorter races (5K, 10K, etc) or run a first (or faster) marathon -- or, if you just want to get in shape and enjoy a running program, the book is still great (although it is focused a bit on racing)."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This book starts off by breaking runners into categories from Novice to Elite. There are 7 categories (further broken down by age groups and gender), and any recent race time (from 5k all the way to marathon) can be used to help you find out where you fit. Glover explains the different training concepts to help you improve your times. He goes into a lot of detail about all of the important topics. He gives weekly mileage guidelines, talks about maintaining a running base (what % of your weekly mileage should be used as a base), and what paces you should be training at based on your desired race time. Although his advice is specific (and supported with examples of studies that have been done to prove how certain concepts work), all of his advice can be adjusted to fit the individual reader's level and goals. He gives examples of training schedules for the 5k up to the marathon for each category of runner, and tells you how to write your own schedule. He gives many examples of different types of speedwork, hill training, and tempo training so runners can add variety to their own schedules. He says how often each workout should be done on a weekly basis, and at what point they should be done in the training cycle. This is a great book, easy to read, and full of tips that can help you improve your time at any distance.I used to do my daily runs at the same pace, and train without a plan. Last year I started training using the concepts explained in this book (speedwork, hills, long run distances), and I have been able to cut 13 minutes off of my half marathon time in less than 8 months. These training concepts are well known, but Glover customizes them to the reader's level, gives many different examples of each type of workout, and expains which workouts are best for the distance you are training for (For example, he says 1 mile intervals are better when training for the 10k up to the marathon, while power intervals and repeats will be more helpful when training for a 5k or shorter distance). This is a great book, and I wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This book is a great resource for all aspiring competitive runners. However, don't confuse this book with Glover's other book - which is more for beginning and non-competitive runners. There is a lot of overlap between the two books, so there is not much point in buying both. However, I can see a beginner outgrowing the beginner book and wanting the extra info that the \\"Competitive\\" handbook can provide. Both are great."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"Let's forget that this book is a huge bestseller in the running market.

I had run a half marathon, and had no interest in doing a full marathon. I read the entire book, and began following Glover's recommendations. I saw almost immediate results. I then figured out (with Glover's help) that I, too, could do a marathon. I have dropped my 5k time to a new PR of 20:48 and will be running my first marathon in 2 weeks. I have followed his schedule very closely and have had no injuries and have improved dramatically. I even keep this book in my bathroom and reread a segment each morning!!!

It is definitely worth the money!!!!"},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"Bob Glover and his wife, Shelly, have a style that I find particularly endearing, they write in a manner that makes you feel they are addressing you personally rather than a general readership. Glover seems to know exactly what you would ask if he were your personal coach. He provides training schedules, information on running shoes, nutrition, pre-race nerves, race strategy etc. If you are less competitive and race just to improve your times but not to win races or age groups, there is plenty that speaks to you in this book. Similarly, this book is great if you are highly competitive and have the potential to be national class. If you wonder, down to the exact second, what pace you're running if you finish a 5k (or any other standard race distance) in a given time, there is a detailed chart that gives the answer. The writing style is low key and conversational. The book can either be read cover to cover or you can just as effectively go right to the chapter that's most relevant to you. I recommend this book without qualification."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This book leaves nothing to the imagination! What I also really liked is that it doesn't assume anything about you - if it's advice that is more directed to one type of athlete vs. another, it lets you know which, so you're not being led astray by advice better suited for someone else. It's perfectly organized, so that it's easy to quickly find information that you want now, has a chart that ranks your present performance so you know how you fare against other runners in your age, and gives advice based on where YOU are at specifically, not anyone else!

I've dog-eared key pages, underlined key passages, and colored edges of key pages that I keep coming back to.This book gives me the how, where, and why for training for the various road races I run, especially marathons. I've completely read and thoroughly studied marathon books by Daniels, by Bakoulis Bloch, by Pfitzinger and Douglas, by Hidgon, as well as older marathoning books by Henderson, by Bloom, and by others. I enjoyed every last one of them. I recommend them all (especially Hidgon's &quot;Marathon:The Ultimate Training Guide.&quot;But I keep coming back to Glover for specifics of tempo runs, interval training, hill work, and easy-to-adapt marathon training schedules.I keep coming back to Glover to set goals for 5K, 10K, and marathon as I progress in my running and as I get older. (I've been running since 1978.)If you just want a fun, informative book about running and low-key racing, buy &quot;Better Runs&quot; by Joe Henderson or some similar book.

What I like best about the Glover's book is that it has something in it for every runner, from the casual jogger to an elite marathoner. Each chapter focuses on a special area of the sport: injuries, mileage, women's running, seniors, masters runners, even children developing into competitive athletes.The title is instructive: there is an emphasis on competitive running, with the focus primarily in 10K road races to the marathon. Several of the elite and most popular marathons are discussed at length, incuding Boston, L.A., New York and Chicago. There are some useful tips on how to increase your weekly mileage, avoid injury, carbo loading before the race and recovery afterwards. Having completed marathons, I can tell you that it's easy to do than you think and once you start completing the 26.2 mile courses, you'll be hooked for as long as your body will hold out.Running is a joyous activity and one which brings many individual rewards.

However, it's truly geared toward competitive runners.As a recreational runner, my times don't even qualify me for the \\"novice\\" category, which is the lowest grouping in the book. I found it discouraging, even down to the section where it discusses genetics and body type, which suggests that people with certain body types cannot achieve success at the most competitive levels. I thought this mentality was archaic.I enjoyed reading the biographical information about the authors and contributors, and also understanding more about the role of women in competitive running, and the progression of a couple significant running events in the US. Very cool.For a truly competitve runner, this book is probably very well received, but in my case, I didn't appreciate it.

While I was basically an average JV runner, I did manage to break 19:00 for the 5k once, which is pretty decent. I have kept running off and on since high school, and about 9 months ago I decided to train for my first race since I was 18 (I just turned 30). I remembered quite a bit from cross country, and have occasionally browsed through magazines like Runner's World over the past decade, so I was not a total beginner and still had some knowledge fresh in my mind. Still, I wanted an all-in-one reference, as opposed to constantly trying to find good info on the internet.Following the recommendations of some runners I know, I bought this book. In my view, it's just about perfect, and it could be the only resource most runners would ever need. It strikes a great balance between being casual and fun to read, while still containing a healthy dose of the denser scientific stuff which is necessary for effective training and racing (lactate threshold, carbo-loading, etc.). There is very thorough coverage of the major kinds of speed training, hill training, long runs, and so on; great chapters on injury prevention/recovery, diet, mental training, and footwear; and specific chapters and training plans devoted to the major race distances from 5k to marathon (as the title states), and much more. You get the idea - this book covers pretty much every topic of running with good detail. I don't believe it says much about the latest fad, barefoot running, but training principals are significantly altered for that method compared to normal shoe running, so you'd probably want an entire book specifically devoted to it.While I say that this might be all a typical runner would ever need (and that is true) I use it as my 'bible,' the resource I go to first and always return to, while still consulting other sources like magazines or other classic training guides such as those by Daniels and Galloway. As Bob Glover points out in an early chapter of this book, other training guides are neither right nor wrong, just a different application of the same training principals used by everyone.In my review title, I suggest getting this book over the more beginner-oriented 'Runner's Handbook' by the same authors. I don't own that one, but I recently spent a good 15 minutes paging through it at the bookstore; this book contains basically all the same information, PLUS the more in-depth and advanced material. It's beneficial to read that stuff, and view the training plans that an elite athlete would use, just for the perspective, even if you're still a novice. With any luck this book will help you catch the running bug, and within several months or a year you'll need some more advanced advice - so just get this book and get it over with.This is one of those books that is rare in any field - a well-written, extremely credible, thorough guide that basically has no drawbacks. Get it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"As a competitive runner in high school I followed a majority of the plans in this book thanks to a great coach.

It covers EVERY aspect of running, not just the &quot;main points&quot; that other books cover.

I can say &quot;The Competitive Runner's Handbook: The Bestselling Guide to Running 5Ks Through Marathons&quot; by Bog Glover, Shelly-Lynn Florence Glover is best book I have ever read. I can't believe that a book at that price could cover almost every aspect about distant running in such details. Despite having a keen interest, I am no expert in sport and definitely not in a position to say that that book outdoes all the other books on the same subject. But, as a reader with keen interest in sport, not necessarily only distant running, I couldn't find something that is lacking. If there is something I could humbly ask the authors to include, maybe a number of photos showing the posture of stride and posture of the good runners together with an analysis of the angles of body and the limbs. In fact, the authors have given a lot of description about the ideal running forms. The simplicity of use of language, a lot of valuable information and step by step programme making you feel that the authors are personally coaching you. I even promote it to some of the friends who do not have a keen interest in distant running because it is just not only for the distant runners, it is an interesting book to read. Of course, I will still buy some books by other authors.

I bought the original 25+ years ago when I was running in High School and loved it. When I saw there was an \\"updated\\" version I jumped at the chance to buy it. Mistake! I learned nothing new from this book and it was not as good as the original. It is a dumbed down version of the original more designed for beginning weekend warrior than a real \\"competitive runner\\". If you are satisfied being a middle of the pack runner this is the book for you. If you are a competitive runner don't bother. Buy either Pete Phitzingers book or Brad Hudsons they are Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This book has a lot of good advice, but I think it's not exactly what I'm looking for with my own training. The training program advocates lots and lots of miles, even for someone who is not a distance runner. I found that when I upped my mileage in order to improve my performance for a 5k, I was breaking my body down, and my 5k performance actually suffered. Now I'm going the Run Less, Run Faster route and I'm feeling a lot stronger. Many different methods for training, this one just wasn't the one that works for my body."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I am still reading this book but what I have read so far has been good. In addition to running, I enjoy biking, swimming and working out so some of the aspects of this book as far as weekly milage and the number of running workouts just can't be fit in with the other sports I enjoy. However, I feel this book will help me to be a better and faster runner even if I do have to modify the amount of time and runs recommended.For those who only run; whether a 5k runner or a marathon runner, I think this book has relevant and easy to understand information that will benefit anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I have been using this book for two years.

Listen to the advice and you can run well too.Now 5 years later (whoa, 5?), I'll add that I continue to run, though not as much as a couple of years ago.

I have a couple of other books, mainly for beginners, but now that I was advancing, I thought I needed some 'advanced' advice. The information in this book is comprehensive and practical, with lots of explanations (both scientific and experience-wise) if you want to get to the nitty gritty of running and racing. It was really good to see plausible reasons why I had been told to do certain things or warned against others or some rationale for issues,injuries or insights I had had in my running experience. What disappoints me about the book is its style. I can understand the writer trying to give of his experience, but after a while it gets tiring to see all the 'I statements' every couple of sentences. The information seems good, but it doesn't help much if you don't want to read it or get irritated reading it. Plus, there are ALOT of repetitions, sometimes word for word, which is probably a reason why the book is so big. It gets montonous from the lack of a new point being made or the lack of diagrams to illustrate information. If you don't run at least a 9 min/mile pace as yet, you will feel left out reading this book. Some may say it wasn't meant for slow runners in the first place, but it will encourage you to run stronger. What you won't get is your current statistics (like Vox max, mileage, pacing, etc.)and few references.

This book gives great information about how to train for races and improve speed. I have bought a few running books and this is by far the best, I have no need to buy any more running books. The only thing that turned me off a little when first recieving the book is its size, it has almost 50 chapters and is over 600 pages long. However you do not need to read all 600 pages, I would recomend it to get the most knowledge out of the book, but definately not necessary. Highly recomended for anyone who wants to improve their speed and learn how to the proper way."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"When I bought this book I was just starting to run longer distances and hadn't been in any races, so I wasn't the target audience. If you are like me. you'll be a little unsure what your 10K pace is, for example, because you may never have run one. But if you think you're going to be in races and care about your time, I would suggest that this book is worth buying and reading even if those are still in your future.The book is also kind of old-fashioned, based on what I've picked up elsewhere. It focuses on total weekly mileage more than seems to be in fashion these days, for example, and that approach may not work for those like me who are getting into this at an older age (I'm 46). It also talks about calling race organizers on the phone rather than looking at the race's website, which seems kind of quaint in 2007.What's really good about it is that it covers so much. It gave me a lot of good tips for little things to remember before my first race (the San Francisco Half Marathon). It gives guidance for many different lengths of races. It talks about injuries and other issues that may come up. It even talks about balancing running with the rest of your life.With a good update this would be a 5 star book, and even as it is, it's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This is, by far, the best book I have on running. It covers all aspects and I find myself revisiting it more than any other.It is full of useful charts: race prediction times; interval times, training pace times--all manner of conversion times.If there's any question about running, I can usually find it answered here--maybe not always in the depth I'd like--but it's covered. I appreciate how the Glovers stay away from advocating odd theories; they stick to tried and true running wisdom to the extent it exists. I'm not adverse to different ideas but so many books on running emphasis odd points (perhaps inadvertently) that aren't practical or relevant or, are unproven. This book doesn't suffer from that malady.The style and organization perhaps isn't perfect--but as I think how I'd write it, I can't think of any obvious improvements--nor do I know of any book that's done better. Glover has really taken on a lot of material; and, as presented, it's pretty well done.The Competitive Runner's Handbook is obviously a labor of love--and one obviously written from practical experience."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"After a 30km race last spring, during which temperatures soared into the 90s, I became dehydrated despite my best efforts. Luckily I had the Competitive Runner's Handbook. It is full of specific answers to just about any runner's question, including how to rehydrate in a hurry. I followed the authors' tips and avoided a trip to the ER. Besides hydration, the Handbook contains training schedules from 5 ks to marathons, speed workouts, and injury information. Bob and Shelly-Lynn Glover clearly enjoy what they are writing about. Their writing style is factual but not dry. I urge any runner, from newbie to veteran marathoner, to buy a copy.

There's a chapter on just about every aspect of recreational running training and competition, but the information is comprehensive and detailed.

This will keep it fun.The book is especially good for the engineering type who likes to keep logs of runs and time. (I think I'll dig it out of my basement.)It is not a motivational book. It is a training guide. You might at the same time buy one of Jim Fixx's books for the motivation side.Good luck with your running. Remember to keep it fun.

Much thanks to the authors!"},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"I'm giving this book two stars mostly because of its dangerously outdated advice about dehydration and fluid replacement.As Dr. Tim Noakes argues so persuasively in this classic work The Lore Of Running, drinking according to one's thirst is both effective and prudent as a hydration strategy. Unfortunately, the authors of The Competitive Runner's Handbook adhere to the ACSM's now-discredited, far more aggressive, approach to hydration.Basically, the ACSM still insists that runners can't trust their sense of thirst to guide them -- they must drink, and drink more, in order to attempt to replace all lost body fluids. Yet as Noakes and others point out, the result of this approach has been a growing number of cases of hyponatremia. In fact, while documented cases of runners being seriously injured due to dehydration are all but impossible to find, hyponatremia has killed a number of runners in recent years.The fact that this book is silent on hyponatremia, and still parrots the old ACSM guidelines, strikes me as dangerous. Runners who aren't aware of the latest research on this issue will buy into the \\"drink, drink, drink\\" mantra, and some of them may end up in a medical tent dealing with the consequences.It doesn't help that the sports-drink industry has a major economic interest in telling runners NOT to \\"heed their thirst.\\" (Oh the irony.)If this is a case of the book needing an update, then it's time the authors prepared a fourth edition. If it's a case of ignoring the research on hyponatremia and over-hydration, then it's time somebody called the authors to task for their sloppy and potentially dangerous ignorance. In any case, I can't and won't recommend this book to other runners -- especially novices -- until the hydration guidelines are reworked to reflect the current state of research on this topic."},{"Title":"The Competitive Runners Handbook (A Penguin handbook)","review":"This is a very detailed book for anyone interested in competitive running.

However, if you want your daughter to see sex as something that is profoundly intimate with a profound purpose, this is NOT the book for her.This book assumes that once sexual development begins, a girl is careening down an inevitable path toward sex. The irony here is that, despite such helplessness and inevitability, the book is chock full of coaching to enable your daughter to select playmates that will please her yet not hurt her--quite a feat!!If you have any regular time to spend with your daughter, I would forego reading this book. Your time will be much better spent inspiring her to spend time developing her interests and values and socializing with a wide variety of friends of both sexes in a properly supervised atmosphere. In this scenario, while your daughter is avoiding a minefield, she is also noticing which young men are wasting their time indulging their senses and which young men are diligently preparing to be responsible adults through education, work and self-control, all nice things in a husband!If you want to begin de-bunking the far too rampant nonsense in this book, I suggest readingUnprotected: A Campus Psychiatrist Reveals How Political Correctness in Her Profession Endangers Every Student"},{"Title":"Virgin S-E-X","review":"This book doesn't assume that a young girl is careening down the path to sex.

On the other hand, if you want a book that treats your daughter as a person who is thinking about sex (and believe me every young women is) and gives her a road map to 1.

I believe your money would be better spent on a different book."},{"Title":"Her Body Of Work (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"This was a really good example of what Blaze books can be, when done right. I tend to have a kind of love/hate relationship with this line. I really love a romance where the sex is steamy and works to develop the relationship, and I've found some Blaze authors who are really good at that. However, when Blazes are bad, they tend to really stink. I especially detest: a) ridiculously contrived setups which are supposed to be sexy but are just silly, b) mechanical love scenes which add nothing to the story and are just there because the author thinks because this is a Blaze, she needs to add X number of love scenes, whether the story asks for them or not. Sadly, both a) and b) apply to a large percentage of the Blaze books I've read.The good news is, they definitely do not apply to this one. As for a), the setup here is sexy and provocative, but not at all silly. Marco is a formerly undercover DEA agent whose cover has been blown. He's now on the run from the drug dealers he'd infiltrated and, knowing that they will try to get to him through his family, the first thing he does is to get them out of the way.His mother is easy: off she goes on a cruise of the Mediterranean. Then it's on to Chicago, to try to get his model/actor brother out of the city. He lucks out, because Francisco has an audition in LA, but before he goes, he guilts Marco into covering for him and showing up to an audition for a sculptor. After all, they look similar enough, at least at first glance, and that way, Francisco's agent won't be pissed and he'll still have a job if his LA thing doesn't work out.The artist who's looking for a model is sculptor Rey (short for Freyja) Martinson, and she specializes in naked men. She's looking for the perfect model for a big commission, a marble sculpture of Mars for an important client, which will finally put her on the map if it's a success. The sparks fly on Marco and Rey's very first meeting, and in spite of their reservations -Rey because she's had bad experiences with her models and has long made it her policy not to get sexually involved with any of them, and Marco because he's on the run and knows he's going to have to get out of town soon- they're soon creating even more sparks, between the sheets.I very much enjoyed this. Both Rey and Marco are interesting, likeable characters, and they have some very nice chemistry. I thought Donovan did a wonderful job in using her frequent and imaginative love scenes to show the slow progress of their relationship, from simply a very strong attraction to fondness and tenderness and finally love. And when I say imaginative, I mean it! It's actually pretty kink-free, but there are certain things there I haven't seen elsewhere in Romanceland (the Cubana, BTW, we call Russian here. Interesting!)Another plus is that both Rey and Marco are immigrants, she from Sweden, he from Cuba, and the exploration Donovan does of the immigrant experience, of how it affected them and shaped who they are now, is fascinating. I thought it really added some interesting and fresh layers to these characters.All through the book, the grade I had in my head was a B+. It wasn't quite an A read (just lacked that extra zing that's the mark of one, I guess), but it was solidly enjoyable. The ending, however, lowered that grade somewhat. That's when the suspense subplot came to the foreground, and while it wasn't really bad, it just lowered what was previously a fresh, fun story into humdrum territory. The villain was uninteresting, and I just didn't completely get Marco's behaviour there at the end.This is just a small part of the book, though. This is one I'd recommend, and a new author I'm definitely going to be keeping an eye out for from now on."},{"Title":"Her Body Of Work (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Marco Flores was hiding out in Chicago. Things had gotten too hot for the Miami-based DEA agent while he waited to testify against his arch-enemy, the drug lord Juan Carlos Rodriguez, known as El Lobo. All Marco wanted was a place to lay low for awhile, but he got more than he bargained for when he agreed to stand in for his younger brother at a modelling gig. What Marco didn't know was the job was to pose nude for artist Rey Martinson, who was working on her breakthrough commission of a 10-foot marble sculpture of Mars, the god of war.Things quickly heated up between Marco and Rey, and Rey's \\"no sex w/ models\\" rule fell by the wayside. The resulting sex scenes were definitely steaming HOT. (OK--here's where I must confess that I found the fruit and vegetable scene (especially the cucumber!) to be a bit over the top. It's probably just me, tho--maybe most readers wouldn't bat an eyelash. In fact, this little teaser might even pique some readers's interest. You know who you are.)Marco and Rey had more going for them than hot sex. (How lucky can you get?) Ms. Donovan did an excellent job with her portrayal of two people from vastly different immigrant cultures getting to know and appreciate one another. The cool Swede and the hot Cuban complemented each other perfectly.Shadowing everything was the threat that Rodriguez posed to Marco and everyone close to him. Marco had a very personal relationship w/ Rodriguez for almost 20 years, and bringing him down had been a near obsession. This storyline was very well done, believable, and added just the right amount of tension w/out overwhelming the romance.Ms. Donovan's note to her readers indicated this was her first book, but you certainly wouldn't know it from the way she deftly balanced a good story and likeable characters (including a hunky male lead) w/ terrific chemistry together.(Side note to Harlequin: The guy on the cover of this book looks like he's in high school. Definitely not a hot, tough Marco/god of war type. I tried not to look at the jail-bait cover while I was reading the book.)"},{"Title":"Her Body Of Work (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Chicago artist Rey Martinson needs a model for a sculpture that she has been commissioned to do for a very wealthy client. This is the chance of a lifetime for Rey, but she just can't get into the project. Her agent suggests that a little sexual action might be just what Rey needs; Rey totally disagrees, until she sees prospective model Marco Flores. Marco is an undercover DEA agent who has gone to the interview with Rey as a favor for his look-alike actor/model brother Francisco, who has been called to California for a soap opera audition. Rey has seen dozens of nude male models, and has always remained unaffected by them, but Marco brings about wicked thoughts that Rey has not experienced for a very long time. Marco is also shocked at the feelings Rey evokes in him and is instantly attracted to her. When Marco sets out to seduce Rey, she is helpless in dissuading him and the two begin an incredibly hot love affair, sharing their bodies and eventually their hearts.Rey does not know Marco's true identity, nor that he is on the run from a Colombian drug lord who is determined to get rid of Marco and those close to him before he can testify at an upcoming trial. Having his mother away on her honeymoon for several weeks and his brother across the country, Marco is certain that they are safe, but strange happenings make him begin to fear for Rey's life.Rey does not expect to fall in love with Marco, although she finds herself doing just that. Marco is falling equally fast, and makes sure that Rey knows how he feels about her and his hopes for their future together, but he is unsure of how she will react when she finds out that he has been deceiving her about who he really is.Ms. Donovan has written one hot book with HER BODY OF WORK; these characters are attracted to each other immediately and watching their mutual attraction blossom and grow into something much deeper is a real pleasure. Marco is a hero of womanly dreams and the insight into his Cuban heritage is very interesting. He's caring, considerate, respectful and ever so charming. Rey is a strong, driven woman who is intelligent and passionate and unafraid and unashamed to show either of those characteristics. A little danger, a little suspense, and a lot of sensuality make this a very enjoyable book.Courtesy Laurie/Romance Junkies"},{"Title":"Her Body Of Work (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Her Body of Work by Marie DonovanHarlequin Blaze # 204 - September 2005It is only a matter of weeks before Marco must testify against the Miami drug lord. After working 13 months undercover, Marco knows that El Lobo will do anything including harming his family to stop his testimony. After safely sending his mother on a six week honeymoon cruise, he goes to Chicago to convince his brother to take a long holiday. As luck would have it, Francisco is very happy to leave town for awhile, he has a chance at a part in a new soap opera filming in LA. Only one hitch though, if he doesn't land the part, he'll need his modeling career to fall back on, and that means he can't mess up the job he promised to take here in Chicago. Marco wants his brother out of town so he agrees to do the job. Rey has finally earned the commission that will launch her career as a serious artist. Her agent tells her that her latest work has lacked inspiration and that she'd better get her act together and put more passion into her work. She can't blow this opportunity. Marco's shocked when he discovers that Rey only paints nudes --- male nudes. Rey is pleasantly surprised when Marco bares all and proves to be just the model for the Mars sculpture that will earn her six figures. And Marco seems more than capable of providing the inspiration to bring her work to life, after all she can barely keep her hands off him. In Marco's mind there's only one draw back to this little modeling gig; he's really a DEA agent on the run and El Lobo will not rest until he wins. But a few weeks in Rey's studio, pretending to be her Roman god of war, is more temptation than he can resist.WOW ... what a hot, sexy, sensual read. The chemistry between Marco and Rey is there right from the beginning and keeps on right to the end. While the love scenes are explicit, they are extremely well written and creative. The scene in the sauna was very erotic. Both Rey and Marco are very diverse characters, with believable pasts and lifestyles. This is not just a book with sex scenes. I very much enjoyed the story of Marco and Rey. Bravo to Ms. Donovan on her debut novel. I'm looking forward to reading more from her.This book has been on my TBR from my Blaze subscription. I think one of the reasons it's been on the pile so long is because of the cover model for Marco. He just looked too young and didn't really appeal to me. But reading Ms. Donovan's Dear Reader letter inside the book encouraged me to look past that. I'm so very glad I did."},{"Title":"Her Body Of Work (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"This is a great book!

Of course he isn't a model and there in lies part of the fun and suspense since he's really a DEA agent on the run.Donovan is able to take two people who otherwise might not have much in common and give us a wonderful romance as well as some great love scenes.

The book is narrated from the perspectives of these three men.I've seen the film multiple times and find it disturbing yet powerful. The book is similar to the film in some respects but is MUCH more disturbing. Barely a page goes by without some racist or sexist remark coming up and there are TONS of homophobic slurs. This book is full of anger, hatred and self-loathing--there's never a let-up. The book is short (not even 200 pages) but it still is hard to get through. Also the ending seems ridiculously rushed considering what you have to read to get to it. As a totally out gay man I wasn't as offended by the comments in this book as I suppose I should be. EVERYbody comes under fire in this--no one is spared. Also, for 1970, this WAS the way gays were seen. I can't really recommend it--it's far too bleak with not one redeeming character in it.

The self-defense killing is done by the desk-man at a bath house, who is trying to protect himself, and the surviving patrons of the bath house from a madman who has already killed six of the patrons--on his watch. Including this one, the killings are all committed by three men, eleven by one alone.Two reviews by two experts, a psychological and factual summary of the plot, and a short reaction, which was used as a blurb inside the first few pages:\\" William Friedkin's \\"Cruising\\" (1980) was based on a 1970 novel by Gerald Walker, a New York Times editor (actually the cultural editor of The New York Times Magazine--JMV) , Gerald Walker, that portrayed the process by which a New York City policemen, assigned to capture a psychotic killer of gay men, becomes aware of his own homosexuality, and commences murdering gays. The novel, while exploiting the socially instilled self-hatred of an unstable character, is homophobic in spirit and in fact; it sees all its gay characters as having been 'recruited,' condemned to the sad, gay life like modern vampires who must create new victims in order to survive (according to one kind of vampire legend--others treat vampire killing as a necessity, the creating of a new vampire as a sort of sexy work of art...yes---JMV). The gay characters in the novel are all filled with self-hatred and a hatred for the people who \\"turned\\" them gay (the blame usually falls on the first man with whom they had sex). Walker's killer (s--JMV) intimate that the homosexual lifestyle is an inherently violent one--not that the cruising scene is violent, but that to be homosexual is to be violent.\\"--Vito Russo, The Celluloid Closet,1987, 1981\\"Brilliant and, sadly, unforgettable...One of America's most persistent sexual nightmares.\\"--Gore VidalRusso's book, 368 pages long, covers more than three hundred films which portray homosexuals, in all imaginable ways-- between 1895-1987. That's a lot of films! Naturally, he made a few factual errors---all the gay men in the book are not violent. The cop's housemate and the madman's housemate are both intelligent and sympatico. In fact, there are only two really violent men in the book--told mainly from their points of view. But though other gay men make non-violent appearances, one feels a kind of strong, slender rope of hemp leading directly from the conflicted homosexuality of the two--to their violence. So yes--the reader gets the creepy feeling that if you knew you were gay when you were 4, or 10, or 16, you might be O.K, but if you find it out later, or never realize it at ALL, and hate gays anyway (or because of it)--you're likely to be a mad killer. It should also be said, playing the devil's advocate for Walker, that in 1970, although most scientists and many gay men knew that their minority sexual orientation was a natural one, there was as yet no genetic proof, (as there is now), that at least some of them owe it to their genes....like green eyes. So, technically, Walker was free to imagine any cause (I guess...). But what Russo says, in my opinion, is basically correct. The book is full of hatred, of self and of 'the others,' (the gays) as a German filmmaker put it in the 1920s, and to fill the reader of Cruising with a lot of mistrust of anything gay.Vidal calls the book \\"brilliant\\", and, I am sorry to say, it is much better than a good read (and those last two pages, that another reviewer found either confusing, or disliked for some other reason, make the hair on the back of your neck stand up). It is, as Vidal says, a \\"nightmare.\\" And, as he also says: \\"unforgettable.\\" (I am very partial to Vidal.)\\"Ever try to kick it?\\" the policeman asks his housemate, as if he were addicted to heroin.*\\"I'm homosexual... How and why are idle questions. It's a little like wanting to know why my eyes are green.\\"-Jean Genet, 1910-1986"},{"Title":"Cruising: A Shocking Novel of Suspense","review":"For a moment of elaboration, there are three characters: the homosexual-hating killer, who also has collected a harem (of women) and proceeded, through the course of the book, to sexually-use and dominated them, and in his thoughts, he degraded them regularly.Two, there is the rookie-cop decoy who doesn't like homosexuals, is a loner, and doesn't like Jews. (Italians also are mentioned, having killed his uncle.)And his captain is a Jew and the captain knows being a Jew puts him in a difficult situation being a cop with authority, because he has to run the investigation while he knows his abilities, declining with age, are not at their best.So we've got a lot of hate here, and there is more hate than 190-some pages can manage. An armchair mystery-type resolution of 2 pages at the end doesn't help. Being a suspense novel more suspense is need. The read is good, but should've been better."},{"Title":"Cruising: A Shocking Novel of Suspense","review":"This book is good proof that gay people are really weird and do strange things like murder. Where I live in Kansas we all know that the gays are evil. This book was proof too of that I thought. I'm going to go fishing now and forget those weird people in N.Y."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's memorable account of the life and death of the Black Dahlia was the first book I read on the Black Dahlia murder, the first book ever published on the famous unsolved case. Since publication several others books have followed, each with its concoction of groundless speculation and fanciful, worthless nonsense. John Gilmore, a fine writer, demonstrates unquestionable integrity and authority. SEVERED is a tragic story, alive with pathos, insight, and unnerving dread. One becomes mesmerized by the writing, the characters, especially the Black Dahlia herself, Elizabeth Short. A shocking, strange story that is absolutely unforgettable. An exellent book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This True Crime book reads like fiction. That's why it works so well. And that's also probably why several armchair detectives and reviewers here have such a problem with it. Personally, I would be leery of dismissing Gilmore's 35+ years of investigation so hastily.Gilmore's noir style has a way of sucking you in and transporting you back into another time and place. Highly recommended. Beware: this edition of the book contains some very disturbing postmortem photographs."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The writing is great, the story is great. You have to set aside your sensitivities for some of the graphic details, and many of the stark, disturbing photographs. These detail the nightmarish horrors and torture done to the beautiful young woman known as the Black Dahlia. She is the quintessential mystery girl of the 1940's (Glenn Miller's music in the background! Bing Crosby singing; the Andrews Sisters, etc). This is the Los Angeles we see in the gritty film noir movies on late night TV. An engrossing book; the writing is superb. You can't put the book down, and when you do you just keep thinking about it until you pick up where you left off. When you've finished this book, you will want to start all over again. One is drawn into it and the pictures and images stay with you. I am a true crime fan, and especially of the WWII themes and music. I will remember this book and the story whenever I hear the old songs or see those old movies. This is a juicy slice of history. A real accompolishment and a most rewarding (and scary) read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Gilmore's book is probably the most impressive to date in handling the evasive questions that the Black Dahlia murder left behind. His research is meticulous, and his portrayal of Beth Short compassionate. However, I don't quite buy the Jack Wilson story as the final chapter in the famed murder. Gilmore's tie to the case is personal; he is a blood relative to Short, so I don't know whether he let his hunger for closure get in the way of objectivity.I believe it's possible that Jack Wilson knew Beth, hence the photographs and souvenirs. However, I did not find his (Wilson's) ramblings compelling and just because he was aware of Short's physical abnormality does not provide enough evidence to draw a final curtain around this bizarre case. Gilmore's parallels between Short's murder and that of a well-known socialite seem to be reaching. The socialite was strangled with a rag in her mouth while Short was mutilated over hours, then vivisected, then placed on display.Over all, I recommend this book for it's in-depth research and background on a sweet fun-loving, but essentially troubled young woman. Be forwarned though, the photographs are truly gruesome and will haunt many a night's sleep."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book promises to &quot;solve&quot; the mystery of who killed the Black Dahlia, but the outcome seems highly contrived and, I suspect, not entirely true. The book does paint an interesting picture of Elizabeth Short and her wanderings but important events often lack dates or sources, which suggests to me that much of this book is pure fiction. I'm no quicker to believe the solution in another book, &quot;Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer&quot; (Knowlton / Newton), but I found that book more satisfying. We'll probably never know for sure who killed the Dahlia (or why). &quot;Severed&quot; is definitely worth reading, but I doubt it's the once-and-for-all &quot;solution&quot; it promises to be. Some of the author's claims of first-hand knowledge-- including meeting the Dahlia when he was an 11-year-old kid (!) AND, as an adult, actually knowing her killer (!!)-- are, to me, a little insulting. P.S. Beware of a few disturbing photos."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I really don't want to give a 1 star review to a book I found fairly enjoyable, but I'm reviewing this under the assumption that people are looking for facts in their true crime books.John Gilmore's Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder really is an enjoyable read if you don't care at all about those pesky facts in the Elizabeth Short case. I knew very little about the Black Dahlia murder going in to this book. Unfortunately, I didn't come away feeling like I had gained any insight into the crime when I had finished.Oddly enough, my biggest problem with Severed has nothing to do with the outright lies & various half-truths presented as fact. Severed's biggest problem is that it jumps through time without telling you what it's doing. Stylistically, that could be interesting... if this weren't a true crime book. I'm a sucker for dates, locations, actual people involved in the case instead of made up ones (more on this later)...that sort of thing. This book is infuriating. January 15, 1947, Elizabeth Short's severed body is found, the police are investigating, suspects are named, investigated and questioned. The way Gilmore tells the story, I figured, at most, a decade had passed...then SUDDENLY it's 1982 and the man Gilmore unmasks as the killer dies in a suspicious fire. But does he tell you it's 1982, and 35 years have passed since Elizabeth Short was murdered? Nope! The only reason I know the year is because I looked it up online. What was happening a week into the investigation? A month? A year? A decade? We can't tell. Dates are suspiciously absent. They won't be lonely; verifiable facts are nearly non-existent.While chronology is the biggest problem, a few minutes of research unearths many more. Gilmore is dead-set on tying his prime suspect, Jack Wilson, to not only the Black Dahlia's murder but to the murder of her \\"friend,\\" Georgette Bauerdorf. The link between the two dead girls is actually creepy if you take Gilmore's book at face value. But if you believe the detailed account of the District Attorney's Office, Elizabeth Short lived in Southern California briefly until her arrest for underage drinking in 1943, then lived in Massachusetts and Florida before coming back to Los Angeles between early 1946 and her death in January of 1947. By the time Short arrived back in Los Angeles, Bauerdorf had been dead for two years. There's zero proof they knew each other at the time of Bauerdorf's murder, or at all. If you don't know much about the case, this might seem completely out of left field to you. Let me make it clearer; the basis for Gilmore's entire theory hinges on the idea that these two murder victims were friends and murdered by the same man, Jack Wilson. While I certainly can't disprove that they were murdered by the same person, there is simply no proof that they ever knew each other. Furthermore, Gilmore insists that police were finally preparing to arrest Wilson (on the evidence Gilmore was providing, of course) at the time of Wilson's very suspicious death by fire, but not a single law enforcement officer involved in this crime has ever substantiated his claims. In fact, some have contradicted it outright.There's also Gilmore's weird fixation on Short's underdeveloped genitals, which supposedly prohibited her from having sex. A cursory glance of her Wikipedia page shows this to be a myth. And while you can't always trust Wikipedia, in this case, it is more trustworthy (and is better cited) than a writer hell-bent on inserting himself into the plot of some famous cold case.Speaking of citations...there aren't any! I'm not insisting that Gilmore provide us with a bibliography at the end (though that would have been nice), but if you're going to make unsubstantiated claims based on your super secret evidence that years of painstaking research has yielded, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for more than a \\"take my word on this\\" attitude. A picture of audio cassettes that are now (supposedly) in the property of the LAPD are our only \\"verification\\" of the author's claims that Wilson was a top suspect.Some of the other \\"facts\\" that supposedly hammer home the author's theory are just plain ridiculous. There's the really weird inclusion in the book that Elizabeth Short's body was left in an area of Los Angeles that resembled female genitalia on a map. What??? This didn't make any sense until I googled it, and I live in L.A. Let me get this straight: The killer, with a freshly killed & severed body lying around, decided to place it in a vacant lot close to a novelty intersection that sort of forms a 'Y' shape? There are quite a few intersections like that in Los Angeles. I guess this one was closest to the murder site? Gilmore's alcoholic, very tall, one-leg-shorter-than-the-other, sex-fiend murderer Jack Wilson is apparently so into symbolism that he would risk being caught by placing a severed body in what may have been an inferior site just so the body could be near a suggestive intersection. But what exactly was he suggesting with this location? He hated women? He loved female genitalia? Does this have something to do with Gilmore's assertion that Elizabeth Short's genitals weren't quite right? So the killer placed the body near an intersection that most closely resembled perfectly formed female genitals to tell the world that (according to Gilmore) this wasn't what Elizabeth Short possessed? Yeah, sure. I'm convinced...Or could it be a FREAKING COINCIDENCE? No way. Body left in the vicinity of a Y-shaped intersection, sort of like a vagina: Case closed. It must have been Wilson! Unfortunately, that's the kind of evidence you get in this book.Finally, as one reviewer suggested, I took the \\"Herman Willis\\" challenge. Herman Willis was supposedly a cop that supposedly witnessed the autopsy of Elizabeth Short and, supposedly, provided information about her malformed genitals (integral to Gilmore's plot; I'm mentioning it for the third time because that's his fixation, not mine!) and provided the brand new details that Short was forced to ingest human feces prior to her death. WOW! A true bombshell and another twist on an already twisted case! Rest easy, friends. According to the detailed autopsy records, Officer Willis was not present at the autopsy. Furthermore, there is not a single shred of evidence that a Herman Willis was ever a member of the LAPD, or that this man ever existed at all. He seems to have been made up by author John Gilmore. Maybe it's a pseudonym of someone who didn't want their real name used? Perhaps. If so, Gilmore never mentions that. And the autopsy report lists everyone in attendance.Even though the murder of Elizabeth Short was really committed in 1947 by some sick, delusional person, the answer to the crime is not in this equally delusional book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book is by far the best ever written on the Black Dahlia. It has become a classic, a highly respected work in law enforcement circles, in crime literature, and is a \\"Goth\\" bible. Almost everything that can possibly be known about Elizabeth Short (of whom this book has made an icon), the Black Dahlia, is contained within these pages. Time and an erosion (a flood of trash in the wake of this work, i.e., the \\"Daddy Did It\\" books by Janice Knowlton and Steven Hodel) has taken a toll on whatever other information exists out there. It has faded and been warped by now, as well as death taken its toll. John Gilmore is an amazing writer and this is a testament to the noir age of Los Angeles and Hollywood. Fine writing, drama, a compelling sense of immediacy make this book a near-masterpiece."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I had read the high praises the other customers who've bought this book had written, and had to have this book. I tell you what though, it wasn't as shocking and horrific as they claimed. Because I'd seen photos of Ms. Short's body before, I wasn't so shocked when the so-called killer confessed the details of the murder. You can look at the body and see that something terrible happened, so why are people so shocked and horrified when they READ the details? I had to give three stars though, because of the photos included, and for some of the details the book gave that other books did not. I'm not sure why Gilmore believed, with absolute certainty, that Smith was the killer. Yes, Smith explained and knew a lot of details of the body, but he also never touched on some major objects (per se) that were internal to the victim. Gilmore made such a big deal about those objects early on in the book, but didn't even mention them once he got his so-called confession. The lack of chronology wasn't helpful either. Also, why the 'Afterword'? That information was already written earlier, or could have just been another chapter. All in all, I was disappointed in this book once I got to the end, after the three times it took re-reading it to get what happened."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I read this book in just a few days because it is so completely enthralling that you can not put it down! I love the fact that this book told about Elizabeth Short's life and allowed the reader to see her as a person and not just as the victim of this SICK and SENSELESS crime. In other reviews on Amazon, people have been criticizing the inaccuracy of some details in this book, but if you read it, you see that everything Gilmore writes makes sense, especially the conclusion he comes to about who the actual murderer was. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"After having read countless books about the mystery of the Black Dahlia, I was glad to find this book. For the first time I read about Beth Short's childhood, her upbringing, her family. She finally took shape as a real person, not just the Black Dahlia. I found Mr. Gilmore's conclusions about who murdered this girl plausible given her background and character. A satisfying read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I grew up in Los Angeles and was a child when the Black Dahlia murder exploded across the front pages of the LA daily papers, the Times, the Examiner, and the Herald. Sensational then, this murder remains so to this day.The murder of the young, pretty, would-be starlet Elizabeth Short was particularly gruesome. The body was found in a vacant lot literally cut in half. Both halves were lying near a sidewalk easily visible from the street. The body remained in the lot for sometime and drew onlookers. I remember the atmosphere of life in the late forties, and compared with today, we were all unabashed gawkers. There was little of the finicky nature of turning away from the horrible then. Today it seems almost as if this era is as remote from us today as is the Civil War when people turned out to watch hangings.Gilmore takes us on his own long journey of personal discovery as well as retracing the journey of the sad and confused Miss Short from eager young hopeful in Hollywood to unidentified body on a slab in the county morgue. The Dahlia seems to have been drawn almost inexorably towards a tragic death. She is the ultimate victim, helpless and lost, wandering the streets of downtown LA until she more or less disappears only to reappear and become a legend that illustrates the fallacies of Tinseltown and the realities of life on the unromantic streets.The strange and affecting style of this book is what sets it apart from most books in the true crime genre. For one thing, there appears to be something of an attachment by Mr. Gilmore to his subject that is vaguely perverted in itself. And his interest in the Dahlia seems, at least in part, sexual, as was the interest of many men in Los Angeles toward this displaced child/woman. Though Gilmore does his best to keep his perspective professional, his emotional connection to the woman is always there. This is what makes this book even more compelling. Sometimes I got the feeling that Gilmore was trying to find out who killed his girlfriend rather than a long dead stranger (whom he may have met as a boy). This heightens the level of excitement and anguish while stoking a certain salaciousness to the whole undertaking. It is impossible, when dealing with the Black Dahlia murder, to separate objective police research with an undercurrent of lascivious interest in her. Who was she having sex with? What was she doing to the men and what were they doing to her? These thoughts permeate the case and cannot be brushed away through a pretense of \\"getting to the bottom\\" of something. And Gilmore more than understands this. He does not exploit it so much as acknowledges it; it's part of who and what the whole case has always been about.The reader will find him or herself unable to look away, much as people did in those days. The more horrible the death, the prettier the victim, the more we looked. And the fact that the body was naked simply engulfed the public in a salacious atmosphere that resembles the old circus \\"freak shows\\" where we paid a quarter to stare at people who were disabled or stricken with some awful disease. This kind of thing gives a kind of imprimatur to our rude and ghoulish interest. After all, this was a famous murder. How can we not be interested? It is on this basis that \\"Severed\\" is so attractive to us. It's a book, with evidence, with hard detective work and some interesting speculation on the part of Gilmore that offers a new possibility as to who she was and to who might have been, in fact, her murderer. There are facts revealed in this book that were new, at least to me. The hint of a sexual dysfunction that Miss Short suffered from only makes the whole thing more even more gothic.All in all, I believe that this book should be considered a masterpiece of its kind. It does what novels try to do. It involves the reader even when the reader wishes to remain clear and objective. We follow the Dahlia all the way to the place where she was (possibly) killed. We watch the murder and dismemberment. We watch the dumping of the body and we stand on the sidewalk with the other curious citizens whispering and craning our necks for a better view. All in all, this is a cathartic work that allows us to exercise our baser instincts in safety. But it must have haunted Mr. Gilmore for many years, both before and after he wrote it. All in all, a terrific book.That is, of course, if you like that sort of thing.EKW"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"First, I take exception to 'another' reviewer's off base remarks with regard to the veracity and facts in this book. The actor, Franchot Tone, did try to pick up Ms. Short, unsuccessfully, and the Tone family has its own reasons to keep this factoid under wraps, second, the LAPD has had a Metro Division since 1933, in what is now Parker Center, and was in Room 114. Third, the detective, Herman Willis, was an actual detective at the time of the murder. These accounts can be easily verified on the Internet, and pointing them out as errors is more reflective of the critic/LA Times reporter's personal agenda rather than actual fact. The book is actually an extremely well-written, thoughtful and evocative account of this girl's descent into the quagmire of 1940's Hollywood, the absolute worst of the worst in terms of decadence and predatory types. She sought out the kind of people who were involved in petty schemes and nefarious doings and eventually encountered her killer in this melange of monsters. Her sole focus was on fame, and she did whatever she could to attain what she hoped would be a career in front of the cameras. There were plenty of criminal types who preyed on these girls, and would tell them anything they wanted to hear in order to take advantage of them and their dreams; unfortunately for Ms. Short, she went with the demon who tortured her for, what the coroner later speculated was a 72 hour torture session, and never saw her name up in lights, but achieved a grislier fame, as that of a victim who died such a terrible death that it is talked about and argued to this day, some 54 years later. Gilmore is a master of setting the mood of L.A. in the 1940's, replete with all the peripheral characters Hollywood was overflowing with and taking the reaader to the streets of same...his descriptions and attention to detail add to the rich mix of sin and glamour, the quest of which cost this doomed young girl her life. One cannot truly imagine what she endured waiting for death to release her from the horror of the things which were perpetrated on her body during those last agonal hours... Kudos to Mr. Gilmore for providing us with this incisive glimpse into a world long gone but brought back vividly to life, and giving us a taste of what Hollywood and this crime were really like and how they relate so well to each other; the perfect stage setting and the perfect crime, since no one has ever been charged, nor is likely to be at this late date.Also recommended: Hollywood Babylon, Day of the Locust"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"It's understandable that a small handful of would-be or wanna be investigative writers would want to throw rocks at this book, SEVERED; because it's a great book that gets you where you live, or as the upfront boys say, grabs you where it hurts! Because John Gilmore has written an emotionally and psychologically troubling book; the most mysterious and bizarre account I have ever read concerning an 'unsolved' murder in Los Angeles. This book must be considered the definitive history on the famous Black Dahlia murder case of 1947. The murder case is still in the news, still in the mainstream press. It also appears that this case is woven into the experience of the author, a major plus for the readers! Born in Los Angeles, Gilmore's father was a policeman with the Los Angeles police department (a wonderful photo of his father is at the front of the book, dressed in the 40's LAPD uniform and standing beside the old black-and-white squad car, like the ones we see in the film noir movies). Author Gilmore is no newcomer to the crime field; I have read his other books, one on Charles Schmid, the killer in Arizona, recently published as COLD-BLOODED, and his book on Charles Manson, THE GARBAGE PEOPLE.But it appears that this book, SEVERED, is his major work in the true crime field. This book is written with the same sureness that a Zen marksman uses in hitting a target. The reader will most assuredly have nightmares about Elizabeth Short, the young woman this tale concerns itself with as she wages a losing battle with survival. Almost too painful at moments to read, but it keeps getting deeper, and deeper into this girl. Her beauty, it seems, is a curse; she is too young to get ahead in the hard, hard town of Hollywood, and she literally dies trying.Apart from this amazing portrait of a young woman caught in the L.A. web (thugs, crooks, gangsters), what I found most fascinating was the author's personal link to the case, to the murder (via his father, a cop doing legwork on the case in the late 1940's), his family (the name Short crops up, which brings about an encounter with the actual victim when the author was 11 years of age). These things seem at the root of Gilmore's interest or obsession with the case, the victim, and certainly his years of efforts at closing in on a plausible suspect. He tracks the participants, no doubt followed some to their death beds, hounded police and newsmen alike, and spent decades on an otherwise 'officially' futile investigation. Again and again he returns to the same subject, the strange and haunting personality of the Black Dahlia herself, would-be actress, L.A. fringe girl and drifter during the War and that lost, merry-go-round of post-war Hollywood.This book is a real life thriller and one you will stick with to the end, despite a few spots that could raise a few nit-picking questions. It is a must read for anyone interested in true crime, police, hard-boiled, dark writing or seeking a real experience: being plunged back into L.A's. past, those swing-shift war yeras of the west coast. But this story seems to hit all coasts, east, west and inbetween as we follow the black Dahlia on her torturous journey.The photos are shocking, but this is a frightening tale, and told by a strong writer, a new voice echoing some of the old hard-boiled school of pretty gals and gunshoe cops. But reader beware: this tale sneaks up on you, and will shake you up before you know it."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book starts out well. The interviews and statements Gilmore has marshaled from people who knew Elizabeth Short, from detectives who were on the scene in the late 1940's - are all evocative of the period. They remind me of the movie The Best Years of Our Lives. I get a sense of how people were casting about back then, trying to come down off the high of the War effort, trying to find a place for themselves in what was becoming America's humdrum consumer landscape. That designation of those years as \\"The Best Years,\\" at least as far as Elizabeth Short's life was concerned, carries a horrible irony.Women who were in their twenties just after WW II have often waxed nostalgic about those days. They've told me how innocent things were then, how they could go out on dates with ex-servicemen - and the boys were all gentleman who never demanded anything more than a chaste kiss at the end of the evening. But reading this book, I began to doubt the goldenness of those times for women. Certainly the men who knew Elizabeth Short were rarely satisfied with a kiss. She had to endure the crudest of advances. She had to provide the most tawdry of services in exchange for a meal. She was beautiful, adrift, ambitious - a combination that marked her as prey to the randy, predatory men orbiting her.Gilmore etches us into that black-and-white scene. I was projected back into that excellent TV movie made about the case a few decades ago, starring Lucy Arnez as the Dahlia. That movie deserves to come back into circulation. Lucy Arnez did her best acting turn in that movie. She was the Dahlia, as Gilmore paints her for us - with that long, last look going off into an unimaginable fate.But Gilmore's book starts to disintegrate past the midway point. And I'm not convinced by his solution to the murder. The man he fingers comes across as just a perennial, vulgar drunkard. It's not that I expect all serial killers to conform to the TV and movie stereotype of brilliant predators adept at playing mind games with the police. Still, Gilmore's candidate seems to fall just too far short. This is particularly true in light of the fact that Gilmore links the Black Dahlia's murder to the previous murder of socialite Georgette Bauerdorf. If the murders are in fact linked, that makes it especially unlikely that Gilmore's man was the perpetrator. The Bauerdorf murderer exercised some special tricky forethought in his approach to his victim. It seems he might have unscrewed an entryway light bulb in order to extinguish his silhouette. That doesn't sound like the work of a stumbling wino.Gilmore at least distinguishes himself in one respect from the covey of writers who have recently undertaken to solve this case. At least Gilmore doesn't conclude it was his father who done it.The book dissolves completely at the end though. Out of nowhere, Gilmore pops in a statement that the Black Dahlia visited his house back east, researching her family history. Then it's over. What?But \\"Severed\\" is still worth reading. It will orient you to the general facts of the case and serve as supplement to the new major motion picture that is being released. However, be forewarned - the photographs reproduced in this book are very graphic."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I am emotionally wrung out after reading this book.And I'm so sad for poor Beth.Its so tragic what happened to her.This is one of the most disturbing crimes I've ever heard of.Beth and the crime itself will not leave your mind once you hear of it.Beth was just a nice girl who was a victim of circumstances, trusted the wrong person and got caught in the grip of a sexual sadist who killed her.Although questions have been raised about the authenticity of certain people and events in the book, I think that John Gilmore has unmasked the true killer.Although, it can never be proved %100 since the main suspect died just days before his arrest for Beth's murder, I think Mr. Gilmore has come much closer than anybody else and he did some extraordinary work in gaining the killers trust and getting him to talk as much as he did over a period of time.Plus Gilmore is a skillful writer. The book was engrossing and hard to put down.If you want to read a true life tale of an unforgettable girl trying to live the Hollywood dream who was savagely murdered in the dawn of a new postwar America and the years long search for the killer , this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have just finished reading John Gilmore's SEVERED for the third time, it just keeps getting better. The best thing about this book is how Mr. Gilmore presents this young woman known as &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. He does not portray her as a tramp who caused her own terrible death, as other books and resources have over the years, but he doesn't sugar-coat her either. In this book she becomes real, not just a mutilated corpse the world has gawked at for a half of century. Beth Short is a human being with some wonderful qualities and some not so wonderful qualities. Mr. Gilmore does not force his own opinion on the reader but instead gives facts and voices the opinions of others who had known her in life. He shows professionalism, unlike some of his critics who sorely lack it. I recommend SEVERED to anyone who is a true crime fan and anyone who has forgotten that Elizabeth Short was not just a ravaged body of a crime victim. She was a beautiful young woman full of hopes, dreams, and pain. SEVERED does a beautiful job of reminding us."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's Severed (1994) is a carefully measured and respectful investigation into the abominable 1947 murder and mutilation of starlet - hopeful Elizabeth Short. Also known on the Hollywood and Los Angeles streets as the \\"Black Dahlia,\\" in death Short has become a numinous cult figure, with a variety of groups, including feminists, vying to defend, correct, champion, and solidify Short's character for present and future generations. Though some newspapers characterized Short as a streetwalker at the time of her murder, today Short has been largely reinvented as a strictly tender - hearted young woman who became the wholly innocent victim of a demented sexual predator. Gilmore's book, like Mary Pacios' Childhood Shadows (1999) and Steve Hodel's Black Dahlia Avenger (2003), is partially an earnest attempt to discover who Elizabeth Short was in fact. No one should be dismayed to learn that Short was an average human being in almost every way, vulnerable, fallible, and, by turns, considerate and selfish, thoughtful and aggressive.The abundant evidence establishes that Short was neither a prostitute nor a promiscuous young woman. The product of a good, but broken, New England home, Short was a pretty teenager who dreamt of a career in Hollywood films. At 16, she began spending the winter months in Miami to ease her severe asthma. Away from her immediate family, well mannered and vivacious, Short dated freely, was fond of enlisted men, and actively sought a respectable fiance. At some point in early adulthood, Short discovered that her reproductive organs were so undeveloped that she was incapable of engaging in ..... intercourse. What affect this traumatic discovery had on Elizabeth's life and psyche is one of the key questions of the case. As Severed illustrates, at least one apparently loving young man unhappily broke off their engagement because of this abnormality.Making her way to Southern California, where she simplistically hoped to achieve stardom, Short began a vagabond existence of struggle, hunger, irregular employment, and constant changes of address. In well over her head, Short developed a habit of striking up acquaintanceships with anyone she thought might be able to help her attain her goals. Reduced to freeloading, Short often lived parasitically off friends and strangers.Short's involvements with men remained inevitably problematic; she seemed to have slowly surrendered hope of ever achieving a happy marriage. Unaware of her inability to engage in intercourse, some men thought her a supercilious tease. Over time, Short began identifying with the self - loathing alcoholics, social outcasts, marginal figures, and hoodlums who increasingly became her companions. Always a risk taker, Short's behavior during this period suggests an absence of common sense, the presence of mental imbalance, and a weak survival instinct: she continually jeopardized her own security, made reckless decisions, and took enormous risks with her physical safety. She was involved in at least one physically abusive relationship, and often appeared to be terrorized and on the run from one or more persons. Importantly, though she could have returned permanently to the security of her mother's Massachusetts home at any time, she did not. Though she had become a skillful emotional manipulator and used others freely for personal gain, Short paradoxically continued to retain her naivet&eacute;, sentimentality, and fantasies of success and romantic fulfillment.In the age of Lana Turner, Betty Grable, Anne Sheridan, and Lizbeth Scott, Short misguidedly created the noirish persona that came to be known on the streets as the \\"Black Dahlia\\": she wore thick layers of \\"geisha - white\\" facial makeup, \\"blood - red\\" lipstick, dark clothing, and her trademark dyed, jet - black hair stacked high. People, especially men, did take notice, but they were not the talent scouts and film agents Short hoped to attract. Psychologically, the Black Dahlia persona can be interpreted as a neurotically - motivated defense mechanism spontaneously generated to compensate Short, via inflation, for the fundamental problem of her genital handicap.A tragic, isolated, and increasingly deluded figure obsessed with \\"making contacts,\\" at the time of her death at only 23, Short's teeth were so decayed (as friends, as well as the coroner's report, noted) that she used white candle wax to fill in the cavities before going outdoors. Despite such hard and telling facts, and though she had no formal training or apparent talent, Short believed a career as a film star remained an inevitability for her.As Gilmore's text carefully illustrates, Short's psychological and ethical decline did play a role in her death. Short was an assertive personality who did as she pleased, continually placed herself in dangerous circumstances, and was neither helpless nor innocent. Thus the problem for feminists, who want to believe that Short had every right to act irresponsibly without coming to harm. Those feminists defending Short also fail to grasp that human character is an area where \\"paradox, contradiction, and ambiguity abound.\\" At the time of her death, Short was a liminal figure, a shrewdly calculating opportunist who nonetheless perceived herself as an ambitious young lady of good intention. Those who knew Short as a sweet child and likable young lady in Medford, Massachusetts ignore the fact that people can and sometimes do change for the worse, especially under adverse circumstances. Since Short's murder has never been officially solved, it is Short's fascinating psychology, in conjunction with the grisly nature of her death, which remains the focus of the case for almost all interested parties.Gilmore's generally excellent book offers an interpretation of the broad facts and names a suspect. Here, the killer is believed to be an individual the author himself pursued for two long decades. Severed is cautious, non - exploitive, fair, and realistically sympathetic to Short throughout. At no time does Gilmore suggest that Short, in any manner, deserved her fate. The absence of footnotes, sources, and an index may lead some to question the book's credibility. Potential readers unfamiliar with the very graphic morgue photos of Short's mutilated corpse, which are included, may want to approach Severed cautiously."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Reading SEVERED is an experience one is not likely to forget too quickly. This is the story of a ghastly murder in post-war Los Angeles, and the author, John Gilmore, details the crime in in the most disturbing manner I have read in ages. The book is astounding in its scope and depth, and the pictures presented by the prose seem to become branded into ones mind: unforgetable. Keeps coming back. The author weaves in and out of the characters. This is a superb work in the field of recreated crimes; certainly this crime is one of the most famous. The writing is sharp, clear, pure noir and hardboiled. This is not a book to be missed. You don't know whether you really want to keep reading it because it is so disturbing (it gets under your skin), but you can't put the book down! Few writers in this field get this close to perfection."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"When 22 year old Elizabeth Short's body was found mutilated in 1947 Los Angeles the case quickly grew a reputation as unsolvable with too many suspects and not enough solid leads. Author John Gilmore extensively researched the case (beginning in the early 60's for a film that was never made) and began sorting fact from fiction including the largely unflattering portrait painted of Short herself.Gilmore bonded with many of the L.A.P.D. officers (and had a family connection with a relative that was a member of the police department)allowing him a unique insight into the case. He also had access to what remained of the evidence and provided information for the person the L.A.P.D. thought was the strongest and most likely suspect a would be actor (and supposed friend of Tom Mix) named Jack Wilson a man with a drinking problem and possible serial killer.With the recent release of Brian DePalma's poorly received film \\"The Black Dahlia\\" (based on James Ellroy's well written book that comes to a totally different and unlikely conclusion based on the evidence that Gilmore uncovers)\\"Severed\\" returns to print after an absence of of a number of years. Gilmore makes a strong case for Wilson as the murderer but, more importantly, examines the circumstances that allowed Wilson to get away scott free with another killing before Short. Gilmore also examines the political atmosphere in Los Angeles during the late 40's as well as the dedicated police detectives that tried to tackle the case and those that tried to bury it or use it for their own profit. Well written and researched this is the best book that I've seen on the case. Gilmore manages to capture post-war Los Angeles, the dreams of stardom that many actresses had and the ultimate end that resulted in at least one unfortunate case."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The FBI's legendary profiler and mindhunter John Douglas writes about \\"Severed\\" in his fascinating book, \\"The Cases that Haunt Us,\\" and offers unquestionable support for Gilmore's findings. I was familiar with the Black Dahlia case and had heard of Gilmore's book. After reading the John Douglas book, I immediaely obtained a copy of \\"Severed\\" and found this a great book!I have been intrigued by the Black Dahlia and was totally blown away by the \\"Case Reopened\\" documentary which highlights Gilmore's book, reenacting the murder. Scary stuff! I have since read other material on the case, but Gilmore's \\"Severed\\" has to be the bible to the Black Dahlia.No matter how many different takes are offered on this famous case, it becomes clear that the one core account is \\"Severed.\\" Another reviewer says the book has a haunting effect, and I offer this is due to the abundance of personal details Gilmore has brought to light about the real person, Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia). He has made her so real she seems to jump off the pages.The suspect in \\"Severed\\" is a totally creepy individual, wholly believable, and this has been underscored by John Douglas. However, Gilmore doesn't claim he has solved the murder. Though he worked extensively with the detectives who handled the case, he makes clear that a dead man cannot confess or be tried. He tells the story of this awful crime, gathered from exclusive police points of view and information, from postmortem files and medical records that makes a readers hair stand on end. The massive amount of very personal details about Elizabeth Short, from her lipstick and face powder right down to descriptions of her underwear, makes this work so important. Elizabeth has been labeled a prostitute and a streetwalker in other books, and Gilmore skillfully proves this to be untrue. Elizabeth was never a prostitute or a streetwalker. Gilmore makes her so real that the reader cannot help but feel the pain and anguish, the loneliness and desperation Elizabeth must have experienced in her all-too-short life. This is a pitiful story, told by a fine writer, and painful at times to read. I believe this is one of the most important books even written in the field of true crime. An unforgettable read, as others have said, that merits the utmost praise."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"That he doesn't cite ANYTHING? He quotes all over the place and makes sweeping claims, but has absolutely no reference list. I don't understand how this is acceptable. He starts out with pure fiction--what boy on a bike? how does he know what that boy, IF he exists, felt about seeing the car?--and it goes on through the book. I feel like he often sacrifices fact for atmosphere. He certainly has an agenda, like everyone who writes Dahlia books. They don't sell if there isn't a whodunit at the end and he certainly has his pet theory, i.e. Jack Anderson Wilson. He sure flogs the hell out of that one. It's sad to read the transcripts of that sodden drunk taking advantage of him."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Severed is by far the best book on the Black Dahlia, in fact, as Colin Wilson says, it is the only reliable book. Not only was it the first nonfiction book ever published on the subject, but John Gilmore, having spent years researching the case, it is also one of the most exciting and penetrating true crime books ever written. The few who call it \\"junk\\" and etc, are not grasping the essence of what this book is all about. This is a work of literature, of history, a deep excavation of L.A. as it was during the classic era!As for the suspect, Gilmore took what he uncovered to the LAPD and placed it in their hands. FBI profiler John Douglas has even endorsed Gilmore's suspect. Gilmore makes the strong point that the case can never be solved. He opened the door to discovering the Black Dahlia in full dimension. For those who want to understand what this case was all about, read Severed first."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book is a seduction of the readers mind. John Gilmore has an incredible knack at hooking you in via some of the most evocative language and images I've ever read. The sharpness of his detailed exploration into the psychology of the Black Dahlia, her life and times in this bleak portrait of L. A., must stand all by itself as a monument to \\"noir\\" literature. This is an exciting book that apparently knows no bounds or genre. It engulfs the reader. I can hardly wait to read his forthcoming true-crime, \\"L.A. DESPAIR: A Landscape of Crimes and Bad Times,\\" and \\"Crazy Streak,\\" which appears to be about sexual obsession in the manner of Lolita. As Betty Davis once said, \\"Fasten your seat belts! It's gonna be a bumpy ride!\\""},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The Black Dahlia case is unique, I think, among the several dozen murder cases that form the core of the twentieth-century true crime canon not because of the particular horrors of the crime, but because we know -- in the verifiable, documentary sense of that word -- very little about either the victim or the killer.The \\"Black Dahlia truth-told-at-last\\" book business is a peculiar one, as a result. In nearly every case, these books are *involved* in the crime: the author is the daughter or son of the (asserted) killer, or the childhood friend of the victim, or the interlocutor (in Gilmore's case) in a conversation with the suspect.The two phenomena -- the lack of deep and broad data on the victim or her killer, and the highly-involved nature of these narratives -- are related; in the absence of facts, we readers want at least the guarantee of an author's personal knowledge.(For those of you who are surprised by the vituperative quality of a lot of the reviews of Black Dahlia books, this may be the reason: hard-core Dahlia fans give their allegiance to a narrative, rather than to evidence, and so feel the need to defend their narratives against all comers. Don't be put off by this; it's perfectly possible to read the Dahlia literature without becoming a crank.)Gilmore's a good writer. Reading this book is a pleasure: no doubt about that. But Gilmore -- like most true crime writers raised in the post-WWII documdrama school -- forgets to remind us that much of what passes for transcription and photo-realistic description in *Severed* is in fact creative writing: fictionalization.And I don't think a dispassionate reader will find that he's made a sound or even credible case for his suspect's involvement (or, some readers will say, for that suspect's existence).I found Gilmore's evocation of Elizabeth Short's milieu quite compelling. I feel certain, even if I cannot possibly prove it, that Gilmore has somehow captured the mute despair, the cognitive dissonance, the plebian beauty and tawdriness of Short's life and times *as it indeed was*.But I think a dispassionate reader will have to conclude that the book fails, pretty much completely, on procedural grounds -- the case cannot, in any sense, be declared 'solved' on the basis of Gilmore's arguments.Nonetheless, a definite keeper."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's SEVERED was the first true crime book to appear on the Black Dahlia case, the most notorious unsolved murder in the annuls of Los Angeles crime. The beautiful Elizabeth Short, known before her savage murder as the Black Dahlia, has been become an international cult icon of the noir atmosphere since Gilmore's astounding book was published. Other books have tried to follow his lead but pale dreadfully in comparison. Nothing comes close to this riveting work, an almost mythical symbol of Hollywood Babylon/film noir glamour-cum-sordidness. An excursion into the life and desperate desires of this wannabe starlet who finds her fame only in her own brutal murder. Grim, bleak, and intense, this work as well offers a possible solution to the murder which cannot, Gilmore presents, ever be legally solved. This errie and dark mystery will endure and haunt us forever. A highly recommended read, though very graphic photos may disturb the more easily-shocked reader."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have finished the UK edition and find this to be an amazing, superb work. A brand new review in a UK magazine calls SEVERED a work &quot;that borders on poetry in its purity and which more than any other title extant is responsible for the Dahlia's rise as a counter-culture madonna, Our Lady of Perpetual Pain and Suffering...&quot; Well put. I wholly agree, and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best true crime I have read, and I am reading it for the third time. Being an ex-lawman and avid reader, I'm especially interested in the insider's view of the police activities this book offers, during the investigation of the homicide of Elizabeth Short. John Gilmore affords us unobstructed views into the victim and crime, and explores the personalities of the detectives working the case, and related cases. He writes with a deft, vivid style and explores the subject like a pathologist conducting an autopsy. The reader will not find this same engaging quality in other books or crime television. The scrapebook photographs are fascinating and intriguing, and the autopsy photos which some may find gory, are essential from an investigative standpoint. A highly readable book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The coroner's photos might turn your stomach--as they did mine. Well written. You get to see and know what this woman was about. It's true: she was a good-time girl; still, what a way to go. Nobody should have to die the way she did.As far as who did her in?--the author seems to have a fairly compelling idea...and yet, the truth is there never was/is any actual evidence to prove that the suspect who died in that fleabag fire was the actual killer. Then again--who knows?What is difficult to accept is the disappearance of the taped conversations the author had with suspect Jack Anderson Wilson once they were turned over to the LAPD. Too convenient. After all the years of working on the book and finally, at long last, meeting up with a potential suspect, didn't it occur to the author to make duplicates of his recorded conversations with the possible murderer before turning his sole evidence over to the poice? I don't get it. John Gilmore does not strike me as a dumb individual, and yet without these tapes, without anyone else, other than Gilmore, to claim they ever existed--Mr. Gilmore hasn't got much.So who killed Elizabeth Short? A member of the LAPD? Someone connected? One of Tinseltown's High and Mighty? In this reader's opinion, the answer is not conclusive.Still, I say this is the type of true crime book that could easily cause you to have nightmares. Read at your own risk. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"...I felt unsatisfied by the ending. Kind of like a delicious meal at a five-star restaurant, but ending up with a dessert that kind of (...)(!) I came on Amazon one day and spent the better part of 2 hours browsing through reviews on true crime books, when I came across \\"Severed\\", which I had heard of previously, having always had a bit of a morbid fascination with the Dahlia murder. I counted down the days until it arrived in the mail, being unable to find it locally. I couldn't put the book down, reading it all in 2 sittings. The \\"noir\\" feel of Gilmore's writing is enough to hold one's attention, even if the reader could have cared less about Beth Short and her untimely and very gruesome demise. However, I the payoff was less than satisfying for me, as I am not completely convinced that the alleged perpetrator, pegged by Gilmore as being the Dahlia's executioner, is really her killer. The piece of the puzzle that bothers me is this -- this suspect never even mentions in all of his \\"MY FRIEND then did this, and then MY FRIEND did that\\" type of recollections, the one piece of evidence about her corpse mentioned in this book for the first time, i.e. the particularly nasty goo found in the contents of her stomach. Looks like this sicko would have RELISHED telling that part of the story. Of course, I realize that this psycho may well have been her killer; my only problem is that this book didn't completely convince me. However, it is a MUST READ for any true crime afficianado."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. It is tough, hard-boiled, does not pull any punches. I ordered the video, CASE REOPENED, and the re-enactment of author John Gilmore interviewing the suspected killer of the Black Dahlia is so intriguing I ordered the book, SEVERED, immediately. I have read it four times and each time there is new themes to discover. I cannot recommend this book more highly for buffs of crime and &quot;L.A.&quot; aficionados, also those fascinated with grim, noir literature. This is the best of the lot, the first documentary book on the sensational 1940's Black Dahlia murder case of Hollywood. A few pathetic imitatations have ridden in on Gilmore's success (one ridiculous, vanity press offering accuses the late, great actor/director Orson Wells of the murder!). Gilmore's book stands alone and is (and will not doubt remain) far ahead of the pack. Personally, most intriguing about Gilmore's SEVERED is Elizabeth Short's unfulfilled desire to be loved and the unusual handicap that stays her from returning the love she is craving. It appears this strange complication is at the root of her violent death. Certainly this is as sad as any Greek Tragedy, and Gilmore presents a 20th Century tragedy in his dark, dark tale. This is an extraordinary book and will surely live forever."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Living in Southern California, I always love reading true crime books with So-Cal historical content.

Map also points out the site of the body discovery.The best pictures and illustrations I've seen in a true crime book.It's an exciting read from start to finish. As compared to some other Dahlia books I've read, I think this one gives us a glimpse into Elizabeth Short - the person. It's obvious from reading this book that the author has done extensive research to create the most accurate picture of one of the most haunting unsolved murders in Los Angeles.I think the author is right on the mark with his theory into the main suspect.Read this one before the other Dahlia books."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Thanks heavens this unfortunate girl has been redeemedby John Gilmore.

After reading this book by John Gilmore, I feel I know you, or that I know the emotions you had, how much you desired to work in movies but bad luck hunted you down. I am so sorry for you.

I have read other accounts or books inspired by the case, but this one is the only book that digs beneath the surface. Not only is this a fascinating account of a notorious, still (officially) unsolved homicide (plus another unsolved murder of a Sunset Strip socialite)), but it is also an historical observation of the seedy underworld of Hollywood/Los Angeles after the Second World War. The morgue photographs of Elizabeth Short are absolutely chilling, particularly the head shot.

Elizabeth Short, no doubt the first real &quot;Goth&quot;, is a would-be femme fatale known in Hollywood as the Black Dahlia. She quickly emerges from this unnerving book as a major star of Noir Literature. Her tale is heartbreaking. Elizabeth Short's lonely drifting in search of love takes her into dangerous waters. She pretends to be &quot;available&quot; but carries with her a dark secret that sets her apart from everyone she meets. Beautifully-written, strange and haunting, the story about this incredible case is wholly believable and disturbing. Rootless people cling to hope and the Hollywood dream: that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This is a picture of unfulfilled dreams, of shadows and terrible violence. The Black Dahlia, as aspiring movie starlet, arouses desire in almost every man she meets, and in some women, too. At the same time, she &quot;flirts&quot; with some desperate, dangerous characters.

Unlike other True Crime novels, it doesn't focus on the hooplah of the storyline, but instead gets to the point, from page one, and stays there. John Gilmore's always made a point to do just that, and with the second printing of this acclaimed title, readers will find more images and basis of the crime itself.

Exhaustively researched and compellingly written, Gilmore's account unearths the truth about the life and death of Elizabeth Short. In the process, he explodes some of the myths concerning the Dahlia case: Short was not a hooker, a lesbian, or a porn actress. Gilmore is the only writer to portray Short thruthfully, as she was in real life, through extensive interviews with those who knew her. And possibly, Gilmore is the only writer to discover the true identity of the man who dumped her corpse in a vacant Hollywood lot, neatly sliced in two. &quot;Severed&quot; is the last word on the Black Dahlia murder"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"25% mistakes, 50% fiction.

Don't you just hate it when murder scenes migrate like that? Talk about sneaky!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Gilmore does a very good job of painting a picture of Ms. Short's life leading up to her tragic murder. That picture is of a listless dreamer, that while gifted with some personal magnetism and looks (although greatly exaggerated in that department in my male opinion), is actually little more than a gadfly, crashing at one place after another, sponging money from everyone that is never repaid, essentially living in survival mode off the largesse of men and women that felt sorry for her. Her dreams were never supported by a tangible plan with any likely chance of success, she just drifted from one night out to the next it seems.As for the murder, and his solution to the crime, forgeddaboutit.His favored suspect is selected based almost entirely on a third person tale, further the tale lacks very critical details of acts done to the defiled body which calls into serious question the veracity of the story. I won't go into grotesque detail, but after reading those pages it was clear to me that the story was almost certainly a fabrication of someone's imagination, as was a likely connection to other murders which were very dissimilar. There was no motive for the torture and abuse laid out, no pattern, leading to the conclusion that this murder stood unconnected and unique.Clearly, the conclusions would not stand up in court, IMHO. I'm going to try to wade through the other popular work on the subject, Black Dahlia Avenger, but going in I suspect I'll find no better answers there."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is a superb book, as verified by John Douglas (author of MINDHUNTER and THE ANATOMY OF MOTIVE), in his excellent book, THE CASES THAT HAUNT US. The chapter on the Black Dahlia strongly supports John Gilmore's work, and SEVERED. What better recommendation can be had?SEVERED is violent crime and sexual homicide, and loaded with frightening photographs. Elizabeth Short, the notorious Black Dahlia is a haunting persona as portrayed by Gilmore, and his masterful stroke of never letting one get too close to her hangs her in suspension, remaining an enigma. She is a shadowy figure drifitng in a haze. Other times she is as real as one's self, laughing or fearful, yet even then she manages to escape from the reader, the same as she escapes from real life in her strange, whirlpool travels that rush her to violent death. John Gilmore takes us back into a 1940's Los Angeles world of cops, grifters, movie extras, B-girls, the whole nine yards. He creates a landscape barren of emotion and riddled with danger. This is as bleak as a foggy bog where the unwary get trapped. That's how you feel reading his book. Trapped! This work has to be destined an icon of American pop culture."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"My Da got this book from the library,and found it very thorough, deeply studied, well-written. I might have read it myself, as true crime and historical events are of interest to me,but I had the misfortune to open the book to a photograph of poor Miss Short's corpse.It has haunted me to this day.I encourage all ladies to avoid this book, due to the photographs, and gentlemen,also,if they are easilly distressed."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Completely devoid of documentation; a mish-mash of truth, half-truth, fiction and fantasy, &quot;Severed&quot; is one of the silliest books I've ever read. The Black Dahlia case deserves a great deal more intellectual and moral rigor than Mr. Gilmore has brought to it. A complete waste."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I really liked this book. I bounced back in forth between 2 authors and am I ever glad I picked this one. Had heard of Black Dahlia and was a little familiar with the case. John Gilmore really made it interesting and filled in all the gaps! I read the whole book in one day, staying with it till 3:30 am.!I have since bought another Gilmore book. I will be buying more, he is a phenominal writer!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have read all the books written about the Black Dahlia. This one was a waste of my time. Is this a fiction book?"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I am a crime buff, but I had a hard time getting through this book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"An unusual book. The first half, detailing Beth Short's life before and during the war, is absolutely enthralling for fans of old movies---the atmosphere is tangible enough to be relived in the reader's mind.But the second half, the so-called solution to the crime, is disappointing somehow. I don't know why. Maybe it's just too pat that the suspect conveniently dies at just the right time.Some of the criticisms leveled against this book can also not be denied...there are some factual errors made in the book that somewhat lessens the author's credibility, most especially his assertations about Franchot Tone. I'm inclined to think that much of this book is fiction.But even if the solution is spurious, the book's worth having because of its evocation of the Hollywood war era."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. The author's writing style and lack of organization hinders understanding. Many more questions are left unanswered than are answered! It's a shame because the author is obviously an expert on thecase but who can figure out what's going on from his text? Simple things like dates (even just years!) are missing. Characters are developed in great depth than suddenly dropped. New charcters are poorly introduced. Pictures are in the book but no mention of their subject is found in the text. No rhyme no reason. I hope someone writes a more definite book on this case in the style of a Bugliosi (Helter Skelter) which answers all questions. The one star is for info gleaned on the case."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I must object to the seamy cover of this book.And a blurb from David Lynch? Borderline tackiness.Poor Elizabeth Short, taken endless advantage of.Much credit to Mr. Gilmore for his dedication and determination to learn every possible fact about this woman's murder. Reconstruction of many of the events, before and after the murder, had me reading with a shared obsessiveness.However, there were sections that lost me, suffered from lack of clarity and clumsiness in execution.One example: direct quotes from a forensic report are fine, but it would be nice for the author to provide explanations for the medical jargon.Likewise, Gilmore's attempt to reconstruct the last days of Elizabeth Short's life strangely lack interest or feeling, as if all his years devoted to understanding what happened to her had exhausted him of a more important empathy needed to try and explain why.Elizabeth Short remains a cipher. She needed a journalist with a novelist's insight. The saddest and strangest part of her story remains to be told."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I discovered John Gilmore's book, SEVERED, in a bookshop in Santa Monica. The photographs startled me. I was drawn into them. The Black Dahlia in death seemed to be some sort of announcement into the hearts of women. I have read this book twice now and have bought copies to give for Valentine's Day Presents because there is real understanding in this book about pain and about Love-That-Can-Never-Come-True, no matter how hard we want it to. If it was Thanksgiving I would give this book so that we might be thankful for the love we do have in our lives. There are also all these insights into wounded people like Beth Short and these other people who became lost. To me, Gilmore appears to be saying that is the fear we carry, about getting lost, and vulnerable, and for me, this book has shined a light into these fears. My soul is richer for having read this book. I want to read everything this writer has written and try to find all the little gems of truth that shine right out, even where they seem to be covered up with the problems people face in day to day survival.What I have also witnessed here is the world that was L.A. during the Second World War years, and how people were changed by the events of the time. Just as we are changed by the events of our time. The writing enabled me to share with the people in this book, and to get involved in their lives and their concerns. This has been a rewarding experience in reading Gilmore's book, and I hope that many others can share this with me."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"After reading this book, I walked away with contradictory feelings. On the one hand, I felt that the text did a very good job at bringing to light one of the most notorious and horrible crimes of the 20th century. I felt as if I came to know Elizabeth Short personally; where she was from, her dreams, aspiritions, and why such a terrible thing would happen to her. My only qualm with the book was in the publication of some of the crime scene/morgue photos, which I found profoundly disturbing. I felt I was violating Ms. Short's and her family's privacy by having her corpse displayed in the book for the entire public to see. Still, after reading the book, I walked away with some degree of satisfaction in discovering who Ms. Short's murderer might have been, and what might have motivated this person in doing what he did. Now that I have read the book, I can say that I feel most fortunate to live in an era where forensic science has come such a long way that if (God forbid), such a crime were committed today, it is extremely remote that the perpetrator would get away with it.If one can get past the more disturbing photos, then it is well-worth the reading."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Admittedly, I have a bit of an obsession for true crime books, and unsolved crimes. I found this book an addictive read, and was unable to put it down until I finished it. While the style of the writing leaves something to be desired, the author provides just enough history to make the reader feel he/she knows something about the victim, without ever really getting to know her, thus not completely removing the veil of mystery. As for his theory on who actually did the murder, it seems plausible, but I guess we'll never really know."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The reader races through this book with its noir heroine, Elizabeth Short, AKA The Black Dahlia. She gets right into your skin! The police scenes and the investigation of her murder, as is the crime itself, are told in harrowing detail. This is not typical hardboiled writing like James Ellroy; Gilmore is a highly original writer. The tale is dark and twisted, yet with a sensitivity to the writing that takes this subject (as the subjects in other Gilmore books) right into the reader with the same haunting quality that makes this particular book such an outstanding work. Nothing else comes close to it."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book is highly recommended for all those interested in the true crime/crime literature field. An excellent read. The author traces the victim of a savage crime, and the enigmatic killer trail with inexhaustible expertise. The scenes inside the Los Angeles County Morgue are chilling and disturbing. Gilmore has done an amazing job of exploring a world only a few of us enter. This is for sure the dark side of the moon. A tragic and compelling tale."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore is right to say, as he does in &quot;Severed&quot;, that murderers and their victims are linked irreversibly for eternity. Who can think of the Lindbergh baby without remembering Bruno Hauptmann, or ponder the fate of the Princes in the Tower without recalling Richard III?In the same way, murders and the authors who write about them also become connected. Whether it be Anne Rule or Truman Capote, Jonathan Goodman or Max Haines, the crime writer and the crime are linked in the minds of the public by bonds as strong as those that connect the killer and the victim.This is why I feel so badly for the Black Dahlia. John Gilmore has written what has to be the most sloppily written, muddled, confusing crime book I've ever read.Factually, &quot;Severed&quot; is a mess. Gilmore leaves out dates, places, and names, neglects to explain what the setup between the police department and the Hearst papers really is (after reading the book twice, it's still not at all obvious to me), and jumps from date to date with not even the slightest attempt to explain what he is doing. He even brings the dead back to life!Stylistically, it's a disgrace. Gilmore's muddled style is the antithesis of the film noir atmosphere he so desperately wants to convey: his prose is confused, thick and unpleasantly ambiguous without even a whiff of the dangerous sexuality or sharp cold fatalism we expect from noir. Sloppiness is not style, and smog is not atmosphere, and Gilmore is not a noir writer.Some books are so good that you read them over and over. Others are okay, but not compelling enough to read more than once. &quot;Severed&quot; I read twice; once in a vain attempt to figure out what Gilmore was trying to say, and once just to gape, like people do when they pass a car accident. But the tragedy I was gaping at was not the murder itself, but the disgrace Gilmore has brought to the Black Dahlia by this travesty of a book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is the book in which the probable murderer of the Black Dahlia is revealed. Once you've read the killer's detailed, grizzly and cold-hearted account of the murder you are unlikely to doubt it. This is the only book about the case of historic value. The author was contacted by the killer in the early 60s, when he gave him a false confession about it that was evidently true, except that the killer told him that a cross-dresser friend had done it. Of the 21 false confessions, this was a false false confession, in other words, a true confession presented falsely. A friend of Elizabeth Short's had been murdered shortly before by the same killer. Chilling stuff, with a great tragic heroine, very well written.The only thing that this book lacks - although it is definitive otherwise - is an examination of the serial stranglings in Los Angeles at the time, which are likely to have been done by the same killer. The bodies were dumped in vacant lots in the same way as in the Black Dahlia murder, and whoever killed her was an experienced psychopath."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's book was so interesting you can not put it down.It was great reading. You will enjoy reading"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book is the best in its field (true crime writing); goes way past reporting by climbing right inside the people the author is writing about. A truly original work by one helluva writer! Dismiss the complaints of those disgruntled few (a minor minority) who fault some of this author's findings (probably would-be writers who are crying in their suds !). This is a writer's writer and all those who yearn to be have to step aside when this one passes. Gilmore shows us how it's done! A remarkable book. I dare you to put it down once you've read the first page. This is a real American book--about Americans, about Los Angeles and our lives and our culture. It's more than a can't-put-down murder story. It's a HUMAN story. One of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The Black Dahlia murder hits post-War L.A. like a red hot bombshell. A beautiful, young, aspiring actress's battered body is found drained of blood and cut in half. The grisly remains of this soon-to-be famous corpse is laid out in an almost bizarre, comic book manner. The cops are stumped and pull every trick in the book to conceal their failure at catching the killer (who has killed another girl before!). The press have a field day! They butcher the poor girl again in the headlines. Tramp--whore--drunk--etc., to the final humilitation of trying to convince the world that &quot;Beth Short got what she deserved&quot;!But the REAL FACTS of the matter are something else altogether, and author John Gilmore brings home the bacon with this one! It is impossible to come away from this book without being deeply affected, even disturbed. And by far the majority vote is a Thumbs Up 5 Star Cheer for Gilmore's book. Yes, yes, there are exceptions to everything; a few disgruntled, no doubt highly envious &quot;professionals&quot; who will throw out their feebly nasty comments about this fine book and it's author's endeavors. One has brought up supposed &quot;mistakes&quot; on Gilmore's part. However, sincere and intelligent readers of true-crime and certainly the wide following this author has, will no doubt recheck the text but fail to find the errors. So we simply have to overlook the little green-eyed would-be competitors, because SEVERED is a book of immaculate continuity, almost approaching literary perfection. BUY it! READ it! If you love Noir L.A.crime/mystery/true cases, your cup will runneth over with this one!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I read this book a couple of times along with some others and found it simply not credible. Elizabeth Short was in a desperate search for a well heeled sugar daddy or a well placed mate. That she went with an alcoholic loser makes no sense and if this is the book that has her with undeveloped sexual organs (can't remember but I think it was this one), how weird is that and it's certainly not the case. In that highly unlikely scenario (considering how she was getting around and did she ever!), the drunken bum becomes enraged when he discovers that she has no sexual equipment. The book that makes the most sense is Donald H. Wolfe's \\"The Black Dahlia Files\\" which has her as a relatively high priced hooker who was impregnated by one of the Chandlers from the newspaper family who all but ran LA. She met her death when she tried to shake down Chandler, by no less than Bugsy Siegel who was at the top of the criminal pyramid with prostitution as one of his rackets and doing some TCB for one of LAs most prominent power brokers. It's thoroughly plausible, considering the crooked LA power structure and it's very detailed by a very credible author. Some of the other books are off the charts in believability. Read one called something like \\"My Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer\\" where a woman claimed she had a flashback about being in the garage as a child while her father mutilated Short's corpse. There there's Hodel, accusing his weirdo physician father with no direct evidence and with his meandering narrative and pictures of Short that look nothing like her. Don't get me started but the baloney that has been published about this case is as bad, if not worse, than all the lies that have been published about the Ripper Murders. Wolfe's book is the only one that makes sense unless your inclined to buy bridges. On the downside, this book has gotten bad reviews too but, so far, it seems to make the most sense - to me anyway."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"SEVERED is a fascinating read. It is very harsh in places. But due to the author's detailed reconstuction of a time, place and the people, the harshness is balanced with a sensitivity rare for this kind of nonfiction writing. The author indicates many areas for the reader's consideration without blemishing the books integrity. A very good book; well worth the read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Never have I read a book that so captures the jurisdictional and interdepartmental squabbling and plain stupidity as clear as this book does. The pressures imposed by the media upon law enforcement that hinder real investigative work is etehced here in acid! The police are under the gun and the result is panic time. You can lose everything you're trying for if you fight policy. And finally, nobody on the outside knows or cares. So why risk it? That's what comes across. It is a modern day tragedy. Gilmore gets the point across better than anyone I've read before. Times have changed only in the numbers, and to think it was different back then than it now is dumb. It's only worse now, as in the O.J. Simpson situation. I recommend SEVERED to everyone in law enforcement and the press. There's lessons here to be learned. This is a heavy duty book, as well as an incredible story. It's terrific!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book has nothing to offer except to waste the time of people obsessed by the Elizabeth Short case. Terrible with facts, all over the place with writing, this book is just out there to make money off of the obsession with this unsolved brutal murder. Don't buy into it. I did for a minute, wasted time reading it, and felt like a fool after realizing what it really is."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have just read SEVERED: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder. The title haunts me, now that I've read the story. The pathos are etched deep, and the writer has touched the well-springs of human folly and tragedy. The character are so alive they sizzle on the page. This is five bone book!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Despite a certain &quot;noir&quot; flavor, SEVERED flies in the face of documented evidence from the Dahlia case. Detective St. John, for example--cited by Gilmore as an apparent source for and believer in the guilt of Gilmore's suspect, still specifically and publicly denied the case had been solved up to the moment of his death! Gilmore's various statements to the media over a span of years also present a conflicting and highly contradictory picture of how much the alleged killer told him--or, indeed, whether they ever spoke at all. One wonders why it took so many years (over 20 by Gilmore's own estimate) to grind out a largely unsupported story with no documented sourcing whatsoever...and then published by a small press which lets it go out of print after two years. Far from the definitive answer. For a better take, check out DADDY WAS THE BLACK DAHLIA KILLER."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I was propelled through this well-written, exciting tale with a mounting sense of urgency. I read the book twice over the weekend and plan to read it a third time to catch what I might have missed. The literary elements here are woven around the girl known as the Black Dahlia. She comes to life and I felt very close to her. Her murder was very disturbing, perhaps because Gilmore brought me so close to her in the story. The writing is exciting. A great read. I find the few negative reviews puzzling. Leaves one to wonder about the intelligence of those readers. Needless to say, this is a controversial book, so perhaps that is the reason for the sharply diverse pros (majority) &amp; cons (minority). Also this writer digs right into one's safeguards against adverse subjective feelings, getting right into one's head. This book is quite an amazing one. Caution: the brutal photographs might be a chore to view, but this is what happens. This is the world we live in, and the world Gilmore writes about."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"My heart raced through this book, begging for some reward to be granted to poor Elizabeth Short, flower of the night. The beautiful, vain and desperate young woman, a child in so many ways, seeks a measure of love and acceptance, so desperate in her search to find some warm, sheltering little place in the sun. She is one of many young women &quot;on the road&quot; during that confusing, mixed-up history of post-war Los Angeles, and her dreams of motion picture fame and happiness take her to the sad, sad low point this book so devastatingly creates. The word-pictures are so vivid it is like watching a stark 1940's black and white movie. The photographs in this extraordinaty book are shocking and will not doubt disturb some readers, but otherwise a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"One of the really special books I have read. I was introduced to SEVERED: The True Story fo the Black Dahlia murder in Los Angeles at the Museum of Death in Hollywood, where John Gilmore gave a reading from this book. He was with Kenneth Anger who wrote Hollywood Babylon. I have since read the book several times and I have bought copies to give to friends. Also I bought LAID BARE: A Memoir of Wrecked Lives and the Hollywood Death Trip by Gilmore, which contains a remarkable section dealing with the Black Dahlia that is not contained in SEVERED. Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Short has become an icon since Gilmore's book has shown her in the most comprehensive way I imagine it is possible. The writing lets the reader understand the characters and the time period, a very special time in history. Los Angeles and Hollywood during the forties, the WWII period. This is vivid like a walk through a 1940's carnival with the lights and sounds and the milling of the oddball characters. A real slice of life (and death) as it was in the 1940's, a very dark mystery of the hunt and the hunted."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book by John Gilmore tells a most haunting tale about the young wannabe actress Elizabeth Short. She is known as the Black Dahlia because she dresses in black, has black hair, is most beautiful and a very odd girl. Her brutal murder in post-War Hollywood becomes a milestone for the dark side of Los Angeles. This book transcends the true crime genre, is more than mystery, more than drama, and unfolds as a searching tale within the American psyche. This is a raw, powerful, insightful story, and John Gilmore tells it brilliantly. He explores the dark world like a cat, and it is no wonder Gilmore has become such a cult figure. With haunting, evocative prose, Gilmore digs into the victim's odd nature, paving it as the road to her violent murder."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's SEVERED is a masterful work, revealing the character of the Black Dahlia, Elizaabeth Short who was murdered in 1947 in Hollywood. There is no other chronicle that tells the story of this 23 year old beauty in such a personal, detailed manner that REVEALS the real Elizabeth Short who came to Hollywood in search of the \\"magic\\" dream. Other offerings on this story are obvious, commercial exploitations after the fact. Only here in SEVERED does the reader truly meet the Black Dahlia, and discover who she was and what she was like. My recommendation for this book is sky-high."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"You are smacked into the middle of the 1940's in tinseltown, and all the crackpots and shady characters prowling Hollywood Boulevard and Main Street. Elizabeth Short is trying to make it as an actress, even as an extra, but nobody gives her a break. The world is in a big transition. The city is crawling with soldiers and sailors and marines and airforce pilots, and natch the girls to entertain them in the cheap bars of downtown LA and Hollywood. This book doesn't flinch in portraying the hard life on the road for a pretty girl at the end of the Second World War. A dark, forboding feeling is over everything, behind the laughs and the flirtations. There is mystery and a sense of danger. The beginning of the book details the finding of the body of the Black Dahlia, and this is without peer in crime writing. This is a masterful work, and John Gilmore is a masterful writer. I cannot recommended this book highly enough. This is not a READ, it is an EXPERIENCE like watching a dark, strange ballet, full of shadow figures."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Everything has been said about this book, but I would love to add that it has introduced me to the darker, war-years Los Angeles that you only see in the older films noir. This is a remakrable book in scope and depth into the character and psychology of not only the &quot;star&quot;, Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, but into the fringe characters as well. The transcript of the killer's depiction of the murder of the Black Dahlia is a nightmare. I am haunted by it. Anything else on this mysterious case falls short of John Gilmore's book. Get it, read it, and you'll never forget it."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Gilmore had it right when he wrote this concise, hard-bitten chunk of L.A. history in a prose and style that made the hair on my neck stand up and salute! He keeps getting it right every time he opens his mouth on some History Channel or E! show, talking about that totally and awesomely delectable Elizabeth Short, Night Queen of the LA back streets and cheap hotels and dingy bars crammed with gobs and loud-mouths and tinhors and grifters, all lookin' for a ticket to ride.I've gone from the first page to the end on 230 a half dozen times and haven't had my fill. Sorry all you other droops on the bandwagon, wish I could say the same but I can't. This one's right and ain't no coypu showing plastic teeth.Cool book. Cool read about a pretty girl as pretty as a full moon; skin as white and eyes as deep; sweet lost Betty/Beth/Elizabeth, to meet your Maker on such a hard, hard, lonely road. The loss of her makes you want to puke! A salute to cult-king John Gilmore for makin' me feel so sorry she's gone."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the best books published the last ten years. A real-life thriller full of twists and turns. It is shocking and disturbing. A war time, homefront world from coast to coast; a vivacious, glamourous girl (Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia), weaves an incredible trail we are compelled to follow. The characters remind one of Damon Runyon and Jim Thompson, though John Gilmore is a commanding writer with a unique, original talent and a flair for the macabre. The killer is like someone in an old B-movie noir thriller or a spooky Sherlock Holmes mystery, but convinces and scared the pants of this reader. To think this psycho walked the streets is frightening. A highly recommended true crime read. By far the best of all thats been presented on this famous nonfiction murder."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"There are at least three or four books written by various authors about Elizabeth Short. Years ago I had read a different book, which at the time had been my only introduction to the Black Dahlia murder mystery. I figured the previous book was an adequate portrayal of real events, and I was mildly interested.Recently I read John Gilmore's version, the book titled Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia and I was blown away. What a difference in quality between separate books on the same subject! When I had read the other book I was mildly interested, but when I read Gilmore's version, I became intensely fascinated. There is just no comparison. If you are going to read only one book about the Black Dahlia case, make that book Gilmore's.Forget anything you have ever previously heard about the Elizabeth Short case. In Severed, John Gilmore apparently has somehow received exclusive \\"insider\\" information and his book even exposes the actual autopsy report on the case, which had been suppressed for years. Now here it is in all its gruesome details.The book begins by letting us get to know \\"Beth\\" Short as a person. We learn how it was for her growing up in Massachusetts, and her frequent trips to Florida as a treatment for bronchial problems. We learn what she was like, her personality, and her attraction to men and the men's return of that attraction.For most of the book, it reads like a novel, yet it never strays from the truth. An example of Gilmore's gifted writing abilities can be seen from Chapter 11:The Los Angeles County morgue, where the questionable deaths and murder victims were delivered pending identification or burial, was cramped, dingy, and had leaking water pipes. Glass panels in many of the doors were fogged over with a sticky moisture. The foul air reeked of decomposition and the constant electric fans only blew the odors from one hallway or room to another.Often it would seem almost hot and humid in the halls. At one point the incoming cases became so \\"bottled up\\" that, with the severe shortage of equipment, the autopsies were performed on the gurneys. The rims around the table edges were too shallow to contain the fluids spilling over.How is that for a grisly reality! Los Angeles in the 1940s truly was the Wild West and Noir Hollywood combined. In fact, events following the Black Dahlia murder in Los Angeles in early 1947 led to a complete shakedown of the police department and a thorough weeding-out of bungling and the cleaning up of intolerable and incompetent personnel and related situations. It should be commended that the Los Angeles police force was able to rise like a Phoenix from the corruption of the 1940s into a shining example of competence in the 1950s.Adding to the confusion of the Black Dahlia case was the vultures who were otherwise known as newspaper reporters. The lengths they went to in order to obtain any information, real or imagined, would probably be punishable by jail time if they went to those lengths today. Or maybe not, as movie stars can tell you about today's paparazzi.As can be expected from a true crime book, there are pages of photographs, 40 pages to be exact. Certainly there are pictures of the body after death, but there are also many of the Black Dahlia as she was in life. Gilmore has even managed to get a photo of Elizabeth Short's Junior High School report card!John Gilmore was able to effectively deliver all the events of Elizabeth Short's life and death (and the murder investigation) chronologically and in a very exciting manner. I again want to point out that he seems to have exclusive \\"insider\\" information to many things, and not just the autopsy report, which is a real coup in itself. There are things in this book I guarantee you will not find anywhere else, especially about the investigation.Who committed this crime? It is still officially unsolved but Gilmore makes some very convincing arguments as to the identity of the killer.So let me repeat: if you are only going to read one Black Dahlia book, make this one it. As the editor of The Horror Zine, I recommend Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia by John Gilmore above any other Black Dahlia book.Review by Jeani Rector, EditorThe Horror Zine[...]"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"But I have always found the Black Dahlia case compelling. This is the best of the three books I have read on the subject, far superior to &quot;Daddy was the Black Dahlia Killer&quot; - if you consider that anything but fiction. Full of intensive research, horrifying photographs, and an accesible writing style, I recommend this book highly, if you are interested in this subject."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is one of those unsolved cases that has always intrigued me. This book is well done, and I liked how it focused not only on Beth Short's brutal murder, but also on telling the story of her life leading up to her death. I appreciated the detail the author put into covering the information of the case, and I discovered things that I'd not known about the murder. The author makes a case for his favorite suspect, but I still feel it's something that we'll never know for certain. I recommend this book to anyone that finds this case, or unsolved cases interesting"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book is the real deal. I felt like I knew the people in the book personally and got a real feel for Beth as a person. Well written and engaging."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I've read several books on this subject and this is my favorite.John Gilmore's painstaking research is evident. It is very aparent throughout this book that this case holds more than an ordinary journalistic interest for him.Reading this book for the first time gave me a sense of Elizabeth Short as a real person and not just a dark, mysterious alias or a crime scene photograph. She became a person.Some of the book is written in a prose style. I'm sure there is plenty of conjecture and a little artistic license used, but this just adds to the depth of the story we Black Dahlia-obsessed freaks can't get enough of.It's a riveting read. There's stuff in here I've not read anywhere else, and photographs I've never seen before.If you even have a passing interest in true crime or famous murders, or if you're a Dahlia die-hard (expecially if you're a Dahlia die-hard,) you have to read this book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book really brought me to tears. My heart just went out to this unfortunate girl. Her family must have been devastated. I thought that John Gilmore did an excellent job of describing a sad and savage act. It was hard for me to put the book down once I started reading it. I think I would be interested in reading more books by John Gilmore. I purchased this book from Amazon, and it arrived even quicker than I expected."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have recently read Steve Hodel's books Black Dahlia Avenger, Black Dahlia Avenger II, & Most Evil. I followed those three by buying and reading Mr. Gilmore's \\"Severed... The True Story of Black Dahlia\\". My sincere feeling is that Mr. Gilmore's book is no where close to the quality (and even Conclusions) of Mr. Hodel's work.As I was going through Severed I kept anticipating the footnotes and bibliography that would follow at the end. As I was reading on Kindle (purchased at Amazon), quick jumping to the back is not easy! I was shhocked at the end to find no supporting materials or sources even those that could have been referred to by Gilmore from Hodel's BDA whicj appears to have been published first. Gilmore did print a number of photos including the most graphic that Hodel refused to include in his booksMany people question Hodel's body of work as being a bit much since he links his father, Dr. George H. Hodel as the Black Dahlia murderer, murderer of countless othe young women in LA in the 40s and 50s, Chicago and even proposes that Dr. George Hodel was also the \\"Zodiac\\" killer of the 60's in San Francisco! Hodel's countless refences tend to support his theory and he always stated, however, its all based upon the facts he presents and has no other proving information.Gilmore would have the reader believe that a drifter/looser killed Beth Short out of some sexual rage as a result of her having\\" infantile genetalia\\" when he wanted sex. In otherwords she could not have normal vaginal intercourse. The tragedy is that most of the original case files dissapeared from LAPD custody so further clarity is not possible. The recorded transcripts of wire taps in the Dr. George Hodel home in 1950 give strong creedence to his being the murderer. The premis being that LA at that timne was corrupt from top down. Since abortions were illegial, these operations were handled by a group/syndicate of Dr.s who had received protection from the police in return for cash or other service bribes. Why would the LAPD LASD-DA-City Hall fight so hard to keep files from public review and appeared to protect Dr. Hodel's reputation until he skipped out of the country for the next 40 or so years until he came back to San Francisco to live (this is where the Zodiac murders take place. The fact that those series of killings differed can easily be ascribed to the difference in a 38 year old many and one in his late 60s!The suspect in Gilmore's Severed had no influence or authority in LA unlike Dr. HodelHodel's book \\"Most Evil\\" ties all these murders together with handwriting analysis by certified experts, clever clues being left such as geographic curiosities, etc. Hodel's three books while much material is repeated show careful and deliberate investigation. This is totally lacking in the Gilmore book. I did find Gilmore's minute by minute description of Beth Short's daily life (especially in San Diego) in the first half of the book very interesting as it made her seem more alive than Hodel's more scientific research. However,Gilmore's style was so comfortable and relaxed that it does have the feeling of fictional writing, not investigative research (especially without any kind of source material)I am glad I read Gilmore's book after Hodel's as the comparison is stark and clear. Gilmore failed to show me the \\"true story of the Black Dahlia\\" while Hodel's made a very strong case of course based upon lots and lots of circumstantial evidence and official documents (Gilmore had none!. However ther will be questions that will never be answered by anyone I am sure.I found particularly interesting a couple of small points of contrast in the two writers that I have not seen on various blogs, sites etc. These are 1) Beth's lower torso had an unusual slanted angle to it infering that she had been positioned in a recumbent position during her torture, blood draining and bisection. Hodel proposes that this occured in Dr, Hodel's master bath in the famous Lloyd Wright - Sowden\\" home on Franklin Av. Based on observation of the crime scene/autopsy photos, the angle could be very similar to that of the master bath shown in Dr. Hodel's bathroom. On the flip side, Gilmore referres the fact that his \\"killer\\" offered how he placed her body over a metal tub upon boards laid acroos the tub (at an old workshop) and this is where he tortured, bled her and performed the bisection. Based upon my own experience, any naked body resting on a series of boards will in short order develop indentation lines from the uneven pressure points. We all know this to be true. The autopsy (unless withheld and Gilmore would also not have known) did not seem to indicate any such endentation lines especially if the blood draining was occuring!Hodel 1-Gilmore 0. I will not even attempt to justify how a drifter with no medical training was able to bisect Beth's body by performing a Hemicorpectomy and leaving the skin cuts and seperation of the only area of the spinal colume not requiring a \\"saw\\". Hodel 2-Gilmore 0.Also an oft described style of how Beth wore her make-up and hair. She was evidently a perfectionist in her approach to style, clothing (Gilmore repeatedly portrayed Beth laying out all her clothing and admiring them or planning outfit combinations), etc. She is often decribed as having very heavy white powder make-up often quoted is looking \\"Giesha-like\\". She also usually wore bright red toenail polish and matching bright red lipstick. Mr. Gilmore referres on more than one occasion that she had a reputation of not being vaginally active with her dates or boyfriends, but was quick to perform oral sex on them. This was (implied)her way of countering her supposed infantile vagina limiting her to anal and oral sex only. Mr. Gilmore quotes his \\"suspect souce\\" that he observed her performing oral sex on a guy inside a club/restaurnat and that was one of the tipping points for him as the murderer.As a man who is in his 60s I can recall how bright red lipstick was a problem for many men in the 40s 50s and even 60s as a simple mistake and you had \\"lipstick on your collar\\" I cannot imagine a reasonable man (much less Beth) experiencing an oral sex encounter in a public place where lipstick would be every where on face and clothing much less all her very very white face powder. It seems counter intuitive to me. I am willing to say that Beth may have found having oral sex (in private) as a reasonable alternative to keep the dates coming back (for her food and gifts) rather than having vaginal sex. My sense was she was so interested in becoming married that she wanted to keep her \\"promiscuity\\" limited. Hodel 3-Gilmore 0Beth had written but mailed numerous letters to a couple of men who she apparently had created either a fantisy engagement or so wanted to find a loving husband. In one such letter she referres to \\" isnt there some way w can find a way to have our relationship\\" Paraphrased. Even if one accepts the enfantile vagina concept, this supports that Beth was possibly open and clear with men who she loved and sought ways to convince them that they could be together even if she could not have vaginal sex. This was something that hit me hard in Hodel's books as a unstated state of mind of Beth's... just an interesting though taken with the fact that people always said she had a great personality and was good looking (except her teeth) why she was not able to \\"close\\" a marriage? I remain open to the fact that there may have been some kind of female issue with Beth but it could have been at a differnt level (she could have had painful complications with the sex act and that could be the answer? Hodel 3-Gilmore .05Everyone will recall that in recent times a very important US politician inferred in pretty clear terms in the midst of a scandal that \\"oral stimulation was not sex\\" !!!For those who read Gilmore's \\"Severed\\" and rated it as the definitive truth, I encourage them to read all three Hodel books and see if you can 1) see how different an approach Hodel takes to investigative analysis, and 2) maybe change your mind that Gilmoe's work is not the definitive answer to this mystery."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I was especially disappointed with how the author presented his solution to the crime. Spread out over the last few chapters, Gilmore leads readers through the identification of the killer and how the murder was committed (supposedly as told by an informant) in a rambling, stumbling fashion, with errors in several confusing yet critical passages. In the writing, he misidentifies: a) the informant with b) the informant's source with c) the person identified by the source as the killer. (You see, in the story, we have an informant talking about another informant talking about another source talking about the killer.) I had to read and re-read the passages, pages, and the final chapters to realize that the writer and editors screwed up. In short, I found the book interesting, informative, but a very confusing read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Severed is a truly great read. I was totally absorbed into this book. It's a brilliant, genre-breaking transcripted oral history noir, given by those involved, many of whom were still alive at the time, and are taken and crafted in the diffuse light of another less than promising LA Wednesday morning back in January, 1947, before the fog burned-off at about 10:30 AM. Then you could see her nude body, brutally tortured and completely severed at the midriff, drained of all fluids, carefully washed, and posed for the shutter bugs, who always got there first.The horror over on Norton, north of 39th. Street, south of Coliseum. Formerly Elizabeth Short of Medford, Mass. The paperboys always know the way. You should believe him when he says he saw a car there at six. A black Ford. That's what the morning paperboys know. That's what the morning paperboys did; fold papers and ID cars.Martin Lewis, the shoe salesman with a story to tell, to me, formed an interior ring of truth, around which Gilmore's other subjects have spun their true stories. That's how you know it's true. A slight return. It chords with something else, and it buzzes in your head...Gilmore has her there, for a moment, the Black Dahlia herself, and then is all but predictably knocked, skidding, off of her real killer's trail, just as his alkie protagonist and anti-hero, Lanky Jack Wilson is suddenly taken from him, and us, deus ex machina.\\"A signature sex killing.\\" Ellroy says. I call it the perfect crime. Did Jack Wilson do Elizabeth Short in? No way in Hell. But, no matter. I suspect the real killer is in there, somewhere. Down the list. Lucid, and at times transfixing, written in seemingly effortless prose, and annealed with the inclusion of some truly shocking crime scene photos, this is the best place to start your own search for the killer, who could still be alive and at large. There is no statute of limitiations on the truth when it comes to LA's darkest and most infamous and unsolved murder case."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"No wonder this book has been so hightly praised. It is impossible to put down. One of the most exciting, involving books I have read. The writing is direct and engaging. Gilmore is an outstanding author with an amazing command of language. The word pictures he paints dances in your mind and stays in your memory. All in all, this is a sad, tragic story of a girl who, like so many others over the decades, seeks her place in the sun and finds only a nightmare on the dark, &quot;slide-side&quot; on the side of the road in Hollywood.I am reminded of so many other attractive young women who made their way to tinseltown only to lose themselves and wind up as broken dolls. I almost was there myself and can sadly and totally identify with the Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Short as she is portrayed on these riveting pages. (I can not even get interested in the other book about the Black Dahlia because it seems nothing more than a fake, exploitation of this sad girl's life, pain and death).The Black Dahlia as shown to us by John Gilmore has to be the flagship for all those young women who have reached the bottom in their desperate search for love, fame and happiness. My heart cries for poor Elizabeth Short. The photographs in this book are nightmares to behold, as unforgettable as pictures from a concentration camp. Very difficult to take but necessary to this story. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Nothing can compare to this masterpiece of true crime literature."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I salute this book and author for producing the only authoritative study on the Black Dahlia Murder Case. I have read and skimmed the other books and got confused by the conflicting stories until I realized most of what I was reading were stories made up by the writers looking for a new gimmick.SEVERED was the first true-crime book to appear on this case which has fascinated crime readers the world over. There are no gimmicks, no movie stars or somebody's father to blame for the murder. Nor does this book need a gimmick to hook sales.This one is for the L.A. crime and old Hollywood nostalgia buffs, and all readers searching for a &quot;hard core&quot; slice of noir writing."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Without doubt, SEVERED is by far the best book on the Black Dahlia, the \\"leader of the pack\\". Almost everything that can be known about Elizabeth Short, the beautiful, mysterious girl-drifter who has haunted Los Angeles for over half a century, is contained within the pages of this book. John Gilmore, considered a highly controversial writer and cult profile personality, devoted years in researching this work which he confesses was \\"without doubt\\" an obsession since he actually met the Black Dahlia when he was eleven years old (she visited his grandmother with two movie extras, inquiring about the \\"Short\\" side of the family; seeking some relationship between her father, Cleo Short, who faked his own suicide, and the Short side of author Gilmore's family). All of this long before there existed a hullabaloo about the Black Dahlia with others stepping forward (post-SEVERED) to claim their father or someone else was the killer. Back then, from the press, it appears Elizabeth Short was an almost forgotten figure, a bizarre \\"unsolved\\" murder in L.A.'s grimey history, all the while Gilmore was researching his book. Years ago I read two other books by Gilmore (The Tucson Murders, and The Garbage People. My awareness of his connection to the Black Dahlia case was made clear by a front-page story in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner in 1982 (there is a picture of this piece in SEVERED), about Gilmore's investigation and a creepy character he was interviewing who the police were trying to locate. SEVERED was published more than ten years later, and since then, Gilmore's work has made of Elizabeth Short a cult monument. As usual, other books have rushed to follow, blaming their father's or famous figures of murder (like in Jack the Ripper). These offerings are ridiculous exploitations of the truly sad tale of the Black Dahlia, conveyed so throughly and with such pathos in SEVERED. Truly, this is a work that reflects our most unique, star-struck and violent culture; a 100% classic and mainstay of remarkable literature."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I agree with the previous reader called Veronica T.This book is by far the best book on the subject of the BLACK DAHLIA, (written thus far). It's the only book written to date, that makes any sense.I've read other books on this same subject and most of them did not come close. Infact, some other books written on this same subject were down right un-imaginable & unbelievable (eg: some books proposed that the Black Dahlia serial killer was the \\"father of a known L.A. Police Officer\\",and this was stated in the other books... without showing many facts,other than a few photos that looked nothing like the Dahlia, etc...).However, by contrast, the facts in this Gilmore book are very well presented by the author.An easy book to read.As I said, it's the best one out there on the subject.PS: The photos in this Gilmore book are so shocking, so plz beware (gulp!)."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is THE book on the Black Dahlia. It was the first book to appear on this devastatingly horrble murder, and is an amazingly detailed account of the life of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short. Any other book or quasi-offering on this case falls short in comparison. Elizabeth Short's sojourn through various cities enroute to the bright lights of Hollywood, are so successfully depicted, the reader becomes a passenger on the Black Dahlia's journey to her ultimate end: not the blidning spotlights of fame, but the bleak darkness of violent death. A highly readable, excellent work by a superb, compelling author.Worth mentioning: in an editorial review it is stated that David Lynch has optioned this book for a movie. While David Lynch was involved in a development of this project based on Gilmore's book, Lynch no longer has an option on this work. I am in the entertainment business and know this for a fact. I'd love to see someone snatch this book right now and get it up on the big silver screen where Elizabeth Short so hungrily yearned to see herself reflected. SEVERED is THE bible for all interested in the Black Dahlia, in retro-Los Angeles, the days of hard-case detectives and the harsh reality of Hollywood's dark side (well-documented in another of Gilmore's books, LAID BARE: A Memoir of Wrecked Lives and the Hollywood Death Trip)."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"There is much more to this book than the excellent writing and amazing character study of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia. Not to mention the almost-photographic quality of the writing about the whole seedy world of World War II Hollywood, the detectives, the drifters and losers. Apart from these five-star attributes, there is an emotional impact, filled with pathos and pain. The story and highly original writing affords a window for this impact. When finished reading it, I hugged my children and saw that life was good. Only truly remarkable writers have this talent to take you into dark in order that you experience the bright goodness life has to offer. A great, terrifying, but remarkable book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I can't praise this book hightly enough. The more trash I see published on the Black Dahlia, the more I am drawn back to John Gilmore's book. In a most sensitive matter, that of Elizabeth Short's underdeveloped sexual genitals, Gilmore convincingly and with documented evidence, shatters the rumors of Elizabeth being a \\"streetwalker\\" or \\"girl of the night\\" or \\"prostitute,\\" as eagerly portrayed elsewhere with absolutely no documentation whatsoever! That Elizabeth Short suffered this handicap, an inability to have normal sexual relations while driven by strong, unending desires for love and intimacy, is a real tragedy in our culture that sets glamorous women (as Short was) on pedestals as objects of sex. Mr. Gilmore's highly controversial theme is certainly a paradox in our society. Through his extensive research and evidence-gathering, he has set upon our doorstep this \\"girl of the night\\" as a contradiction to our mindset with sex. Elizabeth Short emerges as a sad yet outwardly fun-loving girl, an innocent, plagued by her handicap, and in her loose-ends searching for love and happiness, she encounters an evil determined to extinguish her innocence. In relentless detail, Mr. Gilmore shows us how she suffered and endured such horrible pain. The graphic photos in this book attest to her suffering. She was even forced to swallow feces. Death must come as a relief, ending her pain--along with her innocence. But Mr. Gilmore has brought this young lady (only 22 when she was murdered), back to us in full, Glorious Black and White, and has made her an unforgettable part of our lives."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Without a doubt, this is a most dramatic and heart-rending story of an unfortunate girl's life and death in the time of the Second World War, and shortly thereafter. She drifts in a desperate attempt to find love in this shifting, unstable period of time, all the while knowing that she cannot return the love she seeks even if she finds it. Here is a beautiful, black-haired girl with pale white skin and lovely eyes, craving love and affection and sexual love, but is unable to ever open herself to the reality of these yearnings. She is severed from her family, from home, from love, from romance and intimacy, is lost in the shadows of post-war Hollywood, and is finally severed from life itself. Other books that have represented Elizabeth Short who becomes the Black Dahlia, as a prostitue and a whore are a sad disgrace in our society. Author John Gilmore shows the real Elizabeth Short, vivacious and fun-loving, but burdened with a dark secret that keeps her from fulfilling the dreams she chases. A great book!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I think that those who were critical of this book because it wasent exciting enough were unfair; after all, this isent a fictional novel, this is a &quot;just the facts&quot; account of the Black Dahlia case, along with a plausible theory about who the murderer may really have been. If you want crime drama with flair, read James Ellroy.If I have a complaint, it is this: I would like to have seen footnotes and documentation backing up the author's accounts and allegations.Aside from that, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"While I was grateful to finally find something well-reseached and lengthy about this famous case, the conclusions the author comes to regarding the identity of the killer don't hold water for me. Why can't someone just publish the facts of a famous unsolved crime without having to try to solve it? And why does the alleged culprit always conveniently die before he can be questioned or brought to trial? The comparisons Gilmore makes between the Dahlia case and the other one discussed in the book don't add up. In fact, the only similarity to me is that the victims were both murdered and the cases both unsolved. After that, it's all speculation and wild stretches of the imagination. To me, the case still remains a mystery. And that's the way I like it."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"To anyone who lived in Los Angeles in January 1947 the name The Black Dahlia brings back memories of one of the most brutal, bizarre and puzzling murders of the time.A cold, clear morning, a vacant lot and a paperboy taking a shortcut to pick up his papers. A flash of sun on a car windshield where no one should be caught his attention. For years afterward he would strain to see a face behind that windshield - to no avail.Elizabeth Short, a dark-haired beauty was to find fame in that vacant lot - a fame she so desperately desired in life, would find her in a cruel and brutal death.John Gilmore has written Severed to answer the question of who killed the Black Dahlia, the nickname given to Elizabeth Short by friends and acquaintances. The story provides the reader with an understanding of Elizabeth and traces her life until the moment she left the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on January 9, 1947. She would not be seen again until January 15th, across town, dumped in a cold, empty lot, surrounded by weeds and trash.Over the years the story of the Black Dahlia has intrigued crime buffs, historians, forensic experts and the police. No answer has ever been forthcoming to the question of who killed the Black Dahlia?In 1975 an excellent TV movie, Who is the Black Dahlia?, starring Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Lucie Arnaz brought the fate of Elizabeth Short home to millions of viewers. Done in a film noir style the movie traced Elizabeth to the door of the Biltmore Hotel and ended with the question of what happened after she walked out the door and up the Boulevard.Severed, takes the reader through the door, up the boulevard and into the mind of the man who murdered the beautiful Elizabeth Short. Extensive research brought John Gilmore to his conclusion and the evidence is strong. So is the case of the Black Dahlia closed? According to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, \\"The case cannot be officially closed due to . . .\\", well, I'll let you discover why in the pages of Severed.This is a book that will chill the heart of the most avid crime buff. It contains the most explicit photographs of the body of Elizabeth Short this writer has ever seen (and I've been a Dahlia follower for years). The story draws you through the life of a lonely, yet curiously obsessed young woman, as she seeks fame and fortune in a town not known for easily giving either.by Bob MooreThe Roving Editor"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I love true crime stories and this one has always fascinated me despite it's gruesomeness as it is still unsolved."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I enjoyed this book. I bought the Kindle version and I found it to be easier to get into the story than most books on the Dahlia I have read. He was very thorough with his investigation and was very clear with his timeline of events. There were things in the book that I hadn't read mentioned all together before and it made for a very clear whereabouts of her life and last few days. More time was devoted to Short's life before LA and that I enjoyed. Most books seem to be obsessed with just her last few days, but this book went back to the beginning and was very thorough. I would suggest this book for anyone interested in the life and case of the famous Black Dahlia murder."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Sensational book! Sensational writer! The first and only offering on the Black Dahlia that gives us her life, her desires, her fears, her search for recognition and a life to fulfill her. Poor Elizabeth Short. Poor Black Dahlia. She would have dissolved into forgotten cold case files if not for John Gilmore's obsessing over her since a preteen boy when he met her in his gradmother's living room (her sister named Short). In the Australian magazine, FIEND, Gilmore is interviewed and also an online, detailed interview with him in a letter form by the same publication, wherein he divulges the \\"torch\\" he carries for the mysterious beauty so savagely murdered not long after his memorable meeting with her.I have read other offerings on the Black Dahlia case (painful, I might add, as they all suck) since Gilmore's book appeared, the first-ever true book on the case; the absolute end in itself. Indeed Gilmore has put his \\"lost love\\" on the map of recognition forever in an outstanding book that reflects the heart of our American culture and the fascination/obsession with mystery, noir, sex and murder."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I met Mr. Gilmore recently and have had the opportunity to discuss this book with him. I am a professional reporter (with a degree in theatre) and was quite impressed by Mr. Gilmore's reporting skills and writing style. He is the son of the detective who investigated the Black Dahlia case and he has a knack for extracting the truth out of his subjects. This is the definitive book of the Black Dahlia murder, all other books are of secondary interest."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is probably the most complete account of the Black Dahlia, and the search for her killer. Author Gilmore claims to have found the killer, and explains his meetings with him before his mysterious death. This book details Elizabeth Shorts backgound from growing up in Massachusetts, migrating to L.A. and falling for servicemen while mingling in the Hollywood nightlife scene to ending up split in half on a sidewalk at 39th and Norton. John Gilmore really put a lot of effort into finding every little detail about the Dahlia, suspected killers, the dump site, police reports, media frenzy etc, etc. Really a masterpiece of true crime investigation."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book fills the gap between the pedantic handling of some true case books, and the flowery, wordy extravagances of someone like James Ellroy. What is created is a new kind of writing and the experience of having actually lived the story. Not sure how John Gilmore does it. There is an indirectness where you experience things through someone else's eyes, as it were, and their emotions. I've never read a book that is able to set these important qualities of writing as easily as if you are being dealt a hand of cards. A literary achievement that will without any doubt live long and deep in the readers memory bank. A fascinating account by a fine writer."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore takes his subject into places few writers are able to get to. He turns the characters inside out, and finds in even the most incidental character some intrinsic, emotional connection. Here is a writer who does not push his characters about as though made of cardboard. Gilmore deals with flesh and blood, and a reality beyond crime writing that becomes evocative literature. A must-read for every serious student of human nature."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have read this book four times and each time it's like I'm reading it for the first time. I am drawn more and more into the world that John Gilmore has created, and into the people he writes about. This is an absolutely stunning story. It is just filled with a hundred different jolts. It is safe to say this is a &quot;literary experience&quot; more than just an exciting read. I don't think these word-pictures the author has revealed in this book will ever leave me. Its like I have somehow experienced all of this myself--personally. That can be SCARY!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"My first reaction to this book was to feel like a fly getting into a spider's web. The first sentence of the text of the book:&quot;Smudge pots burned for the first night that winter to keep the frost from killing the citrus.&quot;I'm retired and grew up in southern California (in the Valley!). Bang! This John Gilmore had me. That simple sentence took me back home and I smelled the air and the fruit. I could see the dark, and feel frost in the air, and remember how wet the dew got. I remember some of my mother's flowers being damaged, and she was crying.And then the next sentence and I was hooked on this book. I read the it from cover to cover without stopping. I'm buying more and giving them to friends who grew up in Los Angeles County during and after the Second World War. I have not enjoyed a book as much in a long time. Wish there were more like this and less dumb television programs."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Overall, the book is well written, well researched, haunting and unsettling. The author has uncovered many important and up until now, unknown facts about the elusive Dahlia. However, Gilmore's proposed \\"solution\\" to the case strains credulity. The idea that Jack Anderson Wilson, (Gilmore's suspect), a spacy drifter, destitute for most of his life, committed this particular crime, seems unlikely.For one thing, Wilson apparently had no medical knowledge or training, which the killer seems to have had. At any rate, this killer was organized and successful enough in his life to own a car (much less common back then) and to have a private place to take the victim. Also, Jack Wilson's \\"confession\\" seems incomplete--it omits many important facts about the crime that Gilmore himself uncovered. I feel like Gilmore wanted some kind of closure for the book and just fastened onto this unlikely suspect."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book starts out well, with a thorough (even exacting) description of the finding of Short's body and the subsequent arrival at the scene of the authorities and the press, but then the narrative becomes bogged down in pointless details that have little or no bearing on the case -- and worse, are factually debatable. For instance, there are several passages included that quote the victim directly when no corroboration of those statements is possible. Meanwhile, the writing itelf, particularly as it goes over the last few years of Short's life, is uninspired, and there are questions Gilmore inexplicably leaves hanging in the air, even though he obviously has investigated them. For example, if there was more circumstantial evidence tying Wilson to another death than to Short's, why was he not prodded to incriminate himself concerning it instead? Also, where are the details concerning the police investigation into Wilson's statements? Was a serious effort ever made to locate him before his death? The issue seems to be dealt with in an evasive manner. There is a brief biography about Short early in the book that is worth noting, but it appears to mix facts and rumors without bothering to indicate which is which. Finally, there are several needlessly sexualized passages (the accuracy of which, again, can't be confirmed), and explicit photos at the back whose contents the book has previously described in detail, and so appear to be included merely for some sort of sadistic shock value. As to Gilmore's conclusion that Wilson was the killer, it is based primarily on stories told to him and fails to take into account (or at least mention) that information leaked to the public over the years by the police, a Wilson-type personality could very well have assimiliated to suit his own purposes (in this case, monetary)."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I was particularly intrigued by this book because I grew up in the same town where Elizabeth lived and read all about it in our local papers. It's too bad that it was never solved but the book holds one's attention throughout despite the gruesome details so vividly described by John Gilmore. He probably was the best one to write about this murder because his father was on the LAPD at the time. If you're interested in sensational unsolved murders this book should fit the bill."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"At last I have had the opportunity to of discovereing who the Black Dahlia really was. Nothing else I have ever read comes close to the revelations contained in book, about the young woman, Elizabeth Short, known in Hollywood circles as the Black Dahila. This beautiful young woman suffered the most horrible death imaginable. Apart from this being one of the most horrendous and mysterious crimes in the history of Los Angeles (and certainly in the annals of modern crime), John Gilmore's book has opened for me the world of Elizabeth Short, young, exciting, yet strange and diffident. I cannot imagine another account that approaches as clear an understanding of the Black Dahlia, or of her tormented, secretive existance, her dreams, her desires, the yearning for fame that alwasy sadly slipped out of her reach. A fine, excellent book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is a book that will haunt you long after you've read it. Like some people are haunted after researching accounts of the Holocaust, genocide or other abominable acts, the Black Dahlia murder represents an individual act of atrocity so fierce that it shakes the soul. Indeed, the soul is left staggering around in a state of shock trying to comprehend how such wanton cruelty could be committed on one human being by another. Gilmore's writing is sublime."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"A lot of great research went into this and it shows, but I was really frusterated with the lack of specific dates and support for the facts; i.e. no footnotes, no bibliography of sources (publicly accessible or not, it would still be helpful to know where the info came from!) The author traces Beth Short's final journeys in great detail, but it is hard to tell exactly when they take place. Likewise when the informant (Gilmore) enters the investigation. Its hard to tell if it is 5 or 35 years after the murder! The author leaves many questions unanswered - like were the fingerprints from the Bauerdorf murder ever compared to the prints of final suspect Wilson? Aside from all that, it is startlingly disturbing and believeable, and if you already know the timeline, the lack of dates might not bother you. The suggestion of why that particular intersection was chosen to dump the body is so creepy - look it up on mapquest and get chills! :o"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I can't believe there is a new edition in the works, I'm first in line to pick it up! I must say, some people just can't let petty envy go...so sad! I have read the old news articles on the case (hours and hours over the years in the periodical room at the L.A. library-yes that building does exist even though it's been moved!) and they are 75% tabloid 25% truth. You need to remember back in the old days they could use the word \\"jap\\" and get away with it, as well as stir up the whole \\"zootsuit riot\\" fiasco among other injustices. Trust me, as a reader of everything Beth Short for the past 16 years, Severed is very good. It is the only book that gives you the sense of who Ms. Short was. Close second is Childhood Shadows by Mary Pacios. Well I hope I spelled every name right or I may be accused of not really reading the book or writing this review."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have to agree that the first half of the book is very thorough and well done. But from the point of the murder forward, things just fall apart. There seems to be no logic in the presentation of the case. For example, he reproduces large segments of the autopsy reports for both the victim and the suspect without pointing out the significance of anything. He seems to spend an inordinate amount of time proving facts that have little or no significance whatsoever. I was disappointed that he failed to introduce any psychological forensics to support his case. And he produces little or no concrete evidence to support either his thesis for the murderer or the linkage between both murders. I wish he could have been as thorough in the second half of the book as he was in the first."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I'm going to have to disagree with many reviewers here in that I didn't like Severed that much. Why? Because I dislike books about unsolved murders in which the author \\"endorses\\" their own chosen suspect as the truly guilty offender(like 90% of the Jack The Ripper books published). The evidence John Gilmore presents did not sway me at all and I can't imagine how so many adults can be so easily manipulated and believe it as Gospel.The author claims he was there when the \\"killer\\" made a full confession (him and about fifty other \\"killers\\"), but conveniently died in a fire right after(hmmmmm...). Gilmore also tries to link Short's murder with another girl's though the MOs were completely different (the first girl was found in her own bathtub clothed and unmutilated; Short was nude, beaten, horridly overkilled, and wasn't at the scene of her crime). Forensic evidence? WHAT forensic evidence?? The entire theory is circumstantial, and was I the only one who noticed that the disgusting contents in Short's stomach was never explained away by the author or the \\"killer\\" like so much else (assuming that it's the truth).I'm sorry, but I'm not a person who believes whatever's sworn to me, and I just don't buy this unmasking of the killer as %100 truth. Now there's a chance it could be fact, but that's a very huge MAYBE, which requires an even huger leap of faith.Other than the author's personal theory being shoved down my throat during the second 1/2 I thought the book was well-written and well-presented, particularly the 1st part(where the book probably should've ended). And I'm more inclined to believe that Gilmore did conduct interviews with the detectives and acquaintaces of Beth because it's feasible. With the provided details Beth becomes a real, three-dimensional person in the book, not just a past-tense sum of living and post mortem photos. For this, I commend Gilmore.There has never been an impartial, comprehensive nonfiction book dedicated to this case and that's a shame. To think that Hollywood Babylon II remains the superior overall account, that's a tragedy!!!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"In a recent New York Times feature that discuses the Black Dahlia, John Gilmore and SEVERED (as \\"the first full nonfiction book about the Dahlia\\"), Brian De Palma, the diretor of a fictional movie based on the Black Dahlia case, says about the movie, \\"It is not the story of Elizabeth. It's about characters who are impacted and obsessed with that happened to her.\\" All fiction. In fact, the fictional Elizabeth Short appeares only briefly in the film.This book, SEVERED, is about Elizabeth Short. The Black Dahlia.In SEVERED, the doomed Elizabeth Short has all the seductive innocence of Twin Peaks Laura Palmer, and all the allure of the little girl lost who meets up with Jack the Ripper in Pandora's Box. The Black Dahlia, as Elizabeth Short becomes known, is the original Goth girl, Marilyn Monroe's dark counterpart. Wearing extravagant and geisha-like funeral makeup and black, skin-tight dresses with high slits, all decoration to conceal a tortured soul, Elizabeth's exaggerated persona makes her a femme fatal and ultimately an indelible symbol of Holltwood's dark side. The world of SEVERED is a Raymond Chanler L.A., full of glamour and violence, a milieu of dualities populated by grifters, sinister fly-by-night producers, catty B-girls, drunken sailors and desperate movie extras. These wayward characters ride the dark carnival-a landscape of glitzy nightclubs, seedy back street bars, Chinatown dives, cheap dance halls and all-night diners. Sexuality oozes in this world existing under the shadow of Hollywood's dream factory, swinging to the beat of Bing Crosby, the Andrews Sisters, and Moonlight Serenade. Elizabeth Short drifts through this life with a mysterious charisma, a stunning, raven-haired beauty, igniting lust in almost every man she encounters in her search for love, wartmth, and closeness. But the harsh underlying reality is that Elizabeth Short is running on empty, carrying a dark secret that dictates her every move and leads her to become the quintessential dreamer, yearing for a life she can never obtain. Each step on her trip down the yellow brick road is plagued by cruel circumstances that ensure her failure and an empty pot at her rainbow's end.SEVERED is more than a true crime classic. This is nouveau literature by one of today's most controversial writers. As such, apparently as long as Mr. Gilmore pushes the buttons of the middle-minded or those frantic for recognition, he will never want for sour-grape detractors, those of lesser abilities who find throwing rocks easier than building a castle. That is what Gilmore's work is about-building castles on enduring foundations. Following a reading by John Gilmore in Hollywood, I was able to chat with him about the rock-throwers and nay-sayers frequently cropping up, the curse of those who march to the beat of their own drums. One such nay-sayer is making claims of having written SEVERED with Mr. Gilmore, brainwashed by him, and of course uncredited and unacknowledged. However, cold facts are simple and undeniable: John Gilmore is the sole and exclusive author of SEVERED. An author's note in previous editions generously thanks one for some \\"childhood material\\" regarding Elizabeth Short. This person next went on to write their own book about the Black Dahlia, ridiculously blaming the famed Orson Wells for killing Elizabeth Short!Undocumented facts show Mr. Gilmore risking his neck, finances, and two marriages devoting decades to an indepth search for the real Elizabeth Short, the gorgeous 22-year old young woman he spent thirty-minutes talking to when he was 11 years old. He told me, \\"I've never forgotten her for a second. She had mesmerized me by her very presence and after her violent death, she was a hauntress of my nights, a human-shaped haze floating in my dreams. I wanted to know everything I could about her and it took me a lot longer than I'd ever imagined.\\"And readers, here she is, Elizabeth Short, alive and breathing between the covers of this remarkable book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Not counting the few disgruntled would-be writers green with envy, everything great has been said about this book, and there seems to be little left to say except buy it and read it and you will no doubt remember it as long as you live. Five stars for Gilmore's Black Dahlia!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book gave me exactly what I wanted: about 100 pages on Elizabeth Short herself- what little there is to know about her and her movements. That is what has really intrigued me about this story. So I am a gratified customer, because Gilmore painstakingly relates every detail he can rustle up on her disheartening, gypsy existence....the second half of the book seems to cover his pet theory about who the murderer was. My problem with the second half of the book is that he gives ABSOLUTELY NO DATES!!! He never tells you what year he is talking about. Whereas I knew exactly where Elizabeth was for the first 100 pages- the month, the year, etc.- he got so sloppy in the second half that I didn't know whether the events he was discussing happened in the 60's, 70's or 80's. I found myself trying to work it out with clues. For example, he mentions that someone was an employee of Robert Kennedy. So at that point I knew, at least, that the event he was discussing happened before 1969. It was exasperating. But what the second half lacked in details and important information, the first half more than made up for. A good read."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Do some reviewers actually read the books they shoot down? Or are their comments the result of sour grapes and rotten apples? Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia by John Gilmore is already an American classic. Unsentimental true crime and dedicated opersonal investigation. The first book to arrive on the scene telling the factual story. No doubt will outlive the others. I first bought the book in '94 and I have followed its success for a dozen years. I have read it seven times. Gilmore offers the only relatively clear picture of the young woman that was known as the Black Dahlia, and his book is a success in all aspects. The most haunting and troubling to date. Perhaps some are so troubled by the real heart-wrenching side of this story they feel impelled to back away from it fast. So they shoot it down as a mirror of their own fears and nightmares. I for one can only offer my long-overdue praise for a job well done. A monumental story of human tragedy. My heart bleeds for Elizabeth Short. A book I guarantee you will never forget!The photographs are beyond belief."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The classic account is John Gilmore's \\"Severed,\\" which achieves the almost impossible feat of turning the very blankness of Elizabeth Short's brief life into a thing of riveting oddity. According to Gilmore, Short had a rare vaginal deformity that made the image of a sexually easy creature of the night nothing more than an image; if we accept this premise, the Dahlia story becomes the dark tale of a hapless mimic whose grasp of adult relations extended only to what they looked like in the movies. There's no reason not to credit Gilmore's fastidious account, in which one drifter kills another, then dies in a flea-pit hotel fire: This cruddy, despressing solution to the mystery is utterly consistent with the pathos of the world the Black Dahlia travelved through on her way to the big nowhere.(Gary Indiana; May 25, 2003)"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The story of the girl nicknamed the BLACK DAHLIA is one of the most haunting and disturbing books I have ever read. There is no fluff here, no glitter; no so-called 'entertainment'. This is HARD ART. Author John Gilmore, (he wrote another brilliant but hard to swallow book entitled COLD-BLOODED), has created a shocking picture of a shadow-world in postwar Hollywood, and he has done so without compromise. In my opinion, this is what great writing is about: how the readers is hooked in emotionally and psychologically, caught in this undertow the writer creates apart from the text. Reading SEVERED is like listening to dark, strange music. It's easily understandable how this author upsets many, because he aims directly at the chinks in social armor and in some he draws out the uncomfortable aspects of the self. I have read John Gilmore's book on Charles Manson, and Manson is described at being able to &quot;get at fear&quot; in people. Gilmore obviously does the same thing. No wonder he connected so tightly with Charles Manson, and with James Dean, and Janis Jopin, and etc., etc. This is the dark arena. The pictures Gilmore paints with words are like the photographs of Diane Arbus and Joel Peter Witkin (try Gilmore's FETISH BLONDE and LAID BARE. See if I'm right). Murder victim Elizabeth Short, in Gilmore's evocative prose, rises out of the grave and into the readers mind like a dark Madonna; we experience almost everything she is, her pains, her struggle, her sorrow, and we experience her brutal, strange murder almost blow for blow. Some things about this girl no one can apparently ever understand, but Gilmore gives us all we need to know. Guaranteed to give you nightmares. So step right up. Guaranteed to draw you into a dark world where fear and horror cracks the whip. This is much more than reportage. More than true-crime journalism. This is literature with a sign on the door that says ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I really enjoyed the way this book was written as it had a pulp kind of feel. I had no reason not to believe the author until I started reading other accounts of the crime stating cops and sources for the book didn't exist, the under developed genitalia was false and so on. Now I'm not sure what is true and what isn't about the case. That and the fact I don't buy Gilmore's suspect do not diminish my enjoyment of the book, just made me a bit more skeptical."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Although Gilmore's suspect Wilson is very believable, especially his state of mind in the \\"missing\\" tapes, and what you would expect to be the criminal psychopathology behind this kind of depraved crime, there are too many holes in his theory. E.g., Wilson had no car to move the body, and there is conveniently no mention of whether Wilson's fingerprints were ever compared with those from the related Bauerdorf murder lightbulb. And the device at the end (a new narrative voice, a hypothetical journalist interviewing Wilson) doesn't work once you find out (possible only from other sources, e.g., crime websites) that it was the author himself who (claimed to have?) conducted the interviews. There was no reason for this confusing voice-change device, which amounts only to another fictional layer behind which Gilmore can hide. I want either all truth or admitted fiction: this mixes both in a confusing and unsuccessful way."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"A fantastic read! All the other books about the mysterious Black Dahlia fade beside John Gilmore's SEVERED. I read the Granta edition in London last year, and recently finished the US edition. I am reading it again. The story, the superb writing, the strange tale draws you in. A post-War time in Los Angeles comes to life and it is gritty and dirty, the people are driven by dog-eat-dog agendas. The Black Dahlia is totally captivating. I feel like I know her, like she is real and I'm enamored with her. I can reach out and touch her. I've got author Gilmore to thank or curse for that! The gangsters, sexpots, soldiers and sailors, the lonely hearts and killers are here. Also a handful of ordinary people like myself, caught by the charms or spells of the Black Dahlia as she steps from the darkness into your life. This has to be a movie!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is an incredible book. Gilmore pays very close attention to detail. The author takes the reader through Elizabeth Short's life, as well as her death. This book was perfect in every sense of the word. The only thing the reader was left yearning for was an arrest!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"SEVERED is by far the only credible text on the infamous Black Dahlia; the first nonfiction, true crime account to have been written on this horrible murder, this book stands light years ahead of anything that has appeared since the publication of John Gilmore's book. Gilmore is, without doubt, still the Prince of Darkness at exploring the shadow-world of our culture. This book is without equal, and others cobbled together on the Black Dahlia subject jumped on the bandwagon, smelling the blood of Elizabeth Short, to cash in on the trail blazed by Gilmore. This work has created an icon in Elizabeth Short, and as they once said about Ernest Hemingway, \\"now the jackals come to gorge on the feast\\". I have never read a book that opens the Postwar world of Los Angeles as does SEVERED. Gilmore puts the reader in the smokey cafes, the bars, stinking of booze and sweat; in the night clubs and dingy hotel rooms, and on the electric streetcars that long ago ceased to exist. In reading SEVERED, my senses were opened wide and I was caught up in the shadow-world Gilmore revealed. Then came the murder: a painful experience to read it because the author had made me so vulnerable and drew me right in. He snuck up on me, and then struck me with the full impact. I shudder recalling that moment.I recommend this book as a masterpiece of true crime literature, and most surely a guide book for all seeking to touch upon those lost yesterdays in the \\"city of angels,\\" the subject of so many noir movies and dark novels. But the subject in SEVERED is real life, intriguing and frightening. The \\"Prince of Darkness\\" takes us through a lost world I shall never forget. I feel as though this strange girl, Elizabeth Short, the notorious Black Dahlia, stepped into my life and I now carry her with me wherever I go. There is something so powerful yet subtle about this book that it simply, as they say, \\"gets under your skin.\\""},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I finished Severed in about a day and found it very engaging. The writing style was smooth without being too literate and ponderous. The factual information regarding Beth Short's perambulations and cross country travels were well researched, especially considering it all happened in the 40's. As a matter of fact I found it interesting that so much of her whereabouts were known since she seemed to get around so much. The facts regarding the nature of the crime and subsequent investigation were also well documented. I thought the crime and autopsy photos enhanced rather than detracted from the story. A picture says a thousand words and that certainly applies in this case. (Note-the pics are extremely graphic and not for the squeamish) I agree with other reviewers that more of a timeline could've been developed with specific dates laid down, assuming these were known. Like most true crime writers documenting a case in which the killer is unknown, Gilmore feels it necessary to provide his own idea of the killer. In this book he provides us with a shady character named Wilson, aka Smith who Gilmore meets along with some other unsavory individuals in an apartment. Why or how Gilmore is there in the first place is not clear but apparently Wilson starts discussing the Dahlia case and Gilmore, acting as an informant over an undisclosed period of time, records Wilson on tape providing details of Short's murder as told to him, Wilson, by some other figure named Morrison who is then the assumed murderer. A bit confusing but the written transcript of the taped recordings is in the book. Is Wilson the Black Dahlia killer? Who knows, but I found one bit of interesting piece of info not in the book. In the book Gilmore describes how Wilson showed him a photo of Short and Wilson together, thereby at least establishing a link between the two people. However, at the Black Dahlia website Gilmore mentions that a photo Wilson showed him is of a naked girl whose face had been cut out of the picture and Gilmore assumes is Short. How can he be so sure it's her, and is this the photo that is supposed to link Short and Wilson together. Most likely the murderer of Beth Short will never be known just like who the real identity of Jack the Ripper is. Still, as an historical account of Beth Short's life/death and the followup investigation, this book tells the unvarnished true story."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore provides the essential text on the Black Dahlia murder mystery with his true-crime classic \\"Severed.\\" The book is a fascinating read on many, many levels. Gilmore's painstaking research and involvement in the case lead one to believe that had he been an investigator in the case, when it had happened, he would have actually solved it, and history would have been changed. While the Black Dahlia's (who was known to her folks as Elizabeth Short) brutal murder is somehow \\"solved\\" every time someone writes a book on the case, Gilmore offers the most satisfying, believable solution.Gilmore has a knack for writing this type of stuff, and excellently covered the Manson Family in \\"The Garbage People,\\" but as I mentioned, it is with noir-ish stories such as Ms. Short's sad tale that Gilmore excels in presenting. Although this is a true story, on some levels and in some parts, it reads like a gritty film noir script or a dime-novel detective story. The people and places of post-WW2 Los Angeles jump out at the reader, and you can almost get the feeling that Elizabeth Short was someone you once knew or had seen around at some point. As most historians know (especially those who specialize in journalistic history) Elizabeth's murder was one of the first of such events to grip the entire nation, due to the sheer brutality and carnal nature of the crime, but the sensational aspects were primarily a creation of the Hearst sensationalism machine of the day. Gilmore does an excellent job in presenting to the reader who Elizabeth actually was, and debunks several of the myths behind her. There were two Elizabeth Shorts, after all, as the reader will come to understand--there was the innocent girl from Massachusetts with dreams of succeeding in Hollywood, and there was also the \\"Black Dahlia,\\" which was in fact a nickname Elizabeth was known by, but was blown out of proportion by the press.I'd recommend this book to anyone, not only to students of true crime, but to anyone who enjoys a good read. It is a sad story, but Gilmore does an excellent job in presenting it in a factual manner. And for those who are interested in finding a book about this case, choose this over Steve Hodel's \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" any day."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Before this book, I knew next to nothing of the Black Dahlia case. Thanks to this book I am more informed BUT I can't help but feel really disappointed. The writing was pretty mediocre plus the book feels disorganized and vague. For instance, the author give no sense of time. When the book ends I assumed that roughly 20 years had been covered, when in fact 40 had. Some interesting info but muddled and confusing."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore's &quot;Severed&quot; provides readers with an enjoyable read, but you wonder, it it fiction of non-fiction? One can not deny the book is a pleasure to read. For serious students of history and those actively researching the death of Elizabeth Short, it is seriously flawed. Even the most fundamental research reveals numerous errors in the book. Gilmore does nothing to support his findings. No footnotes, no bibliography, nothing to allow the reader to confirm his conclusions. Gilmore expects the reader to accept his words as gospel, no proof needed. Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"SEVERED is one of the best, darkest, and most thoroughly engaging books written the past decade, and no doubt will remain a hallmark as one of the most evocative books ever written. The RAVES for this book so far out-weigh the boos that it is pitiful, but even the dregs can have their day on Amazon. Sunday, May 8th, I attended a reading in Los Angeless for the book, Van Gogh's Ear, at which John Gilmore was reading. I had a chance to ask Mr. Gilmore about the cricits who are angry that he doesn't supply all the names, footnotes and etc., in his works. He laughed. He said, \\"Let them do their own digging, if they can ever get their duffs out of the chair.\\" I am sure his laughing at those critics only infuriates them to the point where they almost slander Mr. Gilmore. But he doesn't care. Marilyn Manson is quoted as saying, \\"SEVERED is my favorite book and John Gilmore is my favorite writer...\\" With fans of Marilyn Manson (a number of them at the reading) and David Lynch behind him, I don't think Mr. Gilmore is concerned with the whining of a handful of disgunted, sideline sour grapes. Reading SEVERED again is like retracing steps through a nightmare world and going deeper each time you read it. I CAN'T WAIT to see the movie made from SEVERED! I understand it will be the REAL story of Elizabeth Short--not another Hollywood drummed-up cops and robbers and Ellroy hype."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The Black Dahlia case is a truly haunting one. The book does a good job of letting you kow the facts of the murder of Elizabeth Short, but unfortunately is very disorganized and confusing. The narrative jumps back and forth in time and makes illogical connections (such as attemping to prove that the Black Dahlia murder and another murder of a socialite are connected because the Dahlia was most likely dismembered in a bathtub and the socialite was found in a bathtub).

These books pose as true crime works but read like fictions (nowhere near as good as James Ellroy's tale). Concocting whodunnit theories and silly conspiracies, these works are obvious contrivances for entertainment sales and \\"best-seller\\" status, quite unrelated to the actual real subject, which is, afterall, the Black Dahlia herself...Elizabeth Short, 22 years of age when murdered, an astonishing beauty who suffered a rare genital deformity.

I'd been reading about Elizabeth Short for years, and any book that offered a viable suspect was of real interest. However, it would have to be backed up by meticulous research. Gilmore hands this to the reader IN SPADES. The book is not simply a the story of Beth's death- it's the story of her LIFE. Though he carefully covers the murder and what transpired thereafter- some of the most fascinating material for me personally, was the in-depth information about her early life and \\"adventures\\".

I have heard a new edition is in the works, with material never-before-published in these earlier editions.This book has topped the cult status charts and is read around the world. It is a direct, bold, no-holds exploration into the mysterious personality of the beautiful Elizabeth Short, AKA the Black Dahlia, and her grotesque, heartless murder in post-War Los Angeles at the age of 23. She desperately wanted Hollywood fame, on radio, in the movies, but poor, pretty Beth Short did not achieve that fame in life. However, because of John Gilmore's long-standing obsession with this mysterious, glamorous girl, from a chance meeting with her when he was 11 years of age, the Black Dahlia has posthumously attained the indelible rank of international star.This is a brilliant book, a searchlight penetrating a dark world of nightmare and shocking revelation."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"A hard-hitting, thoroughly engrossing book by a powerful writer.

You will note over the past few years that a couple of armchair revierws (as is encourged) attempt to discredit this book. One in particular has sent previous reviews, usually full of errors, attempting to dismiss SEVERED. This particular reviewer was on a TV show attempting to present his own \\"case\\" on the Black Dahlia. With no takers for his absurd theory, consequently he tries to discredit the first and most successful true-crime book on the Black Dahlia case. How to keep them in the woodwork? Experience true-crime at its very best and most engaging: John Gilmore's SEVERED. A remarkable work that outshines all the rest. As Gilmore is a most controversial writer, there will always be some rotten tomatoes tossed about. To be expected and dismissed. Gilmore's book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"One of the finest, real-life true crime books I have ever read. I am fascinated with the Black Dahlia case, and this book is the only one that is believable, credible, and an exciting read. John Gilmore is an incredible author; his writing about L.A. in the 1940's transports the reader into a different era, like getting into a time machine. Some readers may be shocked by the explicit crime and morgue photographs, but these graphically illustrate the misconceptions that pass as truth about the manner in which lovely Elizabeth Short met her death. I recommend this for all true crime readers and those interested in sensational, investigative journalism."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"The inside story, the result of John Gilmore's arduous and incredible task of uncovering so much information and behind-the-scenes interviews. A near-impossible feat to have unearthed this amount of data about a person such as the young and beautiful Elizabeth Short, who lived such a mysterious and secretive existance. All the other armchair efforts fail where this book succeeds. Only someone with deep roots into the L.A. history and street scene, like Gilmore, could offer such a remarkable, indepth tale. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Without a doubt, this book simmers on the surface in the caldron of modern classics. The story is bizarre, historically fascinating, shocking, troubling. At the same time author John Gilmore rushes the reader on a rollercoaster of sights, smells and tastes; things become alive under our scrutiny. Death and violent murder get a stranglehold on us! Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, moves through this tale as an untouchable Princess of the Night. After reading Gilmore's book, I now dream about her! Destined to never rise above her pitiful plight, the lovely creature is fingered by fate to fail in life and die a spectacular death, thus launching her into stardom (for all time), somewhere on the other side of the big movie screen of darkness. The way Gilmore handles this is what makes the read so superb, so chillingly unforgettable. He is a genius at peeling stark images and drilling these into the readers heads like a mad dentist. This book is way out on its own special crest (as are Gilmore's other books like LAID BARE and LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG, and his work on Charles Manson), surfing a most unique wave indeed. He is creating American NEO NOIR. Recommend this book? It's an absolute necessity!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Just finished reading SEVERED by John Gilmore. This is a terrific book, a harrowing read from start to finish. Caught the cover piece in the Los Angeles Times (Sunday May 25) in which SEVERED is described as a \\"classic account\\" and that sums it up neatly. Anything else about the Black Dahlia is secondary or misc., in comparison. At times SEVERED is so horrific the reader wants to look away, as though you're witnessing a horror act itself. This is not at all like what other true crime accounts do, and the impact in this book is stunning. I agree with one early reviewer who says if some of the readers are put off by John Gilmore's hard-edged, dark, dark style, it is because they are afraid (hence guarded) against the inroads this work can make into ones psyche. Also, nowhere in the book does Gilmore claim that the \\"suspect\\" made a \\"full confession\\" to the crime(s). The would-be suspect who died in a fire at the Holland Hotel on 7th Street never made a direct confession; instead he claimed someone else told him the about the brutal murder. Gilmore NEVER states that he had SOLVED the crime. Too many readers are saturated with paste-up, hack-writing \\"true crime\\" that passes as \\"entertainment.\\" Such offerings fail miserably to engage one on a level of depth, and these readers are blocked to the emotional impact such as book as SEVERED delivers. And without any doubt, it DELIVERS. This is a must read on almost all levels of literature. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Probably the best book written about this famous murder case. Elizabeth Short's life and tragic end are examined closely by the author, and he uses forensic evidence, along with the police reports, to come up with a compelling analysis of the case, and a solution to what may be one of the most famous murders of the 20th Century. Warning: not for the squeamish!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I found Mr.Gilmore's book to be the most complete story of &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; I've ever read to date. He uses fact rather than rumor to paint a full picture of Elizabeth Short without judgement or bias. He gives us answers to questions unanswere for over 50 years and reveals facts long hidden from the public. Mr. Gilmore takes us back in time to a dark and mysterious place where Beth Short and her alleged murderer lived. A place Beth spent her desperate last days that would eventually lead her to the man who would make her dreams of fame come true. Unfortunately, she would pay a nightmare price for it. John Gilmore's SEVERED is a must read for anyone interested in true crime, good writing, and truth about a young lady we really knew nothing about."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I watched the TLC show CASE REOPENED on the Black Dahlia which featured John Gilmore's book, SEVERED. After reading this book, I assert this is the most outstanding book published in many years. This is a breathtaking account and is excellent literature. Gilmore does not compromise his subject in any way, and the reader is left with the feeling of having lived each and ever frightening moment of this most important contribution to crime writing. This book is recommended most highly."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have just finished reading a review in MAXIMUM ROCK N ROLL about John Gilmore's book, LAID BARE: A Memoir of Wrecked Lives and the Hollywood Death Trip. &quot;John Gilmore is one the best nonfiction writers of our time--&quot; the review states.After reading SEVERED, I must agree. The story of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, is one of the most penetrating accounts I have read about a young woman's confusing and at times tortured search for her place in the sun, which results in her brutal murder. Equally as penetrating is the author's detailed portrait of the murderer. There is a quality to this book that manages to elevate the tale into a mirror image of our times. Though most of the story is set in the 1940's, the history of the investigation brings the account into the recent present. The emotional impact of Gilmore's writing can be most disturbing at moments,causing a heart-sickness I can't describe. This is an unforgettable work which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore would make a good fiction writer. He recreated a Hollywood of long ago as I remember it, but all his &quot;conversations&quot; with John St John and the killer involved no witnesses. The tapes he recorded could have been made of anyone. The snapshot and keepsakes all burned. Only Gilmore &quot;saw&quot; them. Only Gilmore survives to say he met Elizabeth Short. (and James Dean, for that matter). For a young women who was a loner, why would she seek the Gilmores as distant relations? Although Pamela Hazelton is in denial, John Gilmore has created fiction that is tempting to believe. The &quot;informant&quot; has misinformed the reader."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Gilmore, whose father was an LAPD cop at the time of Elizabeth Short's murder, delves deeply into one of Hollywood's most celebrated murder cases. His true-crime procedual unfurls like a hardboiled film noir and plays the victim's femme fatale persona to the hilt. Nicknamed &quot;the Black Dahlia&quot; by fellow barflies taken with her jet-black hair, black dresses and exotic looks, small-town Massachusetts beauty queen Short went to Hollywood seeking stardom. In 1947, she was brutally murdered at age 22, her naked, mutilated body found hacked in two in a vacant lot. Gilmore presents evidence that strengthens the LAPD's case against chief suspect Jack Wilson, a reclusive, alcoholic burglar and possible serial killer. In an afterword, Gilmore describes his early 1980's interview with Wilson, who divulged details of the crime that only the killer could have known. Wilson, who died in a hotel fire just days before his pending arrest, also made what could be an indirect admission of his involvement in the murder of promiscuous Hollywood socialite Georgette Bauerdorf months before the Short slaying. That case, charges Gilmore, was hushed up by the LAPD and the media under pressure from William Randolph Hearst, who was a friend of Bauerdorf's father. Gilmore's book has all the elements of a gritty movie: a sexual psychopath; a dedicated police detective pursuing the killer for decaades; Short's reported anatomic anomaly, underdeveloped sex organs, which may have prevented her from having intercourse. It's no wonder that SEVERED has been optioned for film by David Lynch.32 pages of photos."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"SEVERED is a controversial book; the first true crime book ever published on Hollywood's Black Dahlia murder case. To be expected, others have jumped on Gilmore's unique bandwagon, offering their own renditions, concoctions and theories on this still-officially unsolved murder, one of the most notorious in L.A.'s history. Gilmore's SEVERED, a most mysterious book, will be read and re-read for years to come and will surely stand as one of the most ingenious offerings in crime reportage of this century.I first read this book last year, and have just obtained an advance copy of the most recent printing to discover an amazing series of previously unpublished photographs of the victim (Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia. Taken at the L.A. County Morgue in 1947, these new photos explicitly detail the atrocities to the Black Dahlia's body. One, a full length nude study, depicts the bizarre knife cuts to her pubic area. These new photos are gruesome, shocking, and heart rending, and should throughly whet the more prurient appetites. Though, I doubt this was the author's intent. Rather, Gilmore or his publisher has documented these ravages to the hilt (no pun intended), because they are so linked in with the twisted psychology of the person who committed this awful murder.It has been written that Gilmore is without peer when it comes to documenting true life drama and this book is one of the most startling, uncompromising pieces of true crime literature I have ever read. His originality stings the senses. He has to be the most accomplished of the &quot;new age&quot; noir writers, both in his nonfiction and fiction (see &quot;Fetish Blonde&quot; for a literary knuckle-sandwich... William S. Burroughs loved it!). SEVERED will not please everyone, but Gilmore doesn't seem to be the kind of writer who is trying to please or entertain. Not everyone will take kindly to his work. It is like a stun gun, sending the reader into that dark, scary space of self- examination; the shadow land where insight dwells. That's where this book sent me and I'll be haunted for years to come. An absolute MUST-READ for those wanting MORE than diversion or escape. I guarantee there's no escaping the impact of this strange book."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is a disturbing account of the unsolved murder of young Elizabeth Short, whose body was found cut in two on a vacant lot in 1947. She was a pretty aspiring actress and model, nicknamed \\"the Black Dahlia\\" even before her death by friends who used her dark black hair as a pun on a movie title, \\"the Blue Dahlia\\", and whose murder has inspired novels, films and documentaries. The authors father was a young police officer at the time of the murder, involved in some of the legwork concerned with the investigation, which remains unsolved to this day. Gilmore does a good job of recounting a biography of Elizabeth's short life - including her leaving home for the dream of becoming a Hollywood star.Overall, this is a tragic account of a young woman who never seemed to find comfort, security or success, but who remained hopeful of obtaining her dreams. Her transitory lifestyle meant it was difficult for the police to trace her last movements and her numerous, but not serious, boyfriends, meant they were all suspects in a case which baffled the authorities. Like many true crime books, the author attempts to 'solve' the crime and, although his arguments are certainly interesting and he makes a good case against one suspect in particular, it is impossible to say whether he is correct or not. This was a case in which the press and police seemed to be at odds with each other and, indeed, within themselves. The murder of a beautiful young woman in such a horrific way unleashed a media frenzy which seems not to have died down to this day. However, the extremely graphic illustrations in this book are a sobering return to reality, that this was not a mythical Hollywood story, but a real young woman who died horrifically. If you read true crime books, this seems a fairly balanced and unsensationalist account of a murder which still arouses interest."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I have read several books and a lot of articles on this crime, and I will say unreservedly that this is without a doubt the absolute best thing I have ever read about the Black Dahlia. It is wonderfully well-written, and is by far the most plausible theory I have come across. I can't recommend it highly enough!!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This was a well written and interesting book. I found the hypothesis that Elizabeth Short may have been intersex quite fascinating- it's based on the facts that she had no womb when found ( Gilmore asserts that she may never have had one) and that the vagina ended blindly ( although other books speculate that chunks of her flesh that were stuffed up there may have contributed to that perception). There are interesting interviews with people who claimed to have had brief quasi-sexual liaisons with her, and good photos. The ending is inconclusive although it does pose an identity for a suspect but it's unconvincing. Good book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This book I am glad the I read to get the full understand of the mystery of the Black Dahlia. Saw the movie, wanted to understand more about her. This book portrays who she is and tells about her life from the time she grow up, up to the point to here she dies. I don not recommend from any kids of any age to read this book. The pictures at the end are hard to deal with. You think back in those times that some one could not be that crazy to do what was done to her. I was glad I read this from someone that had knowledge of the case. I love the book about how her life was but didn't love the part about her death and how bad it was. Murder this bad you will and do not want to understand how sick a person is to do this to her. I do recommed for adults to read if they want to understand her and know what happen but can also deal with the bad part of the book also because it is detailed."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"Everything about this case is fascinating, if you are interested not only in this case but in True Crimes/Unsolved murder cases then this book is a must-own, your collection will never be completed without this book. I agree, the book is not perfect; the author sometimes forget to mention the date of some events and he provides no evidences that some of the \\"characters\\" in the book really existed. But Mr. Gilmore is a very credible and serious author so I don't mind these little mistakes, nothing is perfect.Buy this book my friends; for less than 15$ it's really one hell of a good deal. I just hope Elizabeth Short is now resting in peace. Thank you Mr. Gilmore, great investigation. Long Live Elizabeth !"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I got interested in this story from playing the L.A. NOIRE videogame. The true story is nothing like the story from James Ellroy's novel (and the later film by Brian De Palma starring Josh Hartnett). The book is a quick read, but will stay with you for a while. The brutal nature of the crime is so haunting that it chills you to think that no one was ever charged and sentenced. The story of Elizabeth Short was very interesting, even prior to her murder. It was one of the better true crime books that I have read.I really like true crime stories because I find the work of detective and forensics so fascinating; how they have to piece together an event and paint a portrait of a victim and criminal's life from gathering clues. It takes a very special kind of person to do this kind of work and do it well."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore has the most comprehensive story of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, and her devastating murder.Everything is included. Gilmore knows more than anyone, except for Beth and her murderer, and divulges all to his readers. He starts with the murder scene; obviously it is a significant reason why this case is so extensively studied. Then he recreates Beth's short, secretive and tragic life. And then we get back to the investigation. Gilmore really gets into the police work, but also exposes how William Randolph Hearst's muckraking papers fit in (although I was disappointed how light this subject was covered, it seems to be truly fascinating in its own right). And then Mr. Gilmore inserts himself into the book with who he thinks the real killer is, all truly remarkable.Now, there are several weaknesses to this text that I would like to address. First, it is difficult to establish a timeline. Beth moves around quite a bit, but also the investigation after her death is quite confusing. Inserting a date or even incorporating a timeline would have been very helpful. Also, Beth knew tons of people, Gilmore could have included a list and brief description of each person in the appendix with the map to enhance comprehension (and more pictures of them would have been nice too). And finally, in a few places of the text itself the writing and syntax is a jumble. Rereading these sections still did not help. A few extra items in the appendix and another edit would make this book perfect. But this is only my humble opinion.And a slight warning, I know this case from other sources, but still found that this book made me nauseated and depressed. Gilmore has the most information about this case, and he tells it all. Some of it may be difficult to read. It is such a sad and insane story, it is difficult not to be affected by it. Just a heads up; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore has really done his research. But not only that, he is a very talented writer. SEVERED has all the excitement of a novel, but true. A bit grisly but then, so was the murder. If you can only read one Black Dahlia book, make this one it."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in the Black Dahlia case. Through the stories of those who knew her in Los Angeles, we get the picture of her life on the edge during the 40's.I'm going to say that Elizabeth Short is one of the saddest lives I know. Her disability, which she kept a secret, must have been a huge burden on her. At one point she was engaged to an Army Air Corps officer who tragically died on his way home after the war ended. I can't help but wonder how she planned to tell him about her lack of ability to even have sex much less conceive children. I guess she must have known it would never work out. In fact she floated through life knowing she would never have any kind of long term relationship. No wonder she was a drifter - hopping from one man to the next for a few meals and often a place to sleep. What a nightmare her life was.It's sad. Just plain tragically sad. Haunting. I can't get her unhappy life out of my mind."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"In my opinion this is the best book ever written about the Black Dahlia.Very creepy!"},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"John Gilmore has written the ungarnished story of Elizabeth Short.

It is a 'thinking persons' book. It is controversial and quite powerful. While it might be upsetting to some readers for a number of reasons, i.e. the graphics, the descriptions of murder or the author taking the reader inside the Los Angeles morgue back in the post-War days (this part is very chilling), the book is a finely written, well-crafted and very believable story.

Another skill a good author posseses is to find at least some redemptive quality in an otherwise tragic crime. In \\"Severed\\" , Mr. Gilmore manages to do the exact opposite. Here is a crime that has all of the elements ripe for a scary , gripping ride through the seedy world of 1940's LA. Instead in turns out to be a jumbled nearly incomprehensible cure for insomia. The narrative is so disjointed .....every few paragrahs I found myself backtracking to see if I could figure out what was going on or who the author was talking about. All the book seems to consist of are questionable \\"accounts\\" from every joe that ever gave Elizabeth Short a lift or bought her a drink ,randomly spliced together in no partciular order, coupled with some stories of competing detectives.....blah , blah.And yes, some overly and unnecessary gruesome photos are included. The whole thing seems like a cheap and sleazy attempt to profit from someone else's horrible tragedy. The author should be ashamed."},{"Title":"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder","review":"I took another reviewer at his word and decided to search the internet for any verification that Gilmore's source, LAPD Detective Herman Willis, really existed. And guess what? The only references out there to any Herman Willis who had anything do with law enforcement are referring to Gilmore's book, not to anything outside it. According to Gilmore, this guy was a key player in the Black Dahlia murder investigation, and yet there is no trace or him as a real-world person. It sure looks to me like Detective Herman Willis is a fictional character created by John Gilmore.If Gilmore made up Herman Willis for his book, what else did he make up?If this book was being sold as fiction, I would not have a problem with it.

Instead I found it extremely dull and unconvincing. Gilmore writes in an exceedingly tedious style; perhaps he was trying for an authentic &quot;film noir&quot; feel by using language and dialogue that is terse and inarticulate. I was reading about a grisy unsolved murder that captures peoples' attention to this very day, and it was putting me to sleep! And as for revealing the true murderer...well, I just have this to say to Mr. Gilmore. In order to solve a murder, you have to have cold, hard PROOF. Not heresay. Not speculation. PROOF.

I don't want to say anything more detailed or I'll give it away!Not only is the story charming (with all loose strings nicely tied up by the end), but the illustrations are up to Goode's usual high standards. The coloring is soft and washed-looking. The story is set in perhaps the 1920s or 1930s in Paris, with all the women having sleek, marcelled hair, fur stoles, and ghillie shoes--and the men sporting dapper moustaches, trim suits, and perfectly manicured hands. It's a visual treat to watch the children bounce from store to store, taking in all the undeniably French atmosphere, made vivid and real-yet-idealized through Goode's luscious pictures."},{"Title":"The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Pharmacology, Vol. 48","review":"Alkaloids have diverse biological activities and offer a rich source for development of new therapeutic agents."},{"Title":"In the Teeth of the Wind: A Study of Power and How to Fight It","review":"In a series of case-centered vignettes that range from bizarre to historic(often both), establishment-turned-rebel lawyer Shelly Waxman intendsto expose massive and unfortunately routine corruption and unfairnessin the legal system and the threat these pose to our freedom.

You'd be wrong. Shelly Waxman was a made man, an insider who had only to protect the powerful and sacrifice the expendable to become a highly placed Federal lawyer, perhaps someday a judge. Instead he blew the whistle on prejudice, corruption, and even murder taking place behind the bar, for which act of justice he was thrown from the halls of power. Eschewing the paneled office, the Armani and the Rolex, and the favor of such luminaries as the paranoid J.Edgar Hoover, Shelly devoted himself to defending the truth. This book is not a tale of only one such courageous act, but of many such cases, some you will recognize from the front pages of the last thirty years of our history. \\"In The Teeth Of The Wind\\" reads like pulp fiction, exciting and surprising, with a cast of quirky characters, but it is all true. If you care about the degeneration of the American system of justice, and you would like to know about one man's lifelong struggle to keep it the honorable institution it was created to be, then put this book in your shopping cart now."},{"Title":"In the Teeth of the Wind: A Study of Power and How to Fight It","review":"In the Teeth of the Wind is a comprehensive look into the legal mind and principles of a practicing attorney who unwittingly fell into some monumental cases and became involved with some very unusual people. However, the book is not written for lawyers and is easy for the layman to understand. The book relates one man's quest to fight for the underdog and challenge the establishment. It provides an inspirational account of how a former Assistant U.S. Attorney fell out of favor with the Establishment and became a fighter for freedom. It provides a tour of the Court system and exposes corruption on a incredible scale. It is a natural flowing read, yet riveting. No fluff. Stops you dead in your tracks and says, 'Pay attention this is important.' Fascinating and told with wit and understanding of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Last Raider","review":"What do you think of when you think of World War I? The great naval battles? Hardly! There were only two: The Battleof the Falklands in 1914 and the Battle of Jutland two yearslater. How about the U-boat war? We never think of this as being part of World War I but it was. This was the first war inwhich submarines were used. We usually associate U-boats with the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. Raiders? No, NOT TOMB RAIDERS or RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK! I'm referring to commerce raiders. Again, we usually associate these with World War II. This was the firstDouglas Reeman novel I ever read. I got it for Christmas in1977 and read it in high school. I was surprised that therewere commerce raiders in World War I. This is the story of the Vulkan's last voyage. The Vulkan set sail from Kiel in February 1918 and was on its last mission when World WarI ended. Read the book to find out more. I'd love to tell youbut then I'd have to knock you out."},{"Title":"The Last Raider","review":"I've been looking for a good sea story, something involving Germany's WW1 commerce raiders. The Last Raider, a difficult book to find, seemed to fit the bill. I took the advice of another reviewer who said \\"If you can find it, buy it.\\"Well, I don't know if I can say the same thing. I had read Das Boot prior to this, and even though Das Boot was written in 1973 and The Last Raider was written in 1963, the two stories have a very similar feel, and I think Das Boot was better executed.The story was decent enough, if somewhat cliche (but since it was written in 1963 that's like saying Shakespeare is cliche, no?) but my God in heaven, if there was one more exclamation point I would have throttled the damn writer. I counted 26, yes, 26 freaking exclamation points on ONE PAGE! Most pages had between 10 and 15. Apparently the period key on his typewriter was broken, so it was ? and ! left and right.If you can find it, and find it cheap, buy it, give it a read, and pass it on. If not? Don't stress about it."},{"Title":"The Last Raider","review":"If you've gone this far to find this book, don't hesitate now. You're a very rare creature -- one who finds naval drama good reading. I stumbled across this novel when just a kid, in my grade school's library, believe it or not. I was already fascinated with the idea of commerce raiders and to get my hands on a novel about such a ship in world war one excited my imagination no end.Reeman has no serious literary pretensions, but he does bring credibility to the subject; when he talks about life on the sea, you believe it implicitly. Quite the prolific writer, I only know this book and HMS Saracen, but I fully intend to dig deeper into his catalogue. I highly reccomend this novel and the writer for anyone who wants to get a hands on feel for naval combat in world war one and two.

I watched the season unfold and saw the President Nixon proclaimed national championship game between the University of Arkansas and the University of Texas played in Arkansas. I also watched the New Year's Cotton Bowl Classic between Texas and Notre Dame which Texas won to lay undisputed claim to the mythical national college football championship. Freddie Steinmark was a sidelight to this season, and we probably would not have heard of his book except for the fact he was an undersized over achiever who was the starting defensive safety for the University of Texas. Freddie played most of the season in teriffic pain. After the Arkansas game he let the coaches and trainers know he had a problem with his leg. After learning he had a malignant tumor in his thigh the leg was amputated at the hip in order to try to save his life. This happened shortly after the Arkansas game. Freddie set his goal to attend the New Year's Day game against Notre Dame which three years earlier had turned him down for an athletic scholarship for his lack of size. On New Year's Day there was Freddie on the sidelines on his crutches to cheer on his team mates. The last chapter in this book was written by Freddie's Catholic priest since he had lost his life to cancer.

I was glad to be able to find it for him. He loves it."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I'd been searching for a comprehensive biography about Prince since forever. I finally found it in Alex Hahn's Possessed.The book is split into two halves. The first half chronicles Prince's rise from an alienated teenage musical prodigy in Minneapolis, MN to the best R&B; one man band on a major label this side of Stevie Wonder to an international pop icon. The other half recounts Prince's fall from the commercial heights of his \\"Purple Rain\\" period to his incremental loss of any true sense of reality and reasoning.As some prior reviewers have pointed out, Prince isn't painted in the most glorified light in Possessed. Nor is he depicted in a villainous one. He is instead revealed to be what I had always suspected him to be: a brilliant yet arrogant creative force that uses silence, eccentricity and distance to guard his fragile true self.Not only does this book do an excellent job of giving the reader a full screen glimpse inside the mind, impulses and heart of both the subject and his notable work, it gives you a full understanding of his relationship with others. In the book, you learn about the defection of the Revolution; the origins of his many prot&eacute;g&eacute;s including Vanity 6 and The Time (all revealed to be mere visual puppets for Prince's music); and of course, the real story with his many female conquests.My only gripes with the book:-The lack of history on Prince's family. Aside from the beginning where the reader learns about Prince's parents (comes to find out his lack of height, eccentricity and musical talent derive from his late father, John Nelson) and his competitive nature with his brother, Duane, not much of Prince's family life is explored afterwards. The reader is not left with any real impression and the relationship between Prince and his biological family after he became a celebrity. We don't get a full understanding of how Prince's upbringing shaped who he is AND why he is the way he is. (Aside from Hahn noting that Prince would later sometimes gave his father writing credits for songs he had nothing to do with.) Prince's sister Tyka Nelson released an album in the late 1980s, the book has no mention of it. It also doesn't mention the time (around the release of Tyka's album) when his late sister Lorna sued her brother when he allegedly stole the lyrics of his 1987 hit \\"U Got The Look\\" from one of her compositions.-Although the reader gets an in depth view of the (momentarily romantic) relationship between Prince and Madonna (which is rather interesting), we don't really get a clear view of the relationship between P and his other fellow superstar Michael Jackson. I know that aside from Madonna, Prince and MJ was either other's main rival. What did Prince think of MJ? What became of their few interactions? Aside from a sentence-long mention of a ping pong table match between the two, there's no mention of a MJ/Prince interaction. Hahn also seems to play down MJ's genius in order to boost up Prince's. They both were equally brilliant in my opinion. And I'm sure MJ inspired Prince as both the Jackson 5 and \\"Off The Wall\\" were inescapable. Another one of Prince's rival, Rick James, is also not really mentioned.-This may sound petty but throughout the text, Hahn gets the dates of certain albums and single wrong. He redeemed himself though with the extremely comprehensive discography that concludes the book.The book concludes around early 2002, just after the release of \\"The Rainbow Children\\" so Possessed just misses Prince's impressive commercial return in 2004. The reader doesn't get to know the background behind his subsequent musical reunion with Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman (who he coldly fired without notice in 1986) and ex-lover Shelia E; massively successful world tours (including the sold out 21-night run at London's O2 Arena); and unconventional methods of musical distribution (releasing 2008's Planet Earth as a free cover mount on the Sunday edition of the UK newspaper The Mail; the exclusive deal with Target for his last three-album release in 2009). Perhaps, an expanded, up-to-date edition of Possessed, similar to J. Randy Taraborelli's recent update of his extensive 1991 Michael Jackson biography, The Magic, The Madness, may be on the horizon. It would undoubtedly prove to be fascinating.As it is, \\"Possessed\\" is an excellent read for any Prince fan and stands as the most comprehensive biography to date on the notoriously guarded superstar."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"A comprehensive overview of the life of one of the greatest musical minds of the pop world. Hahn shows how Prince went from prodigy to pop star to pompous recluse. Starting with his early years right up to the the new millenium, we see how Prince's flame shined so brightly after years of hard work, only to have it snuffed by ego, selfishness and totalitarianism. Plenty of great research by Hahn, who gets his info straight from those close to the Purple One, including band members, engineers, A&R; people and tour manager Alan Leeds who also worked for funk godfathers James Brown and George Clinton. Excellent and complete discography including unreleased material. A must for any fan of His Royal Badness!My only complaint is that Hahn seems biased in favor of the successful Revolution/Purple period and very critical of the later New Power Generation band. Though the lite pop of the Revolution era was the highlight of Prince's career, the musically superior NPG yielded much greatness although its R&B;/rap/funk seemed less accessible to mainstream audiences. In fact, it was Prince's increased musical output and each album's lack of contiuity (jumping to different musical styles like jazz, techno, reggae, r&b;, rock opera, etc) that contributed his downfall. In the end, it seemed Prince lost his focus and idealism and needed to find purpose again to regain his throne."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I know there are thousands of books on Prince and you gotta pick and choose what to believe and what not to believe when it comes to Mr. Nelson.This book is definitely an interesting read. Even though I don't listen to Prince very much these days (except for the demos and outtakes stuff and watching the Lovesexy concert in Amsterdam), reading about Prince is definitely intruiging & amusing but, leaves you asking yourself &#34;what happened to this genius?&#34;"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Insighful with too much TMI. wish I did not know what I now think I know. It takes away the mystery of the man...the music...the sound. But I added to my collection...easy read"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I have been a huge Prince fan since I was a teen. A book like this would have been unbelievable to me back then, since Prince was famous for not giving interviews and creating a Garboesque mystery to his music and image. This is why, even more, i give the author so much credit. To put a book like this together on someone so private quite possibly deserves 5 stars by itself (lol).Any Prince fan needs to read this. This not an irresponsible piece of work at all, which many of the previous Prince biographies are very guilty of. Most of those books couldn't get to the sources like Hahn does and his knowledge of Prince's music and personality. If i remember correctly, it's the first book to feature interviews with many who worked with him. The biggest source being Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, both who were very close to Prince during his stunning mid-80's heyday.More importanly, though, Hahn does give insight to why Prince is the artist he is. It is a very sad read at the beginning to find that Prince was more or less abandoned by his mother and father. He admired and loved his father and wanted to impress him. The book tells in unflinching detail of how Prince's hurt over this matter propelled him into the perfectionist and the genius that he is today. And i hope i have not given away too much.I picked this book up in Barnes and Noble and read most of it within 2 days. Many thanks to Hahn for an impressive work on bringing us closer to this genius."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I conduct a lecture called \\"Lessons Learned from Prince on Achieving and Maintaining Success in the Music Industry,\\" and this book served as the basis for the bulk of my research. I can tell you unequivocally that the book's author, Alex Hahn, goes the extra mile in providing abundant, interesting, and accurate information from Prince's childhood, up until 2002. Compared to other unofficial biographies or websites such as Wikipedia, it's a far more in-depth and intimate accounting of the events and people that are woven into the life tapestry of arguably one of the greatest artists of our time. An absolute must have for all true Prince fans."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"After reading original guitarist, Dez Dickerson's newly released book, &quot;My Time With Prince&quot;, I was thankful for real first-hand observations and insights into the Purple One's beginning. Without the agenda set forth in &quot;Possessed&quot;, Dez shares about the youthful, innocent, and extraordinary path that Prince and bandmates experienced. Legend has it that Dez is the only band member who was not required to sign a confidentiality agreement, allowing him to finally come forth with this rare up-close biography. Very interesting comparison reading."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Not a great biography. The whole book front to back reads like negative propaganda. I've been a HUGE Prince fan for years, and without a doubt he has many flaws, but this book attacks every decision he's ever made. Prince can do no right by the author (whom I might add was at one point involved with suing Prince).Haan only points out how Prince fails and comes up short, and when Prince does make a good move Haan immediately says how he could have done better. The book is titled \\"Fall or Prince\\" when just 18 months after it's publication Prince launched his \\"Musicology\\" Tour and became the Top selling performer in the world for 2004, that sure doesn't sound like a guy on a downward spiral to me.This book verges on slander"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"If you want to know about the full details of Prince's career and personal life, this is the book for you. I couldn't put it down, finished it in a few days. Prince is an incredible musician as well as a control freak in which you will learn. He also is very comfortable in contradicting himself as well. None the less, its a fascinating story. Seems like he had a burn out in the early nineties. Up until then, this guy was on fire and seemed unstoppable. I really like how he stuck up for himself and never let the industry put him into one category. As an artist this is something that many artist wish in their wildest dreams they could pull off, but very few can. In fact none to my knowledge has been able to as well as the purple one. Even less would have the courage to try.The one thing that stuck out to me is Prince's dedication to his career, but lack of balance in personal life. Total workaholic to the point of obsession. Because of this it eventually influenced his career in a bad way. I think he could of stood to take some time off over the years, too much in the thick of it to get a clear head.I'm a huge Prince fan, as amazing as he is........he is human like the rest of us, flaws and all. This book shows you the human element of this guy. A real vicarious view through the life of Mr. Nelson. Let me tell you, one amazing life.If you have any curiosity behind the mystery of Prince, gotta get this book."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This is a very interesting well written book.

Wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This book was pretty good, it showed a lot of background history of the albums as well as individual songs. For me it helped piece together the albums and showed Prince in a more human light, which made me appreciate him even more. It's a bit bitter sweet.I know the Sign of the Times/Black album/Lovesexy era was a really exciting and quick time, but there wasn't a lot on what was happening as far as band members and song writing concerned.I did appreciate the last few sentences of the book which forshadowed Prince starting to emerge from the cloud of those dark years which I consider Graffiti Bridge - Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"*Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince* generated controversy (pun intended) even before its release. The word 'possessed' in itself conjures a negative connotation. Prince's most ardent fans question if Prince has had a 'fall.' There has also been speculation on the author's intent. Was it to write a salacious and tabloid like bio bashing Prince?Hahn has answered these last two points quite well in my opinion. Before reading the book, I myself wondered how Prince had 'fallen.' Now I realize I felt that way because I am interested in Prince and have paid attention to him all these years. For the fan who left the fold in the late eighties/early nineties never to return, \\"the fall\\" may be much more apparent. In the context of commercial viability, Hahn has undeniably proven Prince has taken a fall. Whether he proves that Prince has also fallen musically is highly subjective and debatable.As far as salaciousness, I found very little offensive. Hahn does get involved in Prince's personal relationships, but doesn't delve as deeply as other biographers might, pretending they're flies on the wall. While he does occasionally make great assumptions on what Prince is specifically feeling, Hahn doesn't try to recreate private conversations no one could possibly be privy to. Hahn uses quotes from those he's interviewed and his own inferences to paint pictures. In that sense, he is totally respectful.Situations that were already public knowledge are expanded on, but nothing appears here for sake of titilation.Although this book is written with much care and in-depth analysis, it still falls upon the reader to make an informed decision to take everything with a grain of salt. In particular, the passages about Prince's personal life. When something doesn't have the ring of truth to it, one has to let it go by.I found Hahn's description of Prince's transformation from that of rebel to man of apparent increasing conservatism quite fascinating. His point that Prince may never continue to grow as a musician because he does not surround himself with people who challenge him is made as saliently as the notion that his fan base will never increase if he limits himself to his NPGMusicClub alone.Some want their heroes to be flawless. Fans reading should prepare themselves that the tale told is not a pretty one at times. All humans are flawed and Prince is no exception.Do I get upset when I read accounts of Prince treating people badly? Not particularly. I recognize that there are psychological issues going on underneath. Hahn makes it very clear that control and manipulation cover for Prince's own vulnerabilities and insecurities that he wishes for no one to see, perhaps even himself!I am of the opinion that no biography can ever truly be definitive without the input of the subject. However, Alex Hahn has done his homework, and admirably so in my opinion. While some die-hard fans and \\"Prince apologists\\" will probably find much to be upset about, the fact is, Hahn makes his points incredibly well. I find no appearance of deliberate malice towards Prince in this book.How will fans react to *Possessed*? Depends on what kind of fan they are. If they are fans that refuse to believe anything negative about their idol, they will hate it. If they are fans that have objectivity, they will probably find it very interesting. I fall into the latter category."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"im what you would call a diehard since 81' i've been a major supporter of prince and his lifestyle/music i have all the video's , books, cds, ect... and this is a great addition to the puzzle ....heres why you should buy it ....a book about an artist should reveal things we've never heard right ???????? well i got that on page 1 !!! i recommend this book. (where was it in 1988) ???"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"What's disappointing is that you don't find out what drove Prince during his creative peak, much less why he lost that spark/passion. What you do learn is that Prince appears to be a selfish, egotistical, ungrateful etc. person. That's driven home over and over again through this book, almost to the point of obsession.Since the author appeared to have great access to sources, it's unfortunate not to get better insights into the making of Prince's great songs."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This book gave me the impression that the author doesn't care for the subject of his book. I felt that he came off as being a Prince hater. He would start off with a compliment and end with an insult shortly thereafter over and over and just didn't seem to have anything good to say about Prince. I would recommend a more thorough biography about prince from an author who isn't biased and hasn't had any bad experiences with the subject to get a more objective point of view. I also found the book to be repetive. I also wondered about Prince's relationship with his mother. The book gives great detail about his relationship with his father, but his mother was hardly ever mentioned, which had me wondering if all the womanizing had anything to do with him not having a good relationship with his mother. Overall, the book left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I am looking for a more positive and more detailed biography about the Purple Majesty, who is definitely a musical genius if nothing and else!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"As a Prince fan for nearly thirty years, I've read just about every review, biography, interview and article ever written about The Artist. Far and away, this is the most penetrating, well-written, and insightful book ever published. It avoids gossip and sensationalism, yet does not compromise on providing an in-depth look into Prince's music and his life. Rarely has a truly critical (but never unfair) analysis been written about a musician's career. Prince fans owe it to themselves to give this book a thorough read."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Hahn's book is good but, as some of the other reviewers mention, it is written too much on a schematic of pre-1988 = good, after 1988 = bad. Prince has been humbled, I suppose, and now he plays his greatest hits like clockwork and has attained a semblance of his former fan base. But on the whole his career has been too complicated to fit into the traditional \\"rise and fall\\" motif.Hahn does name names and he's pretty harsh on our boy Prince, who comes off sounding like he's trapped in his own world, unable to break out and see what's real. He is haughty, weird, and troubled. But Hahn is also genuinely interested in the music, and in seeing who did what in the various incarnations of Prince's collaborators.Prince is a sparkplug of energy with a fantastic melodic line and a master of r'n'b. I love the story of Prince helping out Stevie Nicks during the writing of \\"Stand Back\\" one of her signature tracks from the 1980s. It's a shame nothing from his sessions with Kylie Minogue ever saw the light of day; but Hahn holds out a ray of hope that someday, way down the pike, we will hear everything because Prince is a sort of packrat when it comes to holding onto the all precious tapes (obsessively, like Howard Hughes holding onto his fingernail clippings)."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Although I thought the author had an agenda, I thought this book was an excellent look at Prince. I've been a fan of Prince's since his first album and I thought Alex Hahn's understanding of the artist and descriptions of his music were right on target. It was interesting to see the breadth of Prince's work laid out in chronological order because it really brings to light just how prolific he was. Hahn captures Prince's bewilderment at the changing face of pop, the rise of hip hop and his place in it all. However, Hahn does sort of paint Prince as a little purple tyrant of sorts and from the extensive interviews Hahn did, it seems to be true. All in all, this was a very readable, engaging music bio."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"While it tends to paint a rather unattractive picture of the reclusive genius/Svengali, this biography is a real page turner and is a must have for all serious Prince fans. The detailed information on his creative process (all of his studio LP's up to &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; are discussed in depth)and his struggle from an unstable childhood in Minneapolis to superstardom is an inspiration and will keep you turning pages for hours. This is a great book for music/entertainment junkies and manages to be truthful, a bit gossipy but never sinks to the level of tabloid trash. A Good Read for the diehard fan or the casual admirer."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Not too bad.Now it all makes sense about Prince to me.You give someone enough power and reign, don't think that they will give it up so easily. (I'm talking about the music making)He did it ALL, and wanted ALL the credit and control.Even though I'm sure his former band*Slaves contribute in assisting with the new music,but he didn't give credit were I believe credit was due to them.Good-not great book. But it answered some unanswered questions, and I believe they were the most accurate taking account from those who worked and dealt with Prince and both a professional and personal level"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This book hits things right on the nail. From someone who has personally been around the Prince Camp (1994-2001) as a fan and supporter with the hope that Prince would pull out of his self destructive pattern, this is the book to get. The only downside of this writing is that everything couldn't get covered. There was much more hell than this book has reported. Nothing mentions the relationship between Prince and Sheena Easton. None of you know about the many winter jams Prince invited us to that were held at Paisley that found fans waiting for 2+ hours outside in below zero weather. He could have let people inside to get warm until the show started, most of the time it was only 50 to 60 people and we were all regulars, they knew us. People don't know how Revlon offered Prince a deal to promote a perfume around \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\" and he turned it down feeling he could do better with his own brand which was \\"Get Wild\\" that ultimately bombed. The treatment of his staff and fans is stuff of legend. We all put him where his is but I challenge any of you who are not of female gender to get close enough to him to say \`hello'. He will not acknowledge your jester, kindness is not in him. \\"What's with the Ocean\\" is his term for any hiss he may hear in a recording session, believe me engineers caught hell. I'm saying all this not to put Prince down but to confirm this book as being a truthful depiction of the life and times of this music legend. I for one am not getting paid a cent but it's great to finally see someone tell it like it really happened. Too many times we want to make people into what we want them to be and refuse to acknowledge the truth. Stars build fancy propaganda around themselves that's totally false. Prince has serious problems emotionally even though he is a wonderful artist. And anyone who has been around him to witness his actions first hand has a truly amazing story to tell you, I personally could go on and on. It's really scary the kind of people we choose to look up to and follow. This book is a must have for anyone wanting to know the truth of how things started and got to the point they are today in Prince's life. Get this book...."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"If you're a devoted, got-everything, member-of-npg-online Prince fanatic, skip this book. It paints Prince as a fallible human being, and you don't want to hear that.For the rest of us (I'm a fairly big Prince fan), this is an enlightening look at Prince's career through 2002. I didn't find the reporting to be tabloidesque - both Alex and the people interviewed (including such vital players in the Prince saga as Alan Leeds and Dr Fink) paint Prince as a fascinating and incredible human being, both with strengths (mostly musical and visionary) and weaknesses (mainly in business and interpersonal relationships, as well as the &quot;always taking credit but never taking blame&quot; facet that is common to many people in his position). None of what I read contradicts what I knew about the man, and reading the book threw him into sharper focus. I don't entirely agree with Alex's reviews of particular Prince albums or songs, but his insights prove very engaging reading to any Prince fan, and I think the overall picture he paints is fascinating.I do think there's a major flaw in the book, and that's its division into two halves: Rise and Fall. Alex's basic premise is that Prince was on an upward climb until around 1988 (around the time Black Album was due to be released) and been falling ever since. Due to this, everything that's happened in Prince's career is seen as confirming this theory. So &quot;Controversy&quot; (which was more or less a sidestep) is treated as an artistic consolidation, &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; as a commercial sellout (which it may have been, but it still returned him to the public eye), and &quot;The Gold Experience&quot; as a commercial flop (while it didn't sell too well, it was a critical success). This coloring of the facts doesn't really detract from the book as a whole, but it does make Prince's career look more like a mountain (up then down) rather than the peak-and-valley rollercoaster ride it has actually been.I don't think this flaw should detract any less-than-fanatical Prince fan from reading and enjoying this book. Lots of interesting information, and almost none of it of the &quot;juicy&quot; nature - most having to do with unrelease tracks, abandoned projects, and so forth. Pick it up if this sounds intriguing."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"A warning to Prince die-hards: this is not a flattering portrayal of him whatsoever. We all knew he was a mercurial control freak, and that he was essentially a one-man band, but I had no idea to what lengths he would go to alienate people. I also never realized that he had a tendency to not credit others with writing (wait 'till you read about &quot;Kiss&quot;).For me, I bought the book because I wanted the answer to a burning question: why did the Revolution break up? Let's face it, that was his most interesting period, his best band (if not chops-wise, certainly taste-wise) and the departure of Wendy &amp; Lisa seemed to end an era. You'll get the answer here, and it's pretty disturbing. Only one Revolution member parted with Prince on amicable terms--drummer Bobby Z.--and that was when Prince fired him to replace him with Sheila E.As I've found with most idols, when you look behind the talent, at the person, you most often will be disappointed. As a person, Prince is disappointing. Still, his music endures and there's plenty of fascinating stories here about the creation of his classic albums and singles, not to mention his endless side projects, both good (The Family) and bad (Carmen Electra, Vanity 6, etc.).The irony of this book is that it ends on a sour note; it was published before his big comeback this year, and as I'm reading it the Rolling Stone arrived yesterday... with Prince on the cover.It should be retitled The Rise, The Fall, the Return.A must-read if you're a Prince fan. You'll also find out some amazingly interesting stuff about The Time, the whole Purple Rain phenomena, the diastrous Under the Cherry Moon, and just about everything else--including his self-immolating war with Warner Bros., who actually come out here looking pretty sympathetic.I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I loved this book. I have been an avid (artist formally known as) Prince fan for years, and I found this the best book on him to date. I got so much insight into Prince's life, music, and psyche! It is well written and riveting. Its clear that it was very well researched; I feel even with everything I already knew about Prince that I was learning new information. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Some Prince fans have greeted this book with howls of injured outrage, but they may not have read Oedipus Rex or Hamlet. The author has. He knows Oedipus is a powerful, important king with a fatal blind-spot, a world-shaker whose pride, wrath, and failure-to-listen lead to his fall. He knows Hamlet is a brilliant, philosophical young prince who is also a manic-obsessive, tormented by indecision, tortured by his ingrown intellect as much as by circumstance, by his ego as much as by his enemies. Thus Hahn is able to discern and reveal the universal patterns in the story of Prince.Prince zealots retort that their idol is alive and well, thank you, producing music and retaining a loyal fan base. But at his peak Prince combined the vast fame of a chart-busting pop mega-star with the critical esteem of a Miles Davis, while today, though his work continues, he is known to the general public mainly as a footnote, a man who became an unpronounceable symbol, a house-hold name who faded from view. What happened, and why? This book tells the story.Neither sensational nor humdrum, the book relies on the method of a sound investigation: patient, probing, persistent. It will appeal to a wide range of readers, from those alert to pop culture to those attuned to the universal relevance of a rise-and-fall trajectory, whether tragic or ambiguous, aware that the best and brightest of us carry in ourselves the seeds of a potential undoing. This is what gives Hahn's important book its larger resonance."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"At first I was excited to read about Prince. I just love reading biographies. Though I was never a Prince fan, I always thought he was an talented individual and interesting personality. So I thought I would gain insight into this intriguing person. All I got from this biography were typo's, wrong dates, contradictions and an obvious dislike by the author for his subject. Thoroughout the entire book I kept wondering about the author \\"what's wrong with this guy?\\" Either he has a beef with Prince or someone he knows does. I gleaned a few tidbits about Prince's past, but nothing worth the price of that book. The author is giving everyone credit for Prince's success except for the artist himself. For instance he attempts to credit Alan Leeds, Prince's road manager with turning Prince on to Jazz. I ask the question: How could Leeds have introduced Prince to Jazz, when in a previous chapter he stated that Prince's very own father was a known, working Jazz musician on the Minneapolis scene and his own mother was the Jazz singer in his father's band??? Another example, making constant and totally wrong comparisons to Prince with Michael Jackson who only have in common their ethnicity. The picture he paints of the subject is an awful one. It became so irritating that I had to stop reading it and throw it in the trash. Honestly. I'm looking for another Prince Bio. Hopefully a more honest and interesting one. If you are a Prince fan don't even think about buying this one. I am sure it will only infuriate you."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"The epitomy of the classic \\"rock star\\", Prince has seemingly taken an inspired career and turned it into a sort of ironic mystery...author Alex Hahn presents this theory using an amazing access to personal subjects and un-released music to destroy the mystique and bring Prince into the general public's eye for all to scrutinize. What we find is a sort of mini-demagogue who remains brilliant musically, but suffers from many years of petulant behavior to systematically reduce his faithful following and, unfortunately, become nothing more than a cult figure.Back in 1985, however, the thought of Prince being anything but a major musical influence and icon would be inconceivable...this was following the final push to superstardom that \\"Purple Rain\\", the record and movie, provided and the country/music industry was agog at what the next Prince project might be. Of course, the underwhelming and self-aggrandizing \\"Around the World in a Day\\" was the next release and this started the downward spiral that continues to this day. Author Hahn attempts to analyze this with \\"Possessed\\" and he brings it off with an amazing balance...remaining true to his literary responsibilites, he paints a realistic and forthcoming picture of the tortured musician. At once brilliant in the conceiving and performing of cutting edge music while at the same time displaying a curious bewilderment at the ever changing face of popular music, Prince remains the mystery that he so fervently relishes and in the process has virtually destroyed any fan base that could resurrect his career.A stunningly comprehensive biography, Hahn shows the entire Prince career from his childhood up to and including the 2001 release of \\"The Rainbow Children\\". Riding the emotional and psychological roller-coaster that was Prince, we see the meteoric rise and subsequent demise of this influential artist and also the human waste he laid as a side product...his (Prince's) treatment of \\"friends and associates\\" is disturbing and speakes to (in my opinion) a lingering psychosis. Conversely, Hahn, again using amazing access to unreleased recorded material, shows Prince to be prolific and brilliant in his conception of and performance of many major turns in his musicianship. Indeed, the few unreleased tracks that I have personally heard would make for a great album and it's hard to conceive that this level of great music is still \\"in the vault\\".Hahn covers all the important episodes in this star-crossed career...even sharing some new information that former \\"hard-core\\" fans never knew...the homosexual relationship of Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman was new to me and I was a fan at the inception of the \\"Revolution\\"...the interaction of fellow musicians and subsequent denial of artistic credit (i.e. Rosie Gaines and Melvoin) is part of this afore mentioned disturbing psychotic behavior and was also a surprise to me. What astounded me the most, however, was the continued denial on the part of Prince towards the burgeoning rate of change in the popular music world and his denail of this fact. He continued to think that he was one record away from the \\"Purple Rain\\" type of mega-stardom and Hahn presents this part of the story in sober terms...I certainly felt the frustration that most fans assuredly went through and this feeling is the most prevelant throughout this work. Time and again, a new idea or initiative was started by Prince, only to be reduced or disintegrated by the ever-present \\"haughtiness\\" that only served to limit his career growth and is something that he continues to pay for in his musical standing today.Hahn does serve the music fan well, however, with his many reviews of some of Prince's classic music...he raves about \\"Controversy\\", \\"1999\\", \\"Sign O the Times\\" and, of course \\"Purple Rain\\". Some of the later works (\\"Graffiti Bridge\\", \\"Lovesexy\\" and \\"Emancipation\\") that I thought were pure genius were sort of described as episodic and partly rationalized into the spiraling downward turn in Prince's career and music...unfairly, I felt, but an opinion that I respected given the depth of Hahn's research. Closing out the book is an impressive discography of all Prince's works and his part assisitance in others (Bangles, Stevie Nicks, Sheena Easton...etc).Whether you love him or hate him...or even if you're just a popular music fan in general, you'd do well to read about the rise and fall of Prince in this book. A more interesting story you won't find (yes even given the latest Michael Jackson fiascos) and a story that has you at once criticising and conversely hoping for a more fortunate outcome, Alex Hahn is to be commended for a comprehensive, scholarly and entertaining look at one of Rock's remianing mysteries. I recommend this book very highly."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"As another reviewer wrote, if you don't want to see anything negative written about Prince, don't read this book. But again, if you don't pick up and read this well researched and written work, you will truly deprive yourself and miss out on something great. Furthermore, if you really love Prince, you will accept his rough behind the scenes side as well as his stage image. Sure, we want to see our idols as flawless, but realistically, that is not the case. The book takes you on a fantastic journey of highs and lows throughout the artist's personal and business relationships, financial hardships, and his creative triumphs and failures.There were times during my reading of the book that I actually despised him for his treatment of others, especially those who really cared about and stood by him, but then again, that's his personality, and who am I or anyone else to judge? The scary thing is, I see a lot of myself in him, not musically, but personality wise. I really felt bad after reading about how he lost his child. In fact, that was the most heartbreaking part of the book to me. After finishing the book, I watched \\"Purple Rain\\" again for the umpteenth time , and it is strange how my perspective of the film was altered by the bio.Some of the content will be shocking and downwright offensive, and upon completion of the book, you will either love Prince or hate him. Either way, the fact remains that Prince, no matter what his faults or weaknesses are, is one of the best artistic geniuses of our time and has left a permanent footprint on pop culture. Even his worst detractors give him credit for his abilities. Frankly, I couldn't imagine what life would be like without his music. I now have a newfound respect for Prince, in the sense that he is as human as the rest of us. Get this!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"As a hardcore Prince fanatic I was ready to see a halfbaked hatchet job with this book (as other titles have been), but it is EXCELLENT. It is thorough, fact driven, and a pageturner, and NOT a National Enquirer bull**** gossip book. Just for the secrets alone (the mysterious 'Alfred' from Corrine Baconskin for example) it is riviting, but it shows as fact what I have always thought about Prince - that he actually is a true musical prodigy/genius/artist, and with that comes what afflicts most true artists, a self-destructive streak that is evident in the passion they show in their work. It will be a joy to go back and relisten to my library of his cds now that I know the stories behind the songs. From Walt Whitman to Kurt Cobain, true artists often succumb to their artistic muses, and when they cannot mask tribulations with substance abuse (Prince is notoriously anti-drug&amp;anti-drink) they conflict with those around them, which leads to a 'downfall'. Having recently purchased the 'Live at Alladin' DVD, I think it is far too early to put him as 'down and out' however, and I can't wait for the big 'Comeback'.... Alex Hahn has done a masterful job here!!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This book was great!I, like most of you grew up an avid fan. My room was plastered with him and he is the reason I made music my chosen profession...With that said; I give this book 5 stars because in my opinion it tells the truth about him. If you're a real fan of something then you'd want to know EVERYTHING! For the better part of his career, Prince didn't deal directly with the media. And because of that the only way to get info or details on him the only source was the people who were close to him. This book goes in to great detail and depth with interviews from those who were around him. I've read other reviews and some give this book a very low rating saying things like 'don't read this...it speaks badly of Prince.' \\"Possessed: The Rise & Fall\\" tells the truth.It is a great read for any fan that seeks what really went down. Prince has done some really great things, obviously w/ his music, but also with his phenomenal charity work...But he has done some not so good things as well particularly with the way he has treated people that have worked for him. If you're looking a book to praise Prince cover to cover- get a Controversy mag. If you want to know how it was bulit from the ground up read \\"Possessed: The Rise & Fall.\\""},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Though the research is great, the writing isn't. There needed to be more editing on many parts of the book. The information is great but a lot of Prince die-hard fans(like me) already know his biography except for the later years. As for the later years of Prince I wanted more info especially in his marriages. I think the author was afraid to be labeled as a \\"tabloid\\" writer and didn't dwelve more into how his view of women and the lack of showing emotion hurt his 1st marriage. And some typos in the book as his older half(or step) brother Alfred and then his name is incorrectly turned into \\"Albert\\". Though there are fantastic reading moments in the book, also great research and marvelous insightful moments in Prince's life that many fans may have not known. However, it's an average to mediocre completion. It could had been done better and also I wish the pictures in the book were in color too!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"Although Prince has enjoyed a popular \`comeback' since the publication of this book, I felt the author was a little critical of Prince's musical output in the 90s. Personally I thought Lovesexy and Diamonds and pearls great albums.Whilst we all loved the punky attitude of the 80s, we have to remember that Prince wanted to stand out from the generally more conservative R & B scene of the late 70s/80s. When you are young, you naturally feels much free to explore sexuality and how you look you are open to more influence. For a young talented, and good looking African American growing up when he did, Prince embraced all of what that period had to offer whether it was cross dressing, punk, new wave and dating. Naturally as one gets older, one normally becomes more conservative and reverts back to what really felt comfortable to them such as hanging out with the African American NPG.Prince was never really the effete, and camp person that some like Alex Hahn want him to be. Prince is a African American hetrosexual male, with hetrosexual desires.Once hip hop culture became all embracing Prince knew that he could no longer be the effeminate acting brother, he decided to revert to \`keeping it real'"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I discovered Prince in high school and fell in love. I bought every album he made and could quote whole scenes from Purple Rain. This book was like a trip back through time. Some fans have already objected to Possessed without reading it which is too bad. This is not a hit piece. If anything I'd say it's extremely fair.For the first time this book splits the rumors and legends about Prince and tries to tell the real story.Prince is a musical genius but he's not a saint and yes, the book shows that. If you loved Prince back in the day or if you still love him get this book."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I hae always been a fan of Prince, but like everyone else....never understood where he is coming from. This book sorts out the madness from the genius. A must have for any fan of music!"},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"It seems to me that the author is actually in the &quot;destroy Prince&quot; camp - he doesn't seem to understand much about the social surroundings of the 1980's, and takes the weaknesses of that era as Prince's personal faults. We belong to our places and are molded by our times. Prince as a voice of the people, as one who speaks for those who cannot - this did not come across at all in the book. All we see is what contracts were signed and who was mad at who. Although the book does have a lot of information, it doesn't have a soul."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"I'm sure that like many of Prince's longtime listeners, the author (Alex Hahn) has wondered why the magic of Prince's current output seems pale in comparison to the magic of his releases in the early 1980's. Maybe, just maybe, that is what he attempts to uncover in this relatively revealing book of an artist you won't see on Behind The Music. Otherwise, it covers little new ground and may make a new Prince listener quite wary of the man as some screwed-up personality. The truth is, Prince has the God-given talent to express a myriad of musical ideas (not just the ideas that sound good on the dance floor), and the energy and intellect as well. If you listen long enough, you'll hear (or see, if you go to his shows or the Celebrations in Minneapolis)them all...you'll love some and not others, but there is no denying that he is the Mozart of our generation. If you are a Prince completist, you'll need this book. If not, spend your money on one of his multi-cd sets instead."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"This is a book full of tabloid journalism. Very few Prince associates were willing to go on record to tell their stories, but that doesn't slow Mr. Hahn down any at all.He proceeds to report rumor as fact, citing certain unnamed sources offering us a sensationalist view of Prince as an [odd one] who has sabatoged his own career and abused everyone he has encountered.If you believe everything you read in tabloids this book is for you. If you want to learn more about the real Prince, that's a book yet to be written."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"After reading Hahn's book-I had the distinct feeling that I had just read an extra long musical review that seemed only to touch gently on the surface of who Prince really is. It seemed that the author based his account solely on what others speculated and guessed. I found the book extremely repetitive and in some cases the other seems to have blindly wavered off the track of the story. The book in any case is not what I expected it to be and was very dull."},{"Title":"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince","review":"to be honest there are only a handful of Books on Prince that are even halfway interesting.I give the Author Props for taking the time to write on a Cat that while is a Musical Genius,Legend&One of the Greatest Artists in Studio&Live of All-Time, has also for quite a while been a Has-Been&Hit-Less.if it wasn't for the fact that Prince can still Hang with anyone Live on Stage He would be basically Be written off.this Book doesn't balance Prince the Artists enough&His work as it does digging into Prince's Life&whatnot.nothing new here.I give the Author Props for writing on Prince because unlike 20-15&even 10 Years back I don't see the long line to get a Book out on Him.I agree with the title from the Commerical Prime&Peak Situation&also everybody who blows up also takes a dive with a New Genration&Era of Musicial Ears.Prince these days is in the same boat as Michael Jackson minus the Issues even though MJ can still Pull some Hits&Hit with a Album but Image has taken a Major beating&also these Cats played a different brand of the Music Game.but anyway at least somebody still cares to write on Prince?

Still, it was written in Tolstoy's simple style. It took me more than a few chapters to realize that the principal character (e.g the pilgrim) was meeting representative's of all aspects of humanity...and having great conversations with each one of them...focusing on the spiritual for the most part...every one learned from him, and he learned something from everyone, as it should be.

It seems people are drawn to the ritual of the Jesus Prayer itself, without regard for Jesus' teachings. Jesus said the most important commandment is to love God with all your heart, your soul and your mind. I think this prayer can help you achieve that to some degree. However, he said a second commandment is equally important, to love your neighbor as yourself. This prayer puts all the focus inward on the self, maybe some upward toward God, and absolutely none toward loving your neighbor. Several times in the book, the pilgrim actively avoids contact with others so that he can isolate himself and focus on his prayer. Several people are quite kind to him in the process, and although he shows gratitude to them, he does little to help others and make the world around him better, which Jesus clearly calls us to do. All that said, I do think it is an interesting read and can promote healthy spiritual debate and discussion."},{"Title":"The Way of a Pilgrim and the Pilgrim Continues His Way","review":"I liked this book for its honesty and simplicity. For me, it wasn't about Chrisitianity, or looking for God, or finding greater meaning in life, or all that bs.Seeing it in this light would have probably ruined it for me as just another &quot;spiritual quest for more&quot;/self help/ motivational narrative to be read again and again in grips of euphoria.

Many spiritual practices recommend the use mantras extensively for &quot;mind protection.&quot; The faith of this man, and the intensity of his endeavors shows the results of this simple but profound spiritual practice.

Writing in 1956 he adds that this copy is longer than the existing printed version with five extra episodes and a postscript.The first printed version came out in Kazan in 1884 and was called &quot;Sincere Tales of a Pilgrim to His Spiritual Father&quot;. The introduction of this version tells it to be a reproduction of manuscript which Paisius, abbot of St. Michael of the Cheremissi, found and copied on Mount Athos. Paisius died in 1883.Bolshakoff writes further that he found the above when he was studying the correspondence of Fr. Jerome Solomentsev. He concludes that the pilgrim perhaps visited Mount Athos and wrote or dictated his story for Fr. Jerome.However, the above is not the whole history. Bolshakoff found further new information on the pilgrim from two letters of Staretz Ambrose of Optino to a nun who was a prioress of a convent and who had read the manuscript of the Tales before it was printed in Kazan.Bolshakoff: &quot;In his letter Staretz Ambrose writes: &quot;You write that you came across a manuscript which indicates a simple method to learn the Prayer of Jesus, vocal, mental, and of heart. This manuscript was written by a peasant from the province of Orel who was taught the Prayer of Jesus by an unknown Staretz. You write that the manuscript of this peasant ends in 1859. Shortly before that time we heard from our late staretz, Father Macarius, that he was visited by a layman who had attained to such a high degree of spiritual prayer that Fr. Macarius did not know what to tell him. This layman, in order to receive advice, described to our staretz various states of prayer. Fr Macarius could only tell him: 'Be humble' be humble'. Afterwards he told us about this experience with astonishement.

What I really liked about this book is its simplicity. It stars a simple peasant who gives up all of his posessions to worship Jesus, after all.But more than that, the writing sytle is very warm and simple. It is written in first person. Simple thoughts with a lot of meaning, I think.For instance the peasant writes about how he feels joy when he first begins the Jesus prayer, but remembers when he was warned by someone in the church not to be fooled, because when someone starts the Jesus prayer they're overwhelmed with superficial emotions. That's the part that has really stayed with me, for some reason. It resonated with me so well because well, I think we all know what that's like; getting all excited for something and thinking it's going to be a major passion in your life and then it turns out it doesn't matter much in a month.Now, I must admit I was tempted to follow the jesus prayer (this was before I decided to practice Judaism) and it is heart warming.

Historically, the eastern church (Ortodoxy) is one whose theology is synonymous with mysticism, something that comes across in \\"The Way of the Pilgrim\\" thru the Jesus Prayer and Philokalia. The western church (Catholic and Protestant) emphasis is more on systemic theology and doctrinal formulations.Author:The author is unknown. Father Thomas Hopko (from famous Orthodox Seminary St. Vladimir in New York), who write the forward, states that \\"whatever the origin and intention of the anonymous author's fascinating story\\" the pilgrim's way \\"affirms first of all that the source, goal and content of human life is ... the living God Himself.\\"Content:The spiritual way of this pilgrim tells us \\"that life is communion with God ... a ceaseless prayer in pursuit of God and communion with him.\\" It also tells us that \\"Jesus Christ is this life.\\"The pilgrimage starts with an honest question: \\"What does it mean to pray without ceasing?\\" (as the pilgrim had heard during Liturgy; 1 Thes. 5:17, Eph. 6:18, 1 Tim. 2:18). He searches long for an answer to his questions of \\"how one is to pray unceasingly and what is the nature of this sort of prayer.\\"He travels with a Bible that is very dear to him (which he had been reading from early childhood) and a sack of dried bread crumbs and some water. Once he learns of the \\"Jesus Prayer\\" that the holy Church Fathers had written about, he realizes that \\"the prayer began to move of its own accord from my lips into my heart.\\" He states that \\"calling on the name of Jesus now filled my days with joys\\" and everytime a spirit of sorrow, fatigue, doubt came over him, repeating \\"the Jesus Prayer\\" helps him to turn his mind and heart to God and fills him with divine peace and joy. The pilgrim also learns and acquires the Philokalia, a collection of deep spiritual writings from the Christians of the East. Thus the Pilgrim's progress is a life of reading the Bible, having a life of prayer, and contemplating on the spiritual gems found in the Philokalia.Conclusion:If you believe that \\"we are all pilgrims on a journey to God\\", as the forward to \\"The Way of the Pilgrim\\" states, than your spiritual life will be enriched by this Christian classic.\\"Lord Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\" Doamne ajuta!

Far from being a highfaultin' work of theology, its theme is simply the ability of any individual to dwell in the presence of God.The author of the account speaks of how one day in a sermon he heard St Paul's exhortation to \\"pray without ceasing\\", and he wondered how that might be possible. When he asks the question of the abbot of a nearby monastery, the wise old monk introduces the pilgrim to the tradition of the prayer of the heart, or \\"Jesus prayer\\". The pilgrim wanders all over Russia, as far as Irkutsk in the east of Siberia. His account gives us an enjoyable account of Russian peasant life of the time. As he journeys about, he reads much of the Philokalia, the classic compendium of mystical writings by Orthodox saints. Essentially, the Jesus prayer is an attempt to come closer to God through ceaseless repetition of the phrase \\"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\" In the initial steps of his prayer life, the pilgrim says this first hundreds and then thousands of times a day. But the Jesus prayer is no mantra, having intrisic value in its, nor is it \\"vain repetition\\". Rather, the prayer is meant to guide the Christian into a ceaseless longing for God in his heart. Without that centering in the heart, speaking the words of the prayer is an empty gesture.The work is an important representation of Orthodoxy to non-Orthodox, and it dispells two popular misconceptions about the Church. One is the accusation made by some Protestants that Orthodoxy is ritualism mediated by a priest, and does not teach a personal relationship by God. You could hardly have a greater relationship with God than calling upon him every waking (and sleeping) hour. The other misconception is that Christianity has no mystical tradition comparable to the East, but THE WAY OF A PILGRIM, once you get past its rather staid prose, will reveal profound teachings on prayer and meditation that the hippest Hindu or Buddhist fads are the palest reflections of.The book does have a sequel, \\"A Pilgrim Continues His Way\\", which is published together with THE WAY OF A PILGRIM in some editions. I have not read this yet, and I say that if you can't find an edition with it, don't worry, as the main text has more than enough to keep you occupied. THE WAY OF A PILGRIM is a common introductory reading recommended by Orthodox priests to inquirers and converts in English-speaking countries, and I can heartily recommend it. I should note however that the Philokalia, to which the author often refers, was written for monastics and is generally considered dangerous to read without the guidance of a spiritual father."},{"Title":"The Way of a Pilgrim and the Pilgrim Continues His Way","review":"In his first letter to the Thessalonians, Paul writes \\"Pray without ceasing,\\" (1 Thes 5:17) and in his letter to the Ephesians, he writes \\"Pray at all times in the Spirit.\\" (Eph 6:18) What does it mean to pray at all times without ceasing? Can it be done? These are the questions asked by the pilgrim, the main character of The Way of the Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues his Way, two books written in the late nineteenth century by an anonymous Russian Christian. The pilgrim character tells of his journeys through Russia as he seeks to learn to pray unceasingly.Through the telling of his tale, the pilgrim shares much about prayer. The focus of prayer is The Jesus Prayer, and the goal for the pilgrim is to continually pray this prayer from his heart. The writer introduces lessons on prayer and the Christian life through other characters such as priests, wise teachers called \\"starets\\" and other Christian travelers who share their stories of faith. The pilgrim carries two books with him that are his sole possessions on the earth and his treasures. These are The Bible and a book of Eastern Church Fathers called The Philokalia. The narrator references both books to provide lessons on prayer.His journey reveals what he learns about prayer. Through the book, the narrator reveals several lessons about prayer for reflection and practice. The main theme is ceaseless prayer.An older teacher shares with the pilgrim that, as Paul writes to the Romans, \\"we know not what we should pray for as we ought.\\" (Rom 8:26) The teacher advises that the perfection of prayer is not within our power, but we can pray often and always. The teacher then shares The Jesus Prayer with the pilgrim,\\"The continuous interior prayer of Jesus is a constant uninterrupted calling upon the name of Jesus with the lips, in the spirit, in the heart, while forming a mental picture of His constant presence, and the imploring of His grace, during every occupation, at all times, in all places, even during sleep. The appeal is couched in these terms, \`Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.'\\" (Pilgrim 9)The pilgrim begins by practicing saying the above prayer thousands of times a day. With much effort and by the rejection of other thoughts and doubts, he develops the habit of saying it continually. He first says it with his lips and mind. Later in the book a teacher shares with him the expanded form of the Jesus Prayer, \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\"(Pilgrim 135) His teacher explains that in this form of the prayer, the entire Gospel and way to salvation is represented.Through his interactions with others and his reading, the pilgrim continues to learn about The Jesus Prayer and its effects. He shares the following,\\"What the Gospel is, that the prayer of Jesus is also, for the Divine Name of Jesus Christ holds in itself the whole gospel truth. The holy Fathers say that the prayer of Jesus is a summary of the Gospels.\\"(Pilgrim 27)This explains why the prayer so effective for those who pray it in combating their spiritual enemies and producing the fruits of the Spirit in their heart.The author emphasizes that God's grace drives prayer and rewards prayer. He urges those he speaks with to make attempts at prayer and ask God to help them. He does not belittle even the feeblest attempts at prayer. For the author, every intention of ours and every movement of ours toward God are valuable to God. He summarizes his thoughts,\\"The love of God gives grace a thousand fold more than human actions deserve. If you give Him the merest mite, He will pay you back with gold. If you but purpose to go to the Father, He will come out to meet you. You say but a word, short and unfeeling--\`Receive me, have mercy on me'--and He falls on your neck and kisses you. That is what the love of the heavenly Father is like toward us, unworthy as we are.\\" (Pilgrim 117)This is an important spiritual value for the pilgrim that he tries to practice and teach. God gives us grace to come to Him, and when we come, he pours out more grace upon us.The Way of the Pilgrim and The Pilgrim Continues His Way summarize the Bible's lesson on prayer. The author illustrates that prayer leads us to Christ and the Father and is itself inspired and initiated by the Holy Spirit within us. The author has included many scriptures about prayer. He shows systematically how the New Testament encourages prayer. He offers a lesson on how prayer empowers us to do good works, so that the term, \\"Pray and do and think what you will\\" is reasonable and sensible for the Christian who prays sincerely.The book offers a way of life that is hidden in Christ through a continual praying from the heart to Christ. The author shows how it is possible and beneficial to pray continually as prescribed by Scripture.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"The Way of a Pilgrim and the Pilgrim Continues His Way","review":"Wow.

Not being a very talented linguist, I have in the course of five years accumulated an expensive pile of well known Greek courses, texts, and tapes. Only two have done me much good. This book is one of them; the other is 'Learn Ancient Greek' by Peter Jones. The contrast between the two could not be greater, although they do both have the overwhelming common advantage of having been written by expert teachers with a sense of humour (Peter Jones is wacky, sardonic, and Pythonesque; John Taylor is dry and subtle.) While LAG is very dynamic and gets into idiomatic Greek very quickly (eg, second aorist early on), by finding a very tight critical path through the material, G2GCSE takes the expected slow systematic approach with a shrewd eye as to what will trip up someone like me. LAG on the one hand gives answers to the exercises, but on the other hand the other not. Consequently, I found these two a very good informal partnership--well, at least I can say 'Hello' in Greek and read some Socrates and gospels now. I can also read the menu in the restaurants in Cyprus which impresses the waitresses no end but I don't know what they really think of my 2000-year old antique pronunciation.Book One of this series took me 18 months of self-teaching to complete and covers the following: the verb 'to be'; present tense verbs (not contract); all three noun declensions; definite article; future tense; imperfect tense; aorist 1 and 2; present participle; aorist participle; numerals; expressing time; possessive dative; future participle; and tis/ti, autos, pas, and oudeis. Vocab totals 275 words. The Greek to English sentences are cunningly chosen to exercise the full range of variants, and the English to Greek are designed to push the brain into the next gear but you don't have to do them--but I did and I am a better man for it. The Greek translation passages are well known fables and fascinating slices of less well known history. Try telling the fable of the king of the frogs to a child, and you will suddenly feel the mind of the ancient Greek formed in you coming alive! Quite a shock really."},{"Title":"Greek to GCSE, Part 2","review":"Amazon has made something of a mess with this book: Greek to GCSE is divided in two parts which can be bought but not reviewed separately.This review is based on the first part only and will be edited as soon as I have finished the second part.In Italy there are no tools for the self study of Latin and Greek: all handbooks, some good, some better, require a very competent teacher and much determination because of the very sound, comprehensive but oh-so-dull approach and exercises.This book, as stated in its introduction by the author (and by its title which refers to the British syllabus), is meant for classroom use and has no answer key so be warned in advance.Nonetheless the author is clearly an extremely experienced didactitian:his approach -traditional as it may appear- is sensible, matter of fact. Mr Taylor knows EXACTLY were pupils are likely to have troubles and concentrates on those points: his explanations are neat and easy to understand; his excercises are short and to the point with a clever use of a limited vocabulary.This approach suited my needs of adult trying to learn ancient Greek on his own: there were sentences, especially the English to Greek translations, where I would have welcomed an answer key, but they were not many. All in all I was able to finish Part 1 of the course under the impression of having retained most of it.All the above does not mean you will learn with no effort: learning any language is a difficult task, even for those like me who are strongly motivated: you will need time and concentration and some optimism to overcome frustration at hard to understand grammatical items.A criticism I could make is that I would have liked MORE excercises but this is my own thing. Mr Taylor in his introduction is very clear: this book is NOT meant for full courses in grammar schools but for those schools where Greek has to be fitted somewhere in the timetable.Another criticism is that accents are only introduced in the sixth chapter, but then again this is common in Anglo-American textbooks: I cannot understand why it must be so but you cannot complain too loudly if Mr Taylor simply follows suit, not to mention that he, at least, introduces them.This book being a textbook could explain the bad quality of the book itself.The binding is solid enough, but a sewn spine would have guaranteed more comfort of reading.The paper is of poor quality, blinding white in colour, the inking is no more than mediocre and the font just tolerable: you can imagine the fun of reading under artificial light!The layout of the pages is utterly unappealing, different paragraphs and or sections ill distinguishable. Texts are not even justified on the right margin!Books like these need to catch and keep the eye of the reader who is supposedly going to refer to them for many years: beauty and clarity of typesetting are NOT an optional feature, not if they are expensive as is the case here."},{"Title":"Greek to GCSE, Part 2","review":"I minored in Latin in college (which was a long time ago), and since then I've made various short-lived attempts to tackle ancient Greek.

I bought Greek to GCSE to see if I could use it to teach him and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived by its content.While we're on summer break I've been going through the book and doing the exercises to get myself more familiar with what I'll be teaching. I really like the style of the book and find the exercises interesting and not overwhelming. I like the pace that new words and concepts are introduced and don't feel like I'm drowning in new stuff before mastering the previous material. I like that it is spiral and when you learn new words and translate sentences, the author makes sure to include words from previous lessons instead of just keeping to the new words. I've learned quite a bit in a short time. I can of course work much quicker than my son, but I don't mind taking it at a slower pace for him.One issue I have is that there should be an answer key. Some of the sentences don't make much sense when translated, so I have to modify them to fit English, but I don't know if I'm doing it correctly. I could have the sentence totally wrong for all I know. A translation of them in the back or even in a separate book would be welcome. Fortunately, Google translate has Greek and I can type the sentences in if I'm not certain. The only problem of course is that you have to pull down a Greek keyboard (on the translate page) and tap in each letter, one at a time, by hovering the mouse over the letter and clicking. This is incredibly time consuming.I also wish the author had included a phonetic pronunciation for the words in the vocabulary list at the end of the book. I can of course sound them out, as Greek is pretty literal, but knowing where to enunciate the word would be helpful.Overall though, it's a good book for learning Greek and I'm happy I found it."},{"Title":"Avishag","review":"The author writes from a knowledgable standpoint in the eyes of a handmaiden often forgotten until you re-read the Bible itself.

We wonder what kinds of interactions they really did have. I felt myself going back to another time and place. Sometimes it's hard to visualize stories from the Bible without a kick-start. It's difficult for most of us to put a 'face' to those names in the Bible. The names are difficult for us to even pronounce.A book like this reminds us that they really existed.

I think that is a pretty neat aspect of the book.Although it reads a bit like the screenplay for an episode of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" sans Eddie Haskell, it reads well and it is easy to understand the shooting information provided. One might think it is a bit dated due to the 1947 era information provided, but the basics are all applicable to the current smallbore game.

Argenis was a phenomenal best-seller in the first half of the seventeenth century, and was translated into many vernaculars. Yet it has been relatively neglected by modern scholarship, in part because until now there has not been a reliable modern edition of the text. Riley and Huber have certainly provided such an edition. They have constituted an accurate and well punctuated Latin text, which they have equipped with a facing-page English translation. This English version was originally published just a few years after the first Latin edition. Hence even in the translation the seventeenth-century aspect of the work has been preserved. The editors have composed a detailed and highly informative introduction, that by itself will be an important reference work on Barclay and Neo-Latin fiction. This is a very important publication, and the editors have done justice to their task. Their work should be a model for other editions of a similar kind."},{"Title":"Upsetting the Balance (Worldwar Series, Volume 3)","review":"Harry Turtledove has definitely found the right balance (no pun intended) between Alternate history, Sci-fi, and Military Techno-thrillers. This book (the third in a four part series) Keeps the reader constantly wondering &quot;what's next?&quot;. In fact the unpredictability of main characters fates is what makes this story so interesting. Some hard core Sci-fi fans may find the plot and alien gee-whiz gizmos tame compared to other outer space invader novels, but for those who like Tom Clancy and Larry Bond type Military Techno thrillers, this book has action aplenty, and enough different story lines to keep readers from becoming bored. The aliens employ weaponry which seems to be based loosely on today's military technology, making it easier for average people to imagine how the stuff works. The author has also obviously done his homework on the geographical areas mentioned and the life and times of people who lived during the World War II era. The detailed way people, places, and events are described leaves little to the imagination, putting the reader right there with the characters. Overall this reviewer found this to be the best of the three novels so far, although it doesn't really stand on it's own, so the first two books in the series need to be read in order first to really appreciate it. This reader eagerly anticipates the release of the last of this four part series &quot;Worldwar; Striking the Balance&quot;. The only negative comments about this series so far is the time between releases as another reader has already mentioned. It's probably a marketing ploy to sell as many hardbacks as possible, then bring out the new book about the same time the last one comes out in paperback.

Having the information presented through this framework is useful.Also incredibly useful are the various appendices throughout the book, including legislation, FCC policy, and other documents relevant to the authors' concerns.I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone with interest in the decline of localism in US radio. For those already well versed, I might pass."},{"Title":"Parables for Preachers: The Gospel of Matthew-Year A","review":"Barbara Reid's books on \`Parables for Preachers' follow the Revised Common Lectionary. Because of this, the book for Year A concentrates primarily on the texts of the gospel of Matthew. Before getting into the heart of the texts, Reid presents introductory material on parables, preaching, and the gospel of Matthew. Reid states in her introduction, \`In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus rarely explains his parables. They are meant to be wrestled with by each generation of hearers who allow themselves to be disturbed and challenged by Jesus' subversive stories.'Subversive stories? One of the things that comfortable Christianity has sometimes forgotten is the revolutionary and radical character of Jesus and his teaching in the first century. Perhaps this is because the teachers are so familiar. How does one find new meanings in familiar parables that show up again and again? This is a particularly important question for preachers, and Reid addresses it directly.The term \`parable' can refer to a range of types of speech - it goes beyond the simple moral stories similar to Aesop's fables. As Reid says of the gospel of Matthew, \`in one sense, the whole gospel can be regarded as a parable.'Jesus, of course, was not the first to preach or teach in parables. In doing this, he was following an ancient and honoured tradition. This is a tradition that may be continued by modern teachers and preachers. Reid illustrates several ways in which parables serve to carry a message. They provide a way for Jesus to explain his experience of God and holiness without boxing it into academic or dogmatic statements. It helps connect the encounter with the holy with the common people and their daily lives. \`In his parables, Jesus always began with the familiar. The images and situations he painted in his stories were from the fabric of daily life of his audience.'Of course, Jesus' parables were broad and inclusive - nothing was outside the scope of God's realm. While parables began with the familiar, they never lingered there. They served to recast \`common' creation in a new way - the realm of God. Of course, this then begs for interpretation, which is never as straightforward and simple as some preachers would have it seem. \`What catches up with the hearer is that Jesus' parables are usually open-ended; Jesus rarely interpreted these stories for his disciples.... Because they are told in figurative language, the parables are capable of conveying distinct message to different people in diverse circumstances.'Other aspects of parables that are key to their meaning include that they are not neutral, but always have a slant or bias, often toward the more marginal in society. They are a communal endeavour, and not really meant for individualists (something that Western society tends to forget). Parables are short, which makes for easier recollection - they are small like seeds, from which much may grow. Also, the final aspect of parables is similar to that of preaching - they are meant to be heard and lived, not simply forgotten.Understanding how to interpret parables involves several things Reid highlights. They involve understanding the gospels themselves, in their own setting. The nature of the gospels is important - what kind of writing is this, and what is its purpose? Parables fall within gospel literature, so yet another level of understanding is required. Reid gives a quick overview of different modes of interpretation, including allegorical, historical criticism, social science study, linguistic and literary approaches, as well as the new forms of liberation interpretation. Reid is quick to underscore that \`no one method provides the definitive key.' These methods are guides, but ultimately we are all charged with engaging the parables for ourselves and our communities.As this text deals with the gospel of Matthew, Reid continues with a chapter looking at the gospel of Matthew, from issues of authorship, historical and social setting, documentary transmission and analysis, theological issues and overall purpose. The theological ideas of Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology vary from gospel to gospel, as do some of the texts of the same stories. Reid states that, \`from the beginning, Matthew has been the gospel most used by the Church in its worship.' It holds pride of place in the ordering of the gospels (despite the fact that Mark may be the earliest gospel), and needs to be treated with care for new generations, particularly in a post-Christian world with ever-deepening dialogues between Jewish and Christian peoples.The remainder of the book looks at particular parables, seventeen in all, as they appear sequentially in the liturgical year. There is a chapter devoted to each one. These include parables both in the Sunday lectionary as well as the daily cycle of readings. Each section gives attention to major images, theological themes, narrative devsices, and a helpful list of preaching possibilities. This book does not provide set sermons, nor does it emphasise one theological approach exclusive to others.Overall, this book is a very handy guide to anyone who reads the gospels, who is interested in preaching, or is interested in understanding more about one of the primary teaching/preaching devices of Jesus. Reid writes with clarity, sensitivity and care on her subjects. While she does tend toward a liberal interpretation of scripture, even evangelical and fundamentalists can find inspiration here, given that parables have never been meant to have literal interpretations placed upon them, and the multi-valent character of parables practically begs for as broad a range as possible for study. To that end, Reid has provided a generous bibliography for further research.A pearl of great price, indeed."},{"Title":"Parables for Preachers: The Gospel of Matthew-Year A","review":"I had the great fortune to hear Barbara Reid speak at our campus this spring. Her insights into the parable of the woman with the alabaster jar planted a seed of wisdom that has already born fruit in my life. I bought the book to help deepen my &quot;lectio divina&quot; with scripture and am truly delighted that I did so. The parables are presented first, so one can study them without having to have a Bible present. Then Sr. Reid presents various lenses for interpreting the parables. I found the presentation of these differing lenses immensely helpful because they allowed me to see and understand each parable in a new light. It was like reading them for the first time. In addition, I appreciated the absence of one interpretation being claimed to be the &quot;right&quot; one. Rather, I allowed my own meditation to guide me toward the interpretation that best fit my situation. This is truly an excellent book, and I hope to soon purchase her other books in this series."},{"Title":"Le Noel de Caroline","review":"We love the Caroline stories, and have the majority of them in French or English. Most are charming, the antics of the animals and illustrations are delightful.This story is a bit of an odd duck-I'm glad I read it through before giving it to my little one. It starts as a shopping trip to buy a tree, and then gets scary. There is a mysterious note to meet in a secluded forest to get a free tree...and there they are accused of stealing, hauled away and then tied up in a blanket and dragged off. It ends ok, with a generous benefactor sharing a feast with them. I can't help but think the author's wartime trauma of being hauled off and imprisoned has informed this book. It is not for the younger readers, certainly.That said, I highly recommend other Caroline stories, particularlyCaroline Visite Paris (French Edition),Caroline in Europe (A Big Golden Book), andCaroline Aux Sports D'Hiver (French Edition), if you can find them."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Foundations of Statistics (Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction and Decision Theory)","review":"This book,by Kadane,Schervish,and Seidenfeld(KSS),is mistitled.A correct title is \\"Rethinking the Logical Foundations of Subjectivist,Bayesian Statistics\\".The book is composed of 16 essays,all of which have been previously published in academic journals and/or other books.Throughout the book,the authors concede that there are many holes and deficiencies in the logical foundations of the subjectivist approach.The biggest hole is vastly understated by KSS:\\"In fact,it seems reasonable to deny that there are consequences in practical decisions.Thus,our position is that,lacking consequences,expected utility theory must treat probability distributions as extraneous(italicized)...\\"(KSS,1999,p.195).Of course,\\"...lacking consequences...\\" means that the outcomes are state independent.On pp.157-160,KSS had already demonstrated the near impossibility in the real world of being able to specify outcomes that would make their utilities state independent.Given that the subjective probabilities are completely extraneous,there is no longer any way in which the a priori beliefs of a decision maker can be represented by a unique probability distribution on purely decision theoretic grounds alone.This means that unique,definite,precise,numerical ,single number estimates of subjective probabilities do not exist.This result goes to the heart of the entire edifice erected by Ramsey,De Finetti,and Savage,in particular.Savage argued that,based on a careful elicitation of subjective preferences based on betting quotients,a unique probability measure(distribution)can be defined to represent the agent's preference relation.Nowhere is it stated by KSS that this position( of Savage) goes to the heart of the dispute ,between Keynes and Ramsey on the one hand, and Savage and Ellsberg on the other hand.The comparative -interval estimate-approach to estimating probabilities,presented by Keynes for the first time in the A Treatise on Probability(TP;1921),is fully operational since all of the problems that used the difficult Boolean approach can instead use the substantially easier integer-mixed integer linear programming approach in order to obtain solutions.It appears that Savage's approach is a very special case of Ellsberg's(Keynes's) approach that is applicable only when a single,unique probability distribution can be specified a priori. KSS's technical result,first presented in 1990 in the Journal of the American Statistical Association(JASA), completely undermines the logical ,decision theoretic foundations of the subjectivist approach to estimating probabilities."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Garden Center Management","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer who gave a 3 star rating due to &quot;it's of some value if you're starting a Garden Center, but otherwise...&quot;A quick scan of the content plainly featured on the back cover of the book clearly defines itself.

This is what kept me so enthralled and caused me to stay up all night finishing it. The story was so awesome.Now as you noticed, I did knock one star off. The reason was due to the heroine. I really did like her, but I was a little bothered that she was getting so easily distracted by sex instead of focusing on her lost brother. I wish the author had used some restraint there. It also gets confusing when the author tries to portray her as a strong and independent women some of the time, and then just the opposite the next moment.I can say I absolutely loved Darius in this.

Her world was fascinating though. I will certainly read the next in the series.Perhaps I am a bit of a prude though, as I just felt like I couldn't connect with the extensive sex scenes.

Darius is alpha male, determine, good looking (naturally) and sometimes a little arrogant but then that is what makes him so desirable. If you want mad, passionate sex throughout the book, forget it. This book is deeper than that. I found it hard to put down. Would I recommend this book to a friend....certainly. If I lent it out to a friend, I would make darn sure that I got it back! I love most of Gena Showalter's books."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"For some reason could not get into the storyline or the characters. Too much stuff happening all over the place with no real relation between any of it. The characters are unbelieveable and the situations were so forced. The concept could have been good but somehow got all lost and boring. Read all 4 books in this series only because I got them all at one time. Will not be reading anymore Showalter's stuff."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Gena Showalter's Lords of the Underworld is at the top of my automatically purchase list.Then a friend offered me the Atlantis series, I hesitated only because I didn't think it could standup against her other series. Although, the Lords is still my favorite of the two - I have added the Atlantis series to my must read list.If you like Kelsey Cole's Immortals After Dark series...I recommend picking up this series.If you like Gena Showalter's Lords of the Underworld...I recommend expanding your collection to include this series.My only negative comment is that unlike the strong female leads in the Lords of the Underworld, Grace seemed a little wishy-washy. I only hope that Ms. Showalter puts more into future Heroines."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Heart of the Dragon was a wonderful read. I especially liked the way Showalter weaved the storyline of between the characters, mythology and present day. It kept me fully engaged to the very end. The sex was spicy without being over the top.I really enjoyed the Atlantis series. I bought the entire set of books so that I could read them in order and I can't wait for the next book to be released."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"While running for her life through the Amazon jungle, Grace Carlyle accidently finds herself running through a portal that leads to another world. She soon discovers that Atlantis is more than just a myth. Plus, it's inhabited by shape-shifting dragons. Darius en Kragin is the leader of this people and the Guardian of this particular portal. His duty is to kill any traveler who comes through the gate, a duty that he has never failed at, until he sees Grace.For some reason he can't bring himself to kill her. Instead, he imprisons her in his palace. Darius tells himself that it's only because he needs to find out where Grace got the dragonnecklace that she's wearing. When Grace manages to escape, Darius goes after her. In the process of getting her back, he discovers that there is a conspiracy between humans and vampires to take over Atlantis and steal it's wealth. A conspiracy which has already claimed the life of Darius's mentor, leaving control of the other portal in human and vampire hands. Now Darius has to come to grips with his feelings for Grace and wrest control of the portal from the invaders.Heart of the Dragon is a paranormal romance lovers dream. It has it all: vampires, shape-shifting dragons, Atlantis, sexy love scenes, and emotional intensity. Within the first 3 pages, I cared about Darius and wanted his happiness. I didn't stop rooting for him until the story was over. Grace is spunky without being grating, and was the perfect heroine forDarius. Add to this a cliffhanger for a future story featuring Atlantis and the Dragons. Gena Showalter delivers another winner with Heart of the Dragon!MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I actually liked this one more than The Stone Prince, even though this one was not nearly as funny. It was way more serious, but had a dry funny undertone here and there. Grace is lost in the Amazon jungle where she had gone to find her brother. Her guide attempted to steal her things and abandon her (tried--since she loaded his running butt with bullets.) Then she stumbles into a fog and cave and comes out in the hidden world of Atlantis. Yep, Atlantis. Only to face a the swinging sword of its guardian.Fortunately for her its Gardian, Darius, decides not to kill her. I mean, how can he? For over two centuries he had been unable to see color, smell scents, taste anything. Yet, he can see the red of this beautiful woman's hair. He can smell her body, and boy does she taste good.Very sexually heated story, but it's not all about sex. Darius' world is under attack by greedy humans and vampires that want to take control. Grace's brother is a prisoner of same said people and it is up to the two of them to join forces and find the answers to defeat the threat.Very fast pace. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Extra crispy love story but a little soggy when it comes to the plot. Now don't get me wrong, I love alternate beauty meets the beast/sexy dragon shape shifter as much as any other girl but I found major flaws when it came to the main characters. Grace, our spunky heroin needed to get her priorities striate. She's searching for her lost brother and yet through out the book it seems all she wants to do is get laid. How could anyone think about sex when their only brother has disappeared? It kind of bothered me how one minute she's a proud, sassy, resourceful female and then the next she turns into a weak lovesick puppy who lust over a man who pretty much tells her \`I\`m going to do what I want to you when I want whether you like it or not.' and she answers by saying \`Well okay'. Come on, show some dignity girl!And then there's Darius, your average tragic hero. For three hundred years he shows no emotions whatsoever then suddenly in walks Grace then BAM! He's angry, sad, smiles and gets a hard-on all within the first five minutes of seeing her! Where's the development? The suspense? I know 90% of paranormal romance novels center around sex but come on! Give them a little time to develop their relationship first. By chapter four they were already all over each other so by the time their big love scenes came around the reward wasn't as gratifying as it should of been."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Ms. Showalter continues to turn out fantastical pleasers! In her latest sci-fi romance she builds a believable Atlantis and a world full of mythical creatures that inhabit it. The dominant creatures in this lush land are the dragons, changlings that normally appear human but can change to their more reptillian self in an instant. King of the dragons is Darius. 300 years ago his family was slaughtered by travelers from the rest of the world and before he could even morn their loss he was installed as the Guardian of the Mist, forced to slaughter any who came through the portal into their world.Staggering haphazardly through the wilds of the rain forest is Grace, a twenty something looking for life...though she can't even find her brother. He's some where out here, but before she has time to search the funny necklace he gave her pulls her to some glowing mist- which leads to a crazy,although yummy, man with a sword!While Darius knows he has to thrust his sword into Grace for the sake of his people, he really feels like stabbing her with something else and can't keep his lips off her! Denied color, smell, & taste for three centurys, Grace is a sensory explosion. Darius will do anything to save her AND his world. If that means traveling to her world or fighting off a deadly menace of vampires, so be it."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I was intrigued by the premise of a heroine finding her way accidentally into Atlantis and meet this sexy uber-warrior who stood as sentinel to protect Atlantis from infection through contact with our world.However, while the character of Darius en Kragin is certainly dishy, as well as his dragon-brothers who will doubtlessly all have their own spinoff tales in the coming months, the heroine is a complete disappointment.Does she speak to most every woman who stares at her own reflection with chagrin to find freckles where flawless skin should be? Sure.Does she resemble alot of us ladies who know we carry a few extra pounds and want to be desired in spite of this society reinforced 8th deadly sin? Sure.My problem with Grace's character is that she's an idiot. Her attempts to escape her imprisonment in Darius' lair is meant to show courage and tenacity, but all it shows is that she's a moron who can't think through a problem, all she can do is crawl the walls like spastic chimp.All throughout this drudging plot she looks to Darius to make things right, to help her find her brother and unravel the mystery of what happened to the other sentinel and his dragon-stud army, and instead of truly being a help, she's a bungling idiot. She causes him more trouble than she helps him out, which, if I am not mistaken, is the antithesis of what a courageous heroine is supposed to do.Sure, she gives Darius plenty of opportunity to pull her freckled, pudgy butt out of the proverbial fire, but I thought the whole idea of writing a fantasy romance was to transport the reader with a great story, not annoy them with how lame the heroine is.Overall, while there were a rare few moments of genuine originality in the premise, the hero was a winner while his lady fair was a loser, and since I'm the first one to root for the chubby, freckled heroine to get the hot, gorgeous hero, this was a dreadful disappointment."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This author is capable of much better. The characters are cookie cutter cut outs, the whole atlantean male 'dragon' deal is too pat, and the 'mystery' is really, really badly done. If I can figure out the mystery practically as soon as the problem is mentioned, as well as predict much of the plot (not kidding) it is way too predictable a book. And I found it uninteresting in teh world building, which will usually carry me through to the next page. Nope, sorry, this is not worth even the price I paid for it used."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"First I'll say I enjoyed the book and I read the whole thing. I am intrigued by the premise of a real Atlantis, and I definitely enjoyed the novel as an exploration of shape-shifting.I'm giving it three stars because it was a good way to pass an afternoon and I'm not sorry I read it. However, I'm a big one for re-reading books I enjoyed and I'm not sure that Heart of the Dragon merits a re-reading. I was never engrossed enough that I was desperate to know what happens next and wanted to skip ahead to make sure everything turned out ok before returning to my skip point able to read at a normal pace.This is billed as the first Atlantis book, but as far as the explanations about other races and how the culture of Atlantis worked, it felt like I was stepping into the middle of a series - I felt like I was missing some information.I liked the hero and the heroine, but the heroine was something of a disappointment in that she didn't seem able to help solve the novel's conflict. I felt like she kept getting in the way and making more problems, needing to be rescued by the super-capable Darius.And finally, there's the eye roll factor... almost any romance story will make me roll my eyes at some point, usually due to the choice of descriptive language or to sappiness of dialogue, but this one merited four or five different eye rolls.**SPOILERS BELOW**I was a little surprised when the lustful pair decided they loved each other; I mean, I knew that was going to happen, but I didn't see enough build up that it seemed natural and appropriate. There was lust lust lust and overpowering attraction, then suddenly after a bit of kissing and a day of being tethered to each other they're in love. I wasn't sold that they had seen enough of each other to go so far as getting married. A woman of this modern day and age being so willing to jump into marriage and a whole new world with a man she barely knew? I wasn't convinced. And for Grace and Alex to blithely declare they will transplant their mother and aunt to Atlantis, I thought, was awfully cavalier, and somewhat unrealistic. (Yes, I know, complaining about realism in a paranormal story may seem absurd, yet I do expect realism in regard to human emotions.) Grace's mother was depicted as being cold and not open to change, yet her children thought to uproot her and move her permanently to a new world? Of course, their mother's transition to and discovery of purpose in a new life could be the subject of a whole novel on it's own...I liked the stuff about the brother, but the addition of the subplot of the romance between him and a female dragon was not as fleshed out as I would have liked. It felt unfinished."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This is a prequel to Jewel of Atlantis, although I think this book came after Jewel...regardless, Heart of the Dragon is the first I read.

Lords deals with mythology, and those characters have a depth, and the writing has many unique layers, with a hefty amount of romance...I figured this series might compare.It didn't for me...sort of fluff? Can I say that. Not sure how to put it into words, the book wasn't terrible, but certainly nothing unique. I will not continue with the rest of this series, but do look forward to her next installment of LOU in May 09."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This book was so good and I couldn't put it down. I actually stayed up until 4am in the morning to finish it. It was funny, passionate and fast moving. Definitely, worth buying. The Chemistry between Darius and Grace is sizzling. What makes it so touching is that you see conflict of emotions between what his mind (duty as a guardian) is telling him to do and what he heart is telling him. There is also a secondary story in there about Grace's brother Alex. I love the fact that it has an Atlantis twist with Greek mythology but also brings in other mythic creatures. I would love to see Gena do something with the other King who fought with Darius in the end.

The dialog was juvenile (in my opinion) and I wasn't interested in either character. No depth. Darius came across as a grunting, snorting idiot who did nothing but give orders and threats. If there was supposed to be angst or guilt about what he felt he had to do, (I won't say what without giving what plot there was away) I couldn't feel it. Yawn. I had to force myself to finish the book."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Atlantis exists! It is guarded by a race of shapeshifting dragon of unbeilevable fighting skill and hunkiness (even if they do sprout scales when provoked). Darius is the head man...er dragon, and is entrusted with guarding the portal that separates our world from his. His duty is to slay everyone that comes from our side and he takes his duty seriously, never letting any pass. Then one day Grace stumbles through and something changes. He breaks his sacred vow for the first time, intrigued by the fiery red head that dares to defy him.But this isn't the only change heading towards Darius. As he runs around after Grace, trying to keep her from getting killed by the other dragonmen, he discovers that she isn't the only human in Atlantis after all. There is a second portal, guarded by his mentor and father-figure that becomes strangely silent, and suddenly Grace finds herself caught in the middle of a battle to save a world that most still think is mere myth and legend.As Grace and Darius rush to save not only Atlantis, but all the people they hold dear, they find themselves plunged into a very heated romance. And wow...do I mean heated. This is not a book for any who blush easily. While the romance plays second fiddle to the fight for Atlantis, it is definately there and wants you to know it!Grace is a fantastic female character. Not only is she not stick thin and model georgous, she actually has a head on her shoulders and isn't afraid to fight to get what she wants and protect those she cares about. It isn't suprising that Darius struggled to resist her.Darius is a lean mean fightig machine...with the additional abitilities you would commonly associate with dragons as well. While his character is hard and ferocious, we occasssionally are allowed glimpses into the inner-Darius and can easily see why Grace would fall head over heals for him.This is the first book in the Atlantis series by Gena Showalter and I have the next two sitting in my filing cabinet drawer (I ran out of room on the TBR shelf) and I can harldy wait til their turn comes up to read more about this fascinating new world, Atlantis.4/5 (would have been more, a bit too steamy in places for me)"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"As usual, Gena Showalter outdid herself.

After her guide steals from her and retreats into the Jungle Grace finds herself wandering, looking for the way out. Instead of getting out of the jungle however, she unknowingly heads deeper in, finally coming across a strange portal...the entrance to the Mythical world of Atlantis.Darius en Karigan Dragon Warlord of Atlantis feels Grace enter his world and runs to strike her down before she can bring peril to his homeland. Strangely drawn to her however, he finds he cannot bring himself to kill her like he has killed all the others who dared to venture into his homeland. After learning more about her Darius realizes that the city of Atlantis is in danger. Alex had not just gone missing, he is the subject of a conspiracy, a conspiracy to strip Atlantis of all its riches and murder its mythical inhabitants. Together, Darius and Grace must solve the mystery and save Atlantis from greed and deception.In the words of my fianc&eacute;: \\"This book is horrible!\\" Personally, I find that to be a little harsh. I knew going in that \\"Heart of the Dragon\\" was a romantic fantasy, a genre that Showalter is famous for. That being said, I wasn't expecting much and ended up pleasantly surprised. The reading is quick and easy so it makes a good plane/beach read.\\"Heart of the Dragon\\" got better the more I read. If you aren't familiar with Showalter's style the first part of the book might make you want to roll your eyes a tad with the obvious clich&eacute;s and overly fantastic style that many romance novelists have adopted in order to \\"engage\\" the reader from the first page. This is probably what made my fianc&eacute; laugh and make fun of me when I accidently left my book in the bathroom after a bubble bath. In any case, this is a definite \\"chick book\\" and should have it written on the cover in large, bold letters.Keeping all of that in mind, I honestly liked \\"Heat of the Dragon.\\" It was pointedly less serious than the book I'd just finished, had lots of fun, mystery, romance, and just a sprinkling of danger which will undoubtedly lure me back to more works by Showalter. If you're skeptical of romance novels stay away, but if you need something fun, short, and slightly mindless, this is a good choice. \\"Heart of the Dragon\\" held my interest, and even though I had to wade through a river of melted cheese to get to the heart (no pun intended) of the story I sincerely enjoyed it and continue to be a Gena Showalter fan.3 stars."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This book was great!

The plot built up so well to a total a** kicking fight that I was a little disappointed in the rush \\"sweep-up job and tie with a bow\\" ending. I wanted a big 'ole beat-down, but that only happened in my head as I re-wrote the ending to my liking. I hope Ms. Showalter will continue other books with characters introduced in this tale, just slow down on the endings please."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"First let me start by saying that I am a fan of Ms. Showalter. She is a solid author that is on her way to being a really good author in the fantasy/romance genre. That being said, she really borrowed a bit heavily from the world that Christine Feehan has already created for her Carpathians. Alpha hero is emotionally dead and cannot see in color until he meets his mate. They say magic words and are then joined together. Very sorry, but that is a bit too obvious.

At that point we knew the heroine had a missing brother and the hero a missing friend. They hardly knew each other; yet could not keep thier hands off each other long enough to search for thier absent loved ones.

Light in fantasy and light in sensuality or heat in the romance.The plot of this book was a little interesting. Although, the Atlantis theme is getting a little tiresome in most books, the Dragons make the book standout.I was not sure if this book will have a sequel or not. The conclusion of the book left it open as to where the book of Draca is, and what plans the Vampire King could have against the Dragons. Also, who would be the next Guardian of the mist to the other Portal into Atlantis.In some ways the whole concept of Fantasy creatures like Dragons using Kelvar vests was kind of amusing.Here's the basic plot. After Darius's family gets wiped out, he becomes one of the Guardians of the Mist, those who guard Portals from the Surface to Atlantis. Basic they're there to kill any travelers through the portal, be it man, woman, or child. Many centuries later, Grace is looking for her brother and stumbles accidentally through the Portal. But she is wearing one of the Guardians of the Mist's amulets. So instead of decapitating her right away he brings her to Alantis to interrogate her about where she got the necklace. From there the plot thickens with Vampires who hate the Dragons and Humans who want to rape and pillage Atlantis to sell on Ebay.It was nice and light fantasy romance read. I probably would read a sequel to this book if there was one. Although, I think this Harelequin line are only suppose to have non-series books. I would definitely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This story line is predictably simplistic. It is geared for a younger audience, but has sexual innuendo's that make this inappropriate for really young viewers.The book has a lot of simplistic assumptions requiring you to suspend disbelief. Premise of the book is a land of Atlantis where all the creatures of legend abide. These races were placed in Atlantis by Zeus, when the blood of Chronis the Titan spilled on the ground and created more races than just humans. Somehow these races are wrong as the target was creation of the human race. The other races have more power than humans. Why these are children of gods and humans who supposedly were created the same way are not is not clear.The most powerful of these races are dragon shapeshifters. These dragons guard the entrances to Atlantis and kill everyone who enters. The moral dilemma is portraying these cold blooded killers as the heroes of the story. For millenia they have killed every outsider who enters Atlantis, supposedly to protect the land from exploitation. There are other ways this could be accomplished but they are not considered - block the entrance with large rock, close the entrance, build a house at entrance location on earth and guard it there, don't allow anyone who enters to ever leave, magic erasure of memories....Other powerful races such as vampires inhabit Atlantis although they do not seem as interested in keeping its secrets.The \\"heroine\\" Grace Carlyle is a terrible role model for young females. Grace seeks fulfillment in life by seeking adventure and finds it with a savage boy toy with no mutual interests except what appears to be animal lust. Her brother is missing and has also found his way to Atlantis. Her brother is related to the group who wants to exploit the riches of Atlantis. Can the dragons stop them? Will the dragons kill Grace and her brother as has been their custom for thousands of years?So the storyline has many logic & moral flaws, is simplistic, and is slightly racey for a younger audience. I would suggest readers read classics by Edgar Rice Borroughs (such as Tarzan series or John Carter of mars), if you enjoy this book as those are better written, internally logical and do not include bad moral teachings (except perhaps some caste assumptions that were common at the time).The book is a very fast mindless read. Perhaps a good book for pretending to read at the beach, if you can get it from library or borrow it. Paying money for this book seems excessive.**SPOILER ALERT **Luckily for Grace and her brother them they both are irresistible and dragons fall in love with them granting them the one exception since as mates they don't have to be killed.**"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I love the idea of taking the premise that Atlantis is real and still here though hidden so I was very eager to read this series. This first book also hit one of my other favorites- dragons!!!Darius is a stone cold dragon warrior king and guardian of the portal to the human world. He is sworn to kill any who stray through the mist into Atlantis. After three hundred years, a lone woman becomes the exception when he is attracted to her and cannot find it in himself to kill her right away. He must find out why she possesses a dragon pendant that she should not have.Grace Carlysle has come to the Amazon jungle to find the whereabouts of her brother. He sent her his diary and a pendant just before he disappeared searching for the famed lost city of Atlantis. Grace loves adventure, but now that she is lost and without a guide she just wants to find Alex and go home. But adventure is not through with Grace because she accidentally stumbles through the mist into the cave of a dragon warrior. The warrior, Darius questions her about the pendant and her purpose for being there and doesn't like 'I don't know' for an answer. Grace finds herself in awe of the fact that she is in a dragon's castle in Atlantis, but it is the feelings that Darius brings to the surface in her that she finds overwhelming. It is not enough to keep her because she needs to find Alex whom she suspects is still in danger.While Grace searches for her brother and Darius tries to figure out what is going on as well as agonizing over the decision that he must fulfill his guardian vow and kill Grace while they both struggle with their attraction, other forces are at work plotting the downfall of Atlantis and make themselves rich. It will take Grace's knowledge and Darius' strength working together to save the day.I really enjoyed the world building in this one and hope for more stories involving the other races of Atlantis. The plot was exciting much of the time though it switched over for the character development and for the romance. This one was a good story, but its pacing wasn't as smooth. It wasn't bad or boring, but just noticeable like when Darius is dealing with the other warrior's ennui issues or the gaps in Alex's story regarding his escape attempts and such.The characters were very likeable. I think writing good characters whether hero, villain or sidekicks is a trait of Gena Showalter's. I loved Grace's feistiness that is just right. She is vulnerable particularly when it comes to her appearance, but she doesn't let this feeling keep her from trying for something with Darius. She may not be a paranormal, but she is tenacious. It is telling how she desires to help Darius and does, but accepts her own limitations reasonably when its time to let him use his gifts.As to Darius, he cracked me up in certain ways. He is the epitome of arrogant warrior male in certain respects. Through much of the book, he has an untenable problem. He loves Grace and knows that it is Grace that gives him reason for living- her very presence assails his senses, but his vow requires that as a guardian that he must kill her because no outsider may enter Atlantis and live. Darius is tender, loving and protective of Grace while at the same time he is guilt-ridden, distant and even grumpy. Darius sees Grace as the most beautiful and a sweet woman deserving of happiness and she is his to love and protect though he is not too arrogant that he won't accept her help where he can.So it was a good start to a series and I look forward to seeing whose story is next.Paranormal fans will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I was pulled into the story immediately and followed the fast pace eagerly.

They was no tension between Grace & Darius and I threw up in my mouth a little after they proclaim their love foe each other w/in few days. Gag!! She is extremely child like and bored me although I like how she was not emaciated thin. It seems to me Gena Showalter cut & pasted adjectives from other books which bothered me. No one talks like these two did & I realized its paranormal but it was even too much for fiction. Brother's story was distracting intwined w/ hers and a lot going on.

What is a gross error for an author and a little bit of research would help.Then, she gives us a world, but there are not really engaging background for the romance.

Alex has been looking for a portal to Atlantis and disappears. Grace stumbles into Atlantis and meets Darius the King of the Dragon Warriors. He holds Grace there against her will. She does escape and runs into Alex's company that he works for. They tell her they are looking for him to, and quickly send her home. Without giving the whole story away, I will say that it truely picks up from here. I love Gena Showalter's writing style and her story telling. The characters are always full of personality and she spins wonderful tales about the paranormal with a great flair and talent.

Any book following this one is just a great big BONUS! I know there's nothing like the real thing, but I am willing to sacrifice my blinders and force myself to read all of Gena's books. Heart of the Dragon keeps you in reality just enough to keep it real, then it moves you so slowly into the fictional world that you didn't even feel the cross over!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"While out wondering the Amazon Jungle looking for her lost brother, Grace Carlyle finds more than she bargained for. After getting robbed by the guide she hired to help her find her way, then getting pummeled with fruit by a vindictive band of monkeys, she stumbles through a portal to a world unlike anything she could ever imagine. Immediately she's fighting for her life and simultaneously lusting after the sexy sword wielding hunk bent on lopping her head off.Darius en Kragin is the Guardian of the Mist. For the past three centuries, the shape-shifting warrior has been protecting Atlantis from humans who accidently and purposely find their way through the portal. But there is something about this human that has him pausing in his duties. The longer he keeps her alive, the more danger Atlantis is in and the deeper he falls for her. When she escapes, it isn't his duties to Atlantis that has him tracking her down.The Atlantis series is the first set of books that I read by Gena Showalter. This was back in 2006 and since then I've become a huge fan of all her stories. Every time a new Gena Showalter book comes out, it is at the top of my \\"MUST Buy\\" list. So, you can only imagine my excitement when I was blog hopping last week and saw that there will be a fourth story released in the sexy Atlantis series. Not only that, but the publisher is re-releasing the original books in the series with even sexier covers (you can compare the two for the first book above). Of course, I'm sold. Not only because the fourth book features a fabulous character that appears in all three of the first books, but because I plan on running right out and purchasing the whole set (again, just to get those covers). Heart of the Dragon is definitely at the top of my favorite list, as are the other two books in this series (and I'm sure #4 will be added straight away).Dragons, Vampires, Nymphs and a whole slew of other characters populated the city of Atlantis and Ms. Showalter's stories. If you are interested in a red hot sexy read, definitely check out this series. They are AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME books. I guarantee you won't be disappointed..."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I read this author's Lords of the Underworld series and thought they were pretty good so I thought what the heck and bought the first 3 books of this Atlantis series. I just hope the 2nd and 3rd one are as good as the first. I really liked this book. It had humor, excitement, brooding male, good sex scenes. What more could I want in a romance novel. The hero, Darius, was my favorite part. The heroine, Grace, was spunky and had lots of humorous lines. My only criticism would be that when she is described in the book it doesn't conjure up images of attractiveness. Why does it seem that when the heroine is going to be less that beautiful does she have to have unruly curly hair, and red hair to boot. Oh well, that's just a tiny complaint in an otherwise great book."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Grace Carlyne's day if going from bad to worse! Having traveled to the Amazon forest from NYC in search for the missing brother, she has been bush-wacked by her guide and left to roam the forest! Oh, how she wants to believe that around the next foliage plant is the local Starbucks so she could get her mocha frappuchino!Instead she falls into a cave - which leads her through a portal to the legendary city of Atlantis. She discovers the narrations in the journal her brother has sent her, are real! Upon arriving at this portal (as there are more than one) she is greeted by Darius en Kragin, Guardian and leader to his people - shape shifting Dragons.He has never faltered in his duty through the centuries - he has killed without mercy any traveler that has stumbled through the portal to protect not only his race - but all the inhabitants of Atlantis from the humans that dwell on the surface. When he sees Grace - he hesitates. He can't bring himself to kill her - after he has noticed the medallion that hangs from her neck.Darius brings her into his palace and locks her in his rooms. He needs to know how and why this mortal woman (albeit an incredibly sexy and juicy morsel of a woman) is in possession of the dragon medallion - what is more worrisome is that the necklace belongs to his tutor and mentor.When Grace escapes and returns to her world - Darius is forced to go up to the surface to seek her out. Darius' time is short - he cant stay on the surface long or he will die.As he finds Grace - they both discover an evil plot to infiltrate Atlantis and his mentor and many dragons have been killed in the skirmish. Fighting his growing attraction for Grace, Darius realizes the grave danger that his world is in and now he has to figure out a way how to save the day.I had no idea that this book was so unique and that Showalter's writing talent was so incredible! Darius and Grace's story is fantastic! She has crafted an unbelievable subterranean world inhabited by surreal creatures - this is a paranormal extravaganza! It has shape-shifting dragons, vampires, nymphs and evil humans! With terrific sexually charged scenes, a concoction of erotica and X-files and a hero and heroine to die for - you will devour this one and race to the store for the restOKAY - SO NOW WHICH OF THE DRAGONS DO I GET TO PICK???"},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"After reading (and very much enjoying) Gena Showalter's \\"Lords of the Underworld\\" books, I was really looking forward to beginning this \\"Atlantis\\" series. However, Heart of the Dragon was a complete let-down.The idea of dragons protecting Atlantis from the \\"surface dwellers\\" was intriguing - especially when you factor in all of the other paranormal creatures that live in the underwater city with the dragons. A third of the way through the book, though, I found myself completely bored with all of the characters. Darius, the \\"hero\\" of the story, was a bossy brute and spent 99% of his time thinking about sex or killing. Grace, his love interest, was so lacking in character that I had to look up her name again before writing this review - and I JUST finished reading the book last night!I was disappointed by the romance factor also. Mostly because it was nonexistent. When Darius and Grace first met, they went right for each other in a hot and heavy make out session. No matter that Darius was thinking about killing Grace, and Grace was thinking about escaping. From that point on, their relationship only progressed by each of them wanting sex even more. I never believed that their was any cause for either of them to feel love for the other.Also, there was a lot of information that the main characters somehow were aware of without any evidence of a conversation having occurred. I eventually started skimming through pages just to get to the end. Overall, this felt like a YA novel only with explicit sex scenes."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"This is the first book in Gena Showalter's Atlantis series and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"I am a new reader of Ms. Showalters books. This is the third one I've read and of the three was probably the one I looked forward to reading the most. It was also the most disappointing. I didn't completely dislike the book but as another reviewer said I do judge books partially on my desire to re-read them (which I do a lot) and this one I'm not so sure I'll ever want to read again.The plot should have had a built in fast-pace set to it, but somehow it really lacked drive. I should have been burning up to hurry and finish it to find out what would happen to the characters. It was set in Atlantis, where a woman (Grace) finds herself on her search for her brother so I should have been captivated. I wasn't.The story did not feel completely fleshed out. How did we go from intense lust to love? I understand it's fantasy therefore the author has some license, but we're talking about the preogression of feelings overthe course of about 24 hours. There didn't seem a great emotional connection between Darius and Grace for most of the book and suddenly they're saying they are in love and the emotional conenction for the remainder of the book seemed like a sham contrived by the author.It would have been nice to explore more into the relationship between Alex and the female dragon. It woud have been nice to know exactly what was happened to the female dragon in captivity. It all seemed a little vague and unfinished. On top of that I was really annoyed by the decision by Alex and Grace at the end of the book for other family members . Their decision seemed selfish and high-handed. In the end it seemed the author was trying to quickly wrap up the book leading to some inconsistencies in my point of view.I didn't hate the book. It was okay and I'll probably try to check out the next one to give the series another chance. The author did a good job of leaving some loose ends to be explored and tied up in other books."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"WOW, what a waste of time this book was. The characters were flat and so was the story. I forced myself to finish the book because I paid for it. I was so bored throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Heart of the Dragon is the first installment of Gena Showalter's Atlantis series that had just been reprinted by Harlequin in January 2009. Although it was imaginative to place mythical creatures together with the idea of the legendary island of Atlantis, this paranormal romance novel was somewhat of a disappointment; therefore, I'm only be giving it a 3 Pink Hearts.Summary:Shortly receiving a package from her brother, Grace Carlyle found herself lost in the Amazon Jungle trying to find him. But instead of finding him, she stumbled through the portal her brother intended to find into Atlantis, a world full of mystical creatures, and was captured by the sexy-beyond-words Darius.Darius en Kragin, a shape-shifting dragon, was the Guardian of one of the portals to Atlantis. Having had his own family slaughtered by human \\"travelers,\\" he was entrusted to kill any beings who dares cross the portal - intentionally or not - in order to protect their land. Over the centuries, he had lost his emotions, until he met Grace, and for the first time as a Guardian, he wasn't able to perform his duty. So instead, he brought her back to his castle and locked her up.It wasn't long before she was able to escape back to her world, and although he knew he couldn't survive for an extended period of time there, he followed her, convincing himself it was for the sake of the secrecy of his land. Intended only to find her missing brother, together they found out the owner of her brother's company had joined forces with the Vampires in Atlantis to rip the Dragon's castle of wealth and to wipe out their entire race. Now with all that chaos, Darius must sort out his feelings for Grace, and try to save his land while keeping her.A couple weeks ago, when I just finished Kresley Cole's Kiss of a Demon King and I was in between her books (again!), I saw readers on her board recommending Gena Showalter's Atlantis series. Having seen her \\"Author Talk\\" videos, the image of Gena Showalter being super funny was imprinted in my mind, and with some of the nice reviews on Amazon.com, I figured I'd try out the first book of the Atlantis series, Heart of the Dragon. (Oh, ok, I'll admit that another reason I chose to start with this one is because I really loved the cover. SEXY! ;P ) Unfortunately, it disappointed.What I liked:The prologue of the book was very well written with the tragic past of Darius and how he became a Guardian. It stirred up emotions that made me serious want a HEA ending for him because of what had happened to him in the past. It also kept the pages turning, because I was eager to see what kind of a mate Gena Showalter had planned for him.The author also did a good job with Grace's reaction to the idea of her being in another world - Atlantis - when she first realized she was there. Grace actually did go through some sort of shock/denial period prior to her acceptance of where and what Darius was. This was a transition period that is commonly overlooked/missed by some authors, causing their story to range from \\"less believable than it should have been\\" to \\"utterly ridiculous.\\" In the case of Grace, although her shock/denial period wasn't very long, it made sense because of her brother's line of work, and her believing the existence of mythical beings, to a certain degree.What I didn't like:Despite the strong prologue, the rest of the book did not live up to the expectations it set. First of all, although Grace's reaction to the world of Atlantis was well-written, her initial reaction to Darius was not logical at all. Ok, I understand that he was the sexiest man on Earth, but it did not make any sense whatsoever to be ogling him when he was ready to take a swing with his sword to end your life.Secondly, although I could somewhat understand how Darius was interested in her - afterall, he felt emotions and senses for the first time in 300 years when he first saw her - I couldn't understand how that \\"interest\\" turned into \\"love.\\" And the same goes for Grace. From the time they met until they declared (at least to themselves) that they love each other, all that was shown was their lust toward each other. Well, Grace did feel sorry for Darius when she learned of his past, but there was nothing beyond sympathy that was described. So I was taken by surprised when, 3/4-way through the book, Grace all of a sudden realized she was in love with him. I was like \\"Huh??? What??? How???\\" (I'm sure if it was possible, my pupils would have turned into question marks or something). It's not that I have any problem with a couple lusting for each other, and then eventually loving each other, but there must be some valid turning point in between. Unfortunately, that turning point was not present in Gena Showalter's Heart of the Dragon.The whole story was also kind of flat in my opinion. There were several places that could have been more exciting and could have made the book more of a page turner. Unfortunately, the writing style could not put me on the edge of my seat, and, other than the prologue, there was no particular scene where I couldn't put down the book to do something else. Although, for the record, I did finish the book in two days, when I was off and at home with nothing else to do, I never hesitated to put it down for a break or to do something else entirely different.Conclusion:Unfortunately, Heart of the Dragon by Gena Showalter is not a paranormal romance novel that I would recommend if you're choosing among a variety of available books. It certainly did not make it to my \\"Must Read\\" list. I would admit that since it was the first book I've read by her, it certainly didn't give me the best impression; however, this will not be the last book I'll be reading from her. I do plan to try her Lords of the Underworld series, since I've heard it was better. So, as of now, I'll be putting the Atlantis series on indefinite hold on my reading list, and when I've no more books to read, I might just get back to it and give it a second chance.This review was initially written for my blog."},{"Title":"Heart of the Dragon (Atlantis, Book 1)","review":"Grace travels to Brazil to catch up with her archeologist brother Alex, and gets lost. Her dragon necklace leads her into a cave that leads into Alantis. There, she meets Darius, a guardian dragon sworn to kill any traveler that comes into the cave. They fall in love, there is a bit of conflict with Alex, his boss, and some vampires, and that is about it. Most of this book was monologue about how much Grace wanted Darius or vice versa. There wasn't enough action to keep me from skimming through most of it. With all of the skipping around I was still able to understand the plot completely. There was entirely too much filler here for my liking. I enjoy Gena Showalter's Lords of the Underworld, and I thought there would be the same sort of mythology here that there were in those, but that is not the case. Only part of the story was set in Atlantis. In fact, so little of the story was about Atlantis, I fail to see why the series even carries that label.

He's got to kill her because she found out the secret that Atlantis exists.That's the conflict - he's got to do his duty and protect the secret. But I know that since it is a romance novel, he's not going to do it. The hero killing the heroine doesn't scream happy ending. The plot goes on and on, his dueling emotions drag out until I want to smack him. Then finally, three quarters the way through the book, he decides he can't do it.

I just kept doing other things like playing FarmVille instead of reading the book because it just didn't call my name to pick it up and finish. I didn't warm up to the heroine of the story and the hero seemed \\"dumb\\" to me. His language barriers and lack of understanding of the US culture just seemed poorly written.

So many species were explained, it was confusing, and the Dragon guardian in the Mist (it was a little corny). Truefully the whole book was a little corny. I did like the heroine; in fact I liked her more then the Hero. She was realistic at least. Unfortunately the whole book was lacking in real substance and felt like it was thrown together.

For three hundred years he kept the citizens of Atlantis safe, killing any surface dweller who dared to enter the city. However when Grace comes to Brazil looking for her brother who is searching to see if Atlantis really exists, she enters the city but Darius is too attracted to her to kill her.Her feelings for Darius frighten her so aided by the Argonauts, the company her brother works for, she escapes and returns home. Darius follows her because humans have found an entrance to Atlantis and are taking the jewels that decorate the walls. If Grace helps him, he will insure her brother, who is a prisoner, is safe. In love with the taciturn man, Grace agrees to his conditions and both realize he can't kill the woman he desires above all others. Now he has to defeat the humans so the secret of Atlantis is insured, find a way to make Grace part of Atlantis so he won't violate the laws of the city and free Grace's brother who is also in love with a dragon.This romantic fantasy is a magical work where dragons take on human form and have different values than the surface dwellers. Atlantis is an exotic city populated by dragons, vampires, centaurs, and other beings of myth and legend.

An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees by Melanie Choukas-Bradley, illustrated by Tina Thieme Brown, is eminently readable and includes all the local native and naturalized species that grow abundantly here without any help from us. This is the perfect book for anyone who is interested in gardening with Mother Nature, creating a water-wise native plant garden, or just identifying the local plants while out walking and hiking. The author describes the plants with expert plant taxonomy, humor, and personal anecdotes, throwing in folklore and history where appropriate. She includes specifics on habitat and range, as well as bloom time and where the plants can be found when walking the trails of Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland. The illustrations, drawn from life, are simple and beautiful, appropriately delicate when describing fragile spring wildflowers, richly detailed and imposing when capturing the hardier species. They compliment every page they are on.The book is a love letter from two naturalists to their adored Sugarloaf Mountain, where they spent ten years hiking and painstakingly identifying the plants. They view the mountain as a rare gift and \\"a learning laboratory.\\" But this guide is so much more than the plants on Sugarloaf Mountain. It covers every plant I could think to look up. It includes a very readable botanical key and a comprehensive illustrated glossary. There are suggested readings. But what makes it unique and exceptional in my library of field guides, is the personal touch in both the writings and drawings. The love that Choukas-Bradley and Brown feel for these plants jumps from the pages and I can feel and see how wondrous and magical each plant is for them. By sharing their reverence and respect for all these plants, they inspire while they educate.An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees; 350 Plants Observed at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland, by Melanie Choukas-Bradley.

It's a friendly book that is scientifically accurate and detailed but also contains personal anecdotes in which the author's love of trees and wildflowers comes through. I carry both this book and the companion volume--Sugarloaf: The Mountain's History, Geology and Natural Lore on my hikes.One of my favorite things about the book is that the plants are organized according to families, with information about each plant family. It's fun to find members of the lily family and the rose family growing in the woods. The book helps you understand relationships between plants in a meaningful way. I like thinking about how this onion that I'm eating is related to the trout lily that grows along Sugarloaf Mountain's streams! Plus, its illustrated glossary is an extremely helpful learning tool.I recommend this field guide to everyone, from novice to experienced botanists."},{"Title":"An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees: 350 Plants Observed at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland (Center Books)","review":"This is the second in a series of 2 books on the Sugarloaf Mountain region in Barnesville, Maryland. A must-have for any local resident to Washington DC, Maryland or Virginia, you will literally feel like you are up on the mountain in the pages of this book, whose gorgeous illustrations and writing bring the mountain to life in any reader's mind as vividly as the real thing! More importantly, the beauty throughout the pages of this book will drive you out Hwy 70 right over to and up the mountain to see it first hand. One of the North-east's best kept treasures, Sugarloaf Mountain was once the runner-up for what became Camp David, this field guide provides readers with a truely tangible appreciation for why it was also among FDR's favorite resting spots! Make it yours too, beginning with this book!"},{"Title":"An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees: 350 Plants Observed at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland (Center Books)","review":"I received this book as an early birthday gift, and I was immediately impressed with the botanically accurate and elegant drawings. Like other top-notch botanical guides, the illustrations are created in finely detailed black-and-white drawings that perfectly reveal the essential forms that you need to see for identification purposes. The artist's first-hand knowledge of all she has portrayed is evident, as she brings each flower and leaf to life with three-dimensionality and delicacy of detail that are breathtaking. As you'll see when you get your copy, the drawings perfectly complement the clarity and thoughtfulness of the text. On any page you happen to turn to, you will be drawn into the fascinating descriptions and context the author provides for each species. Part of you will wish you could sit with this book for hours, exploring its beauty and secrets, and part of you will want to head right out for a hike to see and explore with your new knowledge and this trustworthy guide in hand. This is a very special book, one to be used and treasured, both in the field and at home, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves flowers and trees and wants to learn more about them."},{"Title":"An Illustrated Guide to Eastern Woodland Wildflowers and Trees: 350 Plants Observed at Sugarloaf Mountain, Maryland (Center Books)","review":"This book is very informative, but the illustrations are a bit disappointing, and they should be in color."},{"Title":"Transfiguration Diet","review":"This is a book for those who have reviewed their dietary lifestyle, have found it wanting and are determined to do something about it.

Homage? Hmm. According to the American Heritage Dictionary \\"homage\\" is defined as: \\"Special honor or respect shown or expressed publicly.\\" I fail to see the \\"honor\\" to Tolkien in McKiernan's \\"The Iron Tower\\" trilogy. While it is true it is said that imitation is the highest form of flattery, McKiernan's books are less like flattery and more like regurgitation. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind if a writer is heavily inspired by the work of another. Even Tolkien himself drew much of his thematic elements and ideas from other ancient and mythic sources (Beowulf for example), but he reconstituted those ideas in such a way that they seemed fresh; not copied or reprinted. He was reinventing not simply rewriting.Unfortunately, such is not the case with McKiernan's work. His ideas are directly lifted from the pages of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" without any attempt at originality.In McKiernan's story, a Warrow (Hobbit) named Tuck Underbank (Frodo) embarks on a quest to defeat an ultimate evil, Mordu (Sauron) who dwells in the evil land of Gron (Mordor). Along the way he encounters a dwarf called Brega (Gimli), an elf named Gildor(Legolas), a human warrior (Aragorn), etc, etc, etc...The Tolkien plagiarism's go on and on.He even includes a scene where some of the main characters have to pass through an abandoned Dwarf city called Kraggen-Cor. The city is abandoned because some terrible monster (Ghath) drove all of the dwarfs out long ago. The only way into the subterranean city is through some magical doors that they have some difficulty getting open. While waiting at the doors, a monstrous squid/octopus-like creature attacks them. And yes, there is even a battle with the Ghath in the dwarfin city on a narrow bridge over a bottomless cavern.I have a one hundred page rule when it comes to books; if the book can't engross me, can't keep my interest by the hundredth page I give it up. In this case, morbid curiosity kept me reading these books; like a horrible car accident, I couldn't tear my eyes away. Page after page I kept telling myself \\"it can't get any worse\\" and page after page I was proved wrong.As bad as the plagiarism is, the writing is even worse.The epic scope of Tolkien's story is GONE. Tolkien's writing was marked by mystery, grandeur and a poignant sense of loss and realism. All of this is missing from McKiernan's work. The characters in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (and the \\"Hobbit\\" for that matter) were three-dimensional; they seemed almost to have stepped out of the history books and not a novel. Tolkien made us care about his characters and what happened to them. McKiernan is incapable of doing this with the cardboard cutouts that populate his world. For example, Tuck Underbank is written to be a tragic/heroic figure and spends A LOT of time crying and sobbing about this or that. The narrative, time and time again, tries to make us feel sorry for him. After a while, I just started rolling my eyes and hoping someone would put him out of his misery. Throughout the story the dialogue is stilted, completely unnatural and pathetic. This may be one of the only times in history where a story would have been improved if none of the characters spoke.Rather than \\"honoring\\" Tolkien with \\"The Iron Tower\\" trilogy, McKiernan dishonors the great writer. For those looking for a well written, enriching story in the style of Tolkien or just a good epic fantasy: Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Dark Tide (Iron Tower Trilogy)","review":"Out of the many people I know that have read McKiernan's Iron Tower trilogy the ones that don't like it are either younger readers or people that cant handle McKiernan being a big fan of Tolkien.As with most of McKiernans works, this installment of the Iron Tower trilogy is well written and enjoyable.I recommend McKiernans Mithgar series (which this book is a part of) to any fan that enjoys good fantasy that isn't aimed at 10 year olds."},{"Title":"Wisdom's Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition (SUNY Series in Western Esoteric Traditions)","review":"Christian mysticism is generally associated with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, but professor Arthur Versluis here casts needed light on the obscure Anglo/Germanic theosophical mysticism deriving from Jacob Boehme.Writing in a style that is scholarly yet accessible, Versluis follows the influence of Boehme down through disciples such as Johann Gichtel, John Pordage, and Jane Leade, figures who remain little-known even in esoteric circles.The \\"theosophy\\" of Boehme and his followers differs markedly from the later theosophy of Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, a syncretistic theosophy which owes much to Buddhism and Hinduism. By contrast, the Christian theosophy of Boehme is thoroughly Christian and Christ-centered, deriving from his personal mystical visions rather than from readings in Eastern religion.A main emphasis of Boehme and his followers is that religion be experiential rather than simply an intellectual acceptance of dogma or an assent to verbal expressions of faith. Boehme often described verbal religion as \\"Babel,\\" signifying that it lacked the truly transformative quality of real religion.Christian theosophy typically invokes the idea of \\"sophia,\\" seen as a feminine personification of divine wisdom. Although present in the Old testament \\"Song of Songs,\\" and occasionally referenced elsewhere in both the Old and New Testaments, sophia/wisdom largely went underground in the Christian tradition, and is more often associated with heretical groups such as the various gnostic sects of the first Christian centuries.Indeed, Versluis takes up the question of whether there is a link between the Boehmian tradition and the earlier gnostics, and his conclusion is generally in the negative. First of all, there is no evidence of a direct line of transmission between the two traditions; secondly, the theosophers eschewed the elaborate mythical constructs of the earlier gnostics, relying instead on their own direct visionary experiences.Versluis has tapped into a mystical thread in Christianity which bears further study, and I recommend his \\"Theosophia\\" as another laudable effort to elaborate the sophian tradition in Christianity - not merely as a historical curiosity, but as a living tradition that might have something to teach Christians to this day."},{"Title":"Wisdom's Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition (SUNY Series in Western Esoteric Traditions)","review":"&quot;Wisdom's Children&quot; is a landmark work in the history of Christian esotericism. Thought mainly to be the domain of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestant mysticism has been marginalized for too long. Arthur Versluis takes us back 300 years and shows us that beneath its stern veneer, there has been, and still is, a vital current of the imagination and mystical understanding in and around mainstream Protestantism. Jane Leade, Johann Gichtel, Boehme, Freher, are all brought to life. The chapters on German theosophy, folk magic, and qabala in colonial Pennsylvania alone are worth the cover price.

Although the nature of my curriculum was such that I did not use this book as much as the other, I was pleased with what it had to offer my eighth graders.The book offers 30 activities (24 labs &amp; 4 video suggestions) spread among 6 modules: (1) Pondering Projectile Pathways (2) It's All in a Day's Work (3) Energy and Energy Conversions (4) Machines Are Simple! (5) Seesaws, Steering Wheels, and Screwdrivers: Applications of Torque (6) Center of Gravity. There are also 10 readings at the end of the book, referenced to specific activities. They were a little challenging for some of the students in my heterogeneous classes, but they were able to get what I wanted them to with a little bit of additional structure from me. Each activity has student handout pages that include directions and questions as well as a guide for the teacher (with answers to the questions with background information, preparation hints, and ideas for further study. All of the activities use easily obtained materials, and I was often able to substitute others as well.The favorite activities were: &quot;Bent Barrel Ballistics,&quot; &quot;Pancake Catapults&quot; (a BIG HIT), &quot;Discovering Your Personal Center of Gravity,&quot; and &quot;Center of Gravity: Magical Motivational Demonstrations.&quot;Although this book was in 1990, and, therefore, has no references to the national science standards, each module has an introduction that provides the teacher with the &quot;big picture&quot; and instructional objectives.One more thing. The videos suggested in this book are all part of the &quot;Eureka!&quot; video series produced by TVOntario. I never tried to obtain them, so I cannot comment on their availability."},{"Title":"New Essays on The Education of Henry Adams (The American Novel)","review":"The five essays in this volume provide solid scholarly appreciations, as well as some much-needed background, for the rich confusion of \\"The Education of Henry Adams.\\" (That this volume is part of the Cambridge University Press's \\"American Novel\\" series reinforces the view that Adams's masterpiece employs a fictional framework and contains undeniably ahistorical elements.)Opening the volume, John Carlos Rowe's introduction is an astute commentary in its own right, offering indispensable context and reassessing Adams's work in light of Ernest Samuels's biographical research and Sacvan Bercovitch's scholarship on American puritanism. He also includes interpretative summaries of the four main entries.Brook Thomas's \\"The Education of an American Classic: The Survival of Failure\\" uses the Harvard Classics (compiled by Charles W. Eliot, who hired Adams as a professor) as a means to assess the place in the canon of both Adams's work and his \\"rhetoric of failure.\\" Framing this discussion within the academic dispute over content versus method, Thomas argues, \\"The importance of the 'Education' is not merely its capacity to raise questions but its challenge to face questions that we--like Adams before us--have inherited from the past.\\"Martha Banta's essay, \\"Being a 'Begonia' in a Man's World,\\" looks at Adams's life and work from a feminist perspective. She tackles this neglected aspect from two fronts, looking at Adams's often sexist yet primitively empathetic views of women and analyzing his defensiveness of his own manliness (or, more accurately, his lack thereof). As a self-described \\"butterfly\\" and \\"dilettante\\" and as a blueblood member of the leisure class, Adams is excluded from the company of \\"real\\" men--those in the \\"process of gaining money rather than having it. Adams knew what money meant in defining American manhood.\\" Banta sometimes lapses into the literally obvious (\\"Because Adams was genetically a male, with a male's rights in society\\") or the metaphorically ridiculous (\\"By means of 'internalization' and 'appropriation' of the kind that suggest the tribal ritual of cannibalism\\"), but her essay is the most original and provocative (and surprisingly witty) of the bunch.The volume concludes with two essays that I'd wished I had before I read \\"The Education.\\" Rowe's \\"Henry Adams's Education in the Age of Imperialism\\" dissects the complexities of Adams' friendship with Secretary of State John Hay and of the \\"decidedly neoimperialist\\" policies Hay advanced during the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations. He argues that, far from being a simple observer, \\"Adams was an active participant in the crucial diplomatic negotiations . . . from the end of the Spanish-American War and the annexation of the Philippines to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.\\"In what is arguably the collection's best essay (\\"The Education and the Salvation of History\\"), Howard Horwitz examines Adams's work in light of contemporary intellectual debates--from New History to social Darwinism--and describes it as a meditation \\"on the nature of history and the office of the historian.\\" For instance, Adams's autobiography \\"secures the benefits of the great-man theory of history even as it eschews the benefits of the great-man theory of history.\\" Horwitz is especially adept at tackling and resolving the many perplexing contradictions Adams serves up to his readers.Although written by literary critics, these essays wallow comfortably and competently in the historical foundations of \\"The Education of Henry Adams.\\" (Only a thorough examination of Civil War diplomacy is missing.) Overall, the collection serves as both background for readers baffled by Adams's work and as a supplement for those looking for additional insights."},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"Action, adventure, terrorist plots, a pinch of romance and a bit of magic to go along with it. A Touch of Magic was a great read.I loved that the points of view were not only given from the lead character but from the others as well. I have to admit it was a bit hard to read from the terrorist points of view but it did give the book a more realistic feel.The descriptions and details in the book make you feel like you're actually there. It gives just enough detail to the setting to create a great visual but not so much that it distracts or overwhelms. The characters are well defined and very believable; I especially found the main characters to be incredibly real and likable.I was on the edge of my set through-out this entire book and couldn't put it down.I recommend \\"A Touch of Magic\\" to anyone who likes a strong and intelligent female lead, a great mystery and lots of action. You will not be disappointed! :)-Jessica"},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"I began by feeling that this might be a let down. How wrong could I be! It immediately grabbed my attention and interest; I was annoyed at any interruptions. Not sure my husband got any hot dinners for a day or two.Channing Stuart, the female protagonist, is beautiful, strong, brave, sensible, and very likeable and the whole premise of her ability to perform magic was fascinating. I learnt a lot without Ruth Myers actually giving away too many magical secrets. Yet I felt as if I would love to learn to perform magic myself... the glamour, mystery and allure of the impossible! The character of Bill Ellery, with whom Channing becomes involved in an effort to pin down a truly evil man, was an interesting contrast to her character. I have a feeling Ellery and Channing will carry on with the good work in another book. I hope so.Oddly, perhaps one of the really outstanding characters was a young female terrorist who poured out hate and loathing and yet who stirred our sympathy because of all she and her family had suffered at the hands of the armies who had invaded her country. Ruth Myers manages to take a very balanced and logical view of the minds of those who become terrorists. They are not all evil baddies...there is a cause for their own animosity as well. Nothing is ever simple. And the author puts that over brilliantly.Definitely a compulsive and very well written story."},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"Thriller, suspense and some romance. Not enough of the first two to make me love it. Good story just not great."},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"\\"A Touch of Magic\\" by M. Ruth Myers is an up to date story full of surprise, suspense, and a bit of mystery. It sets government agents and a female magician, against terrorists determined to make it deceptively easy for future terrorists to destroy U.S. property and kill Americans.Though the story is fiction, the behaviors of the characters are believable as being true to life.Channing Stuart is the principal character who is a fourth generation magician, hydro-geologist, a stand-in mother, housemaster, and possesses some martial arts skills. The use of these skills and her rounded personality are displayed and threaded expertly through the plot by the author and interlaced by the strands of the principal terrorist, Henri Ballieu. Ballieu has a history of violent activity and was: \\" . . known for shooting his victims through the throat, . . \\"Channing also: \\". . made herself responsible for Serafin,\\" \\"He was twelve or thereabouts, Hispanic, . .\\" This child and the other characters interplayed effectively with Channing and the agent named Ellery in brilliantly described actions, scenes and locations.Her magical effects are life like: \\"Channing fought and bouched at the straight jacket.\\" \\"She had to regain her breath. She had to remember she was a Stuart, faster and more sure with her hands than most . . \\"I enjoyed this e-book more than I really thought I would, being compelled not to put it aside for very long. The plot was one that attracted me because of the world news of today about terrorism that has us very concerned about conceivable terrorist activity in America. As a magician, I was also delighted to read the descriptions of the magic that Channing performed, especially the last effect she performed at the end of the story."},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Channing (our heroine) is a fabulous character. She is strong and smart, but she is still vulnerable and is damaged from her past. Bill (our hero) has his own troubled past but he is a white hat who is trying to make the world a better place. It was very nice to also view the action through the voice of other characters, including our villain.The story was a little confusing at first, in part because we do have so many viewpoints to the action. Also, because the author was holding back some major secrets, it was a little difficult to follow who the players were and what all was happening. Once I got involved, however, I found it exceedingly hard to put down! I eagerly await more installments with Channing and Bill and the rest of the cast of characters!"},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"this story just dragged and dragged and I ended up not finishing it.

Don't you just love a heroine who has really unusual abilities?Although this book was written in the late 80s, it never felt dated. The terrorist plot was right on target for today's world, down to the inner workings of the minds of the terrorists, whose point of view we often see. (Interestingly, despite abhorring his plans, I found myself almost liking the main villain, which added a nice layer of texture.) I also found the world of the stage magician to be an unexpectedly fascinating one.I ended this book hoping that M Ruth Myers plans to write a sequel. Today's series-hungry readers would eat it up!"},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"I have been looking for some time for a book that was the wonderful mix of romance and suspense that I found in Mary Stewart's contemporary fiction, and A Touch of Magic gave me all that I hoped for.The heroine, Channing Stuart, is a woman who has thrown herself into work to avoid getting hurt, but when she gets caught up in a terrorist plot she has to learn to trust herself again and listen to her heart. Special Agent Bill Ellery is all that you want in a romantic lead, and the tension between the two is very satisfying. The use of magic by Channing was so interesting, and it added a very special element to the story that it really made the story unique. Finally, the plot unfolds with enough twists and turns and danger to keep you turning the page, but the humor and romance makes you care doubly about the outcome.I highly recommend this book, as well as the first in Myer's historical mystery series, No Game for a Dame.M.

I'm looking forward to her new books."},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","review":"It might seem unusual to the reader that Channing Stuart is both a geologist and an accomplished magician. In fact, given the difficulties in making a living as a magician and the fascination the art presents, it's not unusal at all for a talented mgician to have another profession and to pursue magic as a joyful sideline. M. Ruth Myers knows that because of her backgroud as a performing magician and ventriloquist, as well as her work in the national office of the Society of American Magicians. The tricks that Channing uses are realistic, even if exaggerated a bit at times, and can indeed be performed. Magicians could actually do them. This thread of believability sets a fine stage for character development and a step by step increase in the reader's interest throughout \\"A Touch of Magic\\" The plot is just complex enough to grab you, and you're kept wondering about what is going to be revealed next. If you enjoy a solid mystery embellished with a bit of show business, all woven with a developing romance, you'll have fun with Ms. Myers' briskly moving novel. od/tds"},{"Title":"Drummin' Men--The Heartbeat of Jazz: The Bebop Years","review":"This is a GOOD book on the Be Bop drummers, my only complaint is that the author has opinions that I do not agree with. Such as &quot;Blakey is not a virtuoso&quot;; My opinion is that Blakey played solo's that were beyond &quot;Human Technique&quot;,they were Spiritual. He also relates a story of how Buddy Rich was Philly Joe's &quot;Demon&quot;,and again states that Philly Joe Jones was not a virtuoso. The author also states that the &quot;Rich versus Roach&quot; recording was a &quot;radical mistake&quot; for Max, because Buddy &quot;ran Roach out of the studio&quot;. The author seems to think Buddy Rich is &quot;The world's greatest drummer&quot;. And that the real innovaters have no technique. I say ,listen to Buddy with Bird &amp; Diz;(Tasteless Bombast),then listen to Max(pure melodic Beauty). I don,t care if Buddy can play 3000 single strokes per minute, lets don,t distort the truth, with this continuing myth. Buddy did'nt make any contribution to &quot;Music&quot;, that these cats did."},{"Title":"Drummin' Men--The Heartbeat of Jazz: The Bebop Years","review":"I use this book and its companion,Drummin' Men: The Heartbeat of Jazz The Swing Years, as research tools for both my site called Music for Drummers and for ensuring I have the correct details when I review music here.What I love about this (and the companion book) is Korall is not only a drummer, but a great historian and overall musician. He does not confine his writing to drums and drumming, but digs into the music itself. Take any chapter and you are treated to a dissertation on the music and musicians who created the music the subject drummer played, including accolades for the other instrumentalists on the recordings cited.More importantly, Korall can write prose that is engaging and descriptive. Consider one passage in which he describes Art Blakey's uncharacteristically subdued playing onThelonious Monk Trio: Rudy Van Gelder Remasters. He describes it as Blakey painting in pastels while retaining an underlying rhythm and source of light. This is not the common biography lingo that is dry and devoid of color.Another big plus - in my opinion - is the inclusion of Stan Levey. Just about every history of bebop overlooks him, yet Levey was backing Dizzy at the tender age of 16, and - along with Kenny Clarke and Max Roach - made significant contributions to the bebop drum vocabulary. In fact, Levey was Bird's room mate for a year and was a fixture on the NY and LA scenes.I also love the structure and sequencing of the book. After a very brief chapter, Bebop, that sets the tone for the rest of the book, Korall divides the book into logical sections.Swing to Bop covers the visionaries - Papa Jo Jones and Big Sid Catlett - who laid the groundwork for the new drumming style that made bebop possible. While most of us credit Kenny Clarke, Korall makes a good case for Papa Jo as the root. That does not diminish Clarke's contributions in my opinion.The next section - Transitional Figures - is my personal favorite section for a number of reasons. First, it contains important drummers, some of whom I did not know about, and three I hold in the highest esteem. Those are Denzil Best, J. C. Heard and Shadow Wilson. Of the three Wilson is one of the most elusive figures in that there is so very little written about him. Yet, he occupies an important place in the transition from swing to bop, and was held in the highest regard by practically everyone, including Papa Jo Jones. Also, the nine full pages in this book devoted to Wilson contain more information than any other single source I have found. To me, that alone made this book worth every penny.Innovators is the heart of the book. All of the major players who defined bebop (and hard bop) are covered. There are a few surprises: Don Lamond who I more associate with big bands, and Shelly Manne who was more a West Coast jazz pioneer. Still, both do belong in this section in my opinion.The last two sections cover the 1950s and other significant figures and there are no surprises for the most part. Philly Joe Jones, Art Taylor, Mel Lewis and a few others are covered in sufficient detail.What brings this book alive and makes it a cohesive blend of fact, history, music and opinion are the first hand accounts of other musicians (and in some cases family members) for each drummer. Those, combined with Korall's deep knowledge of music, drumming and his own meticulous research make this an invaluable companion to amateur historians like myself. Korall's notes, bibliography, discography and section on interviewees add more value to this book.In addition to the companion book by Kprall I cited above, I recommend that you also combine this with a DVD set titledLegends of Jazz Drumming."},{"Title":"Drummin' Men--The Heartbeat of Jazz: The Bebop Years","review":"A book about bebop drummers needs to explain 1) what bebop drumming consists of and 2) how the styles of the various drummers profiled diverge. This book does not do either. Instead we are told that drummer after drummer after drummer has \\"a great feel\\" and \\"great time\\"; we learn nothing.If it were just that I'd give the book another star for its sketchy and scattered biographical information, but considering how badly written the book is, I can't justify it.I suggest instead that you buy a copy of \\"The Grove Dictionary of Jazz\\" and look up the entry for each famous drummer you want to know about.

But it is written and researched so well that anybody interested in jazz and its development should not miss it. It is not a technical analysis(though there are many good tips for aspiring drummers) but rather oral history of modern jazz and drumming. It's also very entertaining and has many interesting and amusing stories. Most importantly it's inspiring work for musicians to keep studying and researching history of the music and for jazz listeners to discover many hidden treasures in recorded music and some great underrated but important masters of this wonderful music we call jazz.Both volumes on Swing and Bebop are among best books written on the subject and I keep going back to them for pleasure and inspiration (and I am not even a drummer). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I don't really know why I was bored by this book, but I was. The story didn't appeal to me for some reason. I was surprise because this is a pretty popular book for Rachel Gibson fans and I'm one of them. The hero and heroine had a love hate relationship that was annoying to me. They had a lot of history between them, but I still didn't feel the type of chemistry I was hoping for. I didn't particularly like the heroine and I thought the hero came off as a whiny wimp taking out his hatred for his daddy on the heroine, so it was kind of hard to root for them to get together. Not one of my favorite Rachel Gibson."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was my first Rachel Gibson book, and I couldn't put it down. Absolutely LOVED it. I can't wait to read another of her books."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"The book I ordered came as ordered, in very good condition, and in a very timely manner. Thank you so much! Will order through you, again."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"It was a surprisingly great book. I found it quite different to other light romance books, although this was the first book by Rachel Gibson that I've read and after exploring some of her other works they are all essentially the same. The relationship between the two main characters were supported by a deep, interwoven, somewhat chaotic past which made it a lot more realistic than other books where two people just meet and fall in love, and the characters were surprisingly easy to relate to.Nick grew up being rejected by his own father and subject to cruel gossips, and became a driven and successful man who always got what he wanted with women. His past perhaps meant he was often afraid of succumbing to emotion he doesn't have full control over, and so he tries not to let anything affect or disarm him. He finds that Delaney is the only person who could disarm him, and he attempts to hide or reject it in various ways that often involve Delaney getting hurt. Delaney is a naive, sheltered girl who feels trapped and manipulated by her family to lead the \\"perfect\\" life they wanted her to lead, and finds attraction and solace in Nick's unpredictable behaviour and wild lifestyle. The two reunite after many years apart to find that they were still attracted to each other and in the end realized it had always been love."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This book was book one of my 10 book summer reading challenge I set for myself. I was pleasantly surprised at my feelings towards the characters. I felt myself drawn to the story and how these two were going to end up. Who doesn't have someone from their teen years that could have been, but the opportunity was missed? I would even read a sequel. I would love to see Truly's reaction to these two together... in public! Great beach read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was the second book that I've read from Rachel Gibson. The first book being See Jane Score, which is also a 5 star in my opinion. She has quickly became an author, that I watch for all her books. She writes very witty, and half the time I am bursting out laughing. And the romance is excellent.Delaney and Nick are two great characters. They had a complicated past that goes all the way back to their childhood. (Which I'm always a fan of. It seems real to me, and makes me believe more in the characters)And the tension has not left since the many years Delaney has been gone from their hometown.I won't say anything else, because I know I'll devulge too much, and spoil a great read.But I need to say, the scene in the closet is hott. You might want to have a portable fan next to, or perhaps an ice pack to cool you down. Either way, its rememberable. And I loved how unlike some romance books, it was belivable!An amazing Read!!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was the first novel by Rachel Gibson that I ever read and immediately became a huge Gibson fan. I decided to re-read it and it was almost as good as the first time.The characters are likable, sexy and fun. Back in high school they had crushes on each other, but due to a horrible misunderstanding, they both felt betrayed and burned by the other. It was interesting to hear/feel their old pain and see how the attraction over-ruled that in the end.Fun book -- LOVE Rachel Gibson."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I love this book! I was so sad when it ended. I felt like it had every component a successful romance needed. I go back and read it often and think it will always be one of my top favorites !"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was a very good read on my flight from Denver to Kansas City and from Kansas City to Houston. Nick was such a sexy character and it was a very engrossing read, I think that this got me addicted to romance novels. ^___^"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"As far as contemporary romance goes, Rachel Gibson is always on my must buy list. She is an absolute genius at weaving original, quirky tales that involve irresistibly hunky men and independent women who don't take crap off anyone.Truly, Madly Yours was the first book by Ms. Gibson I'd read. The moment Nick (the hero) rolled onto the pages on his motorcycle I instantly fell in love with him. The dynamic between him and Daisy is a constant tug-of-war of bickering while trying to fight the sexual tension between them. You can practically feel the two characters vibrating with need for each other and by the time they come together the pages of the book practically light on fire.Nick turns out to be such a big softy that your heart is melted by the end of the book. I love the interaction between him and Daisy. Anyone can tell those two were meant for each other. Truly, Madly yours was one of the first paperbacks I'd ever read. I still own it and have gone back and re-read it several timesErin Kernauthor of Looking For Trouble"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Nick Allegrezza has got to be one of the sexiest guys I've ever read! He's drop-dead gorgeous (I've never come across a Basque hero before), incredibly sexy, and thoroughly infuriating. But more than just handsome and sexy, he's complicated too. He was the bane of Delaney's childhood, throwing snowballs at her and teasing her unmercifully, but did he flatten the tires on her bike to be mean or so that he could walk her home? Hmmm, true feelings and motivations can be so murky!Delaney Shaw left Truly, Idaho at 18 and never looked back. She's been a nomad moving from place to place and job to job until she's forced to return to attend her controlling stepfather's funeral. In a last power play, his will stipulates that in order to claim her inheritance of three million dollars, she must stay in Truly for a full year! There go her plans to leave ASAP. Now if she can just avoid her nemesis, Nick for the next twelve months . . . Nick, who was Henry Shaw's unacknowledged illegitimate son, also has a stipulation to his inheritance. He will lose the lucrative property Henry left him if he becomes sexually involved with Delaney within that same year! Shouldn't be a problem, right? He's not interested in Delaney - is he?But avoiding each other in a small town like Truly, especially when Delaney's best friend Lisa is engaged to Nick's brother Louie, and when the hair salon she opens in town is just doors away from the offices of Allegrezza Construction proves quite difficult. And as they have more and more steamy encounters we learn more about their tangled, complicated past - especially their night at Angel Beach when they were caught by Henry in a compromising situation. The repercussions from that night drove Delaney to leave town and continue to haunt both of them. Did Nick take advantage of her just to get back at Henry for not acknowledging Nick as his son? And did Delaney live the life of the pampered, pretty princess as Nick thought or did she pay a price for being Henry Shaw's stepdaughter?I am a huge fan of Rachel Gibson's books and this and SEE JANE SCORE are definitely my faves! Nick and Delaney are so great together and Nick is the kind of complicated guy that you enjoy trying to figure out. A very highly recommended read!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I held on to this book for almost a month and a half so I could enjoy it on vacation, and boy am I glad. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Great characters, great romance and witty dialogue that kept me turning pages. Sparks fly every time Delaney and Nick are in the same room. These two are H-O-T ! Their frolick in the snow had my blood pressure up,not to mention that little episode in the linen closet!Definately gotta grab a copy of &quot;Simply Irresistable&quot; too. If it's even half as good as &quot;Truly Madly Yours&quot; it's got to be great. I wish Rachel Gibson had more books in print, but rest assured I will be on the lookout from now on for new releases!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I recently read this book after a friend recommended &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot;. I enjoyed this book more. I found the story very realistic. Who hasn't had a secret crush. The fantasy part is actually getting to fulfill your crush. I enjoyed the fact that Delany wasn't a blonde bombshell who didn't know she was beautiful. She was a real woman who had to work at being not ugly. And I especially liked that Nick was attracted to her even with 'bedhead'.I thought the broomcloset sex scene was HOT. I have reread this book twice. And, it keeps getting better.Sometimes soulmates can be opposites. Initial attraction isn't enough to live HEA, as one reviewer called it. But, it's what develops from that attraction that sustains this love/lust relationship."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Truly, Madly Yours is *truly* one of the best contemporary romance novels I've read this year! I thought the plot was original, the heroine spunky and wonderful and the hero sexy as hell! I'd recommend this book to anyone who's weary of contemporary romances. The author makes you feel Delaney's pain and confusion and even the hero's frustration... and at the end you're oh-so-glad to have gone through the rollercoaster because the end is oh-so-worth it!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"A fantastic book! I couldn't put it down. This is one of my favorite romance novels to date. This is a funny, warm, sexy, and VERY HOT story set in a small town in Idaho. There are no lulls to this story - and what a satisfying ending!! I almost never re-read books, but I will this one. Plus, Nick has to be the hottest, sexiest lead guy in any romance novel I've ever read. (For a book with a similar hunk, read Susan Donovan's \\"Knock Me Off My Feet\\". Stacey Quinn reminds me a lot of Nick in the way he teases and temps his heroine, plus he has a heart of gold you will simply fall in love with.)In Truly Madly Yours, Delaney's estranged stepfather (and Nick's biological dad) died and left a will with some odd stipulations. Despite a ten-year absence from Idaho and her family, she must now live in Truly Idaho with her mother for one year to collect over 3 million dollars. Nick - his illegitimate son who he didn't acknowledge until it was way too late - must keep his hands off of Delaney for one year to get a mass of land as his inheritance. Even from his grave the loathed stepfather is trying to control their lives. Why? Convinced that Nick will find Delaney's presence too tempting to resist, and knowing that there was once sparks between Nick and Delaney, his dying hope was that they consummate a relationship and carry on the family bloodline."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I had to step on the bandwagon of fans for \\"Truly Madly Yours\\", and even though it was said so many times before, I had to say it again! This is a GREAT book!But although I enjoyed this book very much, I have to first say that there are quite a few holes in the plot. (Spoilers follow) First, Delaney is angry at Nick for what happened ten years ago between the two of them. I can see that she was upset at the time, but surely as she matured she must have put two and two together and realized that he was not taking advantage of her? She's not that stupid, is she?Second, um, did anyone pick this up - Her step-father could not father any children, because he had a zero sperm count, and yet, he managed to produce a bastard son from a one-night stand? I kept waiting to see some explanation (he got Mumps afterwards or something), but no, no explanation.Third, this is not a plot hole, but I would have really liked to see an epilogue, where Ms. Gibson would wrap everything up for us - the money, the place where they would live, the parent's reactions, what happened between Delaney's mother and her boyfriend? I guess Ms. Gibson stopped in the right strategic place to leave us hanging - and wondering; and for the more imaginative ones among us - to concoct all the satisfactory scenes in our own heads. The ending certainly makes us think - but I DONT LIKE IT!All in all, despite all the problems above, this was still a five star book. Why? This is a book that grabs you and pulls you in. Once I got past the first few pages, I simply couldn't put it down. This is a book about all of us, about real people, and it's funny in a way that will touch your soul. The ending is a \\"truly\\" happy ending, with just the right amount of everything to make it so. And the h/h are just right, too. Nick is not perfect, just the better side of normal, in my opinion. He doesn't do and say perfect things, and I like him alot better that way. Neither, for that matter, does Delaney. But we love her just the way she is!Those reviewers who said this book was not about love did NOT read this book. Yes, he keeps saying it's not love, it's lust, but we the readers, know better. It's all the things he does, not what he he says, that make us, the readers, understand differently. And, yes, she keeps saying, \\"I hate him\\", but then she can't keep away from him, she can't tell him no. If she were some spineless girl who can't say no to anybody, the attraction would not be as believable, but we see her sticking up for herself all over the place, and if she simply wants someone, anybody, why does she say \\"no\\" to Steve?And no, they do NOT spend the entire novel being nasty to each other. They are actually quite good to each other, except when they get into a fight (over quite understandable reasons). It's everyone around them who are nasty to THEM, to Nick and Delaney. I think everyone is actually quite horrid, and I think there are so many strikes against them that its a miracle they actually got together in the face of so much real opposition. And I've read alot of books were the h/h fall in lust with each other, but this is not one of them. Ms. Gibson is just very good at describing those scenes.Yes, a major plot flaw, and the pieces are not tied up well enough for my liking, but still - a five plus star book! It's worth it!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Rachel Gibson has an uncommon talent: she can actually write genuine, funny heart warming stories populated with REAL people. It is so refreshing to read about a contemporary heroine who doesn't wear slacks or blouses or worst of all pumps.Ms. Gibson seems to be the only contemporary author who realizes that no one under fifty wears that crap.Delaney is a delightful young modern woman we can all relate to who happens to wear platforms instead of pumps and vinyl and spandex instead of cashmere. Nick is a gorgeous Levis wearing hunk who is head over heels in love with Delaney since they were kids but he believed Delaney was out of his reach because she was the mayor's stepdaughter and he was his illegitimate son. Delaney in turn thinks Nick hated her because she was raised in luxury by Nick's biological father who denied his real son everything she had.Nick and Delaney are brought together after ten years apart by a bizarre stipulation in the late mayor's will. In such close proximity (Truly is a very small town) they are forced to face their feelings for each other and when they do the sparks will fly!This is a well-written, funny, sometimes poignant love story that will leave a smile on your face. Highly recommended! :)"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was the first Rachel Gibson book I've ever read, it won't be the last! I checked it out from the library, and fell so in love with it I had to buy it! I loved the comedy and I loved the romance!I grew up in a small town in Oregon and could totally appreciate the depiction of life in Truly, ID. I loved the charachters, and for reasons I can't explain, Nick the beefcake has stuck with me. I just read True Confessions by Rachel Gibson as well, and as much as I liked that book and the sheriff, he was no Nick Allegrezza. And I read a review in here that someone didn't think he and Delaney would last into the happily ever after. I so disagree! They loved each other half of their lives, why would they stop now?"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I'd read 'Simply Irresistable' and purchased 'Truly, Madly' based on the reviews here. Great contemporary romance! I've already reread it 5 TIMES! I like that Delany and Nick are real (not perfect) and that Gibson spotlighted their enteraction with others (day to day life, jobs, family). I also liked the little details (Delany getting ready for something, descriptions of clothing and the fact that Nick noticed). Too many writers today leave out descriptive details and we forget what the characters are supposed to look like. Overall this is a great read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I have NO IDEA why this book has so many stars!! Now I love me some Rachel Gibson, I am always reading her books. Let me tell ya, Nick is the biggest dirtbag, man whore I have ever seen. He is disrespectful and tries to play victim throughout the whole book! Yes, he had a lousy childhood, but that's no call for the cold way he treats Delaney. Half way through the book I thought he flat out hated her. I thought they lusted for one another but they didn't like one another at all.This one is not even worth the read I will tell you that. Nick is not sexy to me. He has been with every woman in town, and abuses the one he really loves??? Gimme a break. Give me a break."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is my very first Rachel Gibson book. I normally read suspense mystery like J.D. Robb, Sandra Brown and Dean Koontz. But it gets boring and the killing kinda gave me nightmares. The truly intense ones really gets to me at night. So my coworker recommended contemporary romance so I've been reading that ever since.I came across this author by accident to tell you the truth. But I am actually glad I did! I think I type in contemporary romance and Rachel Gibson's name popped up next to Jennifer Crusie and Erin McCarthy. I chosed her instead of the other two. I am glad I did. I won't give too much details as the other reviewer but this is a great first time read! I highly recommended this book to anyone looking for a hot, steamy, quick read! haha"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I loved Nick and Delaney. Both so independent. The scenes were very original and the sexual tension was great. My only wish was that at times Delaney had a little more backbone when Nick was having his fun w/her. I always love a happy ending."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Definitely an easy, enjoyable & fun loving book. My only criticism was I don't like when descriptions of characters are dated....like the kind of clothes they wear and the hairstlyes ( men w/ slicked back ponytails are so dated!) They should be kept general enough so the reader can use their own imagination. Otherwise, the characters were enjoyable and likable."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I've read quite a few of Rachel Gibson's books. Nick seems like the \\"sexiest\\" of all the men. I thought Sebastian was it until, Quinn, then Zach, Mick, and Jack, but Nick broke the mode!! These men are so sexy, it makes you want to jump in the pages of the book. I've never heard of the \\"Basque\\" heritage until now. Nick puts shame to Adonis."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is the first book by Rachel Gibson I've read so I really didn't know what to expect but wow did she ever surpass my expectations! It was such an easy read, but it wasn't \\"dumbed up\\" and repetitive like so many books in this genre can be. The plot and the timeline of events was believable, as well as the characters' actions and reactions. I TRULY loved this book and can't wait to read another by this author. I only hope subsequent books can measure up to this one."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Truly Madly Yours has something in it for everyone. It is more than a romance, and really involves an entire town in it's characterizations. It reads more like fiction in parts, but don't misunderstand...this is a \\"romance first\\" kind of book.Delaney Shaw and Nick Allegrezza share a father. Nick's biological and Delaney's adoptive. Their dad was not a nice man...he spent his life denying his paternity of Nick and controlling Delaney. Nick has always been jealous of the attention his dad gave to Delaney, but he's also always had a \\"thing\\" for her as well. I didn't really care for Nick until close to the end of this book. He's promiscuous, rude, and down right cruel sometimes, but as the book reads on, the reader comes to see the vulnerability and hurt behind all his bravado.Delaney's just trying to life her own life when a stipulation in her father's will forces her to live in Truly for one year. During this year the reader \\"experiences\\" life in Truly, Idaho and watches sparks fly between these two adversaries.This is a believable romance between two memorable characters. I love a story where two people who have always secretly longed for each other get their happy ending and this is definitely \\"one of those\\"."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was a very nice read. I really liked Nick because even though he made mistakes he realized he was wrong, and was willing to apologize and go the extra mile for forgiveness. I also really liked that little hot scene in the closet. I felt the characters desire for each other!! What I didn't like was he kept his feelings too bottled up for Delaney to realize he loved her."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was my first book by Rachel Gibson, and I am very much looking forward to reading more from her. There ways just so much going on between the hero and the heroine, I found myself not wanting to put the book down.Delaney Shaw was always the little princess that lived a sheltered life, ruled by her mother and step father. Up until the time she turned 18, every thing she did was for her parents. How to act, what to where, who to hang out with, which college to go to. Ever since her mother married the great Henry Shaw, she'd been forced to live a life that was totally not her own. All she wanted was to be a normal girl, with a normal life, who made her own decisions. She didn't want to live up to anyones expectations, but her own...Nick Allegrezza, the discarded bastard son of Henry Shaw, was never welcomed in his fathers home, let alone anywhere near his step daughter. All throughout his life he watched as Delaney got everything that should rightfully be his. The more he watched her, the more intrigued with her he bacame. Was it hate that made him flatten her bicycle tires, or hit her smack between the eyes with a snow ball, giving her two black eyes, when the were little? Was his constant tormenting of Delaney jealousy, or was it something else.Now fast forward 10 yearsDelaney returns to Truly for Henrys funeral. Being gone for 10 years has not brought out fond memories for Delaney. After leaving Truly 10 years ago, she has never looked back. She is content with her life now because it is truly her own, until Nick, her childhood tormentor and one time almost lover, comes riding up on his harley. She cannot wait to leave Truly ASAP. However Henry has other plans. Forcing Delaney to stay in Truly, an entire year before she recieves any inheritance and also making sure Nick keeps his hands off his step daughter.Delaney hates that Henry is still controling her life beyond the grave. She hates that she has to stay in Truly for a year, because she hates this town. But most of all, she hates Nick and his intense eyes, and stong body and just wishes she could keep a clear head whenever Nick's around. Why does he seem to have this strange control over her. Besides it's not like he's the type of guy who could love her. He doesn't even know the meaning of the word.Nick can't believe Henry would even think of adding a \\"No touch\\" clause to his will. Knowing full well he has never in his life listened to that no good creep of a man known as his father. There has to be something that Henry wanted, even after he's good and dead. But is Nick willing to fulfill Henrys wishes or his own? He can't stop fantasizing about that one night with Delaney. How much is she willing to put her heart through? When will he reach his breaking point? and will they ever be able to forget the past and start looking toward the future.In the end you have to ask yourself, \\"What does true love really cost? and is it worth it\\""},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is my favoite RG book.

This book was very enjoyable with it's blend of fun, wit, steamy sex, and HOT HOT HOT Nick. He may be too good to be true but oh, man! My kind of fantasy man came to life in the pages of this book. The female character of Delaney was a pure delight with her too-trendy-for-Truly clothes and sharp wit. This book could be over-analyzed from here to eternity and it would still be just what it is - a highly enjoyable read that I couldn't put down. That's what I look for in a good book and you'll find it with this one."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Even though this is a fairly standard contemporary romance, this book immediately become one of my all-time favorites. I'm not sure why. Could it be the amazingly sexy hero? The witty dialog? Definite pluses, but the deciding factor is Delaney Shaw. If she's not like you, she's like your best friend.

But I sure hope some of you who are comparing how her other books' rank will not only notice the good reviews for this, but buy it. It truly is one of the sexiest love stories you'll ever find.Nick's character is so well described that I can see him clearly in my mind. Good Lord, what a hottie! He's the kind of male character you wish we're really real!! Laney is just such a treat too. You'll love her twisted sense of humor and her observations of the hometown she ran away from. A great book!Delaney and Nick have a great chemistry. I love how Nick is always teasing Delaney and driving her insane! This book has a high laugh factor and is very sensual too. Nick sounds like one of those characters you can imagine in your mind and dwell on a while. Dont let this one get by! Read it and her other two as well! Simply Irresistible is wonderful too. Ive read it 3 times in 3 weeks! Get all three! You wont regret it!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Have been waiting for her new book after enjoying &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; so much and was not disappointed.

To put simply, I finished it barely 3 minutes ago and I'm already looking forward to re-reading my favorite parts.A lot of the reviews cover the plot line so I won't go into the details again. I have to admit I was really skeptical and turned off by the fact that, technically, the two leads are siblings (not by blood, but still). That plus the cliched chick-lit story line (which, of course, I expected) and slow pace of the book made it difficult for me to get into at first. But the book is so well written, the love story so well developed, that I was quickly convinced. Of all the things I love about this book, my favorite has to be how the author deliberately builds the connection between the leads very, very slowly. You actually FEEL the love story happen, rather than just read about it.Like I said at the start, it is the basic boy/girl story line with a few cliches thrown in here and there (yes, we get it, he's a great kisser; let's move on now!), but I've enjoyed this light read so much, I'm not even bothered by it.Before reading this, Jennifer Crusie's \\"Bet Me\\" was my favorite romance novel; now this one is right up there with it."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Not another book where the hero and heroine are in lust and not in love. I was NOT feeling an emotional connection between Nick and Delaney. I didn't understand why the two loved each other. I was 3/4ths of the way through the book and Delaney and Nick didn't even like each other! They definitely wanted each other and had a sexual attraction to each other. Oh and If I read the word Basque one more time I was going to scream my head off! The premise of the story and the background of the characters was great. This story had great potential, but fell flat. I almost didn't want to finish reading it. I know this book was written in the 90's, but its pretty much like a contemporary I would read today. I guess contemporaries haven't changed that much.I want a romance where there is more a love connection and its not so much about sex/sexual chemistry. I don't mind sex scenes in books since I just skip over them anyways. I want a story that makes me sigh at the end because it was great from beginning to end and I really felt a emotional connection between the characters. Another thing I'm tired of is the brooding and dark Alpha males that are total and complete jerks. That is so annoying. An alpha hero with a soft side would be nice! I want a romance novel where I wish the story didn't even to end. I haven't read a book like that in a long time. I'm still waiting on Lisa Kleypas to come out with another contemporary romance. I might have to go back to reading historical romances."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is one of my all time favorite romances. Nick is the perfect bad boy hero. The story is well written with good character developement and dialog (a rare find). I still go back and re-read this one. \\"True Confessions\\" by Rachel Gibson is also AMAZING!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Gibson delivers her usual dose of sizzling chemistry with these two main characters, Delaney Shaw and Nick Allegrezza. Delaney and Nick both grew up in Truly, Idaho, but stayed at a distance due to family drama. When Delaney left at 18, she had no intention of coming back.She does, though, to pay respects to her step-dad (Henry) when he passes away and for the reading of his will. What she finds instead is a stipulation where she must stay home for one year, if she wants to inherit anything. Worse than that, bad boy Nick was never acknowledged as Henry Shaw's son while he was alive, but now is acknowledged and given property, with a stipulation.What we come to find out is that these two characters had a past, and a HOT one, of which Henry did not approve. We slowly come to see what makes each character tick, and in doing so, we fall in love with yet another Rachel Gibson book.The characters are funny and real (Delaney and her best friend Lisa talk about their bottoms, their high school rivals, and their old boyfriends). The plot is engaging (Gibson holds out on telling us what happened between Delaney and Nick for ages!!). Most of all, the chemistry between these two people who are trying to reconcile and their past and their present, is undeniable. We can't help but root for Nick and Delaney to be happy and to be together."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This book totally worked for me. There are some plot holes, but with a tortured bad boy, unrequited love...I couldn't put it down & have re-read it several times."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Wow....I couldn't put it down! I guaranteed you will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to reading the next book by Rachel Gibson!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was her first book I had read and I just Loved it!!!! I can't wait to read more of her booksA really feel good book light but fun to read.thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Love Gibson! Her books are really cute and fun to read. Nothing too intellectual...just a fun romance. A quick read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was reccommended to be my a huge Gibson fan. Now I'm not big on Romance Novels, never have been, but she told me to read it anyway. I surprisingly enjoyed it. It's so much more than some schmaltzy love story. These are complicated characters who cannot be simply defined by a stereotype you'd normally see in a novel like this. This story is unafraid to show you the beauty and ugliness in peopel without creating any cardboard villains or throwing out last-minute obstacles to get the third act rolling. While not my favorite book of all time, it made me wanna check out more Gibson books. Definitely if you're into Romance but want more to chew on story-wise, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Rachel Gibson is a true gem in contemporary romance and this book is in my opinion the best of the lot. Delaney is a funny girl who has a real flair for fashion and hot Basque men like Nick. As for Nick, Delaney was always the one that got away (and a real thorn in his side).Gotta say, I loved the witty dialogue between Delaney and Nick as well as the crazy sexual tension any time they were near one another. I have read this book so many times I TRULY have lost count. Great read!!! Love her books can't wait for the newest one!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Good storyline. Good Hero and Heroine. The ending, as is typical with most Rachel Gibson novels, was quite abrupt. The end, and the \\"deal\\" in which the entire situation hinged on, could have used more fleshing out and attention."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"First of all..... I LOVED THIS BOOK! I read this book in roughly a day and just could not put it down! The last chapter I think I reread at least a half dozen times because I felt that there is a ring of truth to it. Childhood crushes are painful. Especially when your first crush is your most memorable. Girls and boys handled things differently when it comes to the affairs of the heart and this book highlighted that there is a ring of truth to all those mean and nice gestures that happen in young love. Or at least we hope it is true....Delaney Shaw, adopted daughter to Henry Shaw was innocent and appreciative of her new father figure. Her mother, Gwen, was a very young unwed mother when Henry found her to make her his new wife. Henry, a difficult man that wanted a child of his own, left his first wife to find someone that could give him a child. All the while, there was a son he refused to acknowledge and his name... Nick. Henry refused to accept his only son for so long that there was resentment so bitter that there really was no resolution. Nick, seeking and being denied the love of his father, falls in love with the daughter that his father adopts to claim as his own. Angry of being denied the love of his father, he feels torn about loving Delaney.Throughout their childhood in a small town in Idaho, Nick flip-flopped between being nice and being mean to Delaney. Delaney was fascinated, yet frustrated with the attractive Nick. On one fateful night, Delaney tries to spread her wings of freedom from her overbearing mother and stepfather with the town's illegitimate bad-boy of Henry Shaw, Nick. After being caught on the hood of Nick's car, she is dragged home to be sent away to a college she did not want to go to and ends up running away from it all. After 10 years away from her family, she is pulled back in by the death of her stepfather. Thinking she can run right after the will is read, she has a choice to make.... in order to collect her three million inheritance, she needs to remain in the town she ran away from for one year and to stay away from Nick. Prior to the death of Henry, Nick was given two pieces of property that he intends to build on to continue growing his self-made fortune, but can lose it if he sleeps with Delaney for that one year. The last ditch effort of Henry Shaw to get his way and he knew he could not lose... He wanted to give his son the one thing he knew he wanted.... Delaney... and the grandchild to carry the family name. Kids always did the opposite of what the parents wanted and he was banking on it from the grave.Delaney and Nick have a connection that surpasses simple infatuation or lust, but try as hard as they can to avoid it to only fail. The love that they have for one another is undeniable while small town living makes it really hard to avoid each other. As we learn about what happened that fateful night before Delaney ran for parts unknown, we also get to learn what happened to Nick as he stayed behind to handle the small town gossip. Insecurity pushes them apart (as well as the inheritance), but love overcomes the challenge. Nick and Delaney are the perfect couple to read about.While I have read similar stories about overbearing fathers and their last grasp for control from the grave, this book one of the best. I only wished the story did not end as quickly as it did, but with the connection that these two had for one another.... it is safe to assume that it was nothing less than blissfully, happily ever after. I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"A book worth reading over and over and over. I have the paperback but ordered it for my Kindle so that I could read while traveling."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I've mentioned this a couple of times on my blog. While I am a very undescisive person I can honestly say hat without a doubt my all-time FAVORITE book is Truly Madly Yours by Rachel Gibson. My sister let me borrow this book back in 2007 when I was barely getting back into reading. It instantly became my favorite and sucked me back into the world of reading. Now, 5 years later, no matter how many great books I have read, this one is still my most favorite one. The last time I read this was last year but I have read it 7 seven times so I think I have it memorized enough to finally write a review. As you probably know by now, I am a total cover freak and as much as I hate to admit it, I totally judge a book by its cover. I know this cover is kind of cheesy but it was released in 1999 and covers were a lot different back then.Nick and Delaney have known each other for years. They both grew up in the town of Truly, Idaho. Delaney was the mayor's perfect adopted daughter and Nick was the illegitimate child that he refused to acknowledge. Because of this, their relationship has always been...complicated. Growing up, Nick was always equal parts fascinated and repulsed by her. He was attracted to her because she was always the one girl he couldn't have, yet he hated her because his dad wanted Delaney as a daughter when he refused to have a relationship with Nick. Nick always loved finding new ways to torment Delaney one minute then be really nice and sweet to her the next. When one night of...almost passion leaves Delaney humiliated, she decides to move away from Truly for good.10 years later, Delaney comes back to Truly for her fathers funeral. Her plan is to spend only a couple of days in Truly to help out her mother and get the hell out of there as soon as possible. Hopefully before she sees Nick again. Unfortunately, luck isn't on Delaney's side. When it is time for her fathers will to be read, she discovers that she is set to inherit $3 million dollars and Nick will inherit a lot of valuable property for him to build condos on. The only stipulations are that Delaney must stay in Truly for a year. Oh yeah, and she can't sleep with Nick! If either of them break the rules, then they forfeit the inheritance. Delaney decides she can handle a year in Truly in exchange for $3 million dollars. Besides, she doesn't even like Nick...Nick quickly returns to his old ways and keeps finding new ways to torment her, piss her off and turn her on. These two have one of the HOTTEST chemistry out there and their relationship is slow, complicated, infuriating and absolutely exhilarating! They have the kind of chemistry that makes your palms tingle and keeps your stomach in knots. It's awesome to see just how far Nick and Delaney are willing to go for money and for love. The pacing in this story is absolutely perfect and allows you to really learn about Nick and Delaney and their feelings. Most of this book is told from Delaney's POV, but there are a few parts that are told from Nick's POV which really lets you see that behind his cold and indifferent exterior, he is just a big ol' softie who is just begging to be loved.Truly Madly Yours is contemporary romance at its absolute best! Has the perfect amount of humor and romance. Delaney is shy and a little bit of a pushover but something about Nick brings out her smart ass and wild side. And Nick! He is still one of my favorite male characters ever! You all know I love my fictional guys the best when they have that perfect mix of jerk but sweet and romantic guy and Nick is the perfect example of this. If you have never read a Rachel Gibson book then this would be a perfect one to start off with. I have read ALL her books and a few of my other favorites are Tangled Up In You, It Must Be Love and Any Man of Mine. If you are ever in the mood for a feel good contemporary romance, Truly Madly Yours is the perfect answer. A sexy and emotional story that you will want to read over and over again.5 out of 5 sparkly stars! My Favorite Book EVER!Some of my favorite non-spoiler quotes from Truly Madly Yours:-He'd been forbidden to her all her life, and she'd been drawn to him like an insect to a bug light.-\\"Come here, wild thing,\\"-\\"You're beautiful, Delaney, and you could have anyone you want. Why me?\\"She knew she wasn't beautiful, not like her mother. But the way he looked at her and touched her, and the tone of his voice when he said it made her almost believe him. He made her believe anything was possible. \\"Because you make me not want to say no.\\"-\\"Delaney.\\"\\"What?\\" She stuck her key on the lock, then paused with her hand on the doorknob.\\"I lied to you yesterday.\\" She looked over her shoulder, but she couldn't see him.\\"When?\\"\\"When I said you could have been anyone. I would know you with my eyes closed.\\" His deep voice carried across the darkness more intimate than a whisper when he added, \\"I would know you, Delaney.\\" Then the squeak of hinges followed by the click of a dead bolt and Delaney knew he was gone.\\"-He glanced at her. \\"I'm not trying to tell you anything. I want you. You want me. Someone is going to end up wearing nothing but a satisfied smile on her lips.\\"\\"I don't know, Nick, I might talk afterward. Do you think you can handle it?\\"\\"I can handle anything you can think up, and a few things you've probablynever even thought of.\\"\\"Do I have a choice?\\"\\"Sure, wild thing. I have four bedrooms. You can choose which one we use first.\\"-\\"You're beautiful.\\" His words warmed her skin and tugged at her heart, and this time she believed he meant what he said. He rested his forehead against her, his dark hair in stark contrast to her white flesh. \\"I knew you would be. I've always known. Always.\\"-It was ironic as hell that she'd found the perfect place exactly where she'd left it.***Read more of my reviews and author interviews at:Nereyda @Mostly YA Book Obsessed"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Rachel Gibson and I highly enjoyed it. It was light and funny at times, and sometimes had an even deeper darker parts of the story which wasn't so dramatic that I enjoyed it.I like how its sort of realistic with how delaney and nicks started seeing each other in the books. Its nice that they finally got together after all that time. and The only parts I had a problem with was that I absolutely hate how Nick treated Delaney after the christmas scene with the mom coming back early. and the ending kind of sucked with how they got back together."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"You'll fall in love with the very sexy half Basque man named Nick.

Henry abandoned them and did not support them in any way. Henry then married Gwen and adopted her daughter Delaney. Because Henry was too controlling, Delaney left town for 10 years. Henry never had any other children and wanted an heir. He tries to start a relationship with Nick, but Nick will have nothing to do with him. Henry tries to convince Nick to have a child and offers him wealth, but Nick refuses. Henry dies and his will states the following. Delaney must come back and live in Truly, Idaho for 1 year to inherit $3 million. Nick must not have sex with Delaney for 1 year to inherit two land properties. Henry believes that Nick will do the opposite of this request.DATA:Sexual content: not evaluated. As I recall the content was mild. Setting: current day Truly, Idaho. Copyright: 1999. Genre: contemporary romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Rachel Gibson books, see my 3.5 star review of \\"See Jane Score\\" posted 10-05-09."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read it in one night...I could not put it down! Delaney and Nick are so great and funny and sexy and adorable together. Nick is just HOT! I did not think Rachel Gibson could top herself after the delightful SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE. Well, I was wrong. I enjoyed TRULY, MADLY YOURS even more. I cannot wait for the next book from this author. I have been reading romantic fiction for a very looong time...believe me when I tell you that Rachel Gibson is one of the very best!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was the first book I ever read by Rachel Gibson, and it is still my favorite. I love Delaney and Nick. I love their small Idaho town. I love the minor characters living in that small town. Anyone (like me) who has ever lived in a small town can relate.Anyone who has an overbearing mother and a shaky relationship with a stepparent will also identify with this. Delaney's mother Gwen is a former hairdresser to Vegas showgirls and is swept off her feet by Henry Shaw, Truly, ID's resident millionaire. Nick Allegrezza is Henry's illegitimate, half-Basque son that he ignored in favor of adopting Gwen's daughter Delaney. Delaney breezes back into town, stylish, rebellious, and itching to leave again when she comes to stay in her mother's stifling home. But there's the matter of Henry's will, which stipulates that Delaney has to stay in town for a year in order to inherit his properties and fortune. If she doesn't, the inheritance reverts to Nick. Of course, the additional hurdle is that Nick cannot become physically involved with Delaney...huh?Sparks really fly in this novel. Gibson builds up the back story of these prospective lovers with good rhythm and tension. It's easy to think Nick is just another gorgeous, sexist jerk who has it in for Delaney and her family, but it's fun finding out why. Nick's family is a riot, too; his mother is also incredibly overbearing and interfering, like Delaney's (and reminds me of my own mother-in-law). Delaney s resourceful and funny; I've noticed a pattern of Gibson's heroines not being very educated, they're more of the \\"graduates from the school of life.\\" Jane from \\"See Jane Score\\" is the only Gibson heroine with a college education that I have seen so far.Plot developments are fluid here, with Delaney and Nick each making separate plans for Henry's money when they inherit (Nick wants to develop the land; Delaney wants to open a high end salon). Delaney opens up a salon anyway, initially to keep herself busy, but inevitably begins to steal the clientele out from under Helen, her rival in high school who stole her boyfriend Tommy. Adding to the romantic tension is Delaney's friend Lisa's impending wedding to Nick's brother, Louie. Delaney and Nick have to get along if they are both going to be in the wedding, don't they? Hint, hint...This book is an easy read with a happy ending."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is the 7th Rachel Gibson book I've read, and so far, it's in my top three favorites (a toss up with See Jane Score and Daisy's Back). I'm sad that I only have one Gibson book left to read and then I have to wait for her next one to come out! This book centers around Delaney and Nick. They grew up in the small town of Truly, Idaho knowing each other, but never quite friends. Then one night, just after Delaney's graduation, the two share a passionate encounter. Circumstances surrounding the encounter cause Delaney to leave Truly for good. Now, more than ten years later, a death in the family brings Delaney back to Truly. She can't seem to avoid Nick in the tiny town. She's unsure of her feelings for him, and she really doesn't know what he thinks about her. Gibson has said that she thinks women will either love Nick or hate him, and I can see her point. Personally, I loved him! He walks a fine line between confident and arrogant, but I like that in a man (if he can back it up!) As usual, the love scenes are awesome. Nobody does them better than Rachel Gibson. The story is hot, hot, hot! You have to read this!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Here's a good example of an author taking a tried and true story premise, adding a new and intriguing twist - then dropping the ball during execution. The plot of this novel is nothing new. In fact in the romance genre it's probably been done a million times. Little girl in small town has crush on bad boy...girl grows up and leaves small town...rich, matchmaking relative dies and there's a will to be read - a will with a few interesting stipulations, that is...and well, you know what comes next, right? But Ms. Gibson manages to spice up the story with a very intriguing backstory. I was captured by the story of little Delaney and little Nick hiding their affection for each other as they grew up as the goody-goody adopted daughter and shunned illegitimate son of Truly, Idaho's leading citizen. Unfortunately, their adult relationship seems to resolve around little more than left-over physical attraction. If there are deeper feelings involved they are indeed very deeply hidden. Oh there are occasional instances where the main characters are actually nice to each other. But these instances are very few and far between. Communication and emotional sharing is very obviously absent from this novel. It's one thing for hero and heroine to say they love each other but, I'd like to see them show it every once in a while. A lot of sex and bickering just doesn't do it for me. But the author does get praise for her character development, dialogue and fast paced plot. With better romantic development this story could have been a keeper. Ms. Gibson does a better job of developing the romantic relationship of her main characters in her earlier novel, Simply Irresistible. If you haven't read her yet, I'd recommend giving that one a try, first."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This plot is four standard romance story lines. Girl returns for a quick visit to the small town she fled years before only to find that circumstances conspire to keep here there. And, of course, there is that dangerous male whose kiss renders her absolutely helpless. That's okay because this book makes the reader feel absolutely helpless, too. The author describes the main characters -- and their feelings -- in tantalizing detail. Whether wildly entangled in the linen closet, or accidentally touching at the town parade, the author writes so vividly that you can almost feel what the characters are feeling. If you like your romances salacious, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I loved this romance and could not put it down. The characters of Nick and Delaney have a history going back to childhood that is impossible for construction company owner Nick Allegrezza to forget. Nick has been with lots of women, but none of them have affected him since he was a boy like Delaney. He keeps the other women constantly throwing themselves at him at bay so that there is no reason for them to think that he will ever marry any of them. Although they keep trying!Hairstylist Delaney Shaw is not the most gorgeous woman in town, but there is something about her that makes Nick want her, even while he tries to stay away from her when she returns to town after a ten year absence to attend her step-father's funeral. A step-father who also happens to be Nick's natural father, although Henry Shaw refused to acknowledge Nick while he was alive. After the reading of the conditions of Henry's will and the chance to inherit 3 million dollars after one year in Truly, Idaho, Delaney rethinks her immediate plans to leave and sets up shop on Main Street, which is next to Nick's construction company office. The ensuing drama builds as the two try as they might can't seem to keep their hands off each other.Very heartwarming and fun!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Truly, Madly Yours is the first book I've read by Rachel Gibson. I used to read a lot but lately hadn't found time. However, once I borrowed this book from a friend of mine that absolutely loves Ms. Gibson's work, I found myself wanting to take time to read and find out what happens! The love scences were incredible, and the bad boy with a heart of gold is wonderful. Now, I love to browse amazon and read about more of Rachel Gibson's work. Trust me, if you love romance, you will love Truly, Madly Yours!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Seriously. My favorite Rachel Gibson book thus far (I've read four of them - three more on the way from Amazon!).I love that the story between Delaney and Nick is so believable. The characters aren't overly cheesey, and their dialouge is just right - not too dumbed-down nor overly thought-out. They are basic, everyday people from a wonderfully real fictional small town who have known each other most of their lives and have to work at defining their relationship.I won't go into the plot, since so many others have, but suffice it to say that it moves very well. So well that I couldn't put it down - I stayed up all night to finish it. And then I started reading it again the next day! (I've read it three times since then, too!).If you're going to read Rachel Gibson, Truly Madly Yours is a must!!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"My favourite writers are Karen Robards and Susan Elizabeth Phillips but I had read all of their books so I was in desperate search of a new writer. I found her!! Rachel Gibson is amazing. Truly Madly Yours was warm, funny and extremely sexy. I fell in love with the characters and I didn't want the book to end. Delaney was quirky, fun and very human. I could really relate to her. Nick was simply amazing... Do men like that really exist out there?? The sparks generated by those two characters was something else. I'm already reading it a second time and looking to find Gibson's fist book Simply Irresistable. Add Rachel Gibson to your list of favourite authors !!! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I couldn't turn the page fast enough. Romances with no suspense/mystery isn't my usual fare but I do make exceptions. I'm so glad I didn't give up on Rachel Gibson after Lola Carlyle Reveals All turned out to be a wallbanger for me. I went on to like Sex, Lies & Online Dating, Tangled Up In You, thought Simply Irresistible was just passable before buying Truly, Madly Yours. It's the best contemporary romance I have had the pleasure to read. It may not be new but the romance and the way it's told is timeless. I know I could read this ten years from now and would still be moved by it.The relationship between Nick and Delaney got me at every turn, at every stage and I've never wanted an HEA for a couple as much as I wanted it for these two. This book had everything to make it a keeper - the romance was bittersweet at first then slowly bloomed; the sex was hot because of the chemistry between Nick and Del and the supporting cast was fabulous.Something to note - despite the cartoonish cover, there is nothing comedic about this book. It is not even a romantic comedy so I'm surprised at the tags some people have attached to it. On the contrary, it's a somewhat serious and emotional story, full of unrequited love, angst and childhood hurts and passions revisited before the protagonists get their happy ending.If there's another book like this one, I hope someone tells me but right now, this is The One."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was another great book by Rachel Gibson. Hard to believe she's only written two (that I know of) books to date. The story line was fast paced and sensual. The characters are all people you can identify with. This is just as good as her other book, Simply Irrisistible. I'll be anxiously awaiting her next release."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This book is a scream! I was laughing so hard at times that I was crying. There are also very touching parts. I loved reading about a heroine who is less than perfect and hasn't gone through life making all the perfect choices. Don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I don't think I've ever read a book with such great reviews that I disliked more. I bought See Jane Score at the USB and really enjoyed it. Truly Madly Yours has a male lead that has absolutely nothing romantic or caring about him. He is the town slut on one hand while bringing home big money being a home builder on the other. Nick claims that he has loved Delaney since they were teens but he never acted in any way kind to her. As far as Delaney goes she was somewhat interesting but I got real tired of her absolutely melting every time Nick so much as looked at her. I'm all for unexplained chemistry between two people but I never understood what the attraction was between Nick and Delaney.This was a dud."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was my first book by Rachel Gibson and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. She writes in a similar vein as Jennifer Crusie (although I think JC's books have better humor). This was a terrific beach book. I think I finished it in less than 2 days. It made me laugh, had just the right amount of 'spice' and characters that were very likable. It's a modern day \\"there's no place like home\\" kind of story that just makes your feel good. I am currently reading See Jane Score, so I did like it well enough to get another book from the same author."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Delaney grew up as the step-daughter of the mayor with a passion for his unacknowledged illegitimate son, Nick Allegrezzo. Caught in a moment of passion with Nick by her stepfather Henry, she flees town, returning 10 years later (amid numerous false rumors about her reasons for leaving) for henry's funeral and to learn the odd conditions of her inheritance.Their first meeting after ten years is at Henry's funeral - he shows up in jeans on his Harley, and picks up on one of the attendees. But he has no intentions of marriage, family, or giving Henry the heir he so desperately wanted.In order for her to inherit $3 million, she must remain in Truly, Idaho, the town that brought her so much pain. In order for Nick to inherit the land that his father has willed to him, he must never engage in a sexual relationship with Delaney. Henry is basically having the last word.Delaney has always thought Nick hated her because she lived in the big house, and he was all but forgotten by Henry. In reality, Nick has always felt a fondness for Delaney, as evidenced from the lengths he would go to grab her attention, oftentimes with mixed results.Despite constantly finding themselves thrown together, and some pretty steamy encounters, will they ever give in to their obvious attraction to each other? It is a Rachel Gibson book... of course they will. And because it is a Rachel Gibson book, there is lots of steam!It is a great, quick read (though like many other readers, I would have liked maybe one more chapter). The secondary romance with her mother is not fleshed out."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"After being away from home for ten years, Delaney Shaw returns to Truly, Idaho for her Stepfather's funeral. Then she plans to leave town ASAP. Her mother requests her presence at the reading of the will. She attends expecting to receive nothing more than a gag gift but is surprised to learn that she has inherited a sizeable sum. Much to her dismay, it is stipulated that she reside in Truly for one year before she can collect her inheritance. She decides to stay and opens a beauty salon next door to Allegrezza Construction. As a child, she was fascinated by Nick Allegrezza but that fascination turned sour after discovering that he used her to get back at his father. Leaving town was her only option. Now she's back and realizes that Nick is as irresistible as ever.Ten years ago Nick Allegrezza was the town's bad boy. Nick had matured and opened his own construction company but he continues to attract attention riding his harley, wearing an earring and tying back his long hair. Nick also received an inheritance from Henry Shaw--he is Henry's illegimate son and only biological heir. At first, Henry denied him, but by the time Nick was five, he looked like a Shaw and Henry had to accept that Nick was his son. But it was too late. By the time Henry was ready to make amends, Nick had turned stubborn and refused to accept Henry's efforts. Nick's inheritance also came with a stipulation--he was to have no sexual relationship with Delaney. Unknown to anyone, Nick had always been attracted to Delaney and now that she opened her salon next door to his construction company, it was going to be difficult to treat her with indifference.I've read and enjoyed all of Rachel Gibson's books and if I had to pick my favorite, &quot;Truly, Madly Yours&quot; would be it. I think this is her hottest story. Delaney is so likeable and Nick is so sexy and outrageous and Gibson's best hero to date. I look forward to her next novel due out in April, 2002."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"In Truly, Idaho, Henry Shaw loathed being ill so he killed himself. Many of the townsfolk feel that their former mayor was killed by his illegitimate son, who hated the man he considered no more than a sperm donor. His step-daughter Delaney arrives from Arizona to attend his funeral. To the shock and dismay of Delaney's mother, Henry's estranged bastard son Nick Allegrezza comes to pay his final respects.Laney is shocked to learn that Henry named her in his will since they departed on not so friendly or fatherly terms. However, it is the will itself that truly stuns Delaney. She must reside in town for the next year if she wants to inherit several million dollars. If she fails to meet the stipulation, the money goes to Nick, who has inherited some property from his father with a stipulation also. He must refrain from sex with Laney for the next year or lose the property to her. Laney has loved Nick for over a decade, but he remains angry at everyone,but especially his father. As they try to meet the terms of the will, they begin to fall in love, but he has much personal baggage to overcome and she has pressure from her mother and friend to stay away from the bad seed.TRULY MADLY YOURS is SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE as readers will conclude that Rachel Gibson is no one-hit wonder. Her second contemporary romance is intelligent and engaging, and sure to obtain the witty writer many new fans. The story line is fun and the characters are genuine and interesting. Readers will make Ms. Gibson truly, madly theirs.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"rarely have i read a romance with such a weak heroine. somehow she turns to mush every time the hero tries to kiss her.she's a boring under-achiever and not worthy of being the subject of a whole novel.the hero is a domineering male who would work much better opposite a feisty lead than a dull pushover. also, there's no real reason given about why the hero even loves her, other than the fact that he used to be obsessed with her when they were kids."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I read this book after I finished with Simply Irresistible and this book is as better as the other. Delaney, coming home to Truly after 10 years, to attend the reading of her step-father's will. She meets again with Nick, her stepfather's illegitimate son whom she has loved over a decade.I enjoyed every moment reading this book. Nick was sexy! Their encounter in the linen room was hot! The end was worth-it...Imagine a guy cut his hair just to win your heart...wasn't that sweet?"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"It didn't take me long to get through this one. The chemistry between Delaney &amp; Nick was pure sizzle! There were small twists &amp; turns throughout. The story made me yearn for a Nick who would give me tiaras for Christmas. I look forward to checking out more by this author."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I have now just finished reading every book of Rachel Gibson's and she has got to be one of the freshest and best writers in the genre! This sweet book, of Delaney and Nick, being watched by the town of Truly, Idaho is fantastic. Ms. Gibson's captures the hysterical quirks of small town living and writes two passionate characters each desperate for love. I just want the author to go back and write more stories about the magical quirky towns she has created. I encourage you all to get are Ms. Gibson's work and read in a chocolate and coffee marathon! Lesbians and cholonic's will never be sooo funny!Great work!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This was the first Rachel Gibson book I have read, and in my opinion, the best one. While I admit it was the pretty cover that attracted me into buying this book, the content made the book worthwhile to read. It is funny and romantic and both Delaney and Nick are so likeable. This story is cute and sweet, and worth buying! I've already added this book to my permanent collection of books that I like to read over and over!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I loved this book! What a great change from the &quot;typical&quot; romance novels. Cute story with some spice! I didn't want it to be over. I hope she keeps writing. I can't wait for her next one."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Delaney Shaw is shocked out of her mind when her stepdad Henry leaves her a fortune. But the catch is that she must stay in Truly, Idaho, for one year, and for Nick Allegrezza, the man she can't get out of her mind, the requirement is that he not have a relationship with Delaney if he's to claim his fortune. This is a hilarious setup that is well followed through. Gibson's style is fast paced and breezy, and captures the sheer hell of having to live where you don't want to."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This female character is a horrible, selfish, immature, shallow, vain, meanspirited person. The male character's are boreline misogonist and egotist- and that's suppose to be sexy. I thought it was a satire so i kept reading, but sadly it wasn't. I just grew more and more disgusted with both lead characters as it went on, hoping for a sliver of redemtion. By the end, the only way she could redeam herself is to apologize, leave town and join a convent- same for him. She judges everyone based on thier physical apperance in the most mean spirited inner monologe I've every heard in a romance. This is the majority of the book: nasty opinions of other people. She's done nothing with her life except satisfy her own shallow whims, sometimes at the expense of others, and then to make matters worse- she only sticks around in a town she thinks is so far beneth her to inherit 3 million dollars she doesn't deserve and didn't earn. He is also a shallow user. He uses women and sees them as disposable toys and tosses them aside, and it is implied that because he didn't lie about it- than it's okay- even though they are very clear about wanting a relationship with him. When she comes along he treats her like trash, and this is suppose to be sexy too. Why? because he likes her??? Or is this some pathetic attempt at creating friction between two unbelieve characters. Neither of them do anything to earn anyone's love or anyone else's, nor makes an effort to reach out or change. She's disrepectful to her mother, obnoxious to her rival; does much wrong to these women and never apologizes. There is no reason for them to fall in love- it's more like lust. There's nothing that completes the other one- unless that is snobery. Two snotty trust fund babbies with daddy's money- who died and they dont even care- hooking up to boost each other's ego. The book ends anticlimatically and suddenly with no further explinations, healing, apologies or revelations, This is an anti-romance novel."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Well, having read &quot;Truly, Madly Yours&quot;, I should have been warned about &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot;: Both have a rather weak plot line and both have really two-faced characters. Honestly, Ms Gibson gets the love and sex and fun part right in both books, but in order to classify as an excellent romance, the hero and heroine should form a lasting relationship or at least a relationship the reader thinks will last. NEITHER BOOK FULFILLS THOSE REQUIREMENTS! Cause when you get to the bottom line, do you think Delaney and Nick will live HEA (happily ever after)? I don't. She's creative, spunky, a little weird and plainly not beautiful. He is though, but he's not creative, he's more mean than spunky and even though he lusts after her, they plainly don't have a lot to say to each other except when trading insults. Still hoping Ms Gibson works on relationship development plot line for the next book BUT KEEPS ALL THE OTHER GREAT ELEMENTS!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"The process was fine. Got a fun book to read in a timely manner. Foud the same book at McKay's Used books for half the price and no shipping a week after I got it."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I read her See jane Score before this and this was another winner by Rachel gibson! This was a fast, fun and very sexy read. I loved the whole small town feel that she created in this book. The protagonists as well as the secondary characters were very appealing. I now look forward to her Simply Irresistible which is next in my TBR pile!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Cute reading for a break from serious reading."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I actually bought true confessions in the airport and got so into it that I was sad when it ended. I immediately picked up Truly Madly Yours and fell in love with the book. Man Ms. Gibson is making me want to move to Idaho and find a man. Nick is just too sexy for words. Always loved a guy who dresses in faded levis and tshirts... I am going to buy another of her books tomorrow. I am addicted!."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that the reader just doesn't get the feeling that the couple will last into happily ever after. Delaney and Nick don't seem like a likely couple and their characters, especially in relation to each other, are not explored in such a way that the reader gets the impression that the two, even given their differences, will form a lasting pair.BUT (and it's a big but!), that didn't take away from ANY of the enjoyment I felt while reading the book. I don't generally read contemporary romances (I prefer historicals) and this was one of my first few, and I found Truly Madly Yours purely delightful. I put it down once (at 1 in the morning because I felt I needed some sleep before work the next day), and from the moment I picked it up again, I was just so caught up in the story that I couldn't leave the book unfinished a second time (ended up staying up until 3 the next night).Delaney is truly likeable. She's sassy, somewhat plain, addicted to shoes, and trying to live her own life away from the strict rules she grew up with. She's very much a real person to me. Nick, though a little TOO perfect to be that realistic, isn't without his vulnerabilities either. Though gorgeous, rich and a total ladies' man, he has his own insecurities, which makes him more human and someone the reader can sympathize with.I found the story wonderfully written, with a great dose of humour throughout and some VERY steamy parts. I highly recommend this book and don't think anyone who picks it up will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I heavily rely on recommendation to choose my reading material. I cannot believe how much positive feedback that this book received had I know what a jerk the H was and how spineless the h would be I wouldn't have bothered with this book. Different strokes and all that I guess...I have read books where the H is an alpha male or a bad boy or a rebel and I still felt a connection between him and the h. One never feels like a true love connection ever developed between the h and the H in this book. The H just came across as mean and although he owns his rudeness and dismissive behavior, he never really seems that remorseful. He sets out time and time again to purposely hurt the h and yet somehow that is supposed to be romantic. IMO, the bad boy persona only works when the H falls entirely for the h exposing a side of him that would be otherwise hidden from everyone else. He might hurt the h due to circumstances or by mistake but never purposely as this H does time and again. Despite the fact that the author definitely got the brooding H, she failed to develop a tender side of him that I wanted to fall in love with. New locks and snow tires did not outweigh his deliberate callous actions. It did not make me feel any better that this H was equally degrading to all the female characters he had sex with, not just the h.I hate these kinds of H and hate books with h that put up with that kind of treatment even more. ***SPOILER*** After 368 pages of the H treating the h poorly, including the H inviting the h to join a threesome after she walked in on him almost cheating on her, there is 5 pages of a sorry and a HEA. THAT IS NOT an exaggeration, 5 pages, I counted! The entire ex-girl friend thing was dismissed as I wanted you to think that I was going to cheat on you, but I really wasn't going to. Oh, was that all! So, what where his reason for wanting to hurt her? Because he loved her soooo much and he thought she was going to leave town. Naturally, instead of asking her to stay he wanted to hurt her again as painfully as possible again.If H that are demeaning and h that are doormats don't bother you, you might like this book. I hated the H so much in this book that I am beyond saying anything positive other than I only found one spelling error in the entire book."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This book has got to be the best contemporary romance I have ever read! I have read it so many times that the pages are falling apart. If ever there was an Uber Alpha Male it's Nick. And Delaney is such a great match for him. I have loved all of Rachel Gibsons books but to me this is the best of the best. Delaney and Nick have always had a hate/hate relationship going on as well as a lust/lust for as long as they can remember. Nick was the [...] son of the town mayor who never claimed him.Delaney was his father's step daughter after her mother married the mayor. Nick provoked Delaney all through their youth while secretly yearning for something he couldn't have. A father's love AND Delaney. Delaney stayed as far away from Nick as she could. He intimidated her. He had a reputation as a bad boy which he lived up to since it was a known fact he had charmed the pants off all the local girls. After having a fallout with her step father Delaney leaves at 18 but returns 10 years later for his funeral. There she once again encounters Nick and the tension mounts as does their attraction.Rachel Gibson words flow through this story. It has so many laugh out moments and so many gut wrenching emotions. You fall in love with the townfolk and all their small town ways. And you watch as Nick and Delaney go from falling into lust to falling into love. The only downer was that it ended a little too abruptly. Or maybe it was because I was crying at the time and didn't want it to end. An epilogue would have been nice with them married but oh well..you can't have everything!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I'm all about a happy ending- and the ending in this book is what made it my favorite.I hate (and i do mean hate) guys with pony tails. So if I liked this book where Nick (the main character) has a pony tail, then it must be good.You get to read a little tiny bit more about the characters in \\"Tangled Up In You.\\""},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well. Nick and Delaney have had feelings for one another since they were kids (although they both fought against them). Delaney left town to escape her controlling step-father when she was 18 and never looked back. Nick has always been the bad boy of Truly. Delaney is forced to return to the small town when her step-father unexpectedly passes away. The sexual tension between Nick & Delaney due to their \\"unfinished business\\" can be felt throughout the book.I definitely recommend this book for fans of contemporary romance. There is no suspenseful plot in this book, but it's not all sugary either."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Earns every one of the possible 5 stars. I missed the characters as soon as I was done with the book and two days later started reading through it all over again, going over my favorite parts which was almost the whole book. A quick and eager page turner. The tension is hot and the characters are amazing. This should absolutely be made into a movie. Someone out there in Hollywood needs to pick this up. Can't believe it hasn't been done yet!! We need to see this come to life on the big screen. Absolutely recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This book was HOT. The chemistry between Nick and Delaney was electrifying! There was so much passion between the two of them, it was a amazing. He was so sexy and strong. He had such a wonderful heart. I loved the fact that he had always loved her; since she was just a girl. The story was fast paced, I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one day. I even found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. This book is a must read, it is a gem."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"If you love \\"prodigal daughter\\" romance novels, then you'll enjoy this book. Gibson's story has great pacing, a believable plot, and likeable characters. Basic premise? Delaney left town after her parents caught her in a compromising position with the town bad boy, Nick, who just so happens to be her stepfather's illegitimate son. Now she's back for the reading of her stepfather's will, and if she wants her inheritance she needs to stay in town for a year. Of course this throws her together with Nick, and of course attraction ensues.I sympathized with Delaney. She had a lot of pressure on her to be the perfect daughter, which Gibson conveys quite well. And the relationship between hero and heroine has sufficient sizzle, striking a perfect balance between their adult attraction and their history. Their past creates the perfect amount of present tension. Unfortunately, Gibson chooses to sidestep rather than truly resolve their prior misunderstandings. Despite this oversight, however, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Coming in a close second is See Jane Score...I love Rachel Gibson's writing. Her storylines are unique and her characters well defined. The story was a little slow at first and I was unsure of the whole connection of the main characters, but once you get past that, it's perfect. The hero is a proud man with vulnerabilities that will tear your heart out. Her scenes of intimacy are as hot as always and show up at just the right time.Buy this one because you WILL read it again and again."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Yep, this was definitely a good buy. This was the first Rachel Gibson book I ever read and it was wonderful. I had barely finished it when I wanted to start reading it all over again. There were times when I didn't want to like Nick, yet somehow he managed to intrigue me. I could identify with Delaney's do-I-love-him-or-hate-him emotions. But when you get down to it, he was really in love with her and she loved him. After reading so many romances where the couple only knew each other a few weeks before they're in love and getting married, I liked that these two had known and been drawn to each other for most of their lives. If the rest of Ms. Gibson's novels are like this one, she just acquired a new fan."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I thought this was a delightful book. Although Delany Shaw was not a conventional heroine (she dresses like a hooker when she is already the subject at everyone's dinner table and her hair, which is naturally blonde, has been dyed to about &quot;five different shades of red&quot;)she is independant and strong willed. Nick and Delaney have an unfinished past that is begging for closure! This book was very well written, the characters were fleshed out and there was fantastic dialog. And the humor was great. So many times author's are shooting for humor and miss the mark big time but, Ms. Gibsons was geuinely funny! A great read!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I loved her first book, Simply Irresistible, and was excited to read this one too, but no joy. The heroine is whiny and unsympathetic and the leading man is an annoying cretin.Maybe it's because the things I liked about the first book are so notably absent here. This author really has an ear for convincing child characters, but you won't find one in this book. I like women who make their own way in the world and improve their lives, but this heroine was content to let her life control her. Rather than growing by facing up to some of the old problems from the home town she fled, the heroine falls back into the same old behaviors and never really changes. Any humor seemed to come at another character's expense. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"\`Truly Madly Yours' by Rachel Gibson is a fun contemporary romance novel. Delaney Shaw is Henry's stepdaughter and Nick Allegrezza Henry's illegitimate son and they are being living at odds for years. Henry kills himself and set-up a very interesting Will. The Will forces Delaney to live in the small town of Truly, Idaho for a year and Nick cann't sleep with Delaney and then they both get a huge inheritance. Nick and Delaney share a past and in small towns nothing is forgotten. It was a great book - I finished it in an evening. If you enjoy this genre, I would also suggest, 'Flirting with Danger' by Suzanne Enoch, 'Crazy For You' by Kate Angell and \`Saving Allegheny Green' by Lori Wilde, 'See Jane Score' by Rachel Gibson and \`Underfoot' by Leanne Banks"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I've got to say....i've read quite a few books in my 32 years...but NOBODY writes like Rachel Gibson!!!! This is by far my favorite book she's written. Delaney wants nothing more than to gas up her car and get as FAR from Truly as she possibly can...that is...until her stepfather's will keeps her in town for a year and bad-boy Nick comes into the picture once again after 10 yrs...... making life pretty interesting for the tiny town of Truly."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"'Truly Madly Yours' is my second favourite novel from Rachel Gibson (next to 'See Jane Score'). The chemistry between Nick and Delaney is great, and the characters are pretty realistic. I like the way Delaney is independent and holds her own. Nick melted my heart by doing all those things to show that he cared for Delaney (the tires, the crown, the locks). All in all, this novel is just absolutely amazing. I have yet to be disappointed in any one of Rachel Gibson's works."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I started this book at 10:00pm finished it at 3:00am COULD NOT put it down it was a welcome diversion and well worth the lack of sleep today ((smile))The dialogue between Delaney and Nick is one that you just smile and laugh to yourself at moments. Reminds me of the Witty humor of a Cary Grant and Irene Dunne movie. The Sex Scenes are Seductive, Playful and very satisfying. I have had this in my TBR (to be read pile) since 1999 now I guess I'll have to check out the rest of her work. If you LOVE Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Series you'll enjoy this book. It's light nothing dark and mysterious just a good light read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"This is the perfect book for when you just want to enjoysomething and not have to work too hard. It's not Jane Austin orCharles Dickens, that's for sure, but it's very entertaning. Perfectbeach book. It's funny, sweet, and a nice read. It won't tax you at all...but, you'll enjoy it.

It's not great literature but it's a very pleasant easy read."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"If you haven\`t ready any books by Ms. Gibson, don\`t start here. Try Sex, Lies and On-Line Dating or See Jane Score for a more interesting plot and well-developed characters. The lead love interests have potential in this book, but the constant vacillation between love and hate gets tiresome. This is an okay read, but not great romance."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I liked that Delaney struggled with being independent, even at almost 30, and that her mom never really understood.

Yes, it is predictable and all that fun stuff but I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to a friend!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I really enjoyed these characters. I'm not going to do a plot summary. That's above by Amazon or by other reviewers. I thought all these characters clicked. They were very well developed. There were some plot holes but that's to be expected in romance novels. I enjoyed the concept of the daughter returning home instead of the son. I felt the ending was a little fast after all the build up but it was still a very good book. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good interesting romance novel. Great beach book."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I feel misled by all the positive reviews, and the cover art. The cover design implies a chick-lit style romp. Instead, the book is mirthless, the characters unlikeable, and cliches thrown in about \\"glinting grey eyes\\" and \\"long hard\\" you-know-what's. Struggled to get to page 80, then just flipped through the rest and gave up.Oh, and also I found it quite insulting and superficial to keep seeing the word Basque constantly repeated in context as \\"dark sexy dangerous\\". It's a culture, not a physical trait for fetishizing."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"I really liked this book. It had it's good and bad points. Delaney returns to town after 10 years for her stepfather's funeral. She left at 18 after being caught with bad boy Nick, her stepdad's illegitimate son. When she went away to college she finally got a chance to live her life and make her own mistakes without her overbearing, controlling parents interferring. She went wild and dropped out of college and lived a vagabond life moving from town to town looking for the perfect place and job. She returns to Truly, Idaho for her stepfather's funeral and some really crazy stipulations in his will if she wants to inherit.I liked the heroine Delaney. She was funny and down to earth even though I wished she would have put her mother in her place. Now Nick I loved and hated. He could be a real jerk one minute and really sweet the next. The main problem I had with him is that after being with Delaney it is alluded to that he is still with other women. I understood him still running around with women before they got together but afterward he refused to committ to just Delaney and references were made that he spent time with another woman. End the end I thought his carousing ways should have been addressed. He admits he could never be with just one woman nor would he want to. So while I love books with alpha male characters who are finally tamed, I just didn't see that happening with Nick. But overall this is a great book."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"rachel gibson's leading men tend to be a bit too \\"bad boy\\" for me. she is a wonderful writer though. sex scenes are a bit too much for me, but if you like that than this is your book!"},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"Wow. I've recently discovered Rachel Gibson's work and i just wanted to say thanks. I've enjoyed everything i've read so far--this book was entertaining for sure. She wrote two great characters (Nick was dreamy. Delaney was realistic. the sexual tension was great!) and made the family history and small town life quite interesting and appealing. I will always laugh when i hear the phrase \\"wild thing..\\" My only issue--when she buys him a size 15.5 shirt for xmas. If i pictured him correctly he should be more a 16-17--Large or XL, not a medium for sure...."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"And I can't!

Bravo Ms Gibson, I finally found a novelist who can pull the string of reader's hearts and keep us laughing all the way to the end page.

The plot was easy to follow and the characters were true to life. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Truly Madly Yours","review":"(...)I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters are people that I would seek to avoid had I known them.Delaney is portrayed as small-minded, trashy, (...) and evil spirited. Nick is portrayed a little better. Throughout the entire book, all they did was trash each other. The intimate scenes seemed like they were randomly thrown in, and then immediately - they were back to trashing each other.There seemed to be no buildup of respect or understanding. This book left me feeling unsettled and uneasy and left me wondering how could anyone REALLY enjoy reading this.Maybe my standards are too high.

This is the only one worthy of permanent desk space. Everything you would ever need to look up is included in this book. From Photoshop to Flash, palette optimization, integration, javascript, and interactivity! I used to have piles of books, now I can just use this single reference. There are great color pictures on almost every page, and step by step guidelines on how to recreate the projects. There's even a CD-Rom full of examples.

But look what you see when you get to the top! The book is very inspiring and really fired my imagination. Even given all the limitations of animation on the web, this gives you an idea of what is possible. I've been slow to join the web designer hordes. Part of the reason is that most of what you see on the web is a pale imitation of good print design. However, the info. in this book illustrates quite clearly that this is a medium that can almost physically reach out and grab you by the collar or very subtly, gracefully and intuitively, help you get what you need.

There is a huge amount of real world professional experience that has gone into this book as well a very useful sample files, and tutorials.

Once you get used to thinking in his terms, your animation production times become shorter and more creative. A must buy for anyone serious about web animation."},{"Title":"Effective Web Animation: Advanced Techniques for the Web with Other","review":"Effective Web Animation includes an exhaustive survey of different concepts and applications used in the creation of stunning animations (interactive and otherwise) for use on the web. While other web animation books might focus primarily on simply making GIF animations, Hamlin's book gives a much broader (yet in-depth) investigation into palettes, transparency issues, optimizations, timing options and disposal methods, as well as methods of creating interesting and compelling motion. In addition, Effective Web Animation goes far beyond GIF animations, and explores the capabilities of combining GIFs and JPGs into new techniques that are controlled by Javascript, and it becomes clear how to decide when it is more efficient and flexible to use Javascript over the standard GIF format.EWA really shines by explaining its techniques in an application-independent way, such that you understand how particular features are beneficial before you even need to worry about what particular software you're going to use. Examples are shown using specific applications like Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Flash, but it is done in such a way that you don't necessarily feel &quot;tied&quot; to those applications. Some examples show how multiple applications were used to develop one animation, which shows how you can combine the relative strengths of different graphics applications to create something more complex than any one application would allow you to create. The book &quot;educates&quot; you instead of &quot;trains&quot; you, giving you a good conceptual foothold to take advantage of your knowledge regardless of the application you happen to be using.The artwork and animations featured in the book cover a variety of styles, and the case studies section shows off various types and complexities of animations from some impressive sites on the web now."},{"Title":"Effective Web Animation: Advanced Techniques for the Web with Other","review":"The examples in Effective Web Animation will help small web design shops quickly emulate many of the graphic effects used on most popular web sites.

I'm an aviation nut, and am in awe of the presidency and its trappings. I watch West Wing every Wednesday to get the inside view of the White House, and I own the DVD of Air Force One starring Harrison Ford. So this book was a natural for me, and I knew that I would love it even before I picked it up.That said, once I started getting into the book, it was better than I ever anticipated. The authors do a great job of laying out the history of air travel and the office of the President, and you quickly realize how Air Force One was instrumental in creating the world view that the United States was (and is) a SuperPower nation. Not only do you get a great history lesson as to the importance of modern avaiation and the American presidency, you are also enlightend as to the technology and logisitcs involved in keeping the president moving around the globe.This book is great for anyone who has an interest in presidential history, as well as people who love aviation history. The pictures, while many have been seen previously, make for a great and welcome addition to the text. You certainly feel as if you have had an opportunity to fly on Air Force One.I really enjoy having this book in my library, and if I owned a coffee table, I'd have it sitting on the coffee table."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"AIR FORCE ONE by Von Hardesty is a terrific book about the presidential plane. Chocked full of interesting details about the planes, the presidents, the politics, the d&eacute;cor and even the dish behind each president from Roosevelt to George W. Bush, it is a book that gives the full picture of the most famous plane in the world. I recently saw Bob Schieffer (who wrote the foreword) of CBS's Face the Nation Fame talking about it on a television show and couldn't resist buying it when hearing the behind-the-scenes stories. I now have a better understanding about AIR FORCE ONE and its significance to our presidents. The book has many photos which capture the behind-the-scenes world of each president, first ladies, and their families and the key players who rode on the planes during historical visits such as Nixon's visit to China, Lyndon Johnson's swearing in as president following the tragic assassination of JFK . This book would make a great holiday gift, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"Van Hardesty brings a special expertise to this specialized aviation history by being the curator of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped The Modern Presidency is a reader engaging, informed and informative presentation on those advances in air travel which have affected the American Presidency and enabled America's leaders to make more and farther-ranging visits around the world. More than 260 color and archival photographs illustrate this absorbing story of the air vehicles that have served the American President in the twentieth century. Air Force One is a strongly recommended contribution to both Aviation History reference collections and American Political Science supplemental reading lists."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"I originally ordered this book after searching for titles on my son's 6th grade summer reading list. Air Force One is not what I would consider \\"summer reading\\" for a 6th grader, but it is a great coffee table quality book, with brilliant color and black and white photos interspersed through very well-written and interesting history of the president's aircraft. It gives insight into the world events during each U. S. presidency as well as some highlights of each presidents' use and views of Air Force One. Also included is a section on presidential pre-aircraft travel and Marine One, the president's helicopter. My son, who loves any information about aircraft, spent hours looking through it, although he did not read it word for word. Great to have as reference or historical enjoyment."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"This is an interesting book both textually and visually. It shows how aviation made the Presidency a world office. Aviation buffs will enjoy the lineage of Presidential Aircraft and the inside and outside views. Much history occured on Air Force One and newsman Bob Schieffer presents some of the more historic moments for us. There is a table inside which shows how many assets and resources are necessary just to move the President of the United States which is an eye-opener. A fascinating book and a great gift idea for the holidays. It's one of those books that you'll look at again and again over the years."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"This book would be of great interest to &quot;presidential&quot; buffs!

This informative and interesting book traces the history of chief executive flying from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush. Each president brought his own personality to the plane: John Kennedy was often hoisted in a steel cage to the entrance to avoid climbing the stairs with his ailing back; Richard Nixon preferred to remain isolated once aboard and seldom moved about the plane; Jimmy Carter used flights on Air Force One as a reward or inducement for congressional members' votes; Bill Clinton liked to pack the plane with political luminaries; in November Bush flew Air Force One into the heart of a hostile Baghdad to have Thanksgiving with our military in Iraq. There are numerous photographs and anecdotes about the plane and its place in history. There's also a foreword by broadcast journalist Bob Schiefer who was on board many flights in the Gerald Ford and Carter administrations."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"The book ( Air Force One )by von hardesty. talks about the transportation of the president of the United Status to fly abroad and the safety of this plane. The first president who used Air Force One is John F Kennedy and the last president to use it is Barack Obama. The airplane is Boeing model 747S. There are many types of entertainment in this plane like rooms, big menu for food, The white house is who takes care of this plane. The best part of this book for me is the history of the jet age. Maybe because the book is old. I expected more out of the book, Air Force One. I'm interested in this book because I love airplanes and my father has worked in Saudi Arabian Airlines, and now two of my brothers are working in Saudi Arabian Airlines as pilots."},{"Title":"Air Force One: The Aircraft That Shaped the Modern Presidency","review":"I have the hard cover edition, and it's a beautiful high quality book. Filled with unpublished photographs, real life stories and historical background of the Presidential transport. Each chapter is a chronological narration of the evolution of presidential travel, since George Washington riding horse, up to George W. Bush on board Air Force One during 9/11, passing thru WWII, the jet era, JFK assasination, Nixon's resignation and Reagan's tours.It is also loaded with parallel information, like personal experiences, technical specifications, aircraft interior and systems up-grades and much more.Reccommended for Presidential followers, aviation enthusiasts or luxury books collectors.The book was published in 2003, so it is updated to Bush's administration."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"How did L. A. Franco ever get her job? She hates her boss and distrusts the whole LA Police Department that she works for in Baxter Clare's good, new book &quot;Bleeding Out&quot;. She's tough and competent. I got the book for a birthday present, and I wasn't sure I'd finish it. The back cover blurb says &quot;Mystery/Lesbian Fiction&quot;, and that isn't anything I'd pick up for myself. But after a few pages, just a sample, I couldn't leave the book alone. Baxter Clare's first novel is a hell of a story. It's very graphic, but that goes with the territory, Southeast Los Angeles. Frank, that's what everybody calls Franco, drags you along with her single-minded determination to get the villain. She's real and her friends and coworkers are real. And the bad guy is really BAD. &quot;Bleeding Out&quot; is what a thriller should be. It will have broad appeal among all us mystery fans."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"I found drops of brillance in Bleeding Out. As with any debut novel, I give the authoress her due. Baxter Clare introduces us to the world of Lt. Franko and all that is entailed in her inner city struggle between criminals and police politics in solving a serial rapist case. We are also privy to inner demons of a violently lost lesbian love, a rebirth into a non-conforming society, and an isolation finally thrown off. Almost as if cloaks of darkness removed will allow voids to be filled--like buttery warmed pastries &amp; the playing of &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; ( I prefer Etta James' version ) can fulfill a Sunday morn.An intriguing criminal read with inner glimpses into important issues of lesbianism."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"Clare's first novel, Bleeding Out, is a taut, gritty, psychological thriller set in contemporary South Los Angeles. Police Lt. L.A. Franco is a tough, tall, handsome, intelligent, dyke investigator. Years ago, the traumatic loss of her lover prompted Franco to shut down much of her personal life and focus on work. Years in one of the city's toughest districts have built an armor around Franco.Franco cares about the people in her district and is alarmed when the first victim of a serial murderer appears. Franco sees the pattern in these murders as an extension of earlier, increasingly brutal, rapes and walks a razor's edge as she allows herself to sink deeper into the killer's mind in order to track him down.Clare provides remarkable insight into the &quot;rearing&quot; of a serial killer in a series of short, often horrific vignettes at the beginning of each chapter. These hauntingly powerful depictions stay with the reader.Allison Kennedy, a young, smart mouthed, narcotics officer is brought in to act as bait for the killer. Displeased with the stake out plan, Franco is annoyed, worried and just a little attracted to Kennedy. --Feelings that Franco does not welcome, yet may be important for her salvation. Not because their relationship is necessarily destined to be a success, this is not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; love story. -- Because for the first time in years Franco feels more than simple lust for another woman and is willing to risk the relationship.Some of Clare's secondary characters are difficult to differentiate, particularly in the macho police world. Yet other characters are complex, compassionately drawn and touchingly real. Not a thoughtless, pleasant armchair mystery; Bleeding Out is a well written, engrossing thriller of police investigation and politics."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"Los Angeles Police Lt. L. A. \\"Frank\\" Franco is introduced here as she seeks the killer of a young girl. She eventually ties in nine rapes and four murders to the perpetrator. Franco is meticulous and thorough as she shifts through the few clues she has. The author painstakingly puts us into the mind of both the perpetrator and Franco. This is police procedural at its best. The characterizations are such that the reader cares about the main characters even the closed-off Franco. There are several minor characters that the author manages to fully flesh out as well although Franco's squad members are, at times, hard to identify because of her use of their nicknames - a minor flaw at best. This author deserves a wide audience. Let's hope the author and her publisher gives us more of Baxter Clare and Lt. Franco."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"Frank, LA Freek, or as I preferred to think of her, Franco, is a gay policewoman in the sinister world of South L.A. Here, day to day life is not just a jungle, it is a survivor's path of dirt, grafitti, wretched poverty, petty crime, and the force 's obstacle course of keeping some modecum of decorum in their lives, as well as in their assigned neighborhood.Franco is mourning her violently lost lover Maggie. Almost as a turtle wears it's shell, Franco's tough exterior is a protective armour of grueling workouts, alcohol sprints, workaholic tendencies, and self -imposed isolation. Strangely, the tracking of a serial rapist and murderer brings her back to life.I did enjoy this criminal read. There were a few too many characters for my tastes. And at times the writing was trite. Also on the negative side, I wanted to visualize through the author's words the take down of the rapist. That is like the pay-off in a crime story. Like pulling on a one-armed bandit till it spews the action for you. Well, no whistles and bells here--just played off with a newspaper story. I'm not sure if Ms. Clare had a reason for that or if she just ran out of ideas.In fact, I am wondering if someone else wrote the spicy narratives found before most chapters. Now, those were tightly woven glimpses into the rapists life as the story progressed. I anticipated them and found them original, not so forced as some of the book seemed.&quot;Bleeding Out&quot; is an easy to read criminal novel needing a few more twists than lesbianism. Still a good debut novel through Firebrand Books and Baxter Clare.other reading suggestions: &quot;The Woman Who Rode To The Moon&quot; by Bett Reece Johnson and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; by Jeffrey DeaverYour interest &amp; comment votes are appreciated--CDS"},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"Baxter Clare has written a novel that is impossible to put down. The writing is crisp, very detailed and moves amazingly well. The case itself is disturbing, centering around the brutal rapes and murders of teenage girls in south central Los Angeles. Clare does a wonderful job of illustrating the urgency Lt. Franco and her colleagues feel as they try to solve this case before someone else is killed.The lesser characters are very well defined and the reader can't help but empathize with each one in turn as they deal with varying aspects of their jobs and the unrelenting stress that takes them ever closer to burning out. But what makes this book work is the portrait the reader is given of the main character Lt. L.A. Franco. Here is a woman who willingly tortures herself with a past that she refuses to forget, preferring, instead, to inundate herself with work, alcohol and exercise.The only drawbacks to this otherwise fantastic novel, are Clare's over reliance on nicknames and her portrait of Kennedy, a detective from another unit who is recruited as a decoy to try and trap the killer. After wading through more nicknames then I could count, I completely gave up trying to fit them with corresponding characters. As well, Clare's portrait of Kennedy as a drawling, gum cracking, pseudo surfer chick strains credibility. However, these are very minor flaws in an otherwise great book. This is one novel that will keep readers in its grasp long after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"This is a very well written book, but the subject matter is quite disturbing. There were a couple of times that I had to lay the book down, the story was that intense. Probably not for the real squeamish, but definitely a &quot;keeper&quot;."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"Police lieutenant L.A. Franco commands Homicide Squad #93 in the gang-ravaged heart of south-central Los Angeles. A workaholic, she allows nothing into her bruised private life but booze and exercise, football and music. But when one, then another brutally murdered girl turns up within Frank's jurisdiction, the pressures of running one of the country's busiest homicide units increases when Frank and her squad find themselves dealing with a serial rapist turned murderer. As investigative leads go nowhere, a trap is laid for the unknown assailant. The bait is Allison Kennedy, a playful young narcotics detective who seems to delight in irritating Frank. The two women face are compelled to forge an alliance in order to survive as their hunt for the killer brings Frank painfully close to her own demons and she must choose between freeing herself from the bonds of a turbulent past, or remain fatally shackled by them. Bleeding Out is a superb police thriller, and justly documents Baxter Clare as one of the best."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"A wonderful first mystery where the main character, Lt. &quot;Frank&quot; Franco, is on the trail of a brutal serial killer, and is also running on an emotional empty. Since the death of her lover, Frank has lived her life on long hours at work and endless alcohol, but this begins crumbling. The pacing of the story is superb, but what saves this simple mystery is the characterizations. It's reminiscent of Emma Donoghue's &quot;Hood&quot; where the main character must come to grips with the loss of a loved one to move toward hope. And this is Baxter Clare's first book! I hope the next is as compelling."},{"Title":"Bleeding Out: A Mystery","review":"I wouldn't have given it too many stars anyway.

Well, but I worn you, you must have a good sense of humor to enjoy it and not be easily shocked by pictures like the one on page 39, taken in the streets of New Orleans during Mardi Gras. (The book also contains some beautiful or intriguing photos by Walker Evans and David Graham and others...)For many years (about 30) since my arrival in the US I kept asking myself what is the best way to describe our sense of humor, that of people from Romania (because yes, Andrei Codrescu is from the city Sibiu in Transylvania, and he mentions it in the introduction to his book, and I also come from Dracula country) or other Eastern European countries. Now I have my answer for I found it well expressed on the front cover of the book, in the statement made by John Berendt, author of the \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\": irreverent and droll. In this book, says John Berendt, Andrei Codrescu is his usual self, informative, irreverent and droll. The same Andrei that travells in a red convertible limousine through the US in the movie he made some time ago, called \\"Road Scholar\\" (same sense of humor, same powerful way of perceiving things ...)So, if you saw that movie made by Andrei Codrescu, a feature-length documentary (mentioned in his book on page 177) about strange Americans and you liked it, you will also love this book. If you missed the movie, read the book, it looks at American people, places and \\"phenomena\\" with the same eyes. The \\"Rhode Scholar\\" becomes the \\"Road Scholar\\" (note the pun!) who travels throughout the US not taking the things, people and places he sees too seriously, as he does not take himself too seriously (a mistake that many people from the \\"Ivory Tower\\" do, for which \\"not laughing\\" = \\"seriousness\\".) For me, orginally from the same country as Andrei, the book and the movie seem so very familiar, for I would have most probably observed the same things, and looked at them with the same sense of perception and \\"strange\\" humor and LOL (to use a computer jargon term meaning \\"Lots of Laughter\\").If you want to have a good taste of the book before buying it I suggest spend a few minutes to read a very short story (\\"Christina of Pasadena,\\" two-pages long, pp.165-167) in a bookstore sipping from a cup of coffee... ). It will give you the flavor of the book. In this short story the author looks at Southern California as a God abandoned Heaven (one point of view, the East Coast one, but you can understand the subtleties pro and con this view in a book by David Rieff - Los Angeles, Simon and Schuster, 1991). Andrei is irreverent about the West as he is about the East Coast, and about Paris, France (a city I love, but I would also be the first not to disagree with Andrei that the Parisians let you humiliate yourself for an hour before you find out directions in the street from them, p. 234). However, what Californian can disagree with Andrei's statement that after ten in most places there is no soul to see in the streets, and driving around greater Los Angeles area, \\"SoCal malls look like badly glued postage stamps about to be blown away any minute by Santa Ana\\". (I never said it to myself this way, but now that he did, I am sure I felt it very much this way all along ...) I thought the way the author describes the French-accented girl he met in a small Greek restaurant as \\"suffering from happiness\\" (as many Californians do...LOL), and his amusing observation at discovering her predestinate first name was Christina (\\"God made Her sign\\") were hilarious. (All women will enjoy this!) Of course the author had to insert some verse too as to remind us that he is a professor of English at Louisiana University, and a poet, which sum the story up:\\"On a faux-Greek restaurant near Pasadena Alit the Christ of Happiness Christina.\\"This is not his only poetry in the book, for one of the chapters (\\"Boston\\") is a poem, and there too he ties his American experiences with thinking about Romania (the driver of a car in which Andrei hitchhiked to Longan Airport was working for an organization who \\"could and did\\" parachute former nationals back behind the Iron Curtain where they earned a hefty paycheck for blowing up bridges\\". But well, Andrei preferred to get back to his bed in California. At least then, for later he went to Romania and wrote his view on the events December '89 in a book called \\"The Whole in the Flag:An Exile's Story of Return and Revolution.\\"The author is indeed a gifted social critic, as he is presented on the back cover of the book. However, he does it in a better way than most, for rather than making a lengthy boring analysis he presents it all by sharp droll observations. In \\"Hail Babylon!,\\" as well as in his movie, \\"Road Scholar,\\" Andrei Codrescu gives us the perspective of the ex-foreigner, who ends up in becoming a keener chronicler of the American spirit than many born in this country. With his last short story, \\"New York\\" he clearly shows that foreigners know this country better than the natives. He finds himself in New York, on an assignment by Conde Nast Traveller which commissioned hordes of investigators to various cities on the planet to determine rudeness levels (p. 233). Andrei selects an odd-shaped, strange-looking landmark, the Flairton Building, completed in 1902 from plans drawn by Burham &amp; Company, which he believes captures all the humor and the pathos of the metropolis. He starts asking people in the streets if they know where this building is, by showing them a photograph of it. All the people he met but one knew well where it was, a woman from Kiev, and Algerian shop owner, a Chinese, a Frenchman, a Haitian... But he insisted to find a New Yorker, and when he did, well, this one did not have the faintest idea where the building was (pp. 231-240).I liked the book for many reasons apart from its sense of humor and for recognizing myself in it as an Eastern European observer of America. Because it is breathing knowledge, by mentioning names of people and phenomena I knew about (Milan Kundera, the Czech novelist living in France, Ionescu, who \\"wasn't French for nothing. And, of course, he was Romanian,\\" Brasaii, a famous photographer, said to be of Romanian origin too, Erza Pound, Walt Withman, Louis Mumford, the Dada movement, etc). Because I learned about others whom (shame on me) I had no idea about, like Walker Evans. (To find out more about this photographer's work of America of the Depression years, and Cuba, I browsed through a wonderful big-format book in the Midnight Bookstore on The 3rd Street promenade in Santa Monica and I will definitely go and see the collection at the J. Paul Getty museum just five minutes by car from my house). Because it shows the America I so differently imagined when I came here in 1973 in Los Angeles, when I could not find the skyscrapers I saw in the movies of my childhood, and that most people from that part of the world have such an unreal image wonderfully suggested by the author's mentioning the question that he recalls his uncle asked long ago: \\"How could there be a Depression in America when there are so many cars?\\" Because the author's observations about our urban landscapes (and I have an interest in urbanism from my background in architecture from then the only Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in Romania, \\"Ion Mincu\\") makes us think that it is time to reevaluate them. Because you will discover or find cities you know or read about in the light you think about them or a new one: \\"Boston is a kind of Rome. Only colder\\" (p. 225). \\"New Orleans is a creature of the river, much as Egypt (before the Aswan Dam) used to be a creature of the Nile\\" (p. 4). \\"New Orleans is in many ways the opposite of Jerusalem. It is most definitely not a holy city\\" (p. 5). \\"San Antonio in microcosm mirrors America\\" (p.95). \\"Oxford, Mississippi, the town of writers - I did not know that ... (of which the most famous was William Falkner) (p. 57). The fascinating city of Las Vegas where the card dealer the author meets is Polish. And, I was about to forget, because of the fact that at times I recognize the Romanian way of writing, which I miss in English books, permitting to start sentences with the \\"interdicted\\" \\"And\\" (or at least this is my laic perception!) Two sentences start with \\"And\\" (p. 233) and I find it so pleasant to read the continuation ... his way, my way, the familiar way...This is a book by the only person from Romania that my colleagues \\"in the Ivory Tower\\" have heard about"},{"Title":"Hail Babylon!: In Search of the American City at the End of the Millennium","review":"Andrei Codrescu's sharp observational wit is put to good use in this insightful book. Mr. Codrescu, as always, looks under the rocks most of us don't even see, and then he finds gem after gem. I am from San Antonio, covered in the book, and next time I go back, I'm definitely looking under some of the rocks Mr. Codrescu did.

John Rensenbrink, author of Against All Odds, is a close friend and colleague. I have worked with John on some of the campaigns mentioned in the book and I am mentioned in regard to the events in those campaigns. The American news media seem to be more interested in flash and pizzazz than any real analysis of political trends. A 10 second soundbite is much more common than in depth analysis, and a movement that grows slowly from many centers, rather than as a centralized movement that grows rapidly directed by Beltway politicos, may be completely off the radar screen, invisible to the American public who relies upon the mass media for information. Occasionally a journalist, writer, or dilettante will attempt to give us the scoop on a movement flying below the radar screen, but the odds of them presenting an accurate account, providing a complete explanation of the core values and the personalities of the movement, is exceedingly thin. The real scoop seems to only come when one of the leading activists of the movement commits themselves to paper. Therefore anyone interested in the Green Party in the United States, in the role of ecology in our society, in the development of political parties outside the Democratic and Republic parties, or politics in general should welcome the arrival of John Rensenbrink's second book on the Green Party \\"Against All Odds\\". John Rensenbrink has written a completely up to date book on where the Green Party is now, how it has gotten there over the last 15 years, and the core values that underlie everything the Greens do. Rensenbrink helped convene the first official Green Party meeting in the United States in 1984, and ever since he has been in the forefront of the movement, helping shape the philosophy and values as well as convening important meetings, chairing national committees, starting important organizations, running for the US Senate, and mentoring emerging leaders. A retired professor of political science, Rensenbrink is able to place what the Greens are doing in a context that goes back to Ancient Greece and is as current Kosovo. The Green Party is based on values, Ecological Wisdom, Non Violence, Social Justice, Democracy, and in the first half of \\"Against All Odds\\" Rensenbrink explores the values that have shaped Green thinking. Especially interesting is his discussion of ecology and the way it permeates Green work in all areas. What may be Rensenbrink's most important contribution to study of organizations based on non violence is his discussion of conflict within the Greens. Many people assume that conflict is abhorrent to an organization based on non violence, but Rensenbrink points out how important it is for groups to actually discuss their differences and create mechanisms for moving forward. With this as a context the factionalism in the Greens can be viewed as a healthy part of their evolution rather than a fatal flaw. The second part of the book gives a history of the Greens. Rensenbrink previously wrote \\"The Greens and the Politics of Transformation\\" in 1992 and includes of couple of chapters from that book to start the historical section. 1991 was a very important year in the development of the Green Party so the immediacy of having material written at that time is a nice touch. Rensenbrink then brings us up to date with some very detailed stories, allowing the reader to meet some of the characters that are important in Green Politics. His participation in all of the currents of recent Green history biases the account, but as most of the other books written about the Greens have come from members of other factions, it balances the history out, and as the faction that Rensenbrink participates in has become the dominate organizing force in the Greens, and the group leading the Green movement into participation in the larger American political scene, it gives a much clearer picture of where Green organizing is going. The writing in the first half of the book is in the deep philosophical strain, but Rensenbrink's ability as a story teller shines in the latter half. Especially comical are his descriptions of the way Left Green leaders have reacted to the development of the Green Party. The winners get to write the final version of the history, and Rensenbrink hilariously exacts his revenge for the abuse he has taken over the years. Green politics is still a minor strain in American politics, but as the recent victory of Audie Bock in a California legislative race shows, a growing one. Rensenbrink has brought an insiders perspective to this story and told a story that an outsider could not tell as well. If you are interested in third party development, ecological politics, or the Green Party, \\"Against All Odds\\" is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Against All Odds; The Green Transformation of American Politics","review":"This is one of the few books that actually goes beyond the ego of an author strutting his or her intellectual stuff, or plugging into archane debates with only a vague idea how those debates might somehow be useful. John provides fine intellectual tools and guidence, but also a basic factual history and a discussion of what it is like to be an activist, and what pitfalls/ opportunities there are to look for. His is the begginning of a discussion, hopefully a systematic one that builds througout the years, of how to be a grass roots activist. It is indeed not a job for amateurs - activism, done right, takes years to develop, and needs to be a healthy part of one's life to sustain that commitment. John starts that discussion - what are the common sorts of things that activists experience, stages they go through and ideas/views they have of themselves and the process along the way. Further, what choices have activists made that helped them, and what choices simply lead them down the road to dropping out. With this information, it becomes possible that more people might survive the reality of activism after the invigoration of idealism - something that provides the only hope for a truely grass roots movement and basis of power."},{"Title":"Against All Odds; The Green Transformation of American Politics","review":"This is a thoughtful book, full of ideas that challenge &quot;conventional thinking.&quot; It offers tremendous insight into what is quickly becoming the US's Third party.

Many of the Greens Mr. Rensenbrink considered problematic were actually more faithful memebers of a true alternative party than Mr. Rensenbrink has turned out to be. Mr. Rensenbrink turned out to be one of the architects of denying Ralph Nader the Green Party nomination in 2004, which resulted in an intentially weak Green Party candidate that would be no challenge to John Kerry. As a result the Green Party is weak and barely a blip on the radar. What a shame for those that had great hopes for the Green Party and what a disservice to Ralph Nader who wrote the forward to this book. If the Green Party does recover it will have to be in spite of \\"Democrat\\" greens like Mr. Rensenbrink."},{"Title":"Against All Odds; The Green Transformation of American Politics","review":"Thank you for the reference list of communists!"},{"Title":"Classics from Louis L'Amour Boxed Set","review":"This is a collection of four good paperback books from Louis L'Amour: Fling, Hondo, Utah Blaine, and The Californios.

It is a 2nd Ed. product, so the contemporary buyer should keep that in mind. In most cases, it provides rules applicable to 1st and 2nd Editions, so you will have to make converstions for use in 3rd Edition L5R RPG.There are some minor editing issues, but in most cases, common sense will fill in any blanks. The biggest drawback for this product is all of the rules elements require access to \\"The Way of the Samurai\\" and \\"The Way of the Shugenja\\". Without those 2 sourcebooks, all the rules portions except for a few creature stats are not going to be useful. The back cover neglects to mention those two essential references, though it does mention other required sources.There are no \\"secrets\\" per se. The book is an account of factions within the Shadowlands, approximately covering the period from after the Lying Darkness into the Four Winds period. It gives a general overview of The Lost, the Shadow Dragon and other remanents of the Lying Darkness, and bloodspeakers (both in the Shadowlands and a few hidden cells within the Empire). There is some passing mention of goblins and ogres, but trolls, hags and oni are notably absent.More than anything, this book serves as a reference for running a game with \\"corrupted\\" players, not as any sort of adventure setting for standard characters. (There are a handful of adventure hooks, with the majority being appropriate for corrupted characters, particularly if characters have become The Lost.)Of the 8 chapters, the first 6 all begin with the flavor text that we've come to expect, all connected in some way. Chapter 7 has flavor text, but is somewhat jarring in that it is a complete change of setting, characters and venue from the preceding 6. Chapter 8 was appearently given no thought in this direction, being devoid of any flavor text. (Which is ironic in that Chapter 8 was the one I deem most useful as is, not needing one of the aforementioned references.)Overally, this is a good reference point for a solid GM and a dangerous weapon for GMs that only think they're good. A novice GM will probably feel overwhelmed by this source as the only detailed info is the section on the Wall of Bone, so don't expect an out-of-the-box adventure such as \\"Tomb of Iuchiban\\". If an \\"evil\\" campaign is in your future, this book is a must-have. If you're going to run a campaign IN the Shadowlands, this will be useful, but not necessary. Any campaign within the Empire won't use this book at all unless you want to focus on bloodspeakers. Heed the call of Fu Leng accordingly..."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Shadowlands (Legend of the Five Rings Role Playing Game)","review":"This is a great book for Legend of the five rings rpg.

His stories have the power to rivet children to the spot. They know he is talking about them. Each story is a moral or Biblical lesson entire. For example, Johann is driven out of the house into the snow on Christmas Eve by \\"an angry and brutal stepfather.\\" Turned away from fine, large houses, where do you think he finds unquestioning and loving mercy? The cottage of a poor old woman. \\"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My chldren...\\""},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories 2","review":"If you are Christian, this set of books is a wonderful way of providing an excellent example of good, moral behavior. My 3 year old son listens to them most nights before bed. It is amazing what he takes away from them - not least of which is a deep abiding faith. One day, while playing baseball, he lost his ball. I was in the garden and had no idea where it went. He looked and looked and couldn't find it. I was amazed to see him then get on his knees and pray - \\"God, please help me find my baseball\\". Unbelievable as it may be, within seconds, he found his ball. One mightthink that is a small, silly thing BUT it is one of many things that has had a profound, positive impact on my son's belief in God. My only negative comment is that if the stories are read to the very young, such as my son, the reader needs to carefully select as some of the stories illustrate rather graphically, severe consequences. My final comment is that one of the previous reviewer's complained about the Christian doctrine in the book. True. It is Christian. I too get upset by the harsh tone of some of the doctrine - however - the book is intended for bedtime as is stated in the title. Since I don't know of too many public schools where children sleep, I am not overly concerned. I believe the positive values of honesty, self-reliance, obedience and earnestness far outweigh the occasional lapses into harsh Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories 2","review":"I'd rate these stories very high for storytelling, but also very high for their horror content. I know that the author meant well, but as a very young boy many of them were disturbingly scary and horrifying.For example, the \\"A mother's love\\" theme. In one story, a mountain climber is buried under untold tons of rock from a landslide. His mother steadfastly stands by for as long as it takes workers to uncover his body from the huge pile of rubble. And by the end of the story, the workers had hardly made a dent in that pile of rubble. The message was supposed to show the steadfast dedication of a mother. But for me, I had nightmares about being buried alive with no hope of timely rescue for many years afterwords.In another story on this theme, we read about a dirt-poor mother with a sick baby, a cat, and a lone oil lamp to provide light. She leaves her house to get medicine for her sick baby, but leaves the baby, cat, and oil lamp behind. (She'd be charged with child neglect today, but Uncle Arthur thought of her as devoted and loving.) The cat, of course, knocks over the lamp and starts the house ablaze. The mother returns to see her home a blazing inferno. Her love gives her the strength to push the firemen aside and rush into the house. Her body was found wrapped lovingly around her baby, but both had burned to death in the blaze.There are others that try to illustrate love, dedication, and devotion but for me they only caused horrific and recurring nightmares for years afterword. I dimly recall many other stories that were indeed uplifting and educational. But beware. Tales of burning to death in a blazing fire, being crushed to death under tons of jagged boulders, and other horrific scenarios might very well illuminate the moral for an adult. However, impressionable young children with active imaginations might find them illuminating their deepest and most horrifying fears instead."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories 2","review":"Tired of wasting that important bedtime story time reading stories devoid of moral values, life lessons, or reality? The you need these books. They are a refreshing breath of fresh air in an area where the mass media teaches parents to be freinds instead of parents. Backbone values like telling the truth, kindness, hard work, obedience to parents, turning the other cheek, timeliness, respect for authority, faith in God, and kindness to animals, humility, responsibility and honor are taught through real life stories. My kids still beg to be read these stories. I didn't think they had that much effect until I overheard them planning to do a \\"secret package company\\" (do a good deed for somebody in need anonymously) and to react to a nasty kid at school by \\"heaping coals of fire onto him\\". (being sincerely nice to him anyway) Boy was I proud...Two caveats: These were written in the thirties. The politically \\"correct\\" may not like some of the generalizations that were the norm in the day these were written. (Didn't bother me - I explained this to the kids) Second, these are real stories, not \\"superheros\\" or purple dinosaurs. The stories are of everday life. They reflect reality. Some modern parents try to protect thier kids from learning about reality. (People lose jobs, some are hungry, pets and people die, some people are uncaring, that sort of thing) Again, I think it's important for kids to learn about reality.More parents should read Uncle Arthur books to thier kids."},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories 2","review":"I read the comments here with fascination. The Bedtime Stories never gave me nightmares, but it is true that some of the harsher aspects of life were dealt with -- abusive parents, death and dying, danger, war, poverty, loss. They were written in the days before \\"political correctness\\" was a watchword, and parenting was harsher even in good families. The stories are basically Victorian in tone -- emotional, intense, and disciplined. Uncle Arthur was a peer of my grandparents' generation and the way he speaks and the stories he tells and the conclusions he draws show him to be a man of his time, as well as a man of his particular belief system. Place him in context, and the way he tells his stories is appropriate.As a child, I liked his stories because they were about real people in real life crises, just like the real life happening around me. Through it all, there was the belief that the characters were not alone in their trials. His characters were interesting little people who weren't a bit perfect, but who still learned and grew and became better people. He taught that life wasn't easy but that prayer could get you through.Some Bedtimes Stories have stuck with me to the point that I recall their titles:Unlucky Jim -- A poor boy has a chance to choose a Christmas gift for himself, and is laughed at when he chooses a doll for his sick sister instead of the train that he wants.Teresina -- Two girls give up their beloved doll to a girl they dislike after she save their baby brother from being run over by a car.Through Fire and Water -- A brother and sister, left home alone, quarrel over a train set until they accidentally set the house on fire. The boy rethinks his relationship with his sister after she courageously fights the flames.Brave Bella -- Bella didn't want to babysit, but performs an act of heroism when her baby brother's carriage is ripped out of her hands on a windy jetty.As you can see by the descriptions, one has to look at these stories in the time frame in which they were written. Children were sometimes home alone, or out on their own, faced with decisions that an adult should have taken care of, but their belief in God helped them find their way to the better choice. That was always the underlying message in Maxwell's writings -- that through prayer, one can find the way.Debra Anne Wintsmith, Author of Precious Jewels, A Seventh-Day Adventist Family Saga"},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories 2","review":"Like it was all roses and blossoms??

In one story, a mother has her little girl hide behind the sofa during a visit from the pastor's wife and daughter because the mother is ashamed of the girl for getting dirty while playing. She uses shame and comparison to tell her she should be more like the nice little girl who visited.In another story, Christmas is totally ruined because a domineering mother with a martyr-complex follows the poor judgment of her husband and goes out in icy weather to deliver a couple packages her \\"naughty, bad boy\\" forgot to deliver. Of course she returns with a broken arm and the son carries the guilt the rest of his life.In a third story, a woman calls a little girl an ungrateful wretch and swears to never give a child a gift again because Gertie forgets to thank her for the candy she bought. The woman happens to die shortly after and Uncle Arthur makes the point that no-one should be like \\"Ungrateful Gertie\\" who is guilty of making this woman's last thoughts terrible.This man is twisted and we cannot believe these books have been so widely used.

Now, at the ripe old age of twenty-nine, I sometimes flip through the whenever I'm back in the waiting room and I find that my opinion has changed drastically. The stories are quite cute and many of the values are universal, but as a non-Christian I feel uncomfortable reading some of them. I'm particularly concerned by Maxwell's apparent belief (implied in a story about a broken radio) that one cannot be a good person if one is not a practising Christian. Also in the same story he tells his young audience that Jesus would \\"have to get rid\\" of those who had not opened their hearts to him. I take this to mean that those who are not Christians are doomed to hell. I realize that this is religious doctrine and that the stories were written with a certain audience in mind, but all the same I would not feel comfortable knowing that this book was being used in my child's school (particularly in a city as diverse as Toronto.)

Boys were stereotyped as sexist, demeaning, and hostile. I found a copy of this book: more of the same.While Ms. Barber should be free to publish whatever she wishes to, parents should also be free to keep their eight-year old's from the cross-fire of the feminist gender wars. Ms. Barber puts them right in the middle, slicing through the ego's of young boys with the hostility and malice she attributes to them in her writing.Boys are more than seven times likely to commit suicide than girls. They're less likely to graduate high school, college, or graduate school. They're much more likely to end up drug addicts or prisoners. Ms. Barber's sexist writings -- falsely portrayed as an affirmative message -- might not be the sole cause of the problem, but they sure don't help.This book, and Ms. Barber's other writing, is inappropriate for children. Especially boys."},{"Title":"Modern Language Bible-OE","review":"The Modern Language Bible aka the New Berkeley Version is based on Hebrew and Greek texts and was translated by Gerrit Verkuyl. This translation so well balanced, it can be used for study, devotions, and public reading. It does not use archaic language, but it also avoids colloquialisms. For example, in the NIV, Matthew 27:24 is rendered: When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \\"I am innocent of this man's blood,\\" he said. \\"It is your responsibility.\\" The Modern Language Bible rendered the passage: When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing but instead a riot was brewing, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \\"I am innocent of the blood of this man; you yourselves see to it.\\"One of the unique features of this Bible are the footnotes at the bottom of each page, which provide historical, theological, and devotional information. For example, the two footnotes for Isaiah 7:14 state: n) The Hebrew term \\"almah\\" is also applied to Miriam at about 14 {Ex. 2:8}; and to Rebekah, whose virginity is affirmed {Gen. 24:16}. The Greek translation made before Christ, has parthenos, usually rendered \\"virgin.\\" o) God with us. An unusual child indeed {cf.

This strategy should ease the transition for the typical VB6.0 developer to VB.NET Web services, and also facilitate better understanding of SOAP over HTTP.This guy's writing style is pretty unique among Computer Manuals in general. He has really researched his stuff, and the book is peppered with several references to tools, articles, and online resources of which many can be put to very good use.The one and only gripe I have is that there are no simple example applications in this reference. The author acknowledges this in the book, but explains that no B2B or B2C application is simple either, (primarily what XML Web Services are for).I can see that this approach will appeal to some and not to others, but on the whole I have to admit that his web-service examples are more complete and real-worldy than the typical \\"weather samples\\" and \\"add two numbers\\" implementations which are promoted in many circles as \\"Web Service examples\\". The author is a regular columnist for many of the Fawcette group publications such as Visual Studio magazine and I'd advice any purchaser of this book to keep in touch with Roger's writing on XML Web Services in these magazines as there are regular updates on some of the information presented in this book, which Roger continues to write about."},{"Title":"WONDERFUL WAYS TO BE A FAMILY","review":"Judy Ford returns again to deliver more sound advice for being a a wonderful family.

I wanted natural remedies and direction in healthy healing and prevention.

There are remedies and vitamin/herb supplement plans for each ailment in the book, and there are probabably 100 or more, just like the cover says, on just about anything you could want, e.g., IBS, sinuses, allergies, arthritis, yeast infections, migranes, digestive troubles, and so much more I can't even think of them all.

Poetry and murder become intertwined as the poet Nigel Strangeways investigates a rural murder that involves the family of Robert Seaton, one of the most distinguished poets in England.For those new to the Strangeways stories, Nicholas Blake was a pseudonym for Cecil Day-Lewis, a respected English poet himself. In fact, Day-Lewis served as poet laureate from 1968 until his death in 1972.As is typical in a Strangeways mystery, this murder has its roots in the past. Critical past events and hidden relationships are gradually revealed, shifting the spotlight from one suspect to another. In the concluding chapters alternative solutions are considered in rapid sequence, each successive solution fitting the evidence more closely.Head of a Traveler is an entertaining mystery that would make a good introduction to the Nigel Strangeways series."},{"Title":"Margrit's World War II","review":"Christa Hermann was a witness to the Germany of World War II. But unlike most novels, histories, poems or visual examinations of the rise and fall of Hitler's Germany, Hermann writes her memoirs as seen through the innocent unbiased eyes of a child, discovering the facts of life in a world of delicate balance with a focus on those things which matter most to a six-year-old: family, maternal protection, the phenomenon of death of a peer, the terror of wartime whether internal or external. The result is a fresh insight into a tragedy as perceived through nascent eyes.1943, Hamburg, Germany. Margrit, her 3 siblings, mother, father and grandmother live in the shadow of frequent bombings and firestorms. Hamburg is being decimated and Margrit's father sends his wife and children off to Bavaria where they might find protection in foster care. Margrit and her brother Werner, though frightened, find ways to avoid the terror of the world at large in games, making daisy chains, etc. Margrit is accepted into a farm home with Frau Hedwig where she finds the quiet joys of calf-birthing, new friends, the disbelief of funerals, the bonding with friends only to have one of them fall victim to the war machine. For two years Margrit absorbs her new life and new discoveries in Bavaria until the Americans defeat Hitler and occupy Germany and Margrit gathers her experience learned about life and death and priorities and is recognized as the village Angel.This short book is a tender memoir of innocence disturbed: 'Margrit' is in fact Christa Hermann and she writes this touching simple story as a means of closure of memories of the war. Her writing style is as uncomplicated as the tabula rasa mind of a 6-year-old and that is why it succeeds. Perhaps the book is not meant to be an anti-war document, but in its sincerity and non-judgmental way, it is as powerful as any of the angry novels related to the great tragedy of War. Margrit's view from within a country at odds with the world most likely is like that of the children of Vietnam, of Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Bosnia etc. The wisdom of children is shatteringly strong. Grady Harp, January 06"},{"Title":"Margrit's World War II","review":"While \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" has had the most publicity, many stories about children caught up in the events of the Second World War have been published. However, this is the first I have seen written from the perspective of a German child. The author was born in 1938 and at the age of five was sent to a remote area of Bavaria, where the Allied planes did not bomb. Groups of children were loaded on trains and sent to the area, where they were taken in by and cared for by the local people. For the most part, the parents stayed behind to continue their work critical to the German war effort. Christa's parents stayed behind, so for the remainder of the war, three spinsters who owned a small farm cared for her. This book is an autobiography of those times.Compared to so many other German children, Margrit (who is really Christa) actually had a pretty good time during the last years of the war. Only one bomb was dropped in her area and the invading American soldiers acted with extreme restraint. Unlike the areas overrun by the Russian forces, there was little looting, raping and burning. Her primary trauma was from being sent away from her parents and not seeing them for so long. Those feelings of loss come through in the writing, although I was not as sympathetic as I could have been. Considering that her relocation spared her the threat of death from bombing and allowed her to avoid the other traumas of the war, she was very lucky. In my opinion, some more of that realization would have made the book a better one.Despite this criticism, it was refreshing to read this book about a German child. It was a good reminder that whatever evil deeds the leader of a country may execute, there will always be children inside that country who will pay a price. Whether they are the result of the actions of the leader or outside forces responding, the children will suffer."},{"Title":"Algebra Made Simple: An Easy-to-Use Teaching Resource (High School)","review":"I like the problems given in the book, but you cannot use this book to purely teach a student algebra.

THE WOUNDED LAND dealt primarily with the visceral shock Covenant experiences upon returning to said land and the physical reactions of Linden Avery. We met some new characters and marveled at the changes in the land. And that was enough.In THE ONE TREE, the relationship between Covenant & Avery grows ever more complex at every turn. They push & pull at each other, struggling with urgent need and vastly divergent understandings of where their quest should take them. We also get to revisit the wonderful giants, briefly reintroduced at the end of THE WOUNDED LAND. In the previous trilogy, we had come to know and love Saltheart Foamfollower, probably the single greatest character ever created for a \\"quest\\" fantasy story. While the giants in THE ONE TREE are wonderfully rich and alive, they don't quite reach Foamfollower's status in our hearts. BUT, we get to understand their race more clearly and experience their unbelievable strength and character.I don't want to rehash the plot...it's been done well enough previously. Some reviewers have complained that the book is too episodic, or that some of the events that take place are just there to fill out the book to proper length. To my mind, the hardships the characters endure serve to illustrate their strength of character and the parts of their psyches that are conflicted or downright torn. I love that. Also, some mention that Covenant isn't the focus of the book as much as Linden Avery...that's okay with me. Covenant, in many ways, is less interesting than most of the other characters. He has my sympathy and support, but he's not the REASON I love these books.Donaldson makes some remarkable leaps of imagination, and the Bloodguard are very richly portrayed. As readers of past Covenant books know, Donaldson is often very ambiguous about good vs. evil. Yes, Lord Foul is the bad guy, no question about that. But it's the bad impulses in otherwise \\"heroic\\" characters that make the books so complex. If you like that element of these books, then you'll love THE ONE TREE. It's full of conflict within the \\"good\\" guys.Many middle books in trilogies have the problem of dangling a little at both ends. They're picking up from a thread of the first book and leaving one behind for the final book. THE ONE TREE has some of that, but the intensity of the final scenes and the resolution of some of the characters is richly satisfying, so rather than feeling let down at the end, you just want to immediately grab the next book. And thank goodness you can...unlike Donaldson's current Covenant books, which are planned to have three year gaps in between.So, if you've like the Covenant books up until now, you'll love THE ONE TREE. It's more action-packed than THE WOUNDED LAND and more rewarding. If you haven't enjoyed the books (but for some strange reason have read up to this point), your mind won't be changed. And obviously, if you haven't read them but would like to, you MUST go back to the beginning. Do not hope to start reading at this point and just \\"pick it up as you go along.\\" You'll completely miss 95% of what's going on."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"The One Tree does not fail to dissapoint if you are a fan of Thomas Covenant.

In the first Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Staff of Law was destroyed, and Covenant plans to make another one from the wood of the one tree.Many things happen in this book. Though, it is the slowest book in the series. But, the action scenes to make up for the lulls. Covenant must endure with the sake of the Land at stake. With his friends, (old and new) he must go on a trek that seems almost impossible.Donaldson fails to dissapoint with this book. It is filled with some of his best work and moves the story ahead to finish in the wonderful 3rd book of the series. The One Tree is a book full of plot twists, intrigue, action, and adventure. Be sure to check it out."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"In The Wounded Land Covenant confronted the Clave, strange governing body of The Land that has replaced the council of Lords, and learned the truth about Lord Foul's role in the desecration of The Land. Covenant decides the best course of action is to leave The Land to search for the Isle of the One Tree. Centuries before, Berek Halfhand had forged the Staff of Law from a branch of the One Tree. Covenant feels the only hope of redemption for The Land is to forge a new staff and restore the laws of nature that were broken when the original staff was destroyed. Accompanied by Linden Avery and a ship full of giants they depart The Land. Since no one knows where the One Tree is located, the giants suggest that the company seek the help of the Elohim. The Elohim are a fairy people that appear to be earthpower incarnate. But the Elohim have their own plans for Covenant and the white gold.A great deal of this book explores the character of Linden Avery. She has terrible secrets in her past that she must explore and confront to overcome her feelings of helplessness. Her confrontation with the leader of the Clave in The Wounded Land left her doubting herself and feeling that she is inherently evil. She must work through her feelings and find a way to help Covenant on his quest to redeem The Land. The giants are all terrific characters, which add to the enjoyment of this book. There is a great deal of action in this book, which flows exceptionally well and never drags."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"This one ranks right up there with The Illearth War, the second book of the first trilogy. Thomas Covenant and his companions sail deep into the Sunbirth Sea on a quest for the One Tree, from which Covenant hopes to fashion a new Staff of Law. Much of the novel (perhaps half) takes place aboard the huge Giantship Starfare's Gem. During this time the major characters have nothing to do but walk around on the boat or help with chores, so the pace of the book is clearly slower than that of the others in the series. Aside from a couple moments of excitement, Donaldson spends the bulk of the ocean sequences in developing the characters. We learn a lot more about Linden and she begins to understand her capabilities. Some of the Giants acquire distinct personalities as we spend days with them at sea. Vain is more perplexing than ever before, especially as we see how he interacts with Findail (a new character in the series). It becomes evident that these two will play some major role in the sequel &quot;White Gold Wielder&quot;.The story heats up in the second half, when Starfare's Gem is forced to make landfall at a fascinating but sinister port town called Bhrathairain. Here a plot unfolds to get Covenant to give up his white gold ring. We also encounter a deadly Sandgorgon, which I'm hoping will make a re-appearance in the sequel. This part of the story was my favorite. Also, the climactic events that occur at the objective of the party's quest are exciting and revealing. We learn why Lord Foul tainted Covenant with venom and get hints of the awesome might of the creature that formed the Earth.The One Tree also has the most deaths of major characters so far in the series. So there are several tragic moments in the novel, which in my opinion gives it an element of realism and poignancy that the other novels lacked. This combined with the very good character development during the ocean sequences and the moving backstory related by the Elohim make The One Tree the deepest of the novels in the series up to this point."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Great series. The book was in good condition and it will be a good addition to my Stephen Donaldson collection."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"'The One Tree' is the second book in 'The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever'. It is a direct continuation of 'The Wounded Land' which should be read first.When we last left Covenant he had decided that the only way to fight the Lor Foul's Sunbane was to create a new Staff of Law to replace the one Covenant had destroyed in the first trilogy. So he enlisted the help of the giants and their ship to search for the One Tree in oder to create a new Staff.Like the middle book of the first trilogy which focused on Hile Troy for much of it, 'The One Tree' focuses on Linden Avery's point of view for most of the story. The story drags a little when the quest is on board the ship, but the scenes on land are better. Especially good were the scenes with the wizard Kasreyn and the Sandgorgon. Besides the slow sections this installment definitely has a couple of weak points. First of all the character of Findail is annoying. He keeps warning Covenant not to do something, but won't say why, so naturally Covenant does it anyway and disaster ensues, then Findail complains that no one listens to him. It's pointless. Secondly the whole plight of the Land seems a lot less terrible when it becomes clear that the Land is only one part of a much bigger world. Part of the attraction to 'The One Tree' is the introduction of places outside the Land but at the same time it dilutes the urgency of the fight against Lord Foul. Finally the fact that the whole quest ends in failure, with very little to show for it leaves the reader with kind of a 'what was the point' vibe.To sum 'The One Tree' is somewhat uneven, and not as good as 'The Wounded Land', but still enjoyable as it introduces new vistas and provides interesting background for the series as a whole."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"This book, though still an exciting and deep tale, is slow and not as eventful as the previous books. Also, it was in the POV of Linden Avery who is not a \\"love to hate\\" person like Covenant. She is rather...whiny.The One Tree is about Covenant, Linden, a group of Haruchai, and a group of Giants who take a voyage across unknown sections of the world to find the One Tree and craft a new Staff of Law. However, Lord Foul sends his Ravers in order ensure the mission's failure and the world's destruction. From the faery home of Elemesnedene to the Sandhold of Braithairealm to the Island of the One Tree, the company meets dangers and enemies that want nothing more than power. The ambiguous Elohim, Kasreyn of the Gyre, and the mysterious ur-vile Vain all contribute to the frustrations and griefs of Covenant and Linden.Although possibly the weakest book of the series, it is still a knockout and a must-read. Fantasy addicts will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"And I am still waiting for the third volume of this trilogy! Why does Amazon do this to us? It is very frustrating to readers."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"The explores further the link between Covenant and the land.

Not your normal fantasy as it's quite dark and doesn't follow the standard formula that most fantasy books do nowadays."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Anyone who has enjoyed the works of S. Donaldson will be sure to enjoy this addition to the Covenant Chronicles. I can not recomend this series highly enough."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Of all of Donaldson's books (I've Read them all) this one is my favorite. This second book in the second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever is possibly the most imaginative of them. It introduces my personal favorite character of the series--Nom, a Sandgorgon. Often, I go back to certain chapters of the book just to relive my favorite parts. A must for anyone who appreciates true imagination and masterful descriptions."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"All the other books of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant rate from good to excellent, except this one! It is wandering disjointed morass of bizarre places and people. The story switches from the main character to the viewpoints of other characters throughout this whole book. Thomas Covenant is rarely heard from in this book. He is just some body everyone else drags around. The whole book is pointless! Nothing of real consequence happens until the next book WHITE GOLD WIELDER.If you want to read the whole second trilogy, do yourself a favor and make sure you get this one used or from a library. You won't want to keep it."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"The first time I read this book, it was a trial to get through. Of course, I was 16 at the time. I recently re-read it and enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. The main problem I would cite is that it seems too episodic, as if the many things that happen to the giantship are unrelated and just serve to fill the book up as much as possible. Linden is the focus of this story, as she is most of the second Trilogy, so don't wait for Covenant to get into the action. He spends a good portion of the book out of it."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"What would be a delicate and diplomatic way to say this... I did not care for this series even half as much as the first chronicles, this mostly appeared to be filler and the actual plot is only a third of any one of the three books.Our &quot;anti-hero&quot; Thomas has pretty much resigned himself to plod thru this with a very been there done that have the t-shirt attitude, and our heroine is simply in denial up to the end of the third book. Avoid this series and stick to the first Chronicles which I give 5 stars"},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Book 2 in the 2nd Thomas Convenant Series tells the tale of the search for the one tree so that the party can make a new staff of law.Sounds simple. The starting location is Seareach. They have a big boat. And they know who has the knowledge where to find the One Tree. Shouldn't be that difficult. I can understand devoting a chapter to this task. Maybe two chapters. But 500 pages! Is Donaldson out of his mind! I realize that the One Tree is very important. But to devote an entire book to finding it is ridiculous.So how does Donaldson fill up the pages? By going into constant digression mode. Digression about Convenant's paradox of power of how he can't control it. Avery has issues with her parents. Keeps asking herself is she is evil. Is she evil? Does the reader really care, if Convenant can't control his power? And I doubt the reader really cares if she is evil.Overall, the pace of events is beyond slow. It's painful. When the characters aren't digressing, Foul is launching more attacks again using a array of creatures. The reader is never stimulated, bc the book is 500 pages long! Chances are that the main characters aren't going to be eliminated in page 50 so why bother these pointless attacks!So this book is a complete waste. Regardless of whether the quest for the staff of law is successful, the party still has to return to the land; meaning this book is pretty much pointless.Overall I'm shocked that this book is still in print. No way does it deserve anything more than 1 star.Take my advice. Skip this book. Go straight to book 3 or don't bother to read the series. The 3rd book contains a 3 page synopsis that will give all the info you need to know.As for book 3, don't expect things to get much better. It's beyond lousy. This whole series just plain sucks."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"I accidently threw it out so I needed a replacement.

I have not read Lord of the Rings but I would be shocked to find it better than these."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"THe One Tree is spectacular. So much of the nature of the series, both one and two, are revealed through the poetic form of Donaldson's delightful prose. This book has been said to drag on by some readers, but this is innacurate, because Donaldson doesn't waste words. Everything is necessary to meet an ultimate climax. The new giants are wonderful and giants in general bring so much hope for humanity whereas Covenant can bring cynicism and Lord Foul despair. Vain is a mystery and symbolic on a level: there is no one cure that will dispell all hurt and despair. But, Covenant is the white gold... This book is beautiful."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Even whiny Linden could not slow this book down. Although not much gets accomplished to further the story line, the book does flow with non-stop action. The questers are besieged with one peril after another. Typical of other books of the series the good guys manage to scrape by, but only after death and loss, and they end up worse off than they began. The entire series is somewhat depressing as every small triumph is offset by a larger failure. At least Covenant is struck by a form of paralysis early in the story and so we don't have to hear him moan. Unfortunately, Linden is still around to fret, cry, whine, and hesitate in Covenants stead. Even with all of this there is plenty of action and surprises to keep the reader turning pages.My two biggest complaints with this book are complaints I've had with other books in the series. My first complaint is Donaldson's use of incomprehensible words. I initially kept a dictionary close by to look up some of the very unusual words that Donaldson fills the story with. However, after a while I realized that many times he uses the words out of context, or in ways that do not make sense even when you know the words meaning. Donaldson is definitely lexiphanic in his writing (using ostentatiously recondite words). Ha! Two can play at this game........try to find that one in your dictionary Donaldson.My second complaint concerns the Ravers in the story. In this book, once again we have an immortal creature that can travel the world instantaneously at will. A creature that can take any form, possess almost any creature (giants and the Haruchai are a little harder than others). A creature that cannot be killed or harmed (they just move into a new form). Donaldson has created these 3 Ravers with unlimited power, but never uses them in any way that makes sense. I've seen this same problem in other fantasy series where the author unwittingly creates a creature, form of magic, or power that if actually ever properly used would prematurely end the series. The end result is that the Raver's power and attacks are limited in the story in ways that confuse and never make sense.Even with my complaints, I'd have to say that this book has been one of the best of the series so far."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery move into The Land with the hope of salvation on a quest for a new Staff of Law. Of course, this a slow arduous process, and the one who has excited by the other books will find this a little slower going. It is excellent, nevertheless, and one needs the persistence and consistency to wade through these troubled waters. It's really interesting that this book made it to the New York Times Bestseller List, and it became an instant hit. And those who went before it become vogue already knew this to be a wonderful series. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"It was amazing! Even though we were transported to a strange and unfamiliar world, which I found a bit unsettling. I loved the Harucahi (as always, they're my favourite characters ( : ) I almost cried when **** died, and I was at work at the time! Linden Avery continues to annoy me however, she seems too petty and selfish to be anyone who has the ability to save the world. I can't _wait_ till I get my hands on the next book. If you're considering reading or starting the series, do it! Perservere and you will be rewarded : ) Donaldson does use some words that are a bit complicated (I'm 15) but if you have a dictionary handy, they do add to the story. This book (like the entire series) is cool, and definately worth reading."},{"Title":"The one Tree","review":"In most trilogy's when you read the second book, all you can think about is getting to the third and final book to find out what is going on.

From the riots at Stonewall Inn, to strolling down Christopher Street, it's like you're there.

I can't wait to go to New York and actually visit the places he speaks about! This is a must for anyone who is interested in GLBT history and culture."},{"Title":"Fragments of Isabella: A Memoir of Auschwitz","review":"This book is slimmer than the volume which came out in 1994, combining and somewhat updating this and the sequel 'Saving the Fragments,' but in a way it has more of an emotional impact, even considering a lot of the powerful vignettes of Isabella and her by then two remaining sisters after the liberation are completely left out. Because it's so short, it has more room to leave a deeper emotional impact; it didn't really dawn on me until rather recently that this, the most powerful book I've ever read, offers up relatively little details about daily life in the camps or seemingly important events and rituals the then-four remaining sisters would have gone through, like mealtime, beatings, the superiors in their barracks, the type of \\"work\\" they were forced to do, and their boarding of and ride in the icy halftrack from Auschwitz to Birnbaumel in November 1944. We get some events that took place in both camps, but not, as in other Shoah memoirs, long detailed passages and chapters accounting for every day, week, or even month spent there. What has made this book so powerful to me over the years aren't the details but rather the truly touching and genuine bond between Isabella and her sisters, how they stayed alive and together for one another, because of one another, even when it would have been easier, particularly for the youngest remaining sister Regina (called \\"Rachel\\" in this book because she wouldn't let Isabella use her real name in print at the time), to go the way of the smoke. We don't even know the ages of the four sisters, which makes it harder to picture the full dynamics of this relationship (the oldest sister, the one who was caught during their eventual escape and never reunited with them, dying shortly after Bergen-Belsen was liberated, was actually almost 30 years old, I've since discovered). These are fragments in the truest sense of the word, which Isabella wrote on scraps of paper, in her native Hungarian, shortly after she'd arrived in the States in May of 1945, whenever the images and memories forced themselves to the forefront of her mind and she needed to get them out of her system, however temporarily. Although in the updated volume, this account is told in the present tense, which makes it seem even more gripping than when told in the past tense in this original book.There are also some passages in this original volume that were left out in the updated one, like how Isabella's mother, whose death she never stops mourning or thinking about, had taught her the very important lesson of listening to her heart and the small inner voice within her dictating what was right, as well as describing how her only brother, Philip, temporarily hid as his family, friends, and neighbors were being herded to the cattlecars, but reappeared a moment later, unwilling to desert his family and not share in their fate too. (Interestingly, I happened upon the ID cards the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's webpage has for Isabella, her mother, her baby sister, and her oldest sister, and discovered that Philip may have been the only surviving brother in a family of five sisters, but wasn't the only brother they ever had; after Potyo [whose real name was Helen] was born, there were apparently born twin boys who died at 8 months of age.) There's also an interesting switch in the passage talking about how Isabella would put down her shovel and stop digging whenever the Nazi guards looked away in Birnbaumel, since her mother had told her not to aide her enemy; in this book it says \\"I honored her and kept myself alive\\" as opposed to, in the updated version, \\"I honored her and tried to keep myself alive.\\" Reading the original unchanged passages makes it more emotional. And though even years later this book haunts me so much that I feel as though I had lost my own sister, nothing compares to the experience of reading it the very first time and receiving the stunning blow that Cipi, the oldest of the four sisters left, was caught and did not survive, having assumed she was with them in America and had survived too, even that maybe they'd found her even decades later. One feels the same way Isabella does, that had she known she would have tugged at her sleeve or run holding her sister's hand or arm. This volume also contains the very powerful closing line that is completely left out of the updated volume, \\"Mama, I make this vow to you--I will teach my sons to love life, respect man, and hate only one thing--war.\\""},{"Title":"Fragments of Isabella: A Memoir of Auschwitz","review":"Although the length of this book is not great, the meaning behind each word is. Isabella Leitner, a Holocaust survivor, wrote this on her experiences in her life as a Jewish woman in Europe during WWII. Leitner was transported to a concentration camp. She writes many of her obstacles as if she were writing a journal. I liked this book, but is not the best I have ever read. What made me give it four stars was that it is true. The person who experienced this wrote it down. It makes me admire Leitner because she went back to this time and wrote about it on paper. I did not give it five stars because I felt I needed a deeper understanding of what I was reading. I would suggest that someone be about sixteen before they read it, unless they were very mature. I would not recommend this book to someone who likes things to be concise. This is best for a patient reader who searches for a deeper meaning. All together, Fragments of Isabella is a great book for the dedicated reader."},{"Title":"The War for Eternity","review":"This was definitely a book of action and excitement.

I would recommend this to any beginning student of the OT."},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"A Theological Introduction to the Old Testament by Bruce Birch, Walter Brueggermann, Terence Fretheim, and David Peterson, 2nd EditionI am alway impressed when I see '2nd Edition' on a book. It means enough people took the time and money to read it and comment on it that the authors took the time and energy (not to mention the publishers money) to publish an updated version of the book. And this book deserves all the congratulations it gets. Of the five texts I had in 'systematic' courses at seminary, this was certainly the best. It is made even better by the fact that it was virtually impossible to discern the seams where Brueggemann's Lutheran material ends and Birch's Methodist treatment begins.This book was the best, primarily because it did not nicely stay within the strictly theological lines. In a class where the other two books were a bit light, the broad range of BBF&P; was a real virtue.This book is an example of something I have found odd throughout my readin of the Old Testament. All the best books seem to be written by Christians. Even the best commentaries on OT books are written by Christians, and more by Protestants than by Catholics (althought that tide may be changing). And when I compare theological writings by a Jew on Genesis (Creation and the Persistence of Evil by Jon Levenson) I get a completely different picture of Jewish theology. This is not because Christian theology is infused with a light shining backwards from the New Testament. Most modern scholarship, even by those who consider themselves evengelicals, take the text as presented, not as a mirror to the future.One wonders why we don't use Kugel or Levenson or Fishbine or Kaufmann as our texts. What do the folks at Yeshiva use as an introduction to OT theology? But getting back to this book.I appreciate the fact that the book follows the order of the books in the Protestant translations of the OT, as that was also the way we studied them, and that is the way with which we are most familiar. And, that order has theological significance, which is why the Jewish Bible is arranged in a different way.The primary virtue for our class was that BBF&P; combined history with theology. This is only appropriate, since Jewish theology is bound up in being 'in history'. Every chapter gave some reflection on the historical perspectives, the social perspectives, and the theological issues.The only major divergence from the Protestant Bible order was to address the wisdom literature (Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiates, Psalms, Song of Songs)last, since they do not fit neatly between the Deuteronomic History and the Prophets.This is a great textbook. I am hard pressed to recommend it to a reader who is really interested in OT theology. To them, I suggest they swap this book for Bright's A History of Israel and Bruggermann's OT theology works, or maybe similar works by Von Rad. You may also try various books by Jon Levenson, especially 'Zion and Sinai'. (I have not read this book, but it is inexpensive and well reviewed)."},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"This book, written by four of the top Hebrew Scripture Scholars, is a fine overview of the themes and theology of the Old Testament. But there are some uneven parts of the book. The style was not even, which is perhaps what you get when you have four different authors. Also there were inconsistencies in content. One example is in the section on the later prohets when the conclusions starts off by saying there are three major parts to their thought and gives only two. This being a theological introduction there was also little reference to liberationist or feminist theology, which would have rounded out the picture the authors offered. In conclusion, while there are some good parts there are some problem areas which need to be refined. Perhaps a second edition would be helpful?"},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"arrived a little later than i had hoped, but in good, clean condition - thank yoU!"},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"What an awful book! The authors trade in the richness and fullness of the Old Testament for not only the dullest of boring textbooks, but they weave into being a God that doesn't believe in sin. Humans make mistakes because they are maturing which is okay, because God makes them too! The Christology foreshawdowed throughout the Old Testament is \\"creative remembering\\" on the part of Christians - NOT REALLY THERE AT ALL - according to these scholors. All of this leads to salvation being an act of social justice rather than Christ's atonement for sin. They should have titled this book: \\"Watch us as we try to castrate God!\\" Geepers guys.

The authors work to discuss the OT from many viewpoints using a number of different types of criticism. I love the way that the book does not shy away from difficult issues in the Old Testament, such as violence and sacrifice, but rather helps the reader to understand the context of the Biblical passages as well as exposing him to classic and contemporary interpretations of those passages. The book is clear, well-organized, and very readable. I appreciate that the book does not seem to have an &quot;agenda,&quot; but rather that it seeks to bring theology and spirituality into a discussion of the Old Testament - something that many treatements of the OT do not include. For a Christian, this book is essential in being able to link the theology of the Israelites to the theology of modern-day Christianity. A must-read for anyone wanting to broaden their understanding of the Old Testament."},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"The authors know their stuff, and I'd thoroughly recommend what I've read of their individual scholarly work. However, having just plowed through this book in a seminary class, I'd have to say there's something peculiarly dull and lifeless about it. The main theological themes seem adequately covered, and the authors go to pains to highlight the diversity of theological approaches canonized in the Old Testament. But despite many inherently interesting topics, the writing is stiff.One other critique: despite acknowledging the centrality of the exilic experience to the formation of the canon, the author's choose to devote relatively little space to the related literature. As a result, the book seems to hurry to its close.Overall, this book is certainly adequate to it task, it's just not inspired or inspiring."},{"Title":"A Theological Introduction To the Old Testament","review":"This work is a seminary-level introduction to the Old Testament that bridges the gap between the academic and the confessional study of the Bible. Birch's much-needed approach is founded upon historical-critical scholarship, but it focuses primarily upon the biblical text as theological witness.

If you are looking for smack, don't buy this book. If you are looking to express yourself in words that will truly animate and stimulate your sex life, this is a terrific book. One word of warning: There are 51 exercises in the book, and doing them will take some time.

It chronicles the steady decline in the fortunes of Miss Lily Bart in late 19th century New York high society. The novel was published in 1905. Most of Lily's problems are the result of her own attitudes and actions, although the execrable Bertha did her part. There is a bit of late-victorian anti-semitism tossed in, perhaps reflecting Ms. Wharton's own feelings, but it can be ignored.

I read the last ten pages as slowly as humanly possible so as to make it l-a-s-t.It was extremely difficult to say goodbye to the heroine, Lily Bart.I had never read Edith Wharton before; a new experience.So lovely were some of the passages that I admittedly took a pen to several pages, placing stars in the margin of pages that I plan to re-read. Her words are poetic, philosophical, and moving. Beyond beautiful. Beyond!As an Austen addict (there are lots of us), I was looking for something similar to Jane. My aunt (a retired English Professor) recommended I read EW. I am indebted.There are similarities: their use of dramatic irony; the ability to create characters that you love in spite of their shortcomings; plots that intensify due to human nature...but unlike Austen -- SPOILER ALERT -- The House of Mirth does not have a happy ending.I've just ordered The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frome. A new addiction!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's &quot;House of Mirth&quot; is now one of my favorite books. It was the first period novel I've ever read but now I have read many more and this still remains to be my favorite. I initially read the book because I am a fan of Gillian Anderson, who plays Lily Bart in the film adaptation. I haven't seen the film yet, but it would be a great feat if the film was better than the novel. I recommend the book to everyone."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Excellent view of life in the early 1900's among the New York rich, and by contrast the lives of ordinary people. Especially interesting was Wharton's descriptions of the different levels of upper class society, depending on how the people made their money and how they spent it. I read it in two days; couldn't put it down! It reads amazingly well for a book written at that time; you would expect convoluted, dense sentences but her writing style is clear. I felt as if I understood Lily Bart in the end and found her a sympathetic character, in spite of her scheming."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This was my first Edith Wharton novel and I know it won't be my last. Lily Bart is a heroine that touched my heart. She grew up surrounded by wealth but didn't have any money herself. Her beauty got her invited to all the best places but eventually gets her gossiped about and her reputation is ruined, she loses her inheritance and has to work for a living.This is a remarkable book and exposes the pitfalls of living beyond your means to fit in with people that have more money than you.I highly recommend this book and author.This kindle edition has a few extra &'s and a few misspellings but overall is very readable.I purchased my kindle in March and since I went over my book budget I am reading only the free books this year. This has to be one of my favorites so far."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I am surprised by how many reviewers did not sympathize with Lily Bart. Her tragic pursuit of wealth at all costs is a direct ramification of the American dream and reminiscent of The Great Gatsby. Yes, she is the Victorian version of a gold digger but her personality is not that cheaply surmised. She never compromises her own morality even in pursuit of her material wealth and she consistently rebels against her own materialistic desires. Her essential aim is to find a place, to be important and to live a life of beauty. How many people do not strive towards living the easiest and best financed life? In essence this woman is a reflection of so many women and men of the time as well as of now. American society is an inexhaustible orgy of materialism. Our current economic crisis is terribly reflective of that. Her story although melodramatic is as relevant today as it was when Wharton wrote it. She is burdened by credit and the desire for things she cannot afford, for travel and mostly for acceptance and love. At the same time she realizes how futile the pursite of material goods really is. It is a beautifully written novel, but definitely not an easy read. Wharton's style is ornate and complex but worth every second devoted to it. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel but beginning Wharton readers should start with Ethan Frome or the Age of Innocence which are more accessible novels."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This best selling classic was written in 1905 and is a great portrait of how women perceived their financial role in turn of the century American society.America was coming into the consumer age in the early 1900's - it was the dawn of opulence, excess spending and the obvious and glaring differences between men, women and money. The House of Mirth is an eye-opening account of how women could only be observers of the American Dream. They had to be content with watching men achieve financial independence all the while knowing that it was out of reach for themselves. This book is a glaring reminder that the only way most women could achieve financial security, was to marry it.Personally, I've always believed that many of the beliefs and attitudes we women have about money, wealth and prosperity must be somehow locked in our DNA. Money attitudes are passed on to us from generation to generation. This book, to me, reinforces this. Our great, great grandmothers were brought up in this turn-of-the-century era. Their beliefs, observations and values have been passed to us consciously and unconsciously. Reading this book, I kept saying to myself, \\"No wonder so many of us struggle with achieving and enjoying financial independence.\\"The House of Mirth is the story of Lily Bart and her struggle for financial independence. From birth her role had been set and no matter how much she wanted to change it, her inner programming and her place in society wouldn't allow it. Lily believes in financial success, wants financial success and yet, she cannot achieve it the same way as the men within her social circle are able to. Men, she realized, have a financial freedom women were not allowed to achieve. The question becomes, did Lily ever make peace with this financial inequity?This book is a powerful look at the traditional role of women in the early 1900's. Beauty, wit and charm were the acceptable methods by which women could achieve financial success.The House of Mirth is a great comparison of how men and women were allowed to learn, grow and evolve financially. Men had the power and women paid homage to that power.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't believe it was written over 100 years ago. It was such an \\"aha\\" and insight into why many of the gender based beliefs and values women have today, are \\"throw backs\\" to the early 20th century."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"After reading a few of these reviews I got the overwhelming impression that people hadn't tried hard enough to see this book in the context of the time it was written, much as perhaps people today might read Catcher in the Rye and see it as perhaps tame compared to reading it when it was written.Lily Bart was a true victim of the society of her times. Watch or read Age of Innocence and see how society can trap someone and manipulate them without the victim realising until they are beyond their depth and struggling.Ok, so Lily Bart was greedy, much in the same way a lot of people are greedy when they long for something and then suddenly find they have the means to have it. How many of us on payday think Hey I can get that outfit I've been longing for, or that surround sound system even though a part of you is shouting something about the end of the month when your salary will have run out because you did go out and buy something just for that moment of pleasure ? Lily loved that moment of getting something she knew she shouldn't really have, and that double-edge made it even more attractive to have.You have to remember that by the time Lily found that her family had lost it's money she was already of an age where she had spent so long thinking she was going to get it all that she found it hard to relinquish. She turned down early marriage proposals with impetuosity of youth, not wanting to be tied down too early and being too young to realise that there might be a day when it would be too late and that she would regret her rashness. She then finds herself at an age where she is on the edge of being too late to save herself and being on the edge makes her swing from one side to the other: to climb to safe harbour but have no happiness or to feel like she was living a true life and keep swimming in the hope something more worthwhile will come along.Lawrence Selden becomes in a sense her saviour whilst also crucifying Lily unwittingly. Having himself had an affair with a married acquaintance of Lily's she discovers over an illicit meeting with him how she is really viewed and this sets about a chain of events that eventually overtake her. Every time she feels the danger of bending to the will of High Society she recalls Selden's view point and strives to maintain the moral ground she feels she wants him to bear witness to. She falls off the wagon a few times but Selden always seems to come along and she tries again.It is very frustrating seeing how Lily and Selden dance around each other through so many misunderstandings, brought about either by themselves or by other people. Watching Lily's fall you see it coming before she does and are forced to watch helplessly as it happens and keeps happening.Lily is guilty only of wanting the same pleasures others less worthy have without appreciating. She has to have new dresses as part of the charade she is forced to maintain to stay in the game. She buys more than she should because she just can't believe that life won't save her in some way after all her hard work.Lily tries to help others and is constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others whilst also fighting to have some form of life, she just can't decide what it is she would prefer to have and knowing it has such a huge importance she takes too long about deciding.I feel in the end, in the vein of other of Wharton's novels, that the main character chooses the moral ground whilst having to sacrifice happiness, she doesn't choose to sacrifice happiness, that is just a consequence. She is only a short distance away from happiness but never knows it and through no fault of her own deprives herself of it forever. This is a tragic and beautiful book, definitely worth reading although many will feel as I do on the last pages, if only they had been there a day earlier but then this is Wharton's story and she knew where her character's had to go."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Can anyone truly tell me under what category our enigmatic Lily Bart should be placed? She's such....well.. an enigma, that she's difficult to put a finger on (no pun intended). Is she an antihero, a bona fide heroine, or somewhere stuck in the middle? In any event, at times I shook my head in disgust at some of her less than wise decisions, while I applauded and cheered as she undergoes a striking, yet tumultuous, epiphany of sorts that makes her all the more endearing and palpably real to the reader.Seemingly infinite wealth, preeminent social status, and unmitigated decadence form the shaky foundation of Edith Wharton's fictional and frictional, yet highly plausible, house -- a house that, ironically enough, is conspicuously devoid of mirth. There exists, however, a method to Wharton's madness. As the bible verse(Ecl 7:4) states from which she nabbed the title, \\"...the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.\\" As Lily is inexorably extricated from this house of miserable frivolity, I found it increasingly difficult to nonchalantly label Lily a failure, but rather as a heroine of noble courage.The sheer genius of Wharton's amazingly fluid and enormously readable prose deftly concludes with \\"the word which made all clear\\" for Lily Bart and Lawrence Selden. The beauty of this is that Wharton does not lower herself and overtly spell it out to the reader as so many hackneyed authors do; instead, she places her blind faith in the astuteness of the reader to discern for oneself.Note: for those ordering the large print version, it is well worth it for the contemporary reviews written in 1905 as well as Edith Wharton's correspondences to Charles Scribner, but do not, however, read the intro by Elizabeth Hardwick before the text due to the fact that she inexcusably reveals the denouement in her so-called \\"introduction.\\""},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I have to admit that I genuinely enjoyed this novel, and I don't generally go for books of this genre. The story is truly an American tale of Romeo &amp; Juliet, although the main characters, Lily Bart and Lawrence Selden, situation is not quite so \\"fated\\" as the original pair. What makes me truly appreciate this novel and what I believe makes it American is how, though the couple is indeed fated, they are more victims of their own free will. It is not so much society that has conspired against them, as much as they are products of that society; thus, their choices and failings are measured through the distorted values society has instilled in them. At any point within the story each might have gone to the other, but neither does, as they are both preoccupied with their appearance.The ending was a bit ironic, but to affect real change one cannot leave the reader with a happy ending and a feeling of satisfaction. We all know the reality of the time was quite the contrary.Bravo Ms. Wharton!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Except for Undine Spragg from &quot;The Custom of the Country,&quot; I've yet to read a novel from E. Wharton wherein I cannot painfully relate. From the joy and madness of unrequited passion to hopes and dreams pulled asunder, I've been there and done that only to have Edith bring it all back to life every time I pick up one of her novels. What an eye she possesses; what an imagination! &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; is a shocking and honest disection of how cruelly society can work to crush those of us whom dare to be daringly unique and follow the beat of a different heart. I do agree with another reader's comment that the story suffers from &quot;too much detail,&quot; but God...how achingly beautiful she writes. The story's ending left me grasping for a comprehension I am still unable to locate. While I didn't particularly enjoy this journey, it's only because a raw nerve was touched. To be sure, such reaction is proof of a genius at work."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth is the book that established Edith Wharton as a major writer. As such, it is not the future Pulitzer Prize-winner's best book, though it does have its strong points. The comedy of manners, particularly around the turn of the 20th century, was effectively monopolized by British literature; this book is one of American literature's first successful books of the type. As such, it is a book distinctly of its time: its setting is certainly not universal; arguably neither is its theme. And yet, the book has been in continual publication for nearly a century for several good reasons. First of all, like her good friend Henry James, Wharton was a master prose stylist. Smart, sophisticated, and witty, her prose is perfectly-suited for a book of this type. Many of the book's features place it squarely in Victorian-era America, in the cradle of New York's upper-class -- in other words, square in the middle of the Gilded Age. The era's infamous social etiquette is on full display here: one that knows little of it will come away from the book knowing much. In the middle of this situation, then, is the book's protagonist: Lily Bart. Wharton uses the story of Bart's rapid downfall to satirize several aspects of New York's turn-of-the-century upper-class society: its selfishness, cruelty, and blindness; its preoccupation with gossip and its disdain for truth; its inhumane treatment of those it believes to be inferior; and more. The book also focuses on the situation that a young lady who was born and bred from the cradle to be rich and taught no skills other than how to woo a rich man into marriage -- a woman, in short, like Lily -- was often forced into at the time. Lily, despite being the most prized beauty of the entire scene, has a seemingly-perverse record of failing to marry rich men whom she has under her thumb. In this, we find Lily to be something of an essentially contradictory character: not a mere gold digger, but hardly a rebel, either. When she is ejected from society's upper echelons, she does not become strong and individualistic: she crumbles. It is in this aspect that the book differs so greatly from present-day culture and ideas about women. This is, by no means, a feminist book: strong-minded women reading this book today, unless they look upon it from a purely-literary viewpoint, will not only despise it, but hate Lily for her failure to stand up for herself. This is an anachronistic reading of the book, of course, but it is precisely the reason why the book's relevance to the contemporary world is questionable at best (this point is illustrated by the largely-unsuccessful recent film adaptation.) Still, the book is both a penetrating comedy of manners and a fascinating period piece. Its exquisite writing style also is quite remarkable, and this is an essential book for prose stylists. This book comes highly-recommended for fans of the works of E.M. Forster and Kate Chopin's The Awakening -- and, of course, of Wharton's other writings. For a truly great work from this author, though, read Ethan Frome."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I realize that we're supposed to sympathize with Lily Bart, the protagonist...but I just find it impossible to really feel sorry for her situation. Other reviewers have claimed that &quot;Lily had no choice&quot; but to end her life. Well, I think that's completely incorrect. She has numerous possibilities to marry Selden--a kind, decent man (in contrast to repulsive ones like Rosedale) who adores her, but she cannot give up the riches of the upper crust in order to do so. Essentially--and this Lily admits to us at points during the book--she's in it for the cash, even if she does finally understand the opportunities she's wasted throughout (strange, for a woman who talks nonstop about &quot;opportunities...&quot;) And I think that, even if it's a correct reflection of the time in which she lived, Lily's motives ultimately destroys my sympathy for her as a character. I mean, a woman who complains because she can't have fresh flowers on the luncheon table every day? Come ON, Lily..."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I could only stand reading one third of this book. I found the writing difficult to follow--maybe it requires a higher SAT than mine, I dont know. But, convoluted high-style writing aside, I found the plot unbelievable and rather trivial. I mean, if Lily was the hottie she was supposed to be in the book, then men being what they are, would have been standing in line with a \\"purple heart on.\\" She wouldnt need much of an IQ either--some men are intimidated by that. If she was a 10, as I gathered in the book, then all she had to do was be nice to any guy and they would melt like butter, even ones with money. When I could see this not happening, building momentum, I lost interest. And the maid who tried making a deal was pretty unrealistic as well. In today's time, she would be making a deal of a different kind--haha--just kidding. Also, the author makes too much of a big deal on appearances. Some people with money dont particularly like to advertise it. Conversely, people who don't try to pretend they have it by over-dressing. Once again, a book in the literarture genre comes up short, at least for me."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I really disliked this book, and I think I'm one of the only people on Amazon.com who isn't going to give this book praise. Not only did I find Lily Bart an annoying heroine (her only goal during the entire book is to get married, hopefully to a rich person) but I also found Edith Wharton's writing convoluted and overly complex. Wharton could've said some things in a simpler, more direct English but she chooses to write in a highfalutin fashion, using SAT-type words and overly convoluted sentence structures. In my opinion, Wharton comes across as just another early 20th century woman writer who tries way too hard to impress others with her complicated writing. The book, while depicting the social strata of early 20th century New York very well, is just another book by a self-impressed female writer about a very weak female character. Now, I am a female myself, and I frankly have no time for these female authors and their books about wimpy girls. Forget about Wharton. I'd much rather read something by Dickens, Hemingway, or Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Amazing heroine.

WOMEN RULE! hehe"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Serious readers of Victorian/Gilded Age fiction, in particular those experienced in groping through the Master's obscure passages, will not find this book a refreshing alternative. Lily's fall is too predictable and melodramatic. All the other characters are wooden, especially Selden, who is like a handsome but untalented actor mouting empty lines. The author's treatment of Simon Rosedale makes me want to urinate on every book she ever wrote. Wharton's ugly anti-Semitism stands in sharp contrast to the clearer thinking of her great contemporaries: Conrad, James, Twain, Howells, George Eliot, Willa Cather, and many more. Additionally, the perseverating description and obsession with material doodads--while pretending, of course, to condemn poor grasping Lily--is no better than any shopping-and-whoopee grocery-store paperback's. This second-rate talent deserves instant oblivion."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I found the book the House of Mirth to be totally horrible. I found that learning all about her life, money troubles, sex sacndals, and worries were tiresome and uninteresting. The writer Edith Whaton has had some of the common probalems related to the book and seems to me as a cry for help. This book upset me, as I enjoyed the wonderful beginning with cheerful Selden, but became hauntingly horrible within the next few chapters. The book went on for much to long and showed that Wharton has no self control over how boring her books can become in the long 400 some pages. I belive that if you enjoy a book about a womans horrible life go ahead and read it, but if you don't like books that could just bring you down after a few chapters...find some other book, like Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is the first Wharton book I've read, and I'm very impressed. I'm usually not a fan of reading classic books on my free time, but this book is completely relevant of our time and society... I couldn't put it down. I truly felt for Lily Bart. Wharton's writing is complex and heartbreaking, presenting external relationships while simultaneously giving the reader a glimpse at what is really going on underneath. READ IT."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Though &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; may be more famous, with a well-known film to spread its story, I felt that this novel was better. Wharton provides the reader with a well-woven tapestry of despair and tragedy. I felt myself wishing that Lily would take the initiative, DO something to stop her slow decline into poverty and drugs, but at the same time, as an amateur literary critic, knowing that in her inability to do so lay the whole point of the book. The description was wonderful, the subsidiary characters excellently drawn, and the ending powerful. I did not particularly appreciate the stereotyping of the Jewish character, but no doubt that expressed the feelings of upper class New York at the time, and so I reluctantly accepted it in my heart. Nothing, especially retrospective viewing of ethnocentrism, can take away from Edith Wharton's rank as one of the great American writers."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I was so thrilled with this book! My only other exposure to Ms. Wharton's work was reading Ethan Frome in junior high school and seeing the film of The Age of Innocence. This is easily the best book I've read this year, and I plan to read her others. I was so heartbroken by the end--I had forgotten how powerful a great novel can be."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The tale of Lily Bart's struggle in a society that is absolutely unforgiving to those without money establishes Wharton as one of the greatest modern authors. Although the story is somewhat dated and has minor anti semetic undertones, it is thoroughly enjoyable classic reading for a lazy afternoon"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This book is notable because it gives the reader an inside look at the ultra-rich old-money upperclass of a century ago.The main character, Lily Bart, I found totally unlikeable. One can't feel sorry for someone who has had boundless opportunities to get a better deal in life than all but a few, but she squanders all of her opportunities because none meet her ideal of perfection.What she's looking for is a life of being ultra-rich where she can boss around an army of servants and never have to do any work, and her only acceptable route for getting there is to marry someone that rich. But it's not enough that her husband merely be filthy rich, but that the money be old money and not new money, that he be good looking and intelligent. This, of course, is all too much for anyone to ask for. So she rejects the man who has old money and is good looking but is as dumb as a brick. She rejects the man who is smart and filthy rich but is fat and ugly and, oh my god, Jewish! And she rejects the man who is good looking and smart, but merely an upper middle class lawyer who can never buy her two mansions full of servants.Lily is also horrified at the notion of actually EARNING money. The process by which men become super-rich repulses her (which is why only inherited money is pure).You don't necessarily have to like the main character in order for a book to be a good book. But I found the book hard reading, mostly due to all the names that are thrown at the reader which soon become very hard to keep track of, and the oblique manner in which so many of the books major plot points are described, making it easy for the casual reader to get completely lost."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"In this novel, the protagonist's decline and fall seems as obvious and predictable as that of a Greek tragedy. Despite the author's ironic commentary, which is not as sophisticated in this book as in some of her other novels, the reader is left wondering just what is wrong with Lily Bart and her unmerited, overweening pride? Plot slows down to a crawl about half-way through, despite the engaging & entertaining glimpses into high society at the time Wharton was writing, and finally gets absolutely predictable. Still, worth a read if you're just discovering Wharton. Characters relatively interesting, if somewhat mawkish. Continue with her better books, however, like CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY, ETHAN FROME, and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. 2* instead of 3* because of predictable ending."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I got about half way through this book and couldn't remember why I had loved it so much when I first read it ten years ago. Edith's superior observation, style and sharp storytelling kept me going and by the end I understood why I'd loved it so much the first time. Lily is certainly one of the most enigmatic characters you'll ever deal with. She's exasperating, stupid, intelligent, and lovely. Did Edith Wharton realize what a modern story she had written? Lily Bart could be any contemporary beautiful young woman striving to reach the top of her game using whatever tools she can muster. To me, Lily's ultimate sadness is that all her vivaciousness, all that she could be, was swallowed up by a gaping lack of spirit, passed on to her by her mother and her admonition not to \\"be dingey\\". That does a lot for your self esteem."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Those who saw the recent film version got an expurgated, &quot;sanitized&quot; version of Lily Bart. Obviously the filmmakers thought, probably correctly, that a movie audience would have little sympathy for Lily if she was as vain, foolish, greedy, and ultimately responsible for her own misery as she is in the book--so she was metamorphosed into an innocent victim of others' cruelty.Anyway...people have called Lily Wharton's most &quot;complex&quot; protagonist. That's shorthand for &quot;she's not likable.&quot; And she isn't, really. Though she's not evil or hateful, she also isn't one who inspires much rooting value. Her stupidity in constantly rejecting Selden becomes grating and makes her death pathetic rather than tragic, and also makes one wonder why on Earth a man like Selden, who'd have little trouble attacting women every bit as beautiful as Lily, would spend so much time trying to win the hand of such a cold fish.However, Wharton's writing, always engaging, manages to keep the reader interested until the very end."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I thought the book was very much like Jane Austin's works which is probably one of the reasons I liked it. It gives a great picture of society at that time and I enjoyed Wharton's writing style. I wouldn't call Lily Bart a tragic heroine. I wanted her to find happiness, but I didn't pity her. Even as she tried so desperately to get into a society she condemned. I also enjoyed other characters, sometimes more that Lily Bart. I thought Wharton did a good job developing some of the other characters as well (Miss Farish, Seldon..)"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Although the language was at times a little too difficult for me (since I'm not a native speaker), I liked the book pretty much and enjoyed it.

I thought the book was interesting and I can only recommend it."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The tale of unrequited love and the realism and insightfulness of the characters intensifies this novel.

It is perhaps the best Edith Wharton novel and will live in my memory forever.."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"America and Europe of the 1800s were stiff, gilded, formal place, full of \\"old\\" families, rigid customs and social transgressions. Especially for women.And nobody chronicled them better than Edith Wharton, who spun exquisitely barbed novels out of the social clashes of the late nineteenth century. \\"The House of Mirth\\" is one of her darker stories, where scandals and lack of conformity trigger a tragic downward spiral for a vibrant woman.Like most not-so-rich women, Lily Bart is on the prowl for a marriage to keep her in luxury and affluent circles. What's more, she has a rapid intellect and striking looks, but she is also a habitual liar who defies society's strictures (she gambles and smokes). Her only friend is Lawrence Seldon, but she is determined not to marry for love alone.Unfortunately, her schemes and plans start to collapse -- her adoring suitors either aren't rich enough, or her independent spirit sends her off. Her desperation becomes even more intense as she finds herself in the thick of a scandal, spun up by a malicious society matron to cover up her own affair. With her reputation in ruins, Lily's life spirals down into a new life of unemployment, poverty, and the final tragedy.Edith Wharton always paid a lot of attention to a woman's restricted life in the Gilded Age, and how scandals, unconventionality and society's hypocrisy could ruin them. But \\"The House of Mirth\\" pays more attention to this than most -- it's a bleakly realistic story, unflinchingly showing Lily's slow descent into miserable loneliness.Despite that, Wharton's writing is pure flowering poetry with a knack for evocation (\\"Her small pale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes\\"), and has a sensual quality with all the descriptions of silks, plants, soft light and luxurious mansions. And she vividly portrays the upper echelons of New York society at the time -- affairs, gossip and gilded salons -- as well as the restricted lives of womenBut Wharton is just as capable of describing the darker, sadder world that Lily falls into (\\"... blurred the gaunt roof-lines, threw a mauve veil over the discouraging perspective of the side streets\\"). Sedoesn't pull any punches with the tragic finale, which has a distinct air of inevitability about it -- no fairy-tale last-minute save by a Prince Charming.Lily starts out the book as a glimmering satellite of society, who can be rather selfish and cruel, but who nevertheless gains some sympathy because she just doesn't deserve everything that happens. The cruel, glittering society of the time had no room for women who stood outside the lines, and Lily's slow downward spiral is an illustration of this -- she's driven into miserable poverty and drug addiction. Lovely.\\"The House of Mirth\\" is anything but mirthful -- it's the study of a woman's slow downfall, and the cruel society that left her friendless and disgraced. Haunting and vivid."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"It's not that consecrated writers of classic, canonical literature need highwayscribery's imprimatur, but this tale of a pretty girl's perils gets an A-plus.The book was a Christmas gift from the scribe's sister-in-law Laura and he is grateful to her for the journey through late 19th Century New York City's high social class.The greatest revelation in devouring this dense, but delicious tome is more personal than universal for the scribe determined that, after following Breton and Cocteau and Celine and the whole modernist crowd for so long, he writes most like...Edith Wharton (?).Indeed, born to it, Wharton breezily confects a high-tone, baroque, and detailed English of the kind the scribe concocted, in a wheezing fashion, if not a breezy one, in his own \\"The Sidewalk Smokers Club.\\"Reading Wharton is work. Don't dare if you're intimidated by 446 pages of tiny type filled-in with long sentences, characterized by many clauses, each of which slices the onion of truth a little more as you catch your breath so as to finish.the scribe grew up in New York and is a product of its fine public school system and the fact he would approve, in the snobbish sense, of Wharton's prose may say a lot about how much our English teachers of adolescence ultimately affect our tastes.But enough about the personal.\\"The House of Mirth\\" is an allusion to the high society world a mostly low-born girl of remarkable beauty, Lily Bart, would like to reside in.This is the story of a pretty girl's perils; not a pretty girl who has a job and a car and a sense of her own projection, but an old-fashioned pretty girl who was raised to behave as an ornament, whose fundamental purpose is to complete elegant tableaux.Lily Bart moves amongst the sun-kissed of New York society (if that's possible), but she is not truly of them. Her ticket to parties and outings of the rich people with whom she runs is her unique and singular beauty.The story opens with Lily's reputation a bit tarnished at the age of 29 by the number of suitors she has passed on. We join her in the opening fade to her personal blossoming. Because we know her innermost thoughts and fears, we can cozy up to Lily in the same way we can cozy up to a criminal who has escaped jail and is fleeing soulless police officers and their barking dogs.But she is not a good person, having bought lock-stock-and-barrel into her mother's vision of Lily as a piece of furniture that must be sold to the highest bidder.Society turns out to be tricky and, as we meet Lily, her swinging season is fast passing. The story details Lily's descent out of society and into the working class where her beauty is naught but a hindrance to a gal trying to earn an honest dollar.At first, it was a little hard for the scribe to determine what was going on and exactly whom had slighted or insulted whom at the parties portrayed by Wharton. These WASPy New Yorkers have always had a delicate touch and sometimes the scribe was forced to return to the scene of the crime, to see exactly what the crime was.Keep reading. Soon enough you get the idea that being left off the yacht you've been invited onto is something like having a knife driven into your heart. Wharton literally provides an early 21st Century savage with a primer on manners so that by the time her one-time friend Judy Trenor runs into Lily at a restaurant, it is easy to see she has been slighted even though only the kindest of words have been exchanged between the ladies.It's a different world assayed here, one where a woman who has never had sex dies in shame, the victim of innuendo and false rumor. A world where a soft kiss to a suitor's forehead is as \\"far\\" as things ever get.Perhaps the only flaw in the story is the swift decline to death of Lily Bart after so arduous and complicated a fall from proper society. Maybe that's what Wharton was trying to say; that a lady that's good for nothing can find no way to live and will die shortly.It would seem fatigue, hopelessness, and an addiction to a popular high of time, camphor, led to Lily's death, but all along feckless men and rapacious socialites either watch her drown impassively, or duck her head under when she comes up for air.In the end, Lily's acts are characterized by nobility, but a self-destructive one that only serves to shorten her life. No Marxist scholar, Wharton nonetheless and slyly, throws light on the perils associated with trying to meet rich peoples' standards and codes of conduct.Stick with your own kind, Wharton seems to be suggesting, because being rich when you're not can't be done."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's \\"The House Of Mirth\\" is a sad, but brilliant commentary on the closed, repressive society of the rich, upper class, New York nobility, at the dawn of the 20th century.

Her parents are dead and she lives with relatives.The Barnes and Noble Classic Series Edition of \\"The House of Mirth\\" contains an excellent Introduction by Jeffrey Meyers, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, who received his doctorate at Berkeley, and has worked as a professional writer since 1992.

Though she has little money, she has family connections, good breeding and the hope of coming into an inheritance. Beautiful and very charming, Lily has been brought up to be an ornament, as were most women of her class at that time. She is a gilded bird with a noble heart, but clearly she is not aware of the restrictions of her cage. Part of Lily's tragedy is that she does have character, spirit, and a conscience. However, she does not know how to align these attributes, with her ornamental avocation, and her ambitions to marry a wealthy man of good birth.As expected, Lily is popular with both bachelors and married men. Most of the bachelors propose marriage at on time or another.

Laudanum helps her to sleep, and she becomes dependent on the drug.Lily's descent, from society's beautiful darling to a disheveled, desperate woman living in a shabby hotel room, addicted to drugs, is disturbing reading, to say the least. Her decline seems inevitable, especially after we read of her many poor and self-destructive decisions. She seems to sabotage herself. However, Lily Bart is ultimately the victim of a cruel society that sacrifices anyone who does not conform to its expectations.After reading \\"House Of Mirth,\\" for the first time several years ago, Lily's character has remained clear in my mind.

Lily Bart, and most of the other characters in this novel, are well fleshed out. Athough Lily Bart is a classically flawed character, you understand her motivations and those of the other individuals reacting to her. The novel is quite readable and although I am not sure that it should have made the list of the top novels of the 20th century, it is certainly a worthwhile classic to read.

It is in fact extrememly well written, and causes us to feel for the main character.

She has everything but money. And that makes all the difference. And the inevitable is happening. She is getting older every day. I became her in a way. I could relate to each of her reverses, could understand most of her reasonings. I was entrenched in her character and pushing her to please marry Selden--they so obviously loved each other! And yet Selden was weak. He could have reached out and did not. She spiralled downward and her friends watched disinterestedly--or perhaps just enough to provide some gossip about Lily. The final scene will tear your heart. It is the finest book I have read in a long time, no matter that it is nearly a century old. It speaks to the woman's heart today as it did then. It is a book I must have in my library forever."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is the same as so many. Written beautifully, interesting characterization, but the main character is not likable and the plot is somewhere between dull and non-existent! Lily is a spoiled brat who has no clue what she wants. She's witty but stupid. Over and over again she's forced to make the decision between love and money. She wants both so she always rejects offers of only one, solidifying her misery. Her helplessness to change herself, know herself, or even explain herself is pitiful to the point of nausea.I did enjoy the book, and never felt like dropping it, so I wouldn't say it was boring. However, when it comes to the \\"society lady's\\" commentary it's far from the craftsmanship of Austen, and the ending fell a little flat. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel, because I certainly don't feel sorry for Lily. She had a setback or two, but no more than the average person and she had so many positives that she could have used in her own favor that she simply squandered.Also, I can have very little respect for someone who in turn has so little respect for truth. It may be reality that truth isn't always appreciated as much as it should be, but to patronize and insult people to such a degree as to make out that truth has no value at all when faced with money and popularity is unjust, pessimistic, and rude."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I stumbled upon a review of the recent film of THE HOUSE OF MIRTH in the TLS and, in order to have the novel firmly fixed in my mind (that is, before the lush, seductive images of film forever eradicated Wharton's novel from me) I dragged my copy off the shelf for a re-read. It had been 16 years since I last read of Lily Bart and her life, and I didn't realize how much I had missed her. For me, this is one of the great reading experiences, one of a handful that make reading a book the deeply moving and human exchange that it is. Despite the distance of wealth, property, time and manners, Wharton manages to make Lily's world and life palpable to anyone who will listen. The clash of money, morals, personality and circumstance is infinitely developed and played out in front of a never fading natural world.

Having grown up in this society, Wharton evaluates it here as an insider, and her trenchant observations give this early novel a liveliness and verisimilitude not characteristic of \\"aristocratic\\" novels written by outsiders. Set at a time in which the old, moneyed aristocracy was being forced to admit newcomers who had made their recent fortunes through industry, the novel shows moneyed society in flux, the old guard ensuring their exclusivity against parvenus who are not the \\"right type,\\" at the same time that their sons and daughters were often securing large fortunes through marriage into some of these new families.Lily Bart, a beautiful young woman of good family whose father lost everything when she was only nineteen, is left dependent on wealthy relatives in this society until she can charm a financially secure suitor into marriage. At age twenty-nine, she is no longer a debutante, and the pressure is mounting for her to marry, though she lacks the unlimited financial resources of social rivals. Still, her wit and charm make her a delightful companion, and she is never at a loss for suitors. Intelligent enough to want a real marriage and not just a merger between families, she has resisted making a commitment to date, though the clock is ticking.As Lily tries to negotiate a good marriage and future for herself, she is aware that the competition is fierce. Women \\"friends\\" pounce on the latest gossip and spread rumors to discredit rivals, and Lily's reputation is tainted with hints of impropriety. Her opportunities for a good marriage begin to dwindle, and when her aunt, Mrs. Peniston, dies and leaves her a bequest that covers only her debts, Lily is no longer able to compete in the society so attractive to her and begins her downward spiral.Wharton creates a complete picture of turn-of-the-century New York society and its \\"important\\" people--their lack of scruples, their opportunism, their manipulations, and their smug self-importance, characteristics one may also see in Lily when she is part of this society, though there is a limit on how far she will stoop. But Wharton also shows how quickly a woman may become an outcast when the money runs out and she is thrown on her own resources without any training for any other kind of life. A well-developed melodrama filled with revealing details, this novel established Wharton's reputation as a novelist/commentator on the manners and morals of high society and those who would participate in it. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I have read this book many times and it is still one of my favorites. I read the reviews, of which some people have no &quot;pity&quot; for Lily - she doesn't want it! While Lily has many chances to take care of herself financially, she is unwilling to let go of her moral character. Quite a position for one who requires (or so she believes) the approval and financial support of society! Obviously those who pan this book as &quot;that was the way it was then&quot; are not old enough to realize that to some degree, that is the way it is now. You are still judged socially by your occupation, home, financial wealth, etc. Lily is a wonderful heroine. Although you want to talk to her and explain to her the other choices, knowing Lily as you come to, you understand her choice. Very wonderful book. I will not see the movie, because I have my own mental images of Lily, Selden and the gang, which I do not want disturbed."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's prose is, of course, exquisite, but don't buy this digital version. The formatting has no table of contents and there is no indication of where one chapter ends and the other begins (with occasional page numbers in the middle of words)."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"High school students are often assigned Ethan Frome, and the Age of Innocence gained many readers because of the movie, but this is the Edith Wharton book that everyone should read. In many ways, this is similar to a Jane Austen book in which a member of the upper echelon of society has money problems and needs to marry well in order to stay at the same level of society. Forces and other people are contriving against her, but there seems to be at least one man who would be a good match for reasons of love. The first twist here is that the good match is not financially well off and therefore won't be able to support the heroine as she wants to be supported.Lily Bart was orphaned many years ago, and her family had been financially ruined before that. However, she is accustomed to beautiful things and wants to continue to live at the top level of society. Unfortunately, her heart and soul long for more than these creature comforts. She yearns for excitement, intellectual and emotional honesty and probably true love, although she is confused about that. As she has gotten towards her late 20s, her prospects are dwindling and the only person who has the resources to support her and is already a part of polite society is Percy Gryce, a singularly boring man.Lily rebels against Gryce just as she is about to marry him when she has a couple of heartfelt conversations with Lawrence Selden, a person she decides she might love, but who makes clear that he is not rich enough to support her as well as she should be supported.Her choices other than Gryce are slim. There is Simon Rosedale, who is portrayed as an upwardly mobile person and therefore undesirable. He is also Jewish, which Wharton never overtly says is a problem with him for Lily, but probably figures into Lily's calculus (Wharton mainly talks about his Jewishness in the context of saying that Rosedale is more patient and able to face disappointment than others in his position because of what his people have dealt with over the centuries).I have to admit that, unlike Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence, it took me a while to get into this book. Perhaps, I picked up this book to read a story of Old New York and manners and was not ready for such an intense character study. But once I got to page 100, the last 250 pages went by in a flash. It is beautiful and eminently interesting. You will be interested in every twist in the story.A couple of words of caution. If you buy this edition with the Anna Quindlen introduction, DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION FIRST. It gives away too much in the first page--when I stopped reading it until after I finished--and the rest of the introduction gives away the rest of the plot. Finally, as with Jane Austen books, the actions of the male characters are often either inscrutable or irrational. It may be that men actually acted like this in the early 20th Century (or 19th for Austen). But I think it more likely that Wharton is misconstruing the male characters in ways that male authors almost always do with female characters. But this is a minor flaw, especially since Lily is so central to this book."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is the third novel by Wharton I've read (the other two, of course, are Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence). Unlike the others, The House of Mirth is an accessible read with characters one can relate to. Wharton's attention to detail is impressive (yet slightly boring), and the subtlety of how the story moves from fluff to tight human drama is superb.Finally, despite being written a century ago the main theme of The House of Mirth is very much applicable to today's materialistic yuppie society. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The world that Edith Wharton felt comfortable with was the one that was located in the fashionably expensive upper east side of New York City of the mid 1870s. There were plenty of newly rich businessmen who had made fortunes after the Civil War, and the attitudes of \\"hit \`em hard\\" that made money then worked pretty well later too. Such attitudes were often grounded in a smugness that said, \\"I got mine, and you didn't.\\" In THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, Wharton examines several figures whose lives intersect at a junction that separates those who have money from those who don't. The losers in such a confrontation are not only the ones who wind up broke--they are simply the most obvious--but the so called winners are also losers in that Wharton shows them as losing their humanity even if they maintain their fortunes.Lily Bart is a very pretty but poor young woman who likes to wear nice clothes and travel in high class society. Since she is poor, she has no choice but to marry into money, and so she spends most of the novel looking at one man and then another, before deciding which man has enough money to guarantee her entrance into the world of which she can only dream. When Lily sees her upper class companions, she does not see them as three-dimensional fully-fleshed individuals, for if she did, she would notice that under the fancy clothes and expensive jewelry are people with the same weaknesses of character as anyone else. For their part, when Lily's rich friends see her, they either recognize her for what she is as a girl on the make or they try to help her gain entrance into their world of money and privilege. The problem with Lily is that she is simply not ruthless enough to get what she says she wants. On one hand she has been taught from childhood that the only way for a poor but pretty girl like her to get money is to marry it. On the other, however, when she does have the chance to marry into money, her \\"good\\" side stops her from taking advantage of a wealthy man who sees only a fine looking lady like Lily. Such a rich man is Mr. Rosedale, who may not be the handsomest man in the world or the most classy of individuals, but he does ask for her hand, which Lily refuses since she thinks she can do better. In the world of fiction, or perhaps in the real world as well, such a refusal often leads to a later regret that a golden opportunity was missed. And indeed, when Lily's standing in the rich community takes a tumble, so does her reputation, and when Lily looks up Mr. Rosedale to tell him that she has reconsidered his offer, he tells her to take a hike. Lily's fall from grace reads like a soap opera. She alienates the one true if poor man who would have been happy to marry her. She allows a rich man to try to seduce her in the most caddish of ways. And she gets involved in a life style that costs considerable sums to maintain, the result of which is to bankrupt her. She takes a dead end job in a factory, and on top of all that she is being blackmailed by that cad seducer. For her, there is no way out but suicide.THE HOUSE OF MIRTH is not quite the drama of naturalism that some see it as. In the world of brute naturalism, the world conspires to crush you without mercy or hope. But in Lily's case, there are others who are good and are not crushed, her would be lover Selden, for example, is hurt by her death but otherwise uninjured. In Lily's demise, Edith Wharton recreates a world that entices one to play a deadly game, the rules of which are stacked against the player from the start. THE HOUSE OF MIRTH can still be seen as a cautionary tale against playing that most deadly of games."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The book tells the sad tale of Lily Bart living in New York at the end of the 19th century. Her fate appears so real, merciless and inevitable because Edith Wharton's family history was acquired with the great names of the old New York society. The author manages to create a protagonist who at twenty-nine is already past the age of marriage which would be her only chance to secure a safe and comfortable future. But her character is complex and contradictory and the causes for her destruction lie within her own psyche. That is why she manages to cut herself at every turn by a combination of lack of judgement, lack of care and a great deal of arrogance towards the men who show interest in her. And so her decline, misstep after misstep, appears both gradual and inevitable.The author remarkably shows the social claustrophobia under which Lily Bart suffers. She evolves in an airless world of tight corsets, heavy draperies and closed rooms where she attempts to gasp for fresh air but fails and suffocates. She doesn't acknowledge that a woman of her class and situation can only support herself through an advantageous marriage. Edith Wharton clearly both disapproves of the wealth of the very rich and portrays them as inevitable. Because such people are invincible, Lily Bart is the agent of her own decline since she refuses to bargain with them in order to triumph. In this sense she is finally a victim because she cannot resolve the conflict between her ideals and her comfort or between what she aspires to be and what society insists she becomes."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I'm not going to comment on the novel itself here. I'm just wondering whether they have proofreaders up at Barnes &amp; Noble Classics. I love the return of inexpensive mass paperback editions of classic literature, but you shouldn't have to put up with a shabbily prepared text just because you don't want to - or can't - pay the price of a trade paperback or hardback volume. This thing is lousy with typos. It's a disservice to readers and to Wharton herself."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Prior to reading The House of Mirth, I had read both The Age of Innocence and Ethan Frome. The House of Mirth deals with moneyed New York families, as does The Age of Innocence, but The House of Mirth has a more serious tone and a more tragic storyline, in that the main character is a woman who is a victim of her times. Lily Bart lives in an era when to be poor is the worst punishment of New York society. The idea of having to work for a living is untenable. Her goal in life is to marry well, but she struggles with the idea of abandoning her goals for true happiness just to marry well. The story deals with her misadventures in society, and the sometimes painful price her relatives and friends extract from her in exchange for financial support. This is a very enjoyable, although sad, novel, and I recommend it particularly to those who have already read some Edith Wharton and wish to round out their selection of writing."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth is Wharton's first big novel, and it isn't as good as some of her later works. Nevertheless, Lily Bart, the central character, is well crafted as a woman who cannot reconcile her emotional desires with her deep-seated hatred of what she calls &quot;dinginess&quot; -- financial poverty. The book meticulously depicts her long, slow social downfall as she runs out of money and becomes the victim of malicious rumors spread by her enemies. Ultimately, she cannot marry the man she really loves because he is not rich enough.The House of Mirth certainly has plenty of juicy elements -- sex scandals, blackmail, gambling, unrequited love, exotic trips to France, etc. It is also a great character study, particularly of Lawrence Selden, who is portrayed as an outside observer looking in on the social world of New York, much like the reader is doing. The social world of the novel is based on the most minute details of all social graces; the book has to be read pretty carefully if you want to get the most from it. Just as all the characters analyze every detail of every other character's actions, so too must the reader. Don't try to use this book as brain candy on a long plane flight. If you've got the time, it's well worth reading, despite some of the cheesy plot twists towards the end."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is the original \\"Sex and the City\\" and a century and the alleged sexual revolution have not lessened its sting. Any single woman of the present day can recognize some of herself in Lily Bart--the optimism, the refusal to settle, the accumulating horrors of growing old in the sexual marketplace. Even the economic details aren't far off--it's a nasty struggle to make it on your own in New York, and a lot of women seem to count on an \\"ATM\\" (see \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\") or rich boyfriend to make ends meet. As the years pass, this becomes less of an option, and all of us fear the modern version of the drudgery that Lily endures toward the end. A thought-provoking if somewhat depressing story, full of lavish period detail and Wharton's trademark precise and elegant prose. Read it and weep."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This was my first experience with Edith Wharton, and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing. She has a way with words that can make ugly things beautiful and beautiful things, like the life Lilly Bart lived, seem ugly. Her knack for description of people and places was spot on - you can really see the characters and imagine them going about their daily lives.The House of Mirth is the story of Lilly Bart, an aging socialite who has yet to marry and has little money with which to romp around in the high society with which she is obsessed. Most of the book is spent on her trials with failed attempts to snare a rich husband. In the process her name is muddied by frequent missteps and minute social faux paus. Her downfall is inevitable.I found Miss Bart repugnant and unsympathetic. Her problems in life were completely brought on herself, and yet she constantly blames her upbringing. The fact that she was cognizant of her pitfalls but continues to ignore them is something I deem worse than those around her who didn't se the illusion of their \\"glorious\\" lifestyle.I think the following paragraph shows both the beauty of Wharton's writing and the dinginess and incorrigibleness of Lilly Bart:\\"She could not hold herelf much to blame for [her] ineffectiveness, and she was perhaps les to blame than she believed. Inherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the highly specialized product she was: an organism as helpless out of its narrow range as the sea-anemone torn from the rock. She had been fashioned to adorn and delight; to what other end does nature round the rose leaf and paint the hummingbird's breast? And was it her fault that the purely decorative mission is less easily and harmoniously fulfilled among social beings than in the world of nature? That it is apt to be hampered by material necessities or complicated by moral scruples?\\"Lilly Bart is objectified by society and objectifies herself to keep up the image. Even when moments break through for her to be herself and be a real woman, she shuns them and hides behind decorum and manners. Sure, that was how it was when she lived, but that doesn't mean that we have to think that it's right.Which is a testament to Edith Wharton's writing that I enjoyed the narrative and turns of phrase so much despite wholly disliking the \\"protagonist\\"."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth, published in 1905, is Edith Wharton's first major work of fiction, and it established her reputation as a brilliant novelist and harsh critic of her society. Because I came to it after reading The Age of Innocence, which shows Wharton at the height of her power, I can't help giving Mirth four stars, where Innocence rated five.Mirth is an excellent novel, finely crafted, beautifully written and alive with Wharton's darkly humorous outlook. Wharton writes of the world she lived in, among the wealthy elite of turn-of-the-twentieth-century New York City, and her characters are frighteningly real: flawed and damaged, the best of them sometimes unsure how to act or whom to trust, and the worst... Oh God, the worst of them are as unspeakably horrible as the idle rich of any time and place.So why the lower rating? Mirth is, for me, the lesser work because of its extremes. Where Innocence relied on a more nuanced look at its characters and central situation, Mirth follows the formula of many writers' early works, with too much \\"goodness\\" on the side of its protagonist, and too much unrelieved wickedness on the other side.Lily Bart, the unmarried, beautiful, twenty-nine-year-old woman at the center of the story, who has been brought up to be merely an \\"ornament\\" in her world, not a worker or contributor, is emotionally incapable of marrying without love or, as the story progresses, unwilling to sink to the level of her abusers, to use blackmail to regain her lost position in the world. The degree to which she grows in self-knowledge is remarkable, and her ethical restraint, while suffering the worst reversals of poverty and ostracism, is not always believable.Part of what made Innocence such an enjoyable story was its \\"historical\\" aspect, the way Wharton contrasted the limited, blinkered world of the 1870s with the freer, more sophisticated world of 1900, when that story ends. In Mirth, we see the other side of that \\"modern\\" freedom, and what it means for women who are alone in the world, without family or close friends to protect or guide them. For Lily, it's an unrelenting downward spiral, and it's a heartbreaking read.I've noticed, as often with stories like this, some readers' contempt for Lily as someone who makes \\"stupid\\" choices. And I've often wondered what makes these readers think they would have done any better, assuming they were products of that same time and place, and did not have their hundred-years' worth of twenty-twenty hindsight. For me, my sympathy for Lily makes reading about her downfall too painful to be enjoyable, despite Wharton's engaging writing style. Lily sabotages all her near successes, precisely because she has too much intelligence and \\"sensibility,\\" in the Jane Austen meaning, to marry without love, to spend the next forty years tied to a man she can't respect.The comparison with Austen is apt, because Wharton's writing is Austen without the gloss of two centuries of cultural change, the separation of the Atlantic Ocean, or a \\"quaint\\" country setting. It's New York City, not Netherfield, and it has this city's unabashed brutality. I was astonished at how similar the NYC of 1900 was to the city I grew up in and still inhabit. Austen's world is every bit as tough, but we don't always see it, because we're too easily lulled by her elegant, eighteenth-century manner to feel the stiletto blade until it pierces our heart. Wharton carries her cavalry saber unconcealed, and we (at least I do) sometimes shrink from its slashing force, dreading the inevitable bloody end.As Lily destroys one chance after another for herself, I found myself wishing that she would use the means at hand to defeat or at least control her female enemy, and not worry about hurting the man she loves in the process. In Wharton's world, as in Austen's, it's the women who pay the price for sexual indiscretions, gambling losses and other misbehavior, no matter who commits the actual sins. When one minor character, a silly young man, gambles away his fortune, it's his two unmarried sisters who are reduced to shabby spinsterhood, trying to earn a living, a mode of existence for which they are woefully unprepared. \\"Miss Jane reads aloud very nicely--but it's so hard to find anyone who is willing to be read to.\\"Wharton writes with the kind of magical style that draws a reader in no matter what. Even if we know the story from having seen the movie version(s); even if we aren't happy about how it ends; even if we find some of the extreme duality of good and bad characters a little tedious--still, we want to spend time with this narrator. Like Jonathan Franzen, another author with this specific talent, Wharton can tell us any story she chooses, about any characters, and most readers will only say, \\"More, please.\\"On that level alone, Wharton's work deserves five stars, but what I'm doing here is ranking her against herself, not everybody else.At the end of The Age of Innocence, I felt that it was a perfect work of art, the final scenes just right; a somewhat ambiguous, sad but not tragic ending that was the only acceptable resolution for the main characters. Mirth, by contrast, leaves most readers dissatisfied. \\"No,\\" we think, \\"that can't be right.\\" It's an argument in Wharton's favor that her ending is in many ways more realistic than the happier one most of us wish for. People do kill themselves, not literally by suicide, but by making one misstep after another, until they reach a place where death is the only possibility.Wharton's only \\"mistake\\" is in allowing us to see each of her heroine's missteps all too clearly, and with no way of turning her in a different direction. Perhaps this book deserves five stars after all."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton is at her best skewering the upper class of snobs and bores while her characters are so blatantly drawn to them. Wharton explores this upper realm through her tragic heroine, Lily Bart, who sorely wants to be an ornament to the super wealthy while knowing that they will never engage her mentally, along with the understanding that she could be cast aside the moment she no longer proves to be an \\"entertainment\\" to their egos and vanity. After a series of mistakes engendered by her own desire for acceptance, Lily quickly slips from favor and becomes a liability. In her downfall she discovers her true nature and the challenges of a more humble existence worsened by her exposure to an excessive lifestyle, and especially by the limited choices offered to a woman whose only skill was being \\"ornamental.\\" What seems especially tragic is that one hundred years later, this world populated by hangers-on aspiring to the Olympus of the rich has not changed one iota, giving this classic meaning for the modern audience."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"New York in the Gilded Age provides the backdrop for one of literature's most complex and tragic heriones: Miss Lily Bart. The beautiful Miss Bart is an impoverished but genteel young woman, trying to keep up appearances until she can make a suitable (and wealthy) marriage. For Miss Bart knows that only money can buy the luxury and beauty her spirit craves. To her, sumptuous surroundings and elegant clothes are not merely acquisitions, but oxygen for her ethereal soul. Ironically, this very soul consistently clashes with the mercenary arts required to achieve great wealth. The hunt for money degrades and depresses the imaginative Miss Bart, leading her to forgo several offers of marriage. As one character puts it: \\"Because, at heart, she despises the things she's trying for.\\" As her youth slips by, desperation emerges in Miss Bart, leading to compromising situations and ultimately social fall.Edith Warton has created a complex, contradictory character in Miss Bart, but one who is ultimately very human and able to evoke our continuing hope and empathy. The surrounding cast of superficial, self-interested society people are just as masterfully painted. The prose is laden with description and emotion. House of Mirth is a masterpiece, the literary equivalent of a Dutch Master still life painting; there are rich, dark colours, carefully arranged detail and above all, sheer beauty."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I have a hard time deciding which Edith Wharton book I like best, but of the ones I have read, this one was definitely the most ponderous. It was less \\"chick-lit\\" than, say, Age of Innocence (the interactions between Lawrence Selden and Lily Bart were limited), but it also was more thoughtful in the sense that it considers issues of women's rights, as limited by financial freedoms. The plot of the novel can even be applied to Darwinian notions of survival of the fittest - Lily is shaped from her childhood for one end only, and that is to endlessly entertain society; yet her internal character and morality forbid her from \\"playing\\" society in the same ways as many of her fellows, which results in her expulsion from society. Her expulsion renders all her charms useless, as she finds herself unfit for anything besides entertainment.At any rate, good read, definitely a Wharton classic. : )"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I cannot comment on this particular edition, but felt compelled to review the novel anyway, in the hope that others will read it.I didn't think I would feel sympathy for Lily, but I don't think I've ever wanted to help a character in any novel as much as I wanted to save Lily. I didn't exactly fall in love with her; frankly she is not my cup of tea. But I desperately wanted to see her happy.For days I was affected by the end. I was very, very moved.That said, I do not accept Edith Wharton's sense of determinism; nor do I accept the basic plot, with its scarcity of men. Lily is the most beautiful woman in New York and there are only two or three obnoxious men she can choose from? I found that hard to swallow. I also found it difficult to accept that (even for an unaccomplished woman) it was either a life of frivolity with the rich set, or a life of impoverished loneliness. Even in 1905 there were more alternatives. Lily, for example, could have learned her lesson that the rich were leading shallow lives, and still have found happiness on a lower social scale with a hard working doctor, or a military officer, etc. She also could have left New York and struck out West.I love the writing of Edith Wharton. And I've read most of her works.

Winning men novels include Nicole Diver in Tender is the Night, Isabel Archer ofThe Portrait of a Lady, Elizabeth Bennett ofPride and Prejudice, and Verena Tarrant ofThe Bostonians. All classics. All wonderful stories following the path of fairy tales.This book is amid the untamed and undeveloped New York City where it was magnificently rustic. \\"The path wound across a meadow with scattered trees; then it dipped into a lane plumed with asters and purpling sprays of bramble, whence, through the light quiver of ash-leaves, the country unrolled itself in pastoral distances.\\" But this wonderland becomes grotesque when one encounters the social intermingling occurring within the confines of the best homes.In this novel, instead of bequeathing the young maiden the comforts and gifts of the adored wealthy, the beautiful Lily Bart encounters bitter reality and is ostracized for acts committed by anyone but she.Wharton grew up among the posh and circumstance of New York wealth at the turn of the century. And with her inquisitive mind, she digested and comprehended the thinly veneered characters whose deceit to one another could scar like acid their best friends of society. This novel shows exactly how easily such distasteful activity thrust horrible conclusions upon those least able to defend themselves. \\"[T]ake them [the rich] into another element and see how they squirm and gasp.\\"Pretense of wealth is financially exhausting. \\"You think we live on the rich rather than with them: and so we do, in a sense - but it's a privilege we have to pay for! We eat their dinners, and drink their wine, and smoke their cigarettes, and use their carriages and their opera boxes and their private cars - yes, but there's a tax to pay on every one of those luxuries. . . \\" The expense is clothing, losing money in cards and more. Much more than poor Lily could afford.In attempting to find husband, Lily fails. Maybe because she was not willing to accept less than a premier mate: \\". . . she works like a slave preparing the ground and sowing her seed; but the day she ought to be reaping the harvest she over-sleeps herself or goes off on a picnic.\\"Unlike its peer classics, this novel shrugs off the Cinderella ending by renouncing resolution through romantic fantasy-like betrothal. In fact, in a novel complete with many couples and many marriages, the only happy marriage is that of abused (by her wealthy employer) middle class Netty to a common man. It is a wonder how society of Wharton's time embraced a novel which criticized such a sacred institution.

Likewise you have extremes of masculinity and femininity; and PTSOML is as raw, intuitive, and visceral as THOM is sophisticated, elegant, and erudite. And while Iceberg Slim tries to use at least one esoteric slang word per page, Edith Wharton uses at least one high school \\"Honors English\\" level vocabulary word per page.Well that's interesting but I guess this is not much of a review so far. Basically THOM is a tragic Victorian novel set in very early 20th Century New York. It was a little difficult for me to relate to these spoiled American gentry - where do these people get their incomes from anyway? At one point the unthinkable happens - Lily Bart (our heroine) has to actually get a job! (And it gets worse from there, I'm afraid to say.)There were a couple of likable characters in the book (notably Lily and Selden) but overall I'd sum it up by stating that this 350 page book seemed more like 700 pages. The book did a tremendous job of transporting me to a different time and place, and presented a a unique world view through the eyes of Lily Bart. There are few things I don't understand about the novel, however - like how did it work out that Lily ended up owing all that money to Trenor when she thought it was a return on her investment? I missed something there.

I read the Kindle free version (thanks, Amazon) and there are some kinks with line breaks and extra ampersands but it does not detract from the power of the writing and story line. As one would expect from Wharton, this book is completely engrossing and an insight into 1890s New York society (and those who live on its edges). The heroine, beautiful Lily Bart, spirals downward as she makes one attempt after another to grasp what she wants - financial security - and we watch painfully as one opportunity after another eludes her. It is not easy to watch her stumble and there is always hope she will finally pull it off or that her true love Selden (though she barely realizes he loves her) hesitates to step in on many golden opportunities. You will come to love Lily and her valiant if misguided struggles and hope for a breakthrough. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Before I embark on a review of this work, it is necessary to say that the temptation to ascribe attitudes and present modes of thinking to classic works of literature is always present.When reading and digesting this most wonderful novel by American writer Edith Wharton, first published in 1905, the reader might be amazed to find herself thinking that, despite Lily Bart's considerable distance from her in time, social milieu, economic position and breeding, there's a little of Miss Bart in most modern women. The schemes Lily Bart almost engages in order to catch that elusive fish -namely, the wealthy man of society who will be able to keep her in her deserved place--are strangely familiar to those of the modern woman who sometimes feels must contrive and flatter and cajole the man she is with to make up his mind and settle down. The third wave of feminism still has not achieved the utopia of making men expendable to women, if ever.There's a major difference though: opposite modern woman, who has been brought up with the expectation of entering the work market in order to earn a living, be it as a single woman or as a married one, Lily Bart was raised and \\"cultivated\\" in the frivolous world of upper class New York at the turn of the twentieth century, where a woman's loftiest value resided in her capacity to attract the most eligible bachelor with her looks and sophisticated charm and grace, and was consequently barred from any form of dignified work to a woman with her kind of family connections and social stature. Bred for her ornamental value, Lily Bart must traverse the patrician ways of upper society in order to reach that most valued place in it. But, despite her obvious intelligence and charm and disposition, Lily definitely does not play by the rules. She lets herself get enmeshed in a most compromising position, when she enters into -what appears to her to be- a legitimate business transaction with a married man.There is also Lawrence Selden, an attorney who is secretly in love with Lily, and who enjoys a friendship with her but is not wealthy enough to aspire to marry her. Throughout, however, this friendship develops into an unspoken, undeclared connection, where neither is willing, or able, to admit the feelings each has for the other.When complications arise, as they always do, Lily must navigate the maelstrom of unwritten codes of conduct and rely on the kindness of friends and relatives, most of whom are more than willing to leave her adrift in her moment of direst need.We witness the downfall of Lily Bart in detail, and feel the descent into misery as if it were happening to us, or at least to one of our own.This is a minute study of the inner workings of upper New York society at the dawn of the 20th century and the story of one woman who dared to defy its conventions."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Classic lit is by far the best genre, they do not make books like they used too.

On a purely emotional level, the book is very tragic, sad and depressing. There is no hope, there is no happiness. Normally, that is reason enough for me warning someone off of a book but House of Mirth is an exception. Edith Wharton's novel is a must read for so many reasons. It is a must read as a critical examination of upper class politics, specifically late 19th century New York - but I believe that Wharton's portrayal of the upper crust has resonance for us now. House of Mirth is a must read as a critique of the role of women in the late 1800s and early 1900s, looking at their limited access to opportunities and the extreme negative impact of singularly grooming women as wives and holding that up as the apex of their lives.\\"Isn't marriage your vocation? Isn't it what you're all brought up for?\\"\\"I have tried hard - but life is difficult and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence.\\"And finally, this book is a must read when we consider failed opportunities and wonder if we should go for what we want, if we should tell people we love them.The main character in House of Mirth is Lily Bart. Lily Bart has been raised to believe her only value is her beauty and that her main goal should be in securing wealth. Her sole method to secure wealth is through marriage; to a woman during this time period and culture, there is no other way.\\"She was like a flower from which every bud had been nipped except the crowing blossom of her beauty.\\"Lily's family was wealthy but lost their money; eventually her parents died and Lily is left alone. She drifts from relative to relative, relying on their generosity to support her. And ever desperate to be in the upper portions of society, Lily befriends married women and is invited to parties, travels, and country homes; in exchange she assists the wealthy wives write thank you letters and plan parties. What is the fair exchange though? Lily is getting food, stay at luxurious locations, travel and presence at the best parties. The exchange is not fair because ultimately, Lily is giving up so much more; she is giving up her safety, her security and her emotional well-being. The wealthy and the married want Lily to be with them and at their parties due to her beauty, her wit and her ability to entertain - this talent is somehow a reflection on them. Lily is used as a toy and as a decoration.The story opens when Lily is 29 years old. She is still supremely beautiful and despite her desiring wealth and independence, the reader is informed through various conversations that Lily has had a number of suitable offers of marriage, but she continues to decline them or push the men away once they want her.\\"Sometimes I think it's just flightiness - and sometimes I think it's because, at heart, she despites the things she's trying for. And it's the difficulty of deciding that makes her such an interesting study.\\"What is clear that Lily is in a precarious situation; she seeks independence and has her own ideas of what she wants to do, but no power (or money) to do anything. Lily travels through social circles as if she was her own person, she makes plans on her own - and it is much mentioned that she acts like a married woman - but she does not have the protections of marriage. Lily is used not only as a toy at parties, but tools for couples, men, women to accomplish what society limits them from otherwise. Ending a marriage? Hiding their infidelities? Attempting an affair with a much younger and beautiful woman? Lily is alone, without protection from parents or a spouse and thus vulnerable to people who want to use her. House of Mirth describes in detail of the horrible things that can happen to a girl without choices and protection.How Lily is controlled is through the threat of scandal; the scandal being physical relations with me - unmarried women were not supposed to have physical relations or lure married men into having physical relations with them. However, the irony is not missing - Lily's entire value is her physical appearance, her beauty and her allure to men which ultimately equates to her physically desirability.\\"When a girl's as good-looking as that she'd better marry; then no questions are asked. There is no provision as yet for the young woman who claims the privileges of marriage without assuming the obligations.\\"\\"If I were shabby no one would have me: a woman is asked out as much for her clothes as for herself.\\"\\"What is truth? Where a woman is concerned, it's story that's easiest to believe. In this case, it's a great deal easier to believe [the scandal] .\\"At several points in the story, Lily's dire situation - one decorated with fancy clothes and that leave her staying in yachts and fine hotels -- is contrasted with working class women who are suffering. Wharton employs these scenes with a dual purpose; we see that despite Lily's complaining and worries others suffer much more than her. But interestingly, while these working class women are not beautiful or fashionable and it is obvious they are tired and over worked - they have several things that Lily does not. They have family, they have love, and they have some limited ability to earn an income. Although, each of the working class women Lily encounters - their lives rotate and turn on the men in their lives. We first meet a maid in a desperate situation because her husband was turned out of his job. We next meet a young working class mother who was not a virgin when her husband agreed to marry her, but thanks to a loving man - he married her anyway. So despite their \\"success\\" and their resources, lower class women were still subject to similar limitations and standards.It is so interesting for me to think that this book was written contemporaneous to the time it was describing. Even more interesting, Edith Wharton came from a wealthy family and she ultimately divorced her husband. It is curious to think how much pressure Ms. Wharton experienced herself or witnessed. We now know that the early 1900s and late 1800s brought much change to society and suffering to various groups of people, so at first it seems hard to swallow or sympathize with such a jet setting crowd. Lily has quite a few faults. She was vain (how dare she understand her only value!), she was judgmental, and she was superficial. But did she have any other choice? This is what she was groomed for, raised for and even if she shirked it off, what else could she do? This book is very enjoyable and I highly recommend it. My one criticism is the descriptions and wordiness of the prose is not my thing, generally - but I was able to enjoy it.\\"It is less mortifying to believe one's self unpopular than insignificant, and vanity prefers to assume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness.\\""},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"\\"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth\\" says Ecclesiastes, the source of Edith Wharton's deceptive title. Mirth and mourning, the two masks over a theater stage; Wharton pays homage to both. Book One, just over half the length of this substantial novel, is a glittering social comedy played out in turn-of-the-century New York drawing rooms and the country retreats of the very rich. Though not rich herself, Miss Lily Bart is well connected, and her extraordinary beauty gives her easy access to these charmed circles, where wealthy men clamor for her attention. Raised to the expectation of making a brilliant match, it is now high time she did so, for she is already twenty-nine.The curtain rises on an even more extravagant setting for Book Two, the yachts and casinos of Monte Carlo. But its trajectory will take a tragic turn, as Lily will be forced to pay for some apparently trivial mistakes in the first part, and sink ever lower in the social scale. The fickle world of fashion was one that Wharton knew well because, like Lily, she had grown up on the fringes of it. Such people, she said, \\"always rest on an underpinning of wasted human possibilities\\"; Lily's story is at heart a tragedy of waste.Though Wharton ends the book perilously close to American moralizing realists such as Norris and Dreiser, for the first three quarters she occupies a brilliant territory somewhere between Trollope and Fitzgerald. You can easily imagine Trollope writing of one character's concern, in planning a dinner party for the local rector, \\"that no divorc&eacute;es were included, except those who had showed signs of penitence by being remarried to the very wealthy.\\" For this is a world of masks. So long as appearances are kept up, all sorts of adulteries and dodgy financial dealings may take place behind the scenes. For all her sophistication, Lily remains an innocent, condemned by society for things she has not done. She will be brought down because another woman's willingness to lie is greater than her own to tell a truth that would harm someone else.Yet some of the blame must still attach to her. At the very beginning of the book, she bumps into a good friend, Lawrence Selden, a bachelor lawyer who moves occasionally in similar circles, and makes the mistake of taking tea alone in his rooms -- a mistake that unfortunately has been observed. It is a social blunder rather than a moral one, yet propriety is everything in a world of appearances. The true moral crux is that there is clearly love between Lily and Selden, and she repeatedly postpones it. High society and the pursuit of wealth mean too much. Whether this is her own failing or the product of her upbringing is almost irrelevant; when the mask is more important than the person behind it, even the most glittering of comedies will turn to tragedy."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I can't add anything to the reviews about this stunning novel which has always been one of my American favorites--except to say that anyone who loves this book absolutely must read the new historical novel \\"Rosedale in Love,\\" which tells Wharton's story from the perspective of Simon Rosedale, a minor but pivotal character in \\"The House of Mirth.\\" It's a whole new take on Wharton and the Gilded Age, gorgeously imagined and told as if it had been written at the same time as \\"The House of Mirth.\\" It's got luscious prose and images, fascinating characters, and memorable romance:Rosedale In Love."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Wonderful tale of class distinction. The prose is easy to follow, and like Jane Austen, Wharton's work remains relevant down the years. I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Reading The House of Mirth is like watching an exquisite crystal glass slowly chip, then crack, then break, then shatter right before your eyes. It is the story of Lily Bart and, like most of Edith Wharton's books, is set in the upper-upper classes of New York City at the turn of the 20th century. It is not Wharton's settings that I am drawn to; upper class Old New York, with its superficiality, preoccupation with wealth and status, and its strictly-proscribed social behaviors, is a world so foreign to my own that it's almost like reading about life on Mars. It was the world Edith Wharton inhabited, and yet her exquisite but brutal honesty in portraying it is evidence that she wasn't enamored of it, either.What draws me to Edith Wharton's books are two things. First of all, her ability to probe the frailties of her characters and tap into the universal human themes of love, hate, jealousy, loneliness, revenge, etc. etc. is among the most skilled of any writer I have ever read. In Lily Bart, in particular, she created a heroine that I identified and empathized with from the first page. Her struggles, her desires, and her missteps resonated with me as few literary heroines have. I felt almost as though I were reading about myself, had I lived during the place and time of The House of Mirth.Secondly, I am drawn to Edith Wharton's books because they are bittersweet (even tragic, as in the case of The House of Mirth) tales. I much prefer such books to those with syrupy, happily-ever-after endings, although I admit I couldn't make a steady diet of them (too depressing). As I alluded to in my opening analogy of the shattering crystal glass, The House of Mirth is a tale of the slow, gradual destruction of Lily Bart. She is a young woman who simply wants the life of comfort, ease and affluence which she was raised and trained for. The story opens when she is 29 and unhappily still unmarried at that ripe old age, in spite of her significant beauty and charm. However, as the story progresses the reader realizes that it is largely Lily's own fault that she is still single, and with financial constraints looming larger and larger over her. Yes, she wants a life of wealth and ease, but she also wants a marriage based on true love and compatibility; it is her inability to reconcile these two (and perhaps it was impossible to reconcile them in the world in which she lived) that has sabotaged every opportunity she has had. She has ruined (and continues to ruin throughout the story) every opportunity for marriage to wealth because she wasn't attracted to the suitor; she ruins her opportunity for marriage to a true soulmate because such a marriage would have lacked the financial security she wanted. What makes it particularly tragic is that Lily frequently has periods of clear-sightedness where she sees the mistakes she has made, but they always come too late after the damage has been done.Finally, it is society itself that destroys Lily, with its slavish devotion to wealth and status and those who possess such. Lily's friends -- one in particular -- use her for their own purposes and then discard her. And although the rest of society knows, or least suspects, Lily's innocence, the woman who has scorned her is such a holder of wealth and status and power that the rest of society follows her lead, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to Lily's fate.If you like happy tales then you probably won't like Edith Wharton's works. However, I find myself captivated by her skillful prose. Her language is formal and somewhat complex; I often had to re-read a passage in order to get it. But in The House of Mirth Edith Wharton once again probes into the timeless frailties that lie at the core of humanity, regardless of our era or geography. It is a tragedy painted in beautiful colors by a master artist."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Written in 1905, this novel brought me into the world of New York society at that time. Edith Wharton lived in this world and her writing dissected its pomp with a sharp discerning eye. The people she writes about own country houses where the party never stops. They travel abroad for months at a time. Their clothes are of the finest quality. And the only possible career for a woman is to marry a rich man.We first meet Lily Bart at the age of 29. She has been trained from childhood in all the social graces. Unfortunately for her though, her father lost all his money when she was 12 years old and both her parents died soon after that. As she was beautiful, she assumed that her looks, quick wit and personality would attract a wealthy husband, and, indeed she did attract them. But in her youth she turned down several suitors and was now aware that time was no longer on her side; she needed to marry before she lost her looks.She has her eyes set on Percy Gryce, a dull man who will be at a party in a country home and she flirts in such a way that he is soon smitten. He is desirable for his money but he bores her to death. But this romance never works out.There is another man of course. His name is Lawrence Selden. He is a lawyer and lives a nice life but doesn't have the wealth she thinks she requires. They become friends and it is clear to the reader that they are in love. She still keeps looking for a wealthy man though and makes one mistake after another. Even though she remains chaste, she gets into some compromising situations. There is a lot of gossip and her rich women friends either turn on her or drop her.Her prospects get dimmer and dimmer and she even considers marrying a rich Jewish man who she had once turned down, but even he rejects her. At one point Lawrence Selden tries to help her but she rejects him too. She's penniless and has no prospects. She is living in a boarding house and trying to work in a milliner's shop but even the spangles she sews on the hats are crooked and she soon loses that job. This novel ends in tragedy.Lily Bart is a great character. She symbolizes the reality of New York society. She also is very human and deeply flawed and even though there were times she annoyed me tremendously, I could also sympathize with her. As a New Yorker myself, I enjoyed the setting as I am very familiar with the streets and the history. This is a really fine book."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is an unusually good book with the familiar theme of the life of a single woman in times past. Lily Bart is an extremely beautiful but relatively poor woman who is starting to get older and is still unmarried. In this era, a woman's only hope for survival was to marry a wealthy man and only the most decorative types could hope for this. Lily,who counts on her beauty to get her what she wants, longs not only for a man with wealth, but also wants one who pleases her personality wise and in appearance as well. Her desire to have it all in an era when women were at mens' mercy proves to be her undoing. Financial debt, betrayal by both male and female \\"friends\\", and the hypocrital mores of the upper class society back then prove to be Lily's undoing. Selden, the one man she truly loves but won't marry because he is poor also eventually turns his back on her when false rumors about her and a married man surface. Lily finds herself alone, poor, and forced to work for a living.Lily is a study in contrast-beautiful in appearance but with a shallow personality; intelligent but greedy; inclined to rich upper class snobbery, but herself rather poor; lacking good judgement, but blaming everybody else for her problems; convinced of being taken advantage of while seeking to take advantage of others; and lastly, likeable yet unlikeable, a strange mixture.The book is well written although somewhat verbose, but not overly so. I enjoyed it much more than others of its type, namely Jane Austin novels. Recommended."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"A decent novel for a decent price.

Both her parents have passed away leaving her with little income. She resides with her Aunt and lives way beyond her means. As a child she was part of high society and even though truthfully she cannot afford this life anymore she is opposed to dinginess and cannot think of living any other way. Thus she faces the task of marrying one of the non-desirable eligible bachelors in her social circles or not marrying, not being able to keep up her lifestyle and having to join a lower social circle.This book was truly refreshing.

Hence begins the story of Lily Bart, raised from birth with no other purpose in life than to be a beautiful ornament to society. Lily is left with little money of her own and must rely on family and friends until she can make an advantageous marriage. Unfortunately, she makes some poor choices in life which diminish her social status, which eventually leads her to attempts to eke out a living among the working class.Wharton, who grew up in this same environment, pulls no punches. We see both the glamour and richness of late 19th century New York society, along with it's evil underside. Wharton's prose is glorious, but you have to pay attention and not wander or you'll end up back tracking and reading that paragraph again so as not to miss the story, you want to slow down and enjoy it like a fine red wine or a box of chocolate (or both). If you enjoy classic literature with a soap opera melodramatic tone to it (like Hardy's Tess), this should be right up your alley. So many times Lily and Seldon missed their opportunity for happiness!

Wharton exposes not only the frivolous society of her time, she exposes the tragedy of women who were raise without any sense of self-preservation and self-reliance. Lily Bart cannot live in a world deprived of opulence, and must be mercenary to attain what she desires most. Wharton's work is perceived as lengthy at times; however What the reader must realize throughout the story is that Wharton was alluding against her own society's upbringing of women."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"It's a little bit distressing in the result.The woman Miss Lily Bart is the hero in her own world ofsocial prejudices about her role in society.It is well written and reminds one at the end of Crane's Maggie.We get an anthropological study of woman in New York society in the very early 20th century.The flapper of the 20's was a reaction to this sort ofmoral decay."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth is Wharton's best. Lily Bart who is poor, pure and honest, bred to be a socialite was doomed amongst the rich and mighty, the hypocrite, her frinds and benefactors.

True, some aspects of the book might be dated, but the idea that there might be something transcendent beyond the daily facade of ordinary life--and people's striving for it--is still as relevant today as it ever was. And the thought that maybe there is no such transcendence, that Lily fell not because she was unlucky but because the &quot;perfection&quot; she was searching for or represented was only ever an illusion, can still bring tears to my eyes. (Sorry this is somewhat incoherent.)"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"My book club chose this as our selection this month. I enjoyed the book much more than I expected. Edith Wharton's writing style is descriptive and she clearly depicts the life and times of the &quot;upper crust&quot; at the start of the last century. The House of Mirth shows what a &quot;business&quot; it was for a woman to find a husband and the expectation that her marriage would be her security during that era. Lily was a great character but I did find myself feeling sorry for her the more I got into the book. She tried so hard to be accepted by society and in the end she failed. An interesting piece of literature. I would recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"As you go through passage after passage of this book, you get a sense that you are standing right there, on a corner of a drawing room watching the scene as it unfolds. At other times, you are inside a character's head. Only great writers can have such strength of prose to impart these emotions. As for the subject, it was hard to see someone spiraling down at the inevitable end. At the conclusion of the book, I sighed with the profound sense of loss and said to my stupefied husband: Lily Bart died! He assumed I meant a long lost friend. That's how Wharton makes you feel this character.I have also read the Age of Innocence and while quite good, it does not compare with the House of Mirth in terms of depth of prose and emotion."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton is the most prolific and poetic novelist of all time (in my opinion). Her vocabulary is so extensive you'll need to keep a dictionary by your side! After watching the movie \\"The Age of Innocence\\" I became intrigued with Edith Wharton and decided to read one of her books. \\"The House of Mirth\\" was my first read. I was completely blown away with Wharton's writing style and how she pulled me into that era of time & period of aristocracy. Wharton's narrative of the early 1900's is like watching an artist paint a work of art on canvas. She gives you a close look into Old New York, brownstones, elegant invitational-only parties, socialites and their secret scandals and infidelities. Wharton slowly seduced me into the world and life of 'Lily Bart', a person whose desires conflicted with high societal norms. You find yourself empathetic toward the protagonist plight of having to choose between her desires to live a life of simplistic love or choosing to live a life in luxury that she craved; a lifestyle ruled by the upper-class. Wharton's story exposes the reader to the upper class snobbery, their arrogance, treachery, scandalous secrets, and as in Lily Bart's case, women's desperation to maintain social standing and the things they do to get there. I've since read Edith Wharton's \\"Ethan Fromm\\" and I am currently reading Wharton's \\"The Custom of the Country\\" - both are equally intoxicating novels."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The quality of Wharton's writing is what 'pulled me through' this novel. The plot is a weak strand of forlorn events that conspire to drag the protagonist, Lily Bart, into the dredges of poverty. Wharton's realism and characterizations are impeccable - there are few writers that have such command of their craft. There are few likable characters in this novel, and this may be why I often lifted this book with a certain disdain. Wharton is a deterministic writer, and she leaves little room for humor or hope in this novel.At times, the prose was very dense and I found myself rereading certain passages to understand Wharton's entire sentiment. You will take many notes while reading this book - Edith Wharton has a way of explaining human nature that is awe inspiring and empathetic.At the end of the day, I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Edith Wharton or early 20th century fiction. If it's gripping plot and action you want - look elsewhere. Wharton's prose is fragile and ornamental and should be read with careful attention."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"One of Wharton's greatest gifts is making her characters seem so alive, and of getting the reader involved with their thoughts and feelings. She is great at describing the psychological processes of her heroine, Lilly Bart, who is compelling as a woman trying to find her way in a society that she both covets and finds superficial. Reading the novel, I could feel what Lilly was feeling, and her thought process made perfect sense from my perspective, I was so involved in her story that I could not put the book down. The narrative is flawless from beginning to end, Wharton having the gift of being romantic without being sentimental (a very hard task for woman writers) and she delivers a wonderful story. The ending made me cry, and I appreciate its realism and it caught me by surprise, Wharton is definitely one to cater to romantic whims or the idealistic desires of her readers."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I just sort of stumbled upon this book recently: the price was right -- $3.00 from Dover! I was not expecting much, although I like Wharton. The subject matter seemed unpromising: the hedonistic rich and their hangers-on. But the quality of the writing kept me going, and the character of Lily Bart was intriguing. By the time I was finished, I was moved enough to do something I rarely do: start over at the beginning. This time the book opened up for me with increasing pleasure and, indeed, awe. How a mere mortal is able to write with such authority about so many facets of life, fabricate a hugely complex social tapestry while all the while keeping the story moving, and create a flawed but achingly noble and sympathetic character out of mere words on a page - is beyond me. So I just indulged. Here is the case study par excellence of inexorable fate determined by upbringing, character, and circumstances. Lily Bart is perhaps the most exquisitely drawn character in all of literature, and her memory will stay with me forever.(By the way, Wharton's more well-known book, The Age of Innocence, cannot hold a candle to this one, in my opinion.)There is, however, one fly in the ointment ... and one that is found frequently in great literature, alas. The book is blatantly anti-Semitic. One of the main characters is Simon Rosedale, who is slimy like so many others in Lily's circle but who has the distinction of being described several times as representative of his \\"race.\\" For example:\\"He had his race's accuracy in the appraisal of values, and to be seen walking down the platform at the crowded afternoon hour in the company of Miss Lily Bart would have been money in his pocket, as he might himself have phrased it.\\" (bk 1, ch. 2)\\"Rosedale, with that mixture of artistic sensibility and business astuteness which characterizes his race ...\\" (bk 1, ch. 2)\\"He knew he should have to go slowly, and the instincts of his race fitted him to suffer rebuffs and put up with delays.\\" (bk 1, ch 11)The book in fact adopts an exceedingly conflicted view of this fellow. For Wharton attributes some very touching qualities to this man, such that he turns out to be one of the few sympathetic figures in the book. On the other hand, there is the definite suggestion that Rosedale represents the utter depths to which Lily may have to descend in order to maintain the style of life she seems to require. That would be fine (plot-wise) if Rosedale were portrayed simply as an individual or even as a type. But ... as typical of his race? Hmm. Rosedale emits some quality that causes almost visceral disgust in Lily (and her set), even when she can recognize his kindly features; yet that quality is simply to be understood rather than defined, probably because it is little more than the subjective projection of society's prejudice."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"It took me all of my adult life to get around to reading this book, and I am glad I finally did, even though it was a terribly depressing story. Wharton's stunning, if dramatic, portrayal of Lily Bart's downfall was well-written and authentic. It was a critical social commentary on the lives and morals of the wealthy of that era....how they lived and schemed, their manipulations and gossiping, and how they can bring someone down.Lily is 29, unmarried, with no money, dependent on others to provide her with a roof over her head. I think Wharton makes the reader feel Lily's increasing panic as her life get worse and worse, as her efforts to keep her head above water get more and more difficult."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton was awarded a Pulitzer prize for a reason.

Lily is an ambiguous figure. On one hand, she is spoiled and has an air of entitlement about her. She is determined to marry a rich man, she sometimes enters into questionable deals to improve her situation, she takes advantage of people around her. On the other hand, Lily unwittingly craves love, understanding, and closeness and thus sabotages numerous advantageous matches. She is manipulative, but unable to commit any serious moral sins, even to safe her own reputation and future prospects. As Lily's story progresses, after several errors in judgment, she finds herself disinherited and ostracized by people who just several months before fought for her attention. She gradually meets her downfall.\\"The House of Mirth\\" is definitely the most tragic and my favorite of Wharton's novels. This book is filled with a feeling of impending doom and leaves you with a lasting impression. Highly recommended to all fans of classical literature."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"America and Europe of the 1800s were stiff, gilded, formal place, full of \\"old\\" families, rigid customs and social transgressions. Especially for women.And nobody chronicled them better than Edith Wharton, who spun exquisitely barbed novels out of the social clashes of the late nineteenth century. \\"The House of Mirth\\" is one of her darker stories, where scandals and lack of conformity trigger a tragic downward spiral for a vibrant woman.Like most not-so-rich women, Lily Bart is on the prowl for a marriage to keep her in luxury and affluent circles. What's more, she has a rapid intellect and striking looks, but she is also a habitual liar who defies society's strictures (she gambles and smokes). Her only friend is Lawrence Seldon, but she is determined not to marry for love alone.Unfortunately, her schemes and plans start to collapse -- her adoring suitors either aren't rich enough, or her independent spirit sends her off. Her desperation becomes even more intense as she finds herself in the thick of a scandal, spun up by a malicious society matron to cover up her own affair. With her reputation in ruins, Lily's life spirals down into a new life of unemployment, poverty, and the final tragedy.Edith Wharton always paid a lot of attention to a woman's restricted life in the Gilded Age, and how scandals, unconventionality and society's hypocrisy could ruin them. But \\"The House of Mirth\\" pays more attention to this than most -- it's a bleakly realistic story, unflinchingly showing Lily's slow descent into miserable loneliness.Despite that, Wharton's writing is pure flowering poetry with a knack for evocation (\\"Her small pale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes\\"), and has a sensual quality with all the descriptions of silks, plants, soft light and luxurious mansions. And she vividly portrays the upper echelons of New York society at the time -- affairs, gossip and gilded salons -- as well as the restricted lives of womenBut Wharton is just as capable of describing the darker, sadder world that Lily falls into (\\"... blurred the gaunt roof-lines, threw a mauve veil over the discouraging perspective of the side streets\\"). Sedoesn't pull any punches with the tragic finale, which has a distinct air of inevitability about it -- no fairy-tale last-minute save by a Prince Charming.Lily starts out the book as a glimmering satellite of society, who can be rather selfish and cruel, but who nevertheless gains some sympathy because she just doesn't deserve everything that happens. The cruel, glittering society of the time had no room for women who stood outside the lines, and Lily's slow downward spiral is an illustration of this -- she's driven into miserable poverty and drug addiction.

How far women have come today, but how much also remains the same...."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Review of \\"The House Of Mirth\\"Stephanie GrumbacherEdith Wharton's classic, \\"The House of Mirth\\", while written well, was flawed in several ways. Wharton's over-dramatic tale of a social climbing girl who needed to grow up lacked emotion altogether. Lily Bart, who is considered a heroine in nineteenth century literature, drags on in unhappiness for 310 pages without ever stopping to think logically about her money or use of time, ending up poor and lonely. She is what women of 2004 would look down upon with disgust: fragile and weak. Yet the book pulls the reader in by trying to understand why Bart would do the things she does. The book becomes seemingly unbearable by Bart's actions, but addicting in a way that you want to see if Lily will come to her senses.What the novel lacks in description it makes up for in its accurate portrayal of high profile society in the 1800's. Socialites like Bertha Dorset, who used their popularity and \\"rank\\" to keep her hold on people. Simon Rosedale thought that his money could get him whatever he wanted, including Lily. As for the dynamic in Lawrence Seldon and Bart's relationship, it lacked depth altogether. It seemed Lily only had one love, that being herself. \\"The House of Mirth\\", while an interesting look into the past, was overly drawn out and almost painful to read at points."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Again Ms. Wharton satirizes the American social elite of the 'gay nineties'. Lily Bart reaches the age where she must get married to save her social status. Unfortunately for Lily she can not make the committment to forego love for convenience.Lily keeps her emotions for Jack Stepney in check even though she feels some spark. Lily's pride prevents her from finding happiness and leads to her ultimte undoing.The House of Mirth is better than The Age of Innocence."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Despite its title, this must be one of the least funny books I've ever read. I only got to page 32, realised that it was seriously deficient in laughs, flicked to the end, and found that it ends in much the same vein. I hope that if Wharton ever decides to reissue this book, she'll consider changing the title."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I have to say this was no easy read for me. I had a bit of a difficult time with the English. Edith Wharton writes in a way that makes things sound beautiful yes, but I wasn't always confident that I was comprehending the exact meaning she intended. The English is far from plain or direct, much like the communication between the characters she created.I found our protagonist Lily Bart to be shallow and vain and I had no sympathy for her and her situation in the beginning of the story. But as the story progressed I felt more and more for her plight and by the end I was saddened by the tragic course of Miss Bart's life.Edith Wharton has created quite the commentary on the life of rich socialites during the mid 1800s in New York City. I thought it was all very interesting: the egocentrism, the nasty back-stabbing, the rumor mills, how people were judged, the duties of the hangers on etc...And at times the attention to detail was a little too much for me. I thought the story was good but the emotions were muted by the language. I so appreciated Simon Rosedale who said what he meant as simply and directly as possible. It made for much less confusion about his intentions.There was a note in the back of the book about the movie The House of Mirth made in 2000. It wasn't until I had finished the book that I realized I had seen the movie.This was a book club choice and I think it will generate some very good discussions but I can't say I loved this book or would recommend it. I would tell you to watch the movie, I remember that was very moving.The book was moving too it just wasn't the most enjoyable book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I read House of Mirth a couple of months ago and I really enoyed it.

Still, I like to write about it myself, and Wharton's style is exquisite. Of course, it's also a feminist novel, in that it examines a woman's &quot;place&quot; in a society that did not allow her to earn her own living... women couldn't even have their own apartments in those times. Actually, a lot is still the same, psychologically, for women.END"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Someone once told me that readers like to read books where he or she can relate to the main character(s). I could not relate to Lily Bart's character. To me, it was written not as a book of leisurely reading,but as a book of lessons. The author, Edith Wharton, was demonstrating the evils of greed and that those who seek wealth are willing to give up their own morals to get it. The lessons given in the book were my only enjoyment. This is why I gave this literary piece a three. If I had spare time on my hands to read a book, it would not be this one. Thank you."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book for a long time, but found it totally lame. Why, exactly, am I supposed to identify or sympathize with Lily? I found her greedy and stupid and totally lacking in self control or basic common sense. I admit a century has passed between her life and mine, but her problems remind me of my contemporaries who have no money because they *spend* too much money. How is that heroic?Ironically, as she's whining about being relegated to second-tier society circles, she describes them as painters and actors and a crowd with a lot more character than her high society friends. Sounds like victory rather than chrisis, but Lily finds it dreadfully &quot;dingy&quot;. Boo Hoo. Get a grip Lily, millions of people live without money. Ultimately, it's not all that tragic."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth is a wonderful book for all people to read.

Hope you enjoy the book too! :)"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The readers that found House of Mirth frustrating and unappealing miss the boat. Real tragedy is often found more in those lives where the characters have options that they cannot see, i.e., where they could have &quot;controlled&quot; their life for a better outcome but, in fact, were paralyzed by inside or outside forces from doing so. Lily's life in a true tragedy."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I can't classify this book- not comedy, mystery, or romance like may Victorian tales. It's more a look into society in the 1900s and how social standing is everything. Girls in high society were raised with few skills, and the main character, Lily had one gift- she was pretty, when her money was gone she was able to live off her friends - for a while, until her poverty became obvious. Then she became a social leper, her friends avoided her as if they might catch what she had. What she didn't have was the skills to earn a living- this story traces the character's descent from being a &#34;must invite&#34; to the gentry's parties to drug addicted poverty. I found Lily to be frivolous and not always likable- she depended on her looks to support her in the lifestyle she aspired to and scoffed at many opportunities that could have prevented her downfall. Still, it is a book worth reading and closer to the reality of what life was like in those years."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Wonderful for the college student on a budget.

However it soon felt as though I was on a treadmill. As a result, after several tries, I stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through. BORING!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I didn't like this book, but I guess I didn't hate it - that's why it gets 3 stars.Wharton's dialogue between people is hard to sift through. I had the feeling like I wasn't always understanding what people were saying to each other. It's frustrating to not have any of the relationships terribly fleshed out and then to feel like you're not even getting the exchanges between them half the time. Maybe it was the writing style of the time...but I feel like other comparable novels from the same time period were a little bit plainer in text and more easily decipherable in meaning.The descriptions are nice, I will say that. But at times some of them seem very minute, and then other times like there are pieces missing in the situation that's happening before you. You will read all about nice details of a scene in Monte Carlo and then later on wonder how in the world Lily ended up in some place. I also feel like I read a fair amount about how important the clothes of characters were but the details of them weren't very elaborate. For someone who spent so much time with rich people, I didn't often get a very clear picture of what they looked like, and what their surroundings looked like, just their habits of entertainment. There were things here and there, but they weren't in abundance.I get that this is a period novel, it's supposed to discuss how important social circles and missteps in them were, and the intricate games of balance and power that went on. But I can't help but feel this book was a bit drab. The subject matter doesn't have to be limiting, but I felt it was here. The plot wasn't terribly exciting though through Wharton's writing it did leave me scratching my head about what would come next at times.I liked characters such as Gerty and Lawrence Selden, but I didn't care for the main character herself, Lily Bart. Lily is a pretty woman hanging around the rich and trying to make herself useful and amusing to them in order to continue vicariously living off their money and entertainment. She gets careless and then doesn't have the backbone to stand up and declare the rumors untrue. It seems like Lily spends so much time beguiling others and going through so much trouble (hanging out with people she doesn't really like and running up debts to keep up) and then keep wasting opportunity after opportunity. Why does she work so hard running herself into the ground and then squander every last opportunity?Lily just isn't the kind of character you like. She is shallow, and then blames her bad characteristics on her upbringing even though she knows better. She's the kind of girl who never takes responsibility for herself, never has a clear and worthy goal in life, isn't independent, and never allows herself to go after the things that are worthy that she wants.-----SPOILER-----Her death in the end is disappointing too. I'm not disappointed by a novel where everything doesn't work out nicely in the end, either. It's a suicide, but not really? She does it by accident, or she just doesn't care? It starts to say she thinks she can face tomorrow, and that she has plans to do something....I don't get it. Was that just the \\"warm fuzzies\\" feeling of death coming over her? Did she really feel that way? It's as if even her death, just like her life didn't mean anything. She didn't even have specific purpose in dying - a reason to kill herself or something - it just happened as a chance. And it leaves you wondering what the whole \\"word\\" thing was between Lily and Selden in the end. I just don't see the purpose in it."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This novel seeks to unmask what greed and desire can do to people, while commenting on society and its affect on women of the period."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"If you don't like it, just open the book in chapter 13, where Lily gets into the carriage.

Will someone please EXPLAIN?"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Was there ever a more spineless, worthless heroine than Lily Bart? Come on, even Aunt Pittypat has more backbone than she does. At the outset of Wharton's beautifully-written book, Lily is clearly already \\"on the shelf\\" at age 29 or so, and she is a proud, secure girl who makes her home with an aging relative. Lily makes a series of really stupid life choices throughout the bulk of the book, which make her relatives unhappy and then make her friends unhappy; they mostly ostracize her as a result, and she swans along, gently puzzled about these changes in her social fortunes. As her lifestyle declines (into a genteel sort of poverty) and she continues to wonder, all the way to the end of the book, I just wanted to throw it out of the window.Usually when you read a book, you become privy to knowledge and insights of the characters because the characters have drawn the conclusions in their own minds. The reader sort of follows along with the deductive processes of the character. Yet this book is written as though Wharton, and therefore we, have more insight into Lily's mind than she herself does. It's frustrating to read (though the writing is, as all of Wharton's books, elegant and evocative). I don't like Lily Bart, and I probably won't reread this book."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Published in 1905, The House of Mirth offers a blistering social commentary on the lifestyles and behavior of super-rich society. Having grown up in this society, Wharton evaluates it here as an insider, and her trenchant observations give this early novel a liveliness and verisimilitude not characteristic of \\"aristocratic\\" novels written by outsiders. Set at a time in which the old, moneyed aristocracy was being forced to admit newcomers who had made their recent fortunes through industry, the novel shows moneyed society in flux, the old guard ensuring their exclusivity against parvenus who are not the \\"right type,\\" at the same time that their sons and daughters were often securing large fortunes through marriage into some of these new families.Lily Bart, a beautiful young woman of good family whose father lost everything when she was only nineteen, is left dependent on wealthy relatives in this society until she can charm a financially secure suitor into marriage. At age twenty-nine, she is no longer a debutante, and the pressure is mounting for her to marry, though she lacks the unlimited financial resources of social rivals. Still, her wit and charm make her a delightful companion, and she is never at a loss for suitors. Intelligent enough to want a real marriage and not just a merger between families, she has resisted making a commitment to date, though the clock is ticking.As Lily tries to negotiate a good marriage and future for herself, she is aware that the competition is fierce. Women \\"friends\\" pounce on the latest gossip and spread rumors to discredit rivals, and Lily's reputation is tainted with hints of impropriety. Her opportunities for a good marriage begin to dwindle, and when her aunt, Mrs. Peniston, dies and leaves her a bequest that covers only her debts, Lily is no longer able to compete in the society so attractive to her and begins her downward spiral.Author Edith Wharton creates a complete picture of turn-of-the-century New York society and its \\"important\\" people--their lack of morality, their opportunism, their manipulations, and their smug self-importance, characteristics one may also see in Lily when she is part of this society. But Wharton also shows how quickly a woman may become an outcast when the money runs out and she is thrown on her own resources without any training for any other kind of life. A well-developed melodrama filled with revealing details, this novel established Wharton's reputation as a novelist/commentator on the manners and morals of high society and those who would participate in it. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's, The House of Mirth provides an intelligent portrayal of the \\"Gilded Age\\", reflected in the extravagant lifestyle of those daily participating in what was New York society. Readers are introduced to Lily Bart, a witty, smart and manipulative member of the higher class. After enduring serial tragedies in her life she finds herself in a financial predicament,unaccepted in her society. With the use of her beauty and charm, she adroitly finds her way back into the better side of economic wellness, seeping through the elegant faade of her surroundings. Her arrangements soon return to harm her instead of benefiting her.This novel is an extremely smart and eye-opening look into the daily aspects of women and men's roles during the turn of the century (1905). Marriage played an essential part of women's lives, while society condoned men never marrying. For women, marriage was a way of escaping financial ruin or social shame-men being their saviors. Lily Bart the lead character in this novel transcends society's views on female roles and leads a self-governing life while maintaining social accord. False relationships and soon failing economic arrangements drive Miss Bart into never-ending poverty. She finds herself struggling to support the extravagant demands that her lifestyle requires; yet that she so vehemently refuses to depart. Miss Lily Bart's strong love for \\"the finer things in life\\" eventually clouds her increasingly harsh days and rapidly deteriorates into oblivion."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"It is a strange society. Everybody is being watched, every single move, words; they dress code reveals a lot: women with big hats, men with fancy suits and top hats. This is the society they are trapped into. It is very hard to get into it, and easy to be dumped out of. This is the world where Edith Wharton's characters from \`The House of Mirth' inhabit: the early XX Century New York. Actually this is the world where Wharton herself lived in.Lily Bart is a marriageable orphan who is trying to marry a rich man. Her first victim is Percy Gryce, a very rich and insecure man, guided by his mother. When this attempt fails, her friendship with Laurence Selden almost leads to a match, but rumors of her being friends with married man, only brings her ruin and social exclusion. A series of unfortunate events --among them losing money in gambling-- and a very mean \`friend' called Bertha Dorset lead Lily to the ruin.More than anything, \`The House of Mirth' is a study of the social condition of the New Yorker wealthy women in the early XX century. Rather than being a heroine, Lily is a human being struggling with her problems. She is neither rich nor strong enough to be independent, so that marriage is the only way of keeping a comfortable life, unlikely man. Early in the novel, Lily and Selden are discussing marriages and she says that \`a girl must, a man may if he chooses'. This states clear the difference of men and women, the lack of freedom, and the way people have to live under the social establishment if they want to succeed.Writing as an insider --and so she was-- Wharton is able to give a faithful and acid view of that society. Inspired from a verse in the Bible, she titled the novel with a wonderful contradiction; there is neither a \`house', nor \`mirth' in the novel. They both are very abstract ideas that we get from the book.\`[Lily Bart was] so evidently the victim of the civilization which had produced here, that the links of her bracelet seemed line manacles chaining her to her fate'. I believe the writer felt this same way --maybe that's why she moved to Europe and lived there for many years. Personal connections to the book aside, Edith Wharton has written one of the best American books of the XX Century. Her prose is brilliant, and her story engaging."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Is victory in our culture reserved solely for small personal matters? Is its price always too high? Is its value negligible? This book, written in 1905, continually turns the smallest victories into major defeats. The House of Mirth is named after a passage in Ecclesiastes: &quot;The heart of the wise is in the house of morning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.&quot; I couldn't agree less. It galled me that this breathtakingly subtle book should end with what seems to me like a hammer blow to the human spirit. Well, only if one allows oneself an emotional response. If not, the novel ends with a literary parlor game. What is &quot;the word which made all clear&quot;? Cowardice? Money? Honor? Death? Defeat? Certainly not love -- that makes nothing clear. I was able to find only four things about The House of Mirth that would tell me it was not written by Henry James. Its range, which seems broader than anything James would attempt in a single work. Its linearity, its unbroken declining trajectory. Is anything James wrote so utterly tragic? So unrelentingly anti-capitalist? Strange that such a dour tale should be such a joy -- so enchanting -- to read...."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This book was an interesting glimpse into the lives of upper class New Yorkers in the early 1900s. There wasn't much action, and it went on just a little too long, but it was easy to see why this book caused controversy at the time of its original publication."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The author's writing style, as well as her subject matter, reminded me of Jane Austen. Perhaps it's simply something about older books, but I found the writing unusually formal. This definitely wasn't something that kept me from enjoying the writing though. I was still drawn into the plot, able to visualize the locations and feel for the characters. The only part of the writing I didn't like was the attention to social details required to understand all the plot points. Especially at the beginning, I sometimes felt sure I was missing something! This is a problem not with the author's writing (since she wrote for her contemporaries) but a problem of book version. And my book version (the penguin classics version), had unnecessary footnotes describing locations and a few useful word definitions but provided little social context.The characters were definitely intriguing, in part because their motivations were so entirely different from anything in my experience. I was always curious about what they might do next! What at the end kept me from liking this book more was that I often didn't like what they did next. I think I might have been able to like Lily even though she wanted to marry for money if she'd just seriously gone for it. Instead, her indecision ended up depriving her of a marriage for money or a marriage for love. Even worse, things frequently almost worked out and some little twist of fate caused everything to go wrong. Situations like that, where simple chance ruins everything, are one of my pet peeves in movies and books. They're just too frustrating! In this case, the book was good enough to keep me reading past all of the bits where things almost worked out in hopes it would get better. But when it ended on the same note, with a so very nearly happy ending, it left me feeling dissatisfied with the whole book. If you're ok with unhappy endings and don't share my hatred for cruel twists of fate, the book was well written enough that I'd recommend it much more highly."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This book is a thrift edition.

Her mistakes, her deflections, her obsession with obtaining great wealth through marriage but her seemingly endless rejection and fumbles of proposals struck me as somewhat maddening. Lily is someone who loves to play in an extremely expensive world without ever having to pay the price, except with her beautiful presence. What she does not seem to realize is the clock is ticking and she is fast running out of time. This is not to say Edith Warton left her void of admirable traits. We get to see Lily as a bit more human as New York high society grinds her down to a pulp due to her mistakes, innuendo and gossip. We soon discover how valuable honor is to Lily, even to a social system determined to forget her. It is tragedy in the most classical sense, but with an entertaining and modern twist as Lily evokes ambivilant feelings in the reader.I loved this book. Lily Bart is just the tip of the iceberg as far as characters and themes, I could discuss them at great length, but why bother? You should just read the book.

Edith Wharton is an extraordinary author, and her heroine of The House of Mirth, Lily Bart, is a wonderfully complex heroine. This sad tale of a woman's struggle against a future prescribed for her by society is made poignant by Lily's inability -- or is it unwillingness? -- to muster the courage to turn her feet away from the path paved in gold in order to find true happiness. As financial circumstances force her to take the first step toward ruin, she not only allows herself to be blinded to the truth of her situation, but impatiently takes the blindfold and ties it on firmly herself. She then begins her inevitable, painfully slow fall, touching but not grasping the hand Lawrence Selden holds out to save her. Selden does love her and does want to help her, but he wears his own blindfold, one created by him to save him from the extremes of life, even the extreme pleasure he would find in a life with Lily Bart. In the end, the fear that has kept them apart throughout the novel brings them together in a tragic end. This is a book that's extremely difficult to put down, and one you'll want to read again and again, always somehow in the hopes of a different ending for Lily and Lawrence."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is an incredibly well-written book, with great period detail.

Chapter12 of Book 2 of Edith Wharton's novel of high society New York at the turn of the 19th century, The House of Mirth, accomplishes just that. As the novel draws to a close and the book's leading character Lily Bart's troubles mount, she has one last chance to escape. She has some letters written by Bertha Dorset, a woman who has slandered her and led to her ostracism, which prove Bertha's infidelity. She takes up the letters intent on confronting Bertha with them and forcing her to restore Lily to the good graces of New York society. But on the way to Bertha's house she goes by the apartment of Lawrence Selden, a man also mentioned in the letters and with whom she has shared an emotional attachment, and stops in to see him. What happens in this moment is both the climax of the novel and, in my view, one of the most poignant and moving pieces of writing in literature.\\"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth\\" Ecclesiastes 7:4. In The House of Mirth Edith Wharton is describing what she regards as the worthlessness and frivolity of life among the rich at a particular place and point in time. As a member of that elite group herself, Wharton knew her subject quite well. But her view of this society is suspect, since she spent most of her life in France, pointedly staying away from it. In any case, the picture presented is somewhat like turning over a flat rock and seeing all the creepy things underneath. We are fascinated, but what we see we hardly find attractive.The central character in the book is Lily Bart, who at the start of the novel is 29 years old and unmarried. Lily is beautiful, charming and socially attractive. The problem is that she is poor--at least by her standards. With the death of her parents Lily takes up residence with her aunt, Julia Peniston. Aunt Julia is prim and proper and critical of Lily's seemingly risqu&eacute; behavior. Lily remains with her aunt because she has no other options and because she hopes to inherit her considerable fortune.At first the reader is likely to have difficulty sympathizing with Lily as she focuses her life on catching a rich husband so as to afford herself the opportunity to enjoy luxury. She rejects Lawrence Selden, a successful lawyer, despite the love she feels for him because he is not rich enough to give her the life she desires. Instead she initially opts for the very rich, but very boring, Percy Gryce. But just when it seems she is about to entrap Gryce she meets Selden and realizes the mistake marriage to Gryce would be. Here we begin to see Lily as she truly is, a person who despite her upbringing has a strong morality. But for much of the novel Lily continues to pursue gaining wealth through marriage. To do so she must keep up appearances. For example, at one point late in the book when her fortunes have declined considerably, she and her friend Gerty Farish, are having lunch in a fancy restaurant. Lily's circumstances have declined sharply, but as she notices several of her rich friends enter she says to her companion, \\"My dear Gerty, you wouldn't have me let the head waiter see that I've nothing to live on but Aunt Julia's legacy? Think of Grace Stepney's satisfaction if she came and found us lunching on cold mutton and tea! What sweet shall we have today, dear--Coupe Jacques or Peches a la Melba?\\"But later we come to understand Lily better. Gerty informs Selden, \\"You know how dependent she has always been on ease and luxury--how she has hated what was shabby and ugly and uncomfortable. She can't help it--she was brought up with those ideas, and has never been able to find her way out of them.\\" We also come to realize that Lily always does what is moral and right even at great personal cost to herself.Most of the other characters lack this quality. Some are just social butterflies, such as Judy Trenor, while others are more malicious, such as the Dorsets. George and Bertha. The philandering George lusts after Lily, giving her money under false pretenses in the hopes of seducing her. Bertha is even more viscous, slandering Lily when her own infidelity is threatened to be uncovered. There are some good characters in this lot. Gerty Farish, a woman devoted to charitable causes, befriends Lily and is constant despite Lily's growing difficulties. But for the most part one's reputation in this group is determined by money. At one point, when she is being persecuted by Bertha Dorset, Lily states that people will believe Bertha over herself because Bertha is rich.While the novel centers on Lily, Wharton is really commenting on the lifestyle of this class at this time in New York that she sees as in a state of crisis and transformation. A group of newly rich people is trying to break into the old money society. In the novel the Wellington Brys and,especially Simon Rosedale, represent this group. Rosedale has the added burden of being Jewish. He initially hopes to accomplish his aim by marrying Lily whose sophistication and background would enable him to ascend into high society, but she rejects this option. A year later when her fortunes have turned, she tells Rosedale that she is now ready to marry him, but he scoffs at the idea. He says that circumstances have changed--he is beginning to make inroads into New York society and Lily, having fallen out of it, would now be a hindrance to this objective. This constant striving for status and prestige at the expense of decency is at the heart of this novel. In the end Lily Bart is its most tragic victim."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Lawrence Selden was infatuated with Lily Bart. He couldn't help it. She was from a good family. She knew everyone. She was painfully beautiful. And special, yes, special: \\"He had a confused sense that she must have cost a great deal to make, that a great many dull and ugly people must, in some mysterious way, have been sacrificed to produce her.\\"What's wrong with Lily Bart? Just three things. Her family has lost its money. She's unmarried. And she's 29.Twenty nine and unmarried --- that's far from a tragedy today, though there's always some fool around to remind a single woman that her biological clock is ticking. But in 1903 to 1905, when Wharton was writing \\"The House of Mirth,\\" society --- that is, upper-class New York \\"Society\\" --- was remarkably judgmental about a woman in such a position. Particularly if she had lost her inheritance, as Lily has. Because, in that circumstance, she was prey to rich, married men who wanted to \\"help\\" her in exchange for the kind of thanks that permanently destroy a woman's reputation.That is the story of Wharton's first great novel: a woman fighting to make her way through a minefield, a Society more infatuated with hypocrisy than humanity. This is high-toned stuff, not raw material for popular fiction. But Wharton saw a way. \\"A frivolous society can acquire dramatic significance,\\" she explained, \\"only through what its frivolity destroys.\\"How modern this all is. Lily's beauty is \\"an asset.\\" Her character flaws are common ones: \\"The only problems she could not solve were those with which she was familiar.\\" And Selden --- do we not know at least one decent, intelligent, mild-mannered young man who could brighten the light in a woman's eyes if he weren't working so hard, if he could just stop being so damned decent?The reason \\"House of Mirth\\" is assigned in English class is because it is a brilliantly written dissection of a society we like to think has disappeared. But the reason to read it is because only the particulars have changed. The essential questions of the drama are as interesting now as they were compelling then: What will happen to Lily Bart? Will Selden rescue her? Or will rich married men ruin her? And if she is ruined, what will happen to her then?\\"House of Mirth\\" sold 100,000 copies in its first year --- equivalent to what a Grisham sells now. So don't think you'll pick it up to improve your mind. This is popular fiction at its best: a page-turner so good that, over time, it becomes a classic.

Somehow I managed to pass her by in high school and college and thought it was about time to right this wrong.In her writing, Edith Wharton is both poetic and pithy, piercing and languid, frivolous and heartbreaking. In essence, it is a flat-out stunning piece of work. The story, however, is hard (emotionally hard) to get through. The protagonist, Lily Bart, is deeply complex. Her astonishing beauty, natural grace, and wit have fixed her as the shining ornament of New York's most exclusive social set. Yet she has no family money and must rely on the condescension of her social friends; a role that does not wear well on her independent nature.Although she is a lover of luxury and the ease that wealth permits, Lily was not born with social fangs or a proclivity to self-advancement. This cruel and irreconcilable contradiction is one that wears on her throughout the entire novel. She is a complacent, yet sympathetically honorable, heroine who is difficult to fully love and understand.House of Mirth is a book of wisdom and even, perhaps, redemption. Although I'm sure some literary critics would take me to task for that statement. I recommend it as a book that deepens our understanding of this world and the enigmatic people who inhabit it."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's Lily Bart is as captivating now as she must have been 100 years ago. With only minor changes she could be dropped into the milieu of New York or Washington's fashionable people of 2005. The emptiness of what was called \\"society\\" in 1905 hasn't changed much, nor have its obsessions. It's still critical to be seen with the \\"right\\" people at the \\"right\\" places at the \\"right\\" time. Never have the dismal effects of social striving been captured so well as by Wharton in \\"House of Mirth\\".My only criticism would be that Lily Bart, in her time of desperation toward the end, doesn't act in a way consistent with a truly desperate woman who is both intelligent and beautiful. To her, the way out of her woes is help, either financial or emotional, from a man. So it does not seem reasonable for her to reject more than one offer of help from each of two men, Rosedale and Selden. A drowning person does not turn away from an extended life preserver, whatever her feelings about the person extending it. On Skid Row, the basic instinct for self preservation would have led her to marry either for money (Rosedale), or for love (Selden); it's inconceivable that her qualms would lead her to choose laudanum and poverty over both of them.I listened to a performance of this novel on CD by Anna Fields, and it was indeed a performance, not just a reading. Ms. Fields seemed to have an endless supply of voices for the various characters. Even, and especially, the men she was able to make unique: Gus Trenor is florid, Rosedale sounds pudgy, George Dorset is hypochondriac, and the accent of Mrs. Fisher is somehow more American than the other Americans. It is a bravura performance to add color to the commute of those of us who are stuck with mere horsepower instead of the horses and trains of Wharton's time (Robert Moses was but a teenager in the New York of Lily Bart)."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"America and Europe of the 1800s were stiff, gilded, formal place, full of \\"old\\" families, rigid customs and social transgressions.

Haunting and vivid."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Reading The House of Mirth today, it's easy to overlook the obvious: that it was not written as a \\"period piece,\\" but as a modern novel. Readers can get so caught up in the early 20th Century details (the Edwardian-era clothing, the carriages, both horseless and horse-drawn, the elaborate social rituals), that they tend to forget that for Wharton and her first readers this story had all the timeliness of, say, Sex and the City, a book which will probably seem just as dated as Wharton's by the 22nd Century, and less well written.What Wharton set out to do, and did so effectively in the final analysis, was to present a picture of a then \\"modern woman,\\" one endowed with beauty and intelligence, placed in a privileged yet precarious position, and to show how a tragic combination of character and circumstance could lead her from the promise of a glittering future to her ultimate degradation and destruction.Lily Bart, the woman at the center of the novel, was modern in the sense that she was a product of both her era and her social class when the novel was published in 1905. Born and raised on the fringes of upper-class New York society before the turn of the last century, yet orphaned young without inherited wealth, she was expected and prepared to be the wife of a wealthy gentleman. Though refined in the moral as well the esthetic sense, she was prized by her society primarily as an ornament. A beautiful ornament, it's true, but so long as she remained unmarried her \\"mission\\" in life could never be considered fulfilled, despite her numerous and varied attributes.Lily is 29 at the novel's start, and in that era dangerously close to becoming an old maid. The longer a woman in such a situation remained unwed, the more exposed she was to unfavorable or even vicious comments from those whom she most needed to ingratiate herself with in order to maintain a place in their charmed circles and to marry well. A woman in Lily's circumstances could ill afford to be considered too independent, or too careless of her reputation, as she belatedly discovered.When, through a series of costly reversals, brought about either by accident (Wharton's novel is filled with momentous chance encounters), or due to her own proclivity to sabotage the advances of her prosperous suitors, Lily is cast out of \\"polite society\\" and ultimately forced to earn a living through manual labor, she discovers how unprepared she is for what she considers the \\"dingy\\" side of life. And not mere dinginess and toil, but the prospect of poverty and abject humiliation are what she faces as the novel nears its conclusion.A sharp descent indeed for someone who started out so near the pinnacle of worldly success, and was so intimately received by those that had already achieved it.When today's readers encounter Lily and her plight in Wharton's novel, there may be an urge to dismiss this story as unrelated to our modern society, where social rules are not so inflexible, and women (in most cases) are routinely expected to be able to earn their own living. But Wharton was not a reporter, she was a gifted novelist, and her tale of a character trapped in an infernal machine from which she can find no escape still has the power to move us deeply. Beyond the period details, The House of Mirth offers us a believable story in which a character struggles to survive a catastrophe partly of her own making, and partly of others'. Such a tragic tale, so skillfully narrated, is timeless."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"America and Europe of the 1800s were stiff, gilded, formal place, full of \\"old\\" families, rigid customs and social transgressions.

Wharton's timeless themes of &quot;a generous person trapped by circumstances into consanguinity with a meaner nature and the nature and limits of individual responsibility - determining what allowance of freedom or rebellion can be made for her trapped protagonist without at the same threatening the structure of society&quot; (Edith Wharton by Blake Nevius, page 10) remain relevant in today's modern world. Lily Bart's tragic quest for &quot;The Republic of the Spirit&quot;, Wharton's vision of personal freedom, will tug at the hearts and souls of today's readers; many of whom still confront this quest daily.Personally, I found the novel to be very tragic but very skillful in the way Wharton attacks the materialistic, crass old NY society of which she comes from. Lily Bart is a very flawed woman and thus cannot be considered a &quot;heroine&quot; in the true sense because of her many weaknesses. However, her beauty, sweetness, and sense of honor makes her a memorable and sympathetic character.I was first introduced to Edith Wharton in 11th grade - I read her novella, Ethan Frome, which was outstanding in its stark but realistic portrayal of the doomed love affair of Ethan and Mattie. Now, as I read The House of Mirth, in graduate school for the first time, I continue to admire Ms. Wharton's incisive social commentary that contains surprising relevance in today's society.I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the works of Edith Wharton.

If I was writing a paper and could only use one book to represent American Women's Writing, chances are this would be it."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Rather than reiterate the long tedious plot about the slow decline of a woman trying to snare a rich husband in the Wasp society of Old New York, I found Lily Bart a shallow woman who cared only for wealth & showing it off. Her sense of values are totally distorted. Edith Wharton ,I think, shows her own values more than anything else. Her anti-Semitism & class snobbery are flagrant. Sam Rosedale, a Jew, is depicted as greedy & social climbing while his Wasp contemporaries are ambitious & hardworking. The charwomen & maids all have red hands, disheveled appearances & can barely speak in a coherent sentence while the rich Wasp women are charming & gracious even if phonies.Lily Bart has opportunities in her quest for marriage but always makes the stupidest choice. Then we are asked to feel pity for her when she either intentionally or accidentally overdoses. Her total life has little or no impact & it is interesting how she \\"looks down\\" on her cousin who is not particularly pretty or rich but takes an interest in social causes (sort of like an Eleanor Roosevelt) rather than worrying about what house party she is invited to.I think Edith Wharton showed a lot about her own attitudes in this \\"appraisal\\" of her social class.Totally insulated from the world, it is a class that is bound to deteriorate & Lilly Bart was but one lone example. I also thought all the names & inter personal relationships were tedious because they were always so shallow & the story could have been much shorter.."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Excellent Excellent Excellent.

Lily Bart, the central figure of Edith Wharton's \\"The House of Mirth,\\" would not be what I can describe as a heroine - she is not a character to be admired. Lily Bart is a tragic figure, a product of her upbringing, and trapped in a world she has no idea how to escape - even if she truly had a desire to leave.Lily Bart was born and raised into a family of extreme wealth, in the gilded age of New York society. She was taught nothing except how to be pretty, witty, flirtatious, dress well - and get a husband. Women of her class and time had no choices in life, and Lily wasn't one to have much ambition. Orphaned at a young age, she was taken in by a wealthy aunt, though her personal wealth was gone. Still, there were appearances to keep up, dresses to buy, social appearances to make, one has to give the appearance of wealth in order to obtain a wealth husband. However, Lily was never encouraged to be smart nor is she bright. She is ruled by impulse, and, by the age of 29, has allowed her foolishness to find her still single, with time desperately running out on marriageable prospects. Never one to be calculating, Lily allows herself to continue in her impulsiveness and foolishness, until she finds herself tumbling down the ladder of society without a clue as to how to regain her footing.Lily Bart is not a woman who elicits sympathy easily. In fact, I found myself becoming exasperated with her often! There were times I found myself thinking, \\"NO, Lily! Not that! Don't do it!\\" And still, she would, impulsive little fool that she was. And yet, in the end, I very much wanted to save her. I wanted to give her a hug, take her by the hand, and show her the way out. Lily is such a product of her upbringing, of the world in which she lived in, of the times in which she lived in. This can be a frustrating book for women of our modern age to read, yes. However, Ms. Wharton was intimatly acquainted with this world, and I think a great of it is coming from her own experience.This book is one of the best I believe I've read, and it will stay with me. It is not the \\"rainbows and roses\\" of a Jane Austen novel, no. It is tragic and unrelenting, and very, very real. And even though this novel was over 100 years ago, I can say that I've met my fair share of Lily Bart's in my life time. There are still pretty little fools living in the house of mirth."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"This is another one of Edith Wharton's better books. For those of you who prefer the less sensational writings of today, Wharton provides excellent glimpses into life during the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly among the wealthy, largely idle 'upper class' of New York and the Hamptons."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"High American society, New York, turn of the 19th century: Lily Bart, an associate of the well-heeled who often attends their social functions, has no fortune of her own. What to do? Marry into money. This should be easy enough for Lily as she's found to be beautiful by many of the men who orbit about her, but she seems to have no interest in them. She longs for the trappings of aristocratic life but is unwilling to accept the sacrifices attendant to marrying simply for position. Letting one too many opportunities slip by, and being embroiled in a couple of social faux pases along the way, she eventually finds that she's been dumped by polite society, facing penury in a boarding house.House of Mirth is of course beautifully written, though the plot moves quite slowly with few truly dramatic punctuations. Lily is a largely unsympathetic character whose motives are not easy to understand and whose actions are often frustrating. Indeed, many of the misfortunes that befall her seem to be of her own making."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I received the book on time and it was exactly what I ordered! It is a good novel to read and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"\\"The House of Mirth\\" by Edith Wharton is her second long novel, and was published on October 14th of 1905. Her first long novel, \\"The Valley of Decision\\", was a sweeping historical fiction, which was perhaps a bit too ambitious for her first attempt. This novel suffers none of the flaws of her first effort, and the reader is pulled into the story by its heroine, Lily Bart. She is an interesting character, who is struggling to maintain her position in society. She is flawed, to be sure, but at the same time the reader wants to find out what is going to happen to her.The story starts with Lily already in difficulty. She is living off of a small inheritance and the sporadic gifts of her strict Aunt Julia. She is also getting older, though still very beautiful and able to attract men, she is always looking for signs of age in the mirror. From the time she was young, she was brought up in affluence, and when her father was ruined financially, it had devastating effect on her mother, and on a then young Lily. She cannot bear the thought of a life without luxury though, and so she is set on marrying only if the man has money. At the same time, those men who do have money do not fill her emotional needs. The man whom she loves, Lawrence Seldon, cannot satisfy her financial needs, and yet she deliberately throws away the opportunities she has to set herself up financially for life.An interesting aspect of Lily's character is the way she becomes morally stronger each time her position becomes a bit weaker. One suspects the Lily from early in the story would handle the challenges she faces later in the book much differently. She has opportunities to recover her position, but she will not behave in the manner necessary to accomplish it, to her credit. Her relationships with other people also become more real, and less based on superficial subject matter and conversation. This inverse relationship between morality and societal position appears in many of the other characters as well.I found this to easily be her best novel, short or long, up to this point in her career. Her short fiction had been her stronger work prior to this, but \\"The House of Mirth\\" changes that as it is the first long work from Wharton which delivers on the promise that she showed with many of her short fiction works. I am rounding this one up to five stars."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth was a more complicated read than I expected. I found myself frustrated with Lily Bart, sometimes thinking she deserved what she got and then at other times I was pulling for her.It's easy to look at Lily with modern eyes and think of her as a purely foolish woman; however, in the context of her time, it is hard to imagine her creating a more independent life for herself. The milliner experience is telling: in Lily's limited world, she is skilled at trimming hats. In the real world, she has nearly no skill at all. Her greatest failing at personal growth was not taking seriously the possibility of a life with Selden. You catch glimpses of the person she might become but over and again Lily chooses the materialistic life she knows.Interesting to me is how my expectations for Lily declined as did her prospects: at first I hoped for Selden and happiness, later I merely hoped for anyone (Dorset or Rosedale) and escape from her desperate circumstances. For most of the book, I found the final outcome hard to predict; unfortunately the ending was too clearly foreshadowed. I won't detail it here for the sake of other readers but once the idea was introduced, it was impossible to read on without dismissing all other possible outcomes. That was a disappointment.Although Lily's adherence to her code of conduct was critical to her last minute redemption, I was selfishly very sorry that Bertha Dorset didn't get her comeuppance. Maybe that's why I cannot judge Lily too harshly."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Lily Bart lives in the House of Mirth, which according to a biblical passage, is the house of fools; the house of mourning is reserved for the wise. Lily Bart is no fool and she struggles throughout to hold on to her permanent truth (she won't \\"Bart\\"er her self, after all). Her permanent truth however, can not take root or give her entry into the house that she longs for, where luxury and sumptuous environs would satify her psychic need for material comfort. Hence, she is outside the realm of her longing and falls down on the cold realities and away from the comforts provided by the house of mirth. I was a teenager the last time I cried while reading a book. I did cry, however, several times while reading the final chapter of The House of Mirth, which in my world is a testament to the transient beauty that Edith Wharton captures in this remarkable tale."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton. Illustrated by A. B. Wenzell.This novel offers a social commentary on the lifestyles and behavior of super-rich society. The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"America and Europe of the 1800s were stiff, gilded, formal place, full of \\"old\\" families, rigid customs and social transgressions. Especially for women.And nobody chronicled them better than Edith Wharton, who spun exquisitely barbed novels out of the social clashes of the late nineteenth century. \\"The House of Mirth\\" is one of her darker stories, where scandals and lack of conformity trigger a tragic downward spiral for a vibrant woman.Like most not-so-rich women, Lily Bart is on the prowl for a marriage to keep her in luxury and affluent circles. What's more, she has a rapid intellect and striking looks, but she is also a habitual liar who defies society's strictures (she gambles and smokes). Her only friend is Lawrence Seldon, but she is determined not to marry for love alone.Unfortunately, her schemes and plans start to collapse -- her adoring suitors either aren't rich enough, or her independent spirit sends her off. Her desperation becomes even more intense as she finds herself in the thick of a scandal, spun up by a malicious society matron to cover up her own affair. With her reputation in ruins, Lily's life spirals down into a new life of unemployment, poverty, and the final tragedy.Edith Wharton always paid a lot of attention to a woman's restricted life in the Gilded Age, and how scandals, unconventionality and society's hypocrisy could ruin them. But \\"The House of Mirth\\" pays more attention to this than most -- it's a bleakly realistic story, unflinchingly showing Lily's slow descent into miserable loneliness.Despite that, Wharton's writing is pure flowering poetry with a knack for evocation (\\"Her small pale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggerated eyes\\"), and has a sensual quality with all the descriptions of silks, plants, soft light and luxurious mansions. And she vividly portrays the upper echelons of New York society at the time -- affairs, gossip and gilded salons -- as well as the restricted lives of womenBut Wharton is just as capable of describing the darker, sadder world that Lily falls into (\\"... blurred the gaunt roof-lines, threw a mauve veil over the discouraging perspective of the side streets\\"). Sedoesn't pull any punches with the tragic finale, which has a distinct air of inevitability about it -- no fairy-tale last-minute save by a Prince Charming.Lily starts out the book as a glimmering satellite of society, who can be rather selfish and cruel, but who nevertheless gains some sympathy for her terrible plight. The cruel, glittering society of the time had no room for women who stood outside the lines, especially if they tried to lie at all the wrong times. And so we see poor Lily, driven into miserable poverty and drug addiction.\\"The House of Mirth\\" is anything but mirthful -- it's the study of a woman's slow downfall, and the cruel society that left her friendless and disgraced. Haunting and vivid."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"&quot;The House of Mirth&quot; is a rich, nuanced study of New York upper class at the turn of the century. It is also a portrait of a single, beautiful, no longer so young (29-it is the turn of the century woman) struggling to survive in this society. This book will break your heart.Lily Bart is nearly penniless, not an unusual condition for the heroine of a novel. However, in her case, she does not exist in the lower classes and is not struggling to make her way to the top. Instead, she has been born at the top and she lives in a world where breeding, beauty and money (preferably of an older vintage) matter the most. Bart possesses the first two attributes and she is using them to gain the third.Bart's only hope for survival in the world of Old New York society is to make an advantageous marriage and in her case it has to be to someone wealthy. The book details the various compromises she can make--basically, the coarser the person, the higher a price he is willing to pay for her breeding.Several themes run through this book: money, of course, and the various forms it takes in &quot;society&quot; (e.g., old money, new money, newer money); class (the book has many anti-semitic references to a wealthy individual who is Jewish--and who is willing to pay a high price for Lily initially); integrity (which basically belongs to those of such older families as Lily's); and finally, true love, which comes in the form of Selden, a young, poor but well bred New Yorker, whom Lily loves in spite of herself.Wharton depicts Lily's downward course in the world. In many ways, Wharton's heroine travels in the opposite direction of characters in books like Dreiser's: a dreiser character might begin in poverty, sacrifice her virtue and integrity, and rise up in the world. In Lily's case, the more she holds on to her integrity, the harder she falls in the world.I would recommend this book to those who like 19th and early 20th century American and British fiction. IN addition, those individuals who enjoy women's books from all eras should appreciate &quot;The House of Mirth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Wharton's darker view of out-of-step women in very different social circumstances is depicted in Ethan Frome and this famous novel, The House Of Mirth. Lurking in the gilded world of Lilly Bart are many twists and turns that torment the incautious souls. Like her counterpart, Mattie in E.F., Lilly is lulled by the power of her own beauty and flames a rebelliousness that ignites a spark to fast-drying opportunities. Though she waivers between eligible men who guaranteed lifelong protection, her passive resistance to the iron-clad social constraints, her failure to respect the rules, placed her at odds with the fates.The world retaliates against rebellious people. Lilly, unfortunately, had not that iron shield of deep resolve or strength of ideals, to bolster her in her ambivalence. This novel has many of the same elegant settings, grand estates and social affairs of Wharton's other works. In this story however, they exist like the dark sky, site of her falling star. Breathless, classic and mythic."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Until about a week ago, I had only a vague consciousness of Edith Wharton; although now, after reading The House of Mirth, I have a deep respect for her as a writer and I can't wait to read something else of hers.She captures society and human nature so vividly that the incidents in the novel reminded me of some from my own experience. Wharton creates characters that seem to be modelled after real people - how else could such expression of their trues characters have been possible? Lily and Selden are deeply complex - much of their characters Wharton conveys simply through description of what they do not do and what they do not say, although you come to know these characters so well that you KNOW what they are really feeling. Its true that these characters are hard to accept as full-fledged heroes, but that is because they are truly human characters - they are not perfect, and yet there is a great deal of goodness in them, along with the flaws. It is important for the reader to remember that society has a stong pull and that it is almost impossible for someone brought up in a flawed society to be free from those flaws. The fact that Lily and Selden are not perfect, but human, makes them all the more endearing.I also think that the way Wharton wrote was truly beautiful = she painted images so vividly that I could totally see the scenes she was describing. There are not long tedious paragraphs set aside for description of the setting, and yet, the reader can imagine exactly how everything looks. Wharton has such a comfortable natural ease with her words that none of it is awkward or showy - she picks the perfect words to convey emotions and moods, all through the way she writes. It's hard to really write about the way she writes, but I think that she is very talented. Her use of metaphor and imagery adds such complexity to an already lush story and the effect of this combination is truly thrilling and awesome. I don't know if all her readers feel this effect, but as I'm in an English class where I have to pay attention to things like diction and figurative language, the artistic qualities of The House of Mirth struck me.I really loved this book and I couldn't stop reading it - and at the same time I didn't want it to end. It is indeed very emotional as other commentators have noted and I think that the fact that this work evokes such emotion is a testament to Wharton's true talent.I don't agree with the idea that Lily saw no way out of her plight except death - her death (as I interpret it) was accidental and I think that she somehow finally had a new found sense of hope. It broke my heart the way Selden finally came to his senses at the last moment, but I don't think that any other ending would have been fitting.I had to pick a book as an outside reading book for my 11th grade English class, and after briefly skimming the possiblities, I chose to read The House of Mirth. I read all 330 pages of it in less than a week and I don't regret my choice. Some might say that this isn't pleasure reading, but I found it very entertaining and it also got me thinking, a merit not usually bestowed upon pleasure reading books. It is very thought provoking and moving, as well as an excellent sketch of 1905 New York.I've rambled a bit, but I definitely recommend this book to anyone who appreciates social history, New York life, human nature, love or a well written book!"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Lily Bart illustrates what Aristotle meant by a tragic flaw. She cannot see beyond the limits of her social horizon. With flawless tastes and captivating graces she cannot accept the notion of marrying into any situation where she would have to tolerate standards she perceives as &quot;dingy.&quot; She knows whom she loves but it never occurs to her to marry him, for his income would fix her in the &quot;dingy&quot; category (though he has an apartment on Fifth Avenue). And given her upbringing, there is no situation but matrimony.

You'll be depressed for a month. It's a good read, though, if by the word \\"good,\\" one intends to say \\"thought-provoking\\" or \\"contemplative.\\" After I finished this book, I couldn't stop talking about it. I made all my friends watch the film (because I knew they'd never read a book like this), and I sat back and watched with twisted amusement the black fury that resulted from their expectation that this would be a story with a happy ending. I know, I have problems.The book is all about a girl called Lily. She's a young woman who's been raised by her wealthy relative, but whose expensive taste in fashion and friends proves to be her downfall.Apparently this story is meant to make us step back and examine society. We are supposed to tilt our heads, squint, and walk away with a sense that poor Lily Bart was wronged by the world she lived in. I'm not saying that's not the case. However, I think there's another chunk of truth to gnaw on. When I finished reading this book, I sat there thinking for a bit, and I realized that the protagonist destroyed her reputation, and, ultimately her life, over a bunch of frilly dresses. I thought that was the saddest part of all. Poor Lily Bart was so enslaved by her addiction to pretty things, and so unable to foresee the consequences of her actions, that in the end she was ruined because she couldn't walk past Saks without walking in. Now THAT is a real tragedy."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Edith Wharton's \\"The House of Mirth\\" offers a sharp, exquisitely detailed view of New York high society around the beginning of the twentieth century, a milieu in which Wharton spent her life and must have known so intimately she probably could be considered its greatest and shrewdest chronicler. It is a society and a time in which a person's influence is directly proportional to his or her wealth, and this novel is about how the vicious circle of such a society decides the fate of one particular girl.The heroine, Lily Bart, comes from a wealthy family, but her father had fallen into ruin just before his death, and now she is impecunious and living with her strident aunt, Mrs. Peniston. Ten years ago, she lost her chance to marry an Italian prince; now, approaching thirty and still single, she drifts through New York society attending dinners, playing bridge, and looking for money to marry -- one thing the novel makes clear is that there is nothing worse than being a Society Woman without money. Despite her financial situation, she retains her snobbishness and is addicted to the luxury provided by this society in which she was raised, even though she is frankly bored with most of the people in it.Lily's precarious position renders her vulnerable to the more predatory members of the society. One \\"friend,\\" Bertha Dorset, invites her to the Riviera for a vacation, but her real intention is for Lily to distract her husband's attention from her extramarital affair; Lily, in turn, is falsely accused of seducing Mr. Dorset and plunged into further shame. Another of Lily's married friends, Gus Trenor, under the pretext of helping her invest what little money she has, gives her some financial aid in the hope that she will give him a little something else in return. To repay her debt to him, she regretfully considers marrying the very wealthy and very repugnant Simon Rosedale.A man Lily does love is Lawrence Selden, a lawyer, who moves in the same social circles as she, but he doesn't have much money nor does he care for the society people. She's also interested in Percy Gryce, a handsome but shy book collector, but she doesn't move fast enough to save him from becoming engaged to another girl. When financial circumstances finally force Lily to take a menial millinery job to make ends meet, we can sympathize with her because she has done nothing foolish to deserve her fate and accepts it with the dignity she deems appropriate for her bygone social status.What impressed me most about the novel is the intricate beauty of Wharton's prose, which is not only descriptively excellent with moments of sly and caustic humor, but conveys the characters' moods and motives with unthinkable subtlety. Was Wharton trying to stick a dagger into the society she knew so well, the one from which she derived her entire lifestyle? With her pen, the strange, unique social mentality in which people may find themselves torn between a fraternal obligation to \\"take care\\" of a friend and a snobbish urge to expel her from a society to which she can no longer afford to belong, becomes a great subject for literary commentary."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I went to see the movie and was intrigued enough by the performances that I thought I would read the book. I am not usually a reader of this type of novel, but I wanted to see if the movie went by the book. Well, being the X-Files fan that I am I will not degrade the movie, but the book did add a lot of details about Lily's personality that the movie did not give insight into.

Selden was no better than the people who turned their backs on Lily."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I have long been a fan of Edith Wharton's work after seeing the film adaptation of The Age of Innocence, but this is my favorite of her stories. I have never seen the film version, for fear to would ruin the novel for me.I have to disagree with the previous reviewer who found Wharton's writing style too difficult for the modern reader. The writing is intellectual, in that she uses good words and perfect grammar, unlike most popular novels today, but very easy to understand. I could not put this book down once I picked it up, but is deliciously long enough to keep me entertained for a week.The story's protagonist, the beautiful Lily Bart is at first glance what we imagine a young lady of society in the late 1800's to be, flirty, charming but a little self-centered and love for all things elegant and beautiful. As the story progresses we grasp her vulnerability and her insecurities and also her all too human love of wealth and \\"beautiful things.\\" She is unable to give into her love for the only person who truly understands and respects her because he is unable to give her all the material things she desires. However when is given the opportunities to become like other women and marry for money to a man she hates, she cannot bring herself to do some. The story is a dance of Liliy's struggle between the things she wants and must have and the other alternative."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Two people telling a story: one has lived it while the other has not. Which would you believe? Most would say the first for there would be no bias, no lies, and no overstatements. This definitely applies to Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, a novel set in the early 1900's. When Wharton accounts the dismal life of Lily Bart and her continuous struggle to fit into upper crust New York, the reader senses that the author is writing an autobiography: the feelings, the thought process, and the actions of the protagonist are indeed too realistic for any reader to deny.A look into the history of America during the writing and publication of the book is vital for understanding why Lily fails but still struggles. At the turn of the twentieth century, America was passing through its post-war era of the Gilded Age, a period of thirty years where extravagant displays of American wealth filled many cities. New York is no exception of course. Born and raised in New York aristocracy during this time, Wharton depicts the bitter and malice realities of living and partaking in it through the influence of Bertha, the antagonist, on Lily's life.New York City had just become a world of extremes, with millionaires living on one block and homeless living across in tenements. Nobles would abolish their standards just to become more famous and richer. People did not follow their dignity or moral sense, but rather thought with stone hearts and money-driven minds. In this savage culture where feasting on others meant a better stature for oneself, there is evidently no room for mercy, love, or acceptance. Of course, in this sort of atmosphere, Lily finds it almost impossible to fit in or even enjoy her life.A little research on the book title reveals valuable information. The title of the book is directly taken from the Ecclesiastes verse, \\"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth,\\" illustrating that Wharton believed her society to be not only foolish but also vain. Besides the social issues, Wharton realized that money is an easy means of opening doors to those who have it, but a problem maker to those who lack it. Unfortunately, the protagonist does not have it, but the antagonist, Bertha, does.Bertha is the antithesis of Lily, as one enjoys money while the other dreams of it; one becomes free while the other becomes enslaved. The extremity between both lives illustrates that aristocratic life during the early twentieth century was a mere cover that hid a more treacherous and villainous lifestyle.Since this book does not only offer a great outlook of American history but also a female's struggle to marry and fit socially, I advice all those that face this problem to read it and learn from Lily's mistakes."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite novels. This tragic, ironic tale of a society darling's fall from grace has always brought tears to my eyes at the injustice of it all. Lily Bart is a true product of her time, both a fool for trusting the people around her and a heroine for refusing to settle for a loveless marriage, become a married man's mistress or stoop to blackmail to regain her status in society. Her love for Lawrence Seldon is both her strength and her downfall.I don't want to get into a complete plot summary. Most people know the story of a socialite with limited means but with good family connections. Her gambling debts lead to her ultimate downfall, for she makes financial investments with a married man with ulterior motives. False rumors cut her out of polite society, and she is forced to make some harsh decisions. The story is more about the trappings in a hypocritical society where appearances and reputation are above human compassion. This is the third time I have read this book, and words still fail me when I make an attempt to describe this wonderful piece of work. Edith Wharton had a keen eye when it came to writing about her world during the turn of the century. Her novels are tragic and ironic, some would call them depressing, but she wrote about her world, and she most obviously knew how things were like in her world. A note to those who may be reading this book for the first time: read the story first, not the introduction. Twelve years ago, when I read this book for the first time, I made the horrible mistake of reading an author's introduction before reading the story, and the aforementioned author (whose name escapes me) almost spoiled the book for me. The introduction had a detailed description of the ending. It's a good thing I had decided to read the book anyway, but I was certainly not pleased. Read the book and savor it. This is one of the most insightful looks into America during the late nineteenth century I have ever read."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"One of the only books i've bought at amazon.com that I actually read all the way through and liked. Couldn't put it down. The mimimalization of women by society still exists in this fashion. Hard to believe she died in 37. She is one of the best writers I've read in a while. Better than Henry James"},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"For a book set in the beginning of the last century, The House of Mirth is not dated in the least. The external-and internal-pressures Lily is under as she tries to marry 'well' are staggering, and time is working against her. She can never really connect with Seldon, which underlines the futility of the life she's trying so desperately to engineer for herself. As long as TV shows like &quot;How to marry a multimillionaire' are out there, The House of Mirth will be up-to-the-minute.Besides the plot, the book overall is brilliant. Wharton's description of the life of a banker, and of a banker's wife, is scarily accurate, even today.( I used to work on Wall Street.) I love all of Wharton's books, because they still ring all too true. This is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Wharton is devestating in her deconstruction of New York's high society - shallow, self-absorbed and self-indulgent, callous and cruel. Lily Bart is an underfinanced outsider bred to be a part of that society, but whose self-consciousness brings internal conflicts that place her neither in or out of it. Her descent, by choices of her own that are predetermined by her background and victimized by the hypocrisy and cruelty of that world, is painful. Because there is the opportunity, time and again, to escape or to successfully join that society, and one understands as Lily makes just those choices that doom her. And the awful proximity of the man who should have been the love of her life, Seldon, whose own timidity and small-minded self-righteousness seal the failure. To watch the step-by-step descent of this beautiful woman is wrenching, agonizing. It may not be pleasant, but it is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"The ugly side of the gilded age, and the world in which Edith Wharton was immersed, is highlighted in this incredibly haunting and moving novel. I can't wait to read Wharton's other works."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"My heart was racing as I got closer to the end; I'd forgotten what it's like to read a book like this. What a powerful psychological portrait of a character and the times! Though I prefer happy endings, this book was so facinating and so complete, that the ending did not disappoint me. Edith Wharton has become one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say that Lily Bart is difficult to like. And Wharton meant her to be; she never misses a chance to remind us satirically how self-centered and materialistic Lily is, and how she thinks she's entitled to be rich because she has such good taste that she could make the world a better place by using her money well on good interior decor. I also agree that the novel is slow-moving. But if you stay with it, the emotional pay-off at the end is extraordinary. The last chapters had me in tears, and I don't usually cry over books or movies. Lily may be too much a product of her times and her awful mother's training, but she does discover her backbone at the end, and has the strength to do something quite heroic when she passes up the chance for revenge on the woman who slandered her in society. The next-to-last episode before her death is a wonderful image of redemption: earlier on, when she had money to throw around, she dabbled in a little charitable work, and later she meets a woman whom she really helped. When she drifts off to sleep for the last time, dreaming that she has the poor woman's baby in her arms -- well, that's the scene when you'd better have the kleenex box handy. It's not true, by the way, that this novel offers no alternative for women except being rich and useless. Lily's only real friend, Gertie Farrish, is a woman who has found a way to be both independent and to do something useful with her life, as Wharton herself did."},{"Title":"The House of Mirth (The Best Sellers of 1905)","review":"Taking place in the early 1900's in New York City, this novel tells the story of Lily Bart, who is beautiful, formerly rich, and determined to marry well so that she can be rich again. To accomplish this, she moves in the highest levels of the smart society, all the while running up debts. However, she is more aware than she should be of the shallowness of her endeavors, and consequently (and often subconsciously) sabotages her own efforts, just when a man is ready to propose. Her one \\"spiritual\\" match is not rich enough to allow her to be a part of the world she has been schooled to desire. Through circumstance and her own unwise actions, she falls down the rungs of the ladder of society, until her only opportunity for redemption is to blackmail her chief adversary. And then....Edith Wharton is so subtle, so understated, that it is difficult to understand how she creates sympathy for this character, but she does. The reader comes to understand that Lily has been created: \\"Inherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the highly specialized product she was.\\" Wharton is commenting on a level of society which turned young women into merchandise to be sold to the highest bidder. She speaks as an insider, having been a part of that milieu herself.This novel tells an interesting and suspenseful story, but what makes it classic is the writing, which is elegant. (That's the most appropriate word for it that I can come up with.) The pace is slow, but the sentences are perfect, revealing so much through nuance and suggestion. This is not fast reading--I often had to read passages twice to understand what actually happened. Still, it more than rewards for time spent."},{"Title":"Christian doctrines: A compendium of theology","review":"This book is preparing for a huge test, it is very easy to read, Im sure I will do just fine, thanks so much for this book."},{"Title":"Wiersbe's Expository Outlines on the New Testament: Chapter-by-Chapter through the New Testament with One of Today's Most Respected Bible Teachers (Warren Wiersbe)","review":"This is a wonderful resource and a wealth of information for the serious seeker.

Cookbook","review":"HOW TO GRILL is the definitive book for grilling, barbecuing, and smoking for beginners and those who have been using barbecues all their lives thinking there's really nothing to using a grilling device, throw on a piece of meat directly over a fire and barbecue. Little did I know that there was more to cooking outdoors than I thought. The book addresses common problems such as over cooking a steak or hamburger to drying out chicken. The book gives detailed step by step instructions assuming no prior knowledge on the part of the reader. It defines semantic terms such as the differences between grilling, barbecuing, and smoking. Man, I didn't realize out of that 30 something year old Weber 22.5\\" Kettle Grill we got at K-Mart for $25 could be made into not only a grilling machine but barbecuing and smoking machine as well. And boy, what delicious flavors come out of that since I purchased this book! There's simple techniques to learn like 2 and 3 zone fires, direct and indirect cooking, temperature control, etc. The book is not restricted to any particular grilling device, for he talks about a variety of these cooking machines. Steven provides an abundance of recipes including injection sauces.

My dad wasn't the best griller in the world... With this book, I've been able to get helpful hints like : cook times, temperature info., recipes, sauces, and techniques to grill different foods. I admit that some of the recipes have a ton of ingredients, but I enjoy to cook, and it is well worth it when you see those perfect grill marks, and bite into a perfect medium rare filet that is so juicy. This book is great for all types of \\"Backyard Barbeque Chefs\\". Whether you're an experienced cook, or you're new to the art, you will find this book very informative. I've had the book for a little over 2 weeks, and I'm enjoying grilling 3-4 times a week, everything from filets to fajitas with pico de gallo, zucchini and squash with greek spices, to corn on the cob, and some different types of potatoes. I'm loving this book, and I just ordered the barbecue bible. It is definitely worth it's price tag, which is an understatement since I bought it here for $6.98.

Cookbook","review":"I was in a bit of a frenzy for the usual Fourth of July grilling extravaganza... I wanted to do a couple of new dishes, smoked BBQ ribs and smoked salmon, and I awoke Saturday morning with neither the foodstuffs nor any proven recipes. After throwing back a bracing cup of coffee, I raced off to the local warehouse store that I knew carried this book to see whether I could still make the cookout happen, and if not... Well, there's always pizza, right?I realized time would be an issue, so as I scanned the recipes for BBQ ribs and smoked salmon, I knew it would be a close race. I would need to pick up all the materials, do some prep work, fire the grill, cook the food, and basically do it all in about 5 hours. Nothing invigorates like a good challenge.Five hours later, our guests were sitting down to newly-made potato salad, cherry cobbler, fresh corn on the cob, green beans from the garden... And the centerpieces of the cookout, the aforementioned spareribs and salmon. Let me just say this. I have always had great success with salmon, and some would say my versions are better than what is served in many restaurants. Raichlen's smoked salmon with dark rum outdid my best. It was buttery, smoky, just a hint of rum and brown sugar. And best of all, as it cured in the fridge for about 4 hours, it allowed me to move onto other projects. Grill time for the salmon? A mere 20 minutes.The ribs were an unequivocal hit also. I even managed to mix up his suggested BBQ sauce, and I must say it was simply outstanding. Best of all, the most labor-intensive aspect of this recipe was actually remembering to spritz the rack of ribs every 15 minutes with cider. How very taxing, indeed...!Sunday I sat down and perused the rest of the recipes. My wife is a modified vegetarian, so she can eat fish, shellfish and veggies. This book had plenty to offer. I just about fell off the couch when I saw &quot;Grilled Creme Brulee!&quot; And as for us carnivores, there's plenty to try out.In short, the layout was extremely user friendly, the recipes tried so far were brilliant successes, and the techniques and hints all were very helpful. I do agree that at some point I'll need to put this into a binder, because I plan to use the heck out of this book. For anyone who likes to grill, don't hesitate. Buy this book now."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I have ignored a lot of the recipies in this book, although some of them are excellent. But the techniques are really what this book is all about. Great starting point to go beyond the hamburgers/hot dogs/steak routine of grilling. Those who have a lot of grilling/bbq experience are probably not going to get as much out of it. You can simply take the technique, apply a different sauce, marinade, or seasoning to it, and still come up with something pretty good.Also, while most of the recipies are excellent, some could use a little help. I substituted ground allspice in the pork chop brine for allspice berries, and get a much more flavorfull result. There's too much salt in some of them for my taste, but then, that's just me. The Asian ribs are outstanding.Has really jump-started my quest to be a &quot;grill master&quot;."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I'm not much of a cook but felt my backyard wasn't complete without a grill in it. I quickly realized how little I knew about grilling food and ended up buying this book. The book shows you how to grill a huge variety of foods (beef and veal, pork and sausages, lamb, chicken and more, fish, shellfish, vegetables, and desserts). It also has recipes for rubs, sauces and condiments to go with the food you grill. Every dish has lots of nice color photos that show not only the finished product, but the steps you need to take to get there. So far I've grilled a whole salmon, fish steaks, burgers and steaks using this guide. The salmon turned out great. The dill sauce with roasted mustard seeds complemented the fish well. The garlic burgers were another big hit. The only misfire has been the tarragon butter sauce recommended for steaks and fish. Tarragon tastes like black licorice to me (which I hate). I felt it almost ruined the flavor of the steaks, but that's just my personal taste. But everything else I've made from this book has turned out great. In fact, it's convinced me that I need to plant some herbs in our vegetable garden next year for next summer's cooking. This is a great guide for anyone new to grilling--plenty of recipes with nice photos and instructions on how to cook everything."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Cookbook","review":"I am from the Northeast and have been grilling religiously for about 10 years. I did not know until I moved to Georgia how serious of a trade and technique barbequing really is. This book will not only tell you, but it will show you with color pictures the techniques of preparing and grilling several different foods. I have found this book and the Barbeque Bible to be indispensible. I have even impresed a few Southerners that think that I have picked up these techniques from my time spent down here in the South. I really acquired them from these books!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

I bet that this book should be awesome In Hard cover or Paperback, but since I bought it for my Ipad, I only give it three stars. Publishers need to understand that a digital book doesn't mean to scan a book and upload it (that's what it seems like).

BBQing is more of an art but is tradionally the husband's domain so this book is excellent for him! It is very precise and it takes the guess work out of cooking...perfect for the beginner or the seasoned chef. The recipes are great, not too complicated but really delicious and there are lots of pictures (I love cookbooks with lots of pictures) that show you how to prepare things or cut the chicken, etc...I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys cooking on the grill or anyone remotely interested in trying to cook on the grill- You will love it!!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

The layout and photographs are really nice (full color) and the techniques great (although *BEWARE* it didn't really teach me anything I hadn't learned from the Barbeque Bible already.) But in the end, the recipes left me disappointed as I was hoping for something more sophisticated. My advice, don't buy this book if you already have the first one. And don't buy this book unless you like all your meat products stuffed with cheese."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Is this to give the compete ABC's or was this book written for beginner cooks? I tried several recipes, all turned out great for spice minded people (the Rosemary Brick Chicken is to die for), but I learned to use half the salt, or at times use twice the meat with the same amount of suggested spice. The book is worth buying, but test the recipes with yourself & a special other before inviting guests."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"This a a great book for creative grill masters. One caveat: if you own an 18 inch weber kettle, be sure to adapt the coal amounts for your smaller grill. Otherwise you will fry your food faster than a hyper-active pyro. The author never bothers to mention how much fuel to use for various sizes of charcoal grills. Not once in the entire book. So, be carefull grill-jockeys and adjust down or up as needed. Otherwise, yum."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"How to Grill is a comprehensive guide to grilling for newbies that want to become pros. The book begins with a very thorough study of every conceivable barbeque technique, every piece of equipment, and many how-to's, from choosing the grill (or grills!) that are right for you to lighting charcoal without blowing something up. Each of these discussions have beautiful, glossy, detailed pictures included. If you decide to buy a fish grilling basket after reading this book, you will know exactly what it looks like when you go to the store. No more guessing from bad illustrations! This alone is worth the purchase price of this book.Of course, this is also a large recipe book. And the recipes are absolutely delicious! I suggest that any barbequer start with the Beer Can Chicken recipe and work from there. The recipe is so simple, but soooo good. All recipes are well illustrated, with step-by-step instructions. Again, nice glossy photos, no bad illustrations.Some have complained that the information about how to do things like soaking wood chips and lighting the grill are repeated unnecessarily with each recipe. I think these repetitions actually make the book great at what it's for, the beginner. A beginner barbequer doesn't want to have to flip back and forth through the book to remember the steps. It's all laid out together. More advanced barbequers, which anyone who buys this book will quickly become, would do well to get another book of Raichlen's: &quot;BBQ USA&quot;, with still great instructions, though less pictures, and 425 recipes to keep you eating for many weekends to come."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"This is not only the best book on grilling I have ever used, it is the easiest to use cookbook on the planet, bar none. The recipes are unbelievable. I served the London Broil last night at dinner, and my friends all agreed it was the best beef they had ever tasted. Ever grill a cabbage? This book will show you how. I used to think I knew how to barbecue until I started using this book. Every procedure is clearly documented with outstanding step by step photographs. This book is a groundbreaker!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"This is only an okay cookbook, rather than the be-all, end-all that other reviewers might lead you to believe. It does have some nice information in it but I had several problems with it that led to me returning the book to the store:-The author claims in his introduction to have gathered as many questions as possible about grilling to help ease worries and generally enlighten people on the \\"secrets\\" of grilling. I found this information to be far too brief/summarized and I'm surprised at how much was left out. It seems strange to me that the author is so hyped up about high-fat meat (many of the recipes in the book specifically demand higher fat cuts of meat, or that you don't trim too much of the fat off), but he's gone and written a book for beginners and there isn't one word here about flare-ups, something that anyone is going to experience when cooking high-fat meat, and that will probably be intimidating for beginners.-Speaking of high-fat meat...this is not a health-conscious cookbook. Not that it really needs to be, but the author doesn't even go so far as to provide calories-per-serving information on any of these recipes. I know that this can be tricky to do with grilling, but it would have been nice to at least get calorie information for the various sauces. Additionally, rather than provide tips on how to keep the flavor/moistness in low-fat cuts or trimmed meat (which, again, will prevent flare-ups and grease buildup), the author disregards these options and just tells the reader to use high-fat meat over and over again.-The author claims in the introduction that the recipes in this book are organized as lessons to help you learn how to cook them. I didn't find this to be true exactly. Most of the recipes involve extremely time-intensive prepwork or expensive ingredients, such as saffron. I couldn't believe how many recipes in this book called for saffron, which I'm pretty sure is the most expensive spice you can buy in a regular grocery store (50 dollars an ounce last time I checked). If you really were trying to teach yourself how to grill these sorts of things for the first time, would you really want to risk saffron on your experiments? This just didn't make sense to me at all.That being said, there were a few pretty nice recipes in this book, and some of the basic cooking information for specific kinds of meat is handy. It's just not as spectacular as others are making it out to be; I went into this book with high expectations from these reviews and came out let down.For experts or for people who have been grilling the wrong way for many years, this might be an interesting book. I don't think I'd recommend it to true beginners. It's not the encyclopedic source of information it claims to be."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Steve Raichlen is the ultimate barbecue and grill guru, and How to Grill is the type of book you would expect from a guru. Raichlen leads the reader through every aspect of grilling. For the grilling beginner, he offers thorough information about the various types of grills, accessories, fuels, and cuts of meat. His recipes range from fairly simple to quite complex. He addresses cooking beef, pork, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and desserts on grills. Raichlen offers tips for adjusting nearly every recipe to the type of grill the reader uses. For grilling aficionados, Raichelen offers a wide variety of recipes for rubs, sauces, and butters that one can experiment with in a variety of fashions. The pictures are suberb and the instructions for every recipe are very detailed. As a South Carolinian, I also appreciate the fact that he distinguishes between North Carolina (vinegar based) and South Carolina (mustard based) barbecue. Only a guru or a South Carolinian knows the difference, and Raichlen is from West Virginia."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Before this book my idea of grilling was light the coals (and pray they stayed lit) and throw the food on (hoping it cooked). Well this book changed my whole ideology. Grilling is a fun and exciting task not a wish on a grate for an okay meal. It doesn't matter if your a grilling newbie, like me, or a seasoned expert there is something to learn.Also the recipes are wonderful. Nothing you have to pay out 20 bucks for in unheard of ingredients, but things most of us have in the pantry or fridge already. The recipes are new and exciting with some standards with interesting twists. This book will make you want to grill every weekend (no matter what the weather)."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"There are a LOT of so-called BBQ experts and gurus. Heck, any of us who slave over our backyard grills and toss burgers or dogs on think we're experts. But Steve Raichlen is the true expert...the man whose skill and knowledge not only of BBQ techniques, but of choosing the right equipment, spices, sauces, etc, is second to none in the BBQ realm. Steve has authored the BBQ Bible, and Indoor Grilling among other great books and here's another one designed for novices or experts.Liberally blessed with over 1000 glossy photos, this book will provide step-by-step techniques to make you an expert griller. From choosing your grill to utensils. Whether its an expensive gas grill, cheap charcoal grill, water smoker, or rotisserie, Steven gives you the skinny on everything.There are sections on how to grill pork including delectable, melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork for sandwiches, Ribs, whole pigs, tenderloins, and chops. Or there is the Beef section detailing techniques from doing prime rib or a whole brisket, right down to making the best burgers. There's also sections of poultry, seafood, veggies, sauces and rubs. The Salmon receipes are just to die for and I'm not even a big fan of seafood generally. FAntastic burgers, even recipes to make your own turkey pastrami. Wow!Written simply and geared more towards beginning grillers, it's still sophisticated enough to provide some extremely elegant techniques and recipes. While Steve seems to prefer an old fashioned charcoal grill, he still realizes that Gas grills are the preference today and provides all the tips you need to get that great grill taste from any kind of grill you use. It's the dead of winter with a foot of snow on the ground and I am licking my chops in anticipation of firing up the grill and making some more great recipes!Thanks again, Steve!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Cookbook","review":"I gave this book to my 19 year old son(off at college) when his Dad gave him his first grill. I was very impressed with the information, especially the way that it took each cut of meat and told step by step how to set up the grill and cook it. Not only how to cook it one way either but several other options depending on what you wanted (ie-smoked, blackened, etc.) It also includes grilling veggies, pizza and other foods. There are recipes using the various forms of grilling included that are set up as whole meals, including sides and items that may not be grilled. I was pleased that the majority of the book was spent on grilling techniques and not mostly recipes with some grilling tips thrown in. I would definitely buy this book as a first grilling book for young people who are just leaving home. It is the perfect companion gift if you are giving a grill as my husband and I did. I also consider it the ideal gift for people of any age that know nothing about grilling (like me!) and would like to learn. It seems that men are the grilling experts in most of the households I am familiar with and the women know little about it.

I have prepared eight recipes and my family has enjoyed every one of them. Steven Raichlen's writing and voice is personal without going over board.Now for the drawbacks, which are slight. First, it would be worth the money to buy the hardback edition. The spine on my copy broke. You will be using this book quite a bit also. Second, The same three pictures of how to light a charcoal fire are on most recipes.

Another thing I like is the quality of the paper on every page. It is almost plastic paper so that a few small spills wont ruin it. And you can bend open pages at the spine. This is not a cheaply made book just judging from the quality of the paper and the binding. This reminds me of some of the very high quality $120.00 physics books I had in college that are meant to last forever."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I was undecided whether to buy this book or \\"Weber's Charcoal Grilling: The Art of Cooking with Live Fire\\". The reviews on both were very good so I just decided to buy both. Now that I have the two, I can tell \\"How To Grill\\" is definitely better than the other book in so many ways. I've picked random recipes, and compared the two in each book. So far, I can tell that the recipes on this book are more appetizing than the other. For example, I did the Barbecue Ribs, and tried to come up with the best from both worlds. At the end, I used this book's instructions for everything:1. Cutting the ribs (pictures were more clear, and instructions too in a step by step fashion)2. Barbecue Rub (liked the ingredients better)3. Barbecue mop sauce (other book didn't have this one)4. Barbecue sauceThe book excels even at recommending sides for each dish, which I don't find as much in the other book which I consider to be just a set of segregated recipes.Another aspect that I really liked about this book, is that it gives you a very good introduction to almost all aspects of grilling. For example, it very clearly explains the difference between the different charcoal placement method, including pros and cons of each one. Also, they have a pretty good section explaining all the meat cuts, and the characteristics of each one (for example, explains that the rib eye contains more fat inside therefore you need to be more careful of flames when you are grilling this cut).So far, I've experimented with the recipes below, and all of them, without exception have been very illustrative and simple to follow:- BBQ Ribs (including rub and 2 sauces)- Grilled Asparagus- Grilled tomatoes- Grilled pineapple (dessert)- Grilled Pizza (including detailed steps to make the bread from scratch, which I did without any issue and no previous experience)There is only one recipe that has caught my attention from the other book, grilled artichoke hearts. They were very good too, no complaints.I do not have anything against the other book, actually has helped me to fill some minor gaps that this book has (like finding a recipe for artichokes) but if I would have to decide for one book, I would go for this one without any doubt. I have to rate this 5 stars, but I could go more than this if I could. I think that the book goes above and beyond on some aspects that are not grilling related (making bread from scratch for example), which I believe is very valuable for someone that is trying to grill more seriously than before."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Cookbook","review":"Let me say right off I love this book.The Recipes are fantastic and so is the discussion of Grills and tools, but far and above everything else are the Photographs.I have looked at several other books and was a little nervous about doing some of the techniques with out some one to guide me.NOT a problem with this book. The written descriptions are very easy to follow, but the photos put this book right over the top.A prime example is found on page 220 \\"Spatchecocked chicken\\" The opening photo presents a mouth watering plating, and the next three pages of photographs and captions walk you through what could be a very tricky process. I managed to make this recipe the first time out with tremendous success, and it has become one of our favorites.Another Recipe that ranks right up is the stuffed pork loin. Previously I would have done a straight butterfly cut and then stuffed and bound it in place with string and prayer. Using Steve's cut and unroll method I was able to end up with a consistent half inch thick slab of meat that I stuffed and re-rolled to perfection. The Ooohs and Aaahs when I plated this were worth the little extra time it took.My other favorite recipe from this book is the Chicken sates found on page 254. This is Thailands answer to the chicken finger. The recipe is quick simple and I never have left overs.If you Grill or smoke this book is a must have"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"My husband, along with a multitude of other men, thinks he can just slap a steak, burger or piece of chicken or fish on the grill on high and it will miraculously come out delicious. It's usually a hit or miss procedure. He's never quite sure long it takes to grill anything just right. Since reading this book, I have now become the chief griller in the family. I have never written a review of a book before but had to write this one. Every recipe I've tried has been outstanding. The illustrations are numerous. large and very helpful, and the recipes are clear and concise. I've learned there's a lot more to grilling than just putting something on the BBQ. Temperature and marinades make a world of difference. Steve Raichlen's corn on the cob recipe is the best. It goes against every expert who says to grill the corn in the husk. Try it. It's delicous. This book should be a requirement for any new griller or, for that matter, any old griller."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I like this book a lot. It has a lot of information for anyone who is fairly new to grilling the standards like ribs and brisket. However I get the feeling that even though the author says you can do it all on a gas grill - he really isn't a fan of them.For example alot of the recipes require long cooking times - sometimes up to six hours. Yet he doesn't mention how to tell if you have enought propane in your tank (you pour hot water on it and where it stays cold that is how much propan there is)And some of the recipies are a little far fetched. The author says he has gone to cooking school in France and certainly a lot of the recipes seem to be influenced by that. But I suspect that most people want to cook ribs, beer can chicken, brisket and the like.That being said he does include all the above mentioned dishes and has some very good recipes for rubs and sauces.Although just from reading the book I have a very strong urge to go out and get a smoker!!.One other side effect of the book - you will get hungry just reading it!!Happy Grillng...."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

And how do you arrange them?This book has chapters arranged by type of food (beef, chicken, sausage, pork, fish, vegetable and dessert. Dessert? Hey, dessert to me is ice cream and I won't be grilling that any time soon.) Then a chapter on gear like charcoal and gas grills. There is detail on how to do things like fajitas, london broil (our fave) and yes, the shrimp on the barbie. Hey, mine fell in!

I didn't like to cook ribs before, because I didn't really know how. Now I look forward to doing it again. Corn on the Cob with Herb Butter is excellent! Smoked a brisket that was wonderful.

Cookbook","review":"THIS REVIEW IS NOT BASED UPON CONTENT OF BOOK - I thought this would be great to have on Kindle, so I could access it wherever I might be (visiting friends, on vacation or discussing cooking w/ others). Unfortunately, as a reference book, this publication on Kindle simply doesn't work. In fact, it's extremely frustrating. The otherwise logical linking of content (not unusual for a cookbook) - for example, a recipe for marinade referenced in a recipe for a certain cut of meat - cannot be accessed in any reasonable way. The text references page numbers, which are absent from the Kindle. There could be embedded links to take a reader to the referenced material, but there are no links in this. Even trying to do a word search is very frustrating as you may find a number of results and there is no easy way to determine which of the results is related to what you are seeking. In sum, a waste of money. My confession: this is the first reference-type book I've tried on Kindle, so perhaps this deficiency in the product / application is well-known, but I naively thought that such a common use of hot links would be an obvious tool to make the Kindle presentation of the book superior even to the paper version. Alas, that opportunity is not realized with this."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

I picked this one up because I'd enjoyed his earlier books and thought I might pick up something new, I was sadly disappointed. It's not a bad book and if you don't have any other grilling books this is decent start, although personally I'd recommend The Thrill of the Grill by Schlessinger & Willoughby."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

I've used it cooking about twenty times for large groups of people.This is not to say that the rest of the book is not completely worthwhile... it is! The reason why I gave it 4/5 stars was because I was not satisfied with the amount of beef recipes in the book, I would have liked to see some more recipes for tri-tip. I liked the fact that the author spent so much time on seriously considering the layout of the pages, they are all easy-to-read and very concise with tons of color photos. There are also sections devotes to sauces, techniques, equipment, and even recommended desserts.Overall a must-have for fraternities, summer party-throwers, and BBQers everywhere."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Raichlen is all about fluff. Can there be ANY good reason to start every recipe wasting a page on how to light your grill and oil it? The recipes are nothing to write home about, in fact they rarely have anything to do with grilling as they could be prepared with any cooking appliance. I believe Raichlen's main goal is to prove a grill can be used too cook anything, like say playing 'Duelin' Banjos' on an electric organ. This is a big book - 500 pages. It should really be about 130. Does it have any saving graces? sure. There's a nice 2-page spread on the different cuts of steak. That's it. As an owner of this and many other grilling cookbooks I would not recommend it. My #1 recommended book is the Weber Real Grilling book. THAT is the book for anyone with a grill, gas or otherwise. It explains things without redundancy, has crafty recipes, and gives decisive directions. It's also crammed full, not a lot of fluff like all of Raichlen's work."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Each technique and recipe comes with complete instructions, including plenty of photos to show you the process and what it looks like.I felt that this book was a little lite on the recipes. Seems to me each technique or food could have come with 2 -4 recipes, instead of 1. Other than that, this is my favorite grilling book. The recipes that are included are excellent.

That said the Stateside world of barbecue is rich and wonderful and I can't imagine a better book to get you started with \\"real\\" barbecue than DrBBQ's Slow Fire. Ray Lampe is definitely the man - he writes wonderfully well, is passionate about barbecue, is a master pit master, and a great teacher - I acquired a used Big Green Egg to replace an aging Weber Kettle thinking I was getting a grill - to my delight what I got was also a terrific barbecue - if you don't have a ceramic barbecue/grill you will still appreciate this book because Ray demystifies barbecue and shows you how to do real barbecue using almost any kind of cooking device. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I absolutely love this book. It gives very clear, step-by-step instructions. And I haven't been disappointed with anything I've made yet. I was a complete grilling beginner when I got this book - all I had cooked was burgers, brats, steaks, chicken breats - the usual. But this book took my grilling skills to the next level and maybe even another level beyond that. The book explains direct vs. indirect grilling, gives the temperatures for low, medium and high-heat cooking, gives recipes for meats, veggies, sauces, rubs, and even desserts. It has a listing of grilling accessories, a picture of each and the use of each. It tells you everything you need to know whether you use charcoal, propane or a smoker.The very first recipe I made, because its one of the first ones in the book, was prime rib. I was nervous because this is not a cheap cut of meat and this was my very first time smoking anything. But I followed the directions exactly and the meat I ended up with was amazing. Everyone who ate it said it was the best prime rib they had ever had. And some of the diners were true prime rib lovers.I have since made salmon with mustard dill sauce (I think the recipe is for how to cook fish with the skin on), eggplant with caprese salsa (my first experience with eggplant - yum!), grilled corn on the cob (fast and delicious because it's basted with herbed butter while you grill it), bourbon brined pork chops (OMG this one is amazing), and spare ribs (not quite fall of the bone, but excellent). Everything I've made has turned out incredibly well. It makes me look like a grilling rock star!I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

My son in law used it and was very pleased."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"At first I almost called this a great basic grilling book. To be honest, I think this book has changed the definition of a &quot;basic grilling book&quot;, simply because while it shows the burgers, etc. that most experienced grill cooks know, it also shows other foods that really are a natural for the grill - expanding the envelope of what really is basic. Many different foods are shown, but nothing is redundant and every subtlety in preparation is explained - giving each recipe a reason for belonging. (ie there aren't seperate recipes for hot dog, cheese dog, and chili dog because there aren't 3 different techniques involved).The layout and format are simply outstanding - done, again, in what seems to be a &quot;basic grilling book&quot; format. Tons of color pictures showing various techniques. You want to know how to grill chicken breasts? Bam! It's right there. Bone-in chicken? Whole chicken? Chicken sate? Chicken wings? All there.And for the more seasoned cook, there are new things as well. Recipes like rum-cured smoked salmon and turkey pastrami are a few non-everyday recipes that are quite excellent. And yes, I've tried many of the recipes and they've all come out quite well. In addition, there are plenty of notes and comments that will bring any cook to a higher level.One note, however. I also bought his 'The Barbecue! Bible' book, and it appears that most of the recipes are also in that book as well, albeit not as nicely illustrated and laid out. I still, though, use both quite frequently (the photos on cutting up a whole chicken are just one of the things that are better in this book)."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"What the Barbecue Bible! was to inspiration, How to Grill is to technique. Written around 100+ grilling and barbecue techniques this book provides the Backyard Barbecue Chef with an arsenal capable of cooking just about any cut of meat to perfection. In his conversational style the author takes the reader through the process of selecting and preparing the meat, using rubs and marinades and best applying fire to food. After reading this book you will have the ability and knowledge to treat each cut of meat with a cooking technique that will best enhance the natural traits of the food.Be warned that this book is a little biased toward the charcoal grill, but most of the recipes can be done on a gas grill if that is your taste. In addition it is primarily a book about grilling. The author only touches on advanced cooking techniques such as barbecuing and smoking. He does however treat rotisserie grilling very thoroughly. The section on materials is short but does provide the basic information you will need to know before cooking outdoors.All told this book is an excellent guide to the fine art of grilling. It is an essential reference manual for both the beginner and advanced cook."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

I own several grilling books, including Barbecue Bible by the author, and have had many successes. But until I got this book I never knew how great grilling could be. Things I have done and especially those I never thought of doing or attempting -- like a whole chicken or turkey or pineapple -- are explained in such great (and color!) detail that I am rethinking every possibility and doing it all better than before. There must be at least six photos or more for every technique -- and the details are helpful even when I am not following the recipes like skewering shrimp or chicken wings. The asparagus &quot;rafts&quot; were a real eye opener and have already saved dozens from a firey fate. Every time you grill you should check this book, not just to find a recipe but just to brush up or learn how to do anything on the grill.

The only quam some might have is the challenge of finding some of the ingredients. Well, not only are there usually substitutions that he points out, but often-times you can just ommit the ingredient all-together and still get perfectly fine results.This book is also great because it's geared towards a very broad audience. A novice should have little problem churning out mouthwatering meals, also a grilling guru (or \\"grill jockey\\") will likely stumble across new techniques to help their dishes taste even better. Also, this book starts off be teaching the most basic grill techniques, such as setting up a 3-zone fire, indirect grilling...etc.It gets better... Everything in this book is made from scratch. Not only will you learn how to apply the right BBQ sauces, rubs, marinades, mop sauces...etc to your dishes, you also learn how to make each and every one! The basic BBQ sauce is hardly \\"basic\\" like the name implies, it is the single tastiest BBQ sauce I have tried!I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Should really be called \\"How to Barbecue\\". While Stephen Raichelen has written many books on culinary creations, he has managed with \\"How to Grill\\" to demystify the process of actual barbecue. This is no mere book on how to enjoy your backyard cookout, HTG is a step by step text book detailing and illustrating all the steps you need to go through to produce mouthwatering 'Q, from the types of grill, (gas, smokers, kettles etc...) to the meats, vegetables, fruits, marinades and rubs, fuels, sauces, serving ideas, not to mention items you would never even think of grilling. To those who crave real 'Q and more importantly, the to those who simply love to create it, this is your reference book. I have spent hundreds of 12 hour days with this book creating my own rubs, making my own sauces, drinking beer, getting sunburt, smelling like smoke, lovingly tending to my ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken, leg of lamb, whole pig, veggies, fruits or anything else you can image that just tastes better on a grill. Real BBQ is A LOT OF WORK!! But for some it is a labor of love that is always worth the effort when you have your guests sit down and take their first bite of pork spare ribs that taste like they're from the best rib joint in Memphis. Pulled pork right out of Lexington North Carolina, Brisket that would make any Texan sit up straight.Raichlen also has other BBQ books, such as BBQ USA, and the BBQ Bible, both are outstanding additions to HTG with more localized recipies, but if you own just ONE gril/BBQ book \\"How to Grill\\" is the one."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

This book is grilling 101, and it teaches you how to do everything right. So the recipes ARE basic but they are good and if you follow the directions, they will turn out fine. Most important, you will get the skills to move on to bigger and better things. A real cook has knowledge of the quirks of what he is cooking and what the techniques he is using do, and this book will teach it."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

He would have laughed himself silly. He lets you know how to grill correctly so some jerk like me doesn't hassel you when you're behind the grill. Very good buy and a great gift. Grilling rules!!!"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Despite it's popularity as a best seller, I think this book is rather over-rated.STRENGTHS:* This book has lots of comforting full-color photographs for the benefit of culinarily adventerous n00bs.* This books covers a fairly broad array of grilling recipes ... meat, fish, vegetables, fruit ... there's a little bit of something for almost everyone, which is exactly what they set out to do, in order to maximize sales. Charcoal is preferred, but this book is minimally gas friendly too ... but only if your burners are of the front-to-rear variety. If they're side to side, you're SOL when it comes to most 'indirect heat' techniques.* Some of the recipes are actually pretty tasty, which partially compensates for some of the serious flaws listed below. One standout for me is the whole butterflied marinated leg of lamb (which I've since improved upon). Nice recipe, but too much scallion.NITS:* This books sacrifices depth for breadth - in other words, it covers a LOT of turf, but none of it exhaustively or well.* This book is heavily and gratuitously padded with needlessly repetative and unnecessary fluff. Case in point - virtually every recipe says to start your grill, and then wastes a FULL PAGE repeating, over and over and over again (with the same color photos) how to start and bank a 2 or 3-tier charcoal fire, for direct or indirect grilling. Cutting out that wasted repitition would have left room for (I kid you not) at least 33% more recipes, for the same page count. Can you say \\"RIP OFF\\" ? I knew you could.* The photographer they hired is a cheater, and a gimick-hound, and nothing irks me faster than photographs (and cookbooks that use them) that lie and deceive. Case in point - if you look any almost any of the close-ups, you will spot right away that most of the grilled items were BAKED (not grilled) off camera, and that the food photographer merely made them APPEAR grilled by branding them with hot wires, and then laying them on a stone-cold-never-before-used grill. There are, however, a few very helpful sequences ... such as the one on how to prep and grill a whole baby lamb (something I'm looking forward to attempting sometime this coming year).* Some of the recipes are just plain absurd. I mean come on - what [...]-retentive cook is going to butterfly a dozen hot dogs, stuff them with cheese and jalepeno slices, tie them closed, grill them (somehow without making a total mess), and then de-string and serve them before the cheese hardens back up again ? HELLO ?"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I've got a bunch of grill books, some fancy, some basic, but this one is the best I've seen yet. Steven Raichlen has been around the world gathering an incredible amount of grilling/barbecuing knowledge. But what's knowledge without application? It's all in the book. I've made several of the recipes from How To Grill including the bourbon brined pork steaks, mustard crusted T-bones, brazilian shrimp and yes, beercan chicken. It's hard to imagine life before beercan chicken. All recipes have been simple to prepare and wonderful to eat. The step-by step photos are enormously helpful. Congratulations to Mr. Raichlen and his photographer, Greg Schneider, for making such a foolproof book that you'll use alot. The Barbecue Bible is good too.

Ribs were so good my dad from the Kansas City area (where they know how to BBQ) had to buy a copy. I didn't like to cook ribs before, because I didn't really know how. Now I look forward to doing it again. Corn on the Cob with Herb Butter is excellent! Smoked a brisket that was wonderful. I'm still working up the cajones to try a Prime Rib - I'm sure it'll turn out great with Steve's help!The pictures and instructions with every recipe are great.

The book covers beef and veal, pork and sausages, lamb, poultry, fish, shellfish, vegetables, dessert, and rubs, sauces, and condiments. A unique recipe is included for each cut of meat that I could think of, and many cuts have multiple recipes that cover different techniques (e.g. 4 recipes/methods for cooking a whole chicken).Actually, the book doesn't contain that many recipes (100 or so) for a cookbook. It makes up for this by doing an excellent job of explaining grilling and preparation techniques (and equipment). Instructions are clear and the pictures are helpful too.

Cookbook","review":"Like most any other American man, I assumed I knew all there is to know about charcoal grilling. Well, this book took me from a hamburger flipper to the talk of the neighborhood. I suggest just about anyone who likes to grill buy this book. The book is very good on different levels. The recipes are great. Besides that, the author gives you a thourough run down of grilling on all types of grills. He goes into detail about fire building. If you build a fire the way he says, you'll find that you don't even need a thermometer to cook. He'll tell you in the recipe to build (for example) a direct medium fire. Then he'll tell you to grill your meat (for example) 5 minutes on each side. Build the fire right (easy) and flip the meat on time, and your dinner will come out EXACTLY how the author said it would. It just doesn't get more precise than that. He also discusses how to grill almost every type of meat before he gets you started on the recipe. For example, a lot of people really don't know what to do with London Broil. Before he starts on the recipe, he tells you what it is, how it's cooked, and how it's carved. And he tells you WHY. Even if you don't want to use his recipe, you leave knowing what to do with any London Broil. His recipes are delicious, and not excessively snobbish/gourmet. If you grill, buy this book."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Cookbook","review":"While Steven Raichlen is a grilling maestro, and this book is great for people learning how to grill, I just didn't like it. I thought that it tries to do too much. Furthermore, I felt that the recipes he presents are a little on the snobby side and less like something that someone who wants to grill out regularly will do. Lastly, I disagree with some of his methods.When I say that he tries to do too much, I feel that he's trying to cater to too many people. Gas or charcoal? Beef, chicken, pork, or other? I could go on and on. I understand that he's trying to cater to a broad variety of people, but it seems silly to me. The idea of the book is to show people the proper way to grill different things, but I feel that he somewhat losses his way in trying to please too many tastes. He should have made some basic assumptions at the beginning and stuck with those throughout. Additionally, in restating so much broad information so often, he loses some very important specific information in the process. A great example of this is how actually control temperature precisely on your grill, which is a direct function of his not picking a certain type of grill to teach on. Being an experienced griller and barbecuer I've learned, but if the function of a book is to teach do it! Don't force the reader to learn from their own mistakes, that's why the author is expert, he's already made the mistakes so you don't have to.As for the recipes and information presented, Raichlen often refers to his experiences abroad and in gourmet kitchens. The problem is that the majority of the people that by this book just want to learn how to use their grills more properly. As stated above, rather than teach people how to use their grills, Raichlen specifically (in a very general way oddly enough) teaches the reader some very specific meals. I understand that the idea is to use those experiences and then apply them to other meals, but seriously, who would ever think of grilling some of the dishes in the manner that he purposes? Instead, he should have done it like Gary Wiviott does in \\"Low and Slow\\" and shown people exactly how to use the grill for a certain type of food, but given the reader the option of what rubs, spices, marinades, etc to use. My tastes might be pedestrian compared to Raichlen's, but then again I feel that most people want something a little more simple than the snobby meals that Raichlen proposes for the grill. It's a grill, not a French Cuisine!Lastly, and this is purely method, but it drives me nuts that he always says to use soaked wood chips and chunks! That is seriously disgusting and will only lead to bad tasting food! By soaking the wood one introduces water into the fire (I use charcoal, people who use gas grills need not apply, they don't count anyway) which causes smoldering. Smoldering charcoal and wood produces creosol, which Raichen actually talks about! Unfortunately, for all the snobby tastes that he presents his tastebuds must not pick up this musty and bitter taste.All in all, while this book is decent at presenting methods and ways to produce some relatively specific meals, I feel that it does a so-so job at best in teaching the reader to actually grill. the methods, while sound, aren't present very well, and don't expound into better ways to create the dishes shown. Lastly, while I do have a somewhat poor opinion of this book, for the seasoned griller and barbecuer this book can be interpreted and used to make some pretty good food if you know how to make up for Raichlen's short comings in his recipes and grill tactics.My suggestion to Mr. Raichlen is that he spend more time on teach process, less on specific recipes, and completely stop mass producing sub standard books on grilling."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

But despite our love for all types of foods, we noticed that we seemed to stick to the usual fair whenever we grilled (burgers, steaks, the occasional chicken quarters, etc). We recently purchased a new, beautiful gas grill, so I decided there was no better time than the present to learn more about &quot;the art of grilling&quot;. We weren't amateurs to the grill at all, but at the same time, there were many techniques that we knew we needed to learn, plus it would help if we had more recipes to try, then we could expand upon whatever knowledge we already had.I researched several &quot;how to&quot; grilling books online, and my first choice was &quot;How to Grill&quot; by Steven Raichlen. Unfortunately, when I ordered it, it was sold out and there was no word on when it would become available. I then decided to purchase my second choice &quot;Weber's Art of the Grill.&quot;That was about a month ago, and since then I have managed to buy a copy of Raichlen's &quot;How to Grill.&quot; In comparing both of them, I think Raichlen's book is indeed well-written and comprehensive, providing some excellent recipes and great tips and techniques. However, I was disappointed by the fact that on each recipe, he gives the same instructions on how to light the grill...over and over again (seems like other readers have noticed this, too). Also, I wish the book were bigger as in the size. (The size reminded me more of a software manual than a cookbook. I expected something &quot;larger&quot;). In parts, the book is extremely rudimentary in it's instruction, too. Because of these things, I pefer Weber's book more as it appears to be written more for those that already have a some grasp of the basics of grilling, plus it isn't redundant in it's instruction. The pictures and the recipes are equalling delicious in both (try the buffalo chicken wings. WOW!), but it seems that Raichlen really favors charcoal grills and makes that point quite clear in his book. I also found that with almost all of Raichlen's recipes, we would have to add at least an hour of cooking time for us to achieve the same results. Could it be because we are cooking on gas? I don't know...the temp on the thermometer still read the same *shrug*.Despite the above, I agree that if you're looking for an all-around comprehensive book to have as a guide to grilling basics, I recommend Raichlen's book as a great resource to have in your cookbook library."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Great recipes, a must for any level of outdoor cooking. This beginner learned a great deal from this excellent book. Thanks."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I own quite a few quickbooks and I have to say this is my favorite. The best thing about this book (besides the excellent recipes) is all of the photos. A lot of cookbooks are just text with maybe a picture of the finished product. How to Grill show's you step by step how to do it.

I am a long time griller, but I find there is much to learn in this book and the recipes are getting me new raves."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Before I get critical about this author, let me make one thing clear: His recipes and grilling techniques are great. I've used his recipes for veggies and seafood (try the soft-shell crab thing) and they are second to none---that is, if you like charcoal or propane. I gave up charcoal years ago, still use propane, but love the wood-fired taste of wood pellets. I use a Traeger, have cooked on a Royale and recommend them if you can get them on sale. I also cook on a 12 year old Weber Silver B propane unit, mostly for quick-to-cook items like 'brats and 'burgers. Despite what the wood pellet manufacturer's say, it's easier,faster and cheaper to use gas when cooking a hot dog.That being said, nothing beats a pork loin slow-cooked on a wood pellet cooker. Nothing. I've been doing it for ten years, and the oven-like system of a wood pellet cooker is superior to the similar indirect cooking system of gas.Charcoal...take a hike. (Gonna get some response on that one.)So what's my beef? Well, I figure if a writer's going to sell a book, host a show and teach folks how to cook, it should be all about cooking on everything that's out there.Mr. Raichlen left out pellet cookers. Why? Well, look at his show, and you'll see nothing but Weber's. I like Weber barbeques. I like propane. I like wood pellets.Mr. Raichlen obviously got sponsored and paid by Weber to do his thing, and I understand that making a few bucks is good. I hope he did well.Get this: Steven, now that you've made a few bucks with sponsorship, get honest and include all facets and ways of outdoor cooking in your next publication. Try something new.And for what it's worth, the author's fetish for \\"grill marks\\" is just that: a fetish. Weird. People don't eat grill marks. People eat food. Anyway, it's a great barbeque cookbook with wonderful recipes. I recommend it for the recipes, but wish he weren't so \\"sponsored.\\"Oh well, gotta make a buck."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

I mean EVERY recipe includes 3 pictures of setting the coals for different heat patterns - c'mon people! This is my biggest complaint - but I add to it the fact that I have a big gas grill (setup for Natural Gas) and perhaps only 50% of the book is applicable.As far as the rest of this review goes - read the review by \\"Darby\\" (maybe number 3?) and I really concur with most of what he said. He rates it at 4 stars but I put \\"The Steamy Kitchen\\" at 4 stars and this isn't nearly that good - so it only gets 3 stars.

I just got my first grill recently, and this book is going to be my source and inspiration for any upcoming meals."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Steven Raichlen is the master of barbecue- if you've seen his PBS show, Barbecue U, you know that he is the real deal. This book is a great resource for beginners and old pros alike. Every recipe is accompanied by extensive color photos, making complicated topics, such as stuffing and tying a tenderloin, seem easy. The book is also very comprehensive in its menu of things to grill, from meats, poultry, and shellfish, to fruits, vegetables, and dessert- yes, there's even a recipe for grilled creme brulee. If I had one caveat, it would be that this book is more about grilling than smoking- so while there are many recipes that involve indirect cooking of meats, they are vastly outnumbered by direct grilling recipes. If you are, like me, more interested in slow cooking ribs, pork shoulders, and brisket, then you might be more happy with a book that deals specifically with those topics. All in all, though, if you're seriously into barbecue, this is a must have resource for your library."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I have about a half dozen grilling cookbooks. I enjoy them all, and when I'm planning a menu I look through each one. But I find that I end up using the recipes and techniques in this book almost every time.The recipes are top-notch. They're special without fussiness with delicious results that don't leave you exhausted from cooking. Plus, Raichlen's instructions make you understand the techniques of grilling, rather than feeling like you ought to slavishly follow every step. EVERYthing has pictures, too.Best of all, this is a very affordable book. You can spend more, but I don't think you'll find anything better."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

Googeling BBQ,and Charcole grills, led me to Steve Raichlen's web site where I read enough good information to know I wanted one of his books to start. Other reviews I had read here, helped me decide which of his books I wanted. Great photo's, simple yet interesting instructions,and a dash of background not only take the mystery out of grilling and smoking, but also add color and readability. This is a great book for anyone, noobie or bonafide grill miester, with recipies for both more traditional BBQ, and some real show stopping exotics your friends and neighbors arn't likely to have seen before.

Cookbook","review":"I have owned the book now for ~6 years and I am on my third copy. What can I say about most funnest rewarding book I own other than the recipes and techniques included are just top notch. I went from being completely clueless novice to being able to consistently deliver great tasting quality food right off the grill.The most rememberable recipes for me are:Prosciutto Wrapped Scallops - These kill everytime.Lemongrass Beef Sates - This is the one where ppl are like \\"Wow I never had anything like this before\\".Sesame Asparagus - Real hard to top.Grilled Corn - Never grill in the husk. (Then you are steaming not grilling).Tuscan-Style Steak - He uses porterhouse in the recipe but I have great results with Tri-Tip.The JERK - Raichlen's jerk recipe is the best I have seen and I have used it on chicken and pork. It is EXCELLENT.The Smoked Turkey, The Smoked Spare Ribs, and The Smoked Salmon are again all EXCELLENT. I cannot say if one was better than the other. Smoking does take your game up a notch for the taste and the affect. Any tailgate now requires something to be smoked.Those recipes are all winners and you cannot go wrong with them.So yeah what else can I say. Six years of fairly frequent grilling/smoking almost exclusively with this book and I have still have not come close making everything. Raichlen has truly made a masterpiece that I have found rewarding beyond measure.Now that I am thinking about it. I should probably carry some copies around with the grill. So I can sell them. It would make the world a better place."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

You don't need anything else (except a BBQ pit, charcoal, utensils, and something to cook!)"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"Steven Raichlen has a recipe for hamburgers in \\"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques.\\" I made it tonight. It is two recipes, really. One for a butter-herb spread and one for the hamburgers incorporating the butter-herb.He points out rightfully how most us would love to be great grillmasters deliver rack after rack of great ribs and other time-consuming dishes. Mostly, though, our grill is putting out burgers. Why not improve the humble burger?He surmised the problem with most backyard burger grilling is dried-out meat. His solution: mix a stick of butter with herbs, and then hide a slice of the mixture inside the burger. This allows a high heat while keeping things moist and flavorful from the inside.It worked. I'll never just slap on flattened ground beef my Weber again. This recipe just shot to the top of my repertoire.Every recipe is do-able, with step-by-step pictures, suggestions when we can't get certain ingredients, and techniques for getting everything right.If you watch his PBS how-to shows, some of it will look familiar.For the beginner griller, learn the basics. Not only will readers understand food, but also the equipment involved with a healthy section on gear and how to source grilling tools. For the veteran grillmaster, gain appreciation of new ways of doing an old thing. All the expected sections are here: beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and so on. He separates shellfish from regular fish. The techniques are largely different, even though some of the cuisines overlap.I fully recommend \\"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques \\" by Steven Raichlen.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

My only dislike with this book is that it is SO big that it is hard to store and certainly not a book to read in bed (yes, I read cookbooks in bed. And lots of other books!) Another \\"like\\" about this book is that it has a lot of basic info if you are a beginner, but goes into more advanced receipes for the experienced.

For someone who didn't know my ass from my elbow when it came to grilling, this was the perfect primer. I don't know about you, but I grew up and my Dad grilled. That was his THING. My mom would do everything else, but the grill was a man's world with beer, and ribs, and sauce and charcoal and men. So when I got my first grill post-college, I had no idea what I was doing, just that I wanted hot dogs that were a little blackened on one side and grilled shrimp. Who doesn't love grilled shrimp???So after several attempts of attempting to grill and either A1) Burning the living crap out of the food or B2) Leaving the food hopelessly raw in the middle despite what seemed like HOURS of cooking, I bought this cookbook.He talks about EVERYTHING - the difference between direct and indirect grilling, how to grill on a charcoal grill or smoke on a charcoal grill or a gas grill. He even tells you how to clean the damn thing. He is very, very thorough, so for the novice, this book is heaven.His recipes are also amazing. Burgers with herb butter? Um, yes please. Mo-jo marinated pork tenderloin? Absolutely. And of course - New Orleans style BBQ shrimp.

Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible! Cookbook","review":"I bought a gas grill for my husband for father's day, and bought How to Grill.......bbq techniques on Amazon. Together they were the perfect gift because he knows very little about cooking let alone grilling. The book tells the basics as well as great recipes, illustration and helpful tips. We now do bbq/grilling every weekend and enjoy it. He is now getting really good with his dishes. Even I like reading the book because of the tips."},{"Title":"How to Grill: The Complete Illustrated Book of Barbecue Techniques, A Barbecue Bible!

This is a must have for anyone who wants to cook out."},{"Title":"Win the Weight Game : Successful Strategies for Living Well","review":"This is a wonderful book. I think that Sarah Ferguson,(teamed with Weight Watchers),does an excellent job discussing the psychological aspects/roots of weight gain, loss, and management. Her personal experiences and feelings enhance the content. Chapter 3, titled, &quot;My Mother, My Weight&quot;, is extremely insightful and useful. The weight issue seems to be passed from generation, and I will try to use the information she presents to break this cycle in my own family."},{"Title":"Win the Weight Game : Successful Strategies for Living Well","review":"While sometimes I pondered over just how much of this book Sarah Ferguson wrote by herself,it is very helpful and practical. Most diet books are so difficult to follow, as good as they are. This one is not. And for the first time I've ever seen in a diet book, the author explains our eating behaviors exclusively from the female perspective. Perhaps the best part of this book is how to prevent weight-teasing and body anxiety in both your children and yourself. The book is very short (I read it in one day and I work!) but I really enjoyed it. The only problem I had with it is that they recommend diet sodas and other aspartame sweetened products in order to cut sugar and calories. They shouldn't promote using chemicals to control weight! Otherwise, a perfectly sensible diet plan I can't imagine not working for anyone."},{"Title":"Win the Weight Game : Successful Strategies for Living Well","review":"I bought Sarah's first two books written in conjunction with Weight Watcers and haven't regretted it. This book too, was well worth the money.This book addresses the real psycological issues and gives practical, usable advice on how to fight your food demons at 1:00 in the morning and at your favorite restaurant.Sarah is a wonderful role-model, she's conquered her weight issues and has accepted that you don't need to be pencil-thin to be healthy or attractive.The recipes, a mixture of exotic and simple, are as always a delight.She makes WW's 1-2-3 success program well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Win the Weight Game : Successful Strategies for Living Well","review":"This book is so tiresome. I'm so tired of the same diet books recycling the same message- control your weight- be happy! There is more to life than controlling your weight but you'd never know living in our culture or looking at the besteller lists. Try reading Simple Abundance or the Mass Market Woman. Those books are far better than wasting all your time, money and effort on trying to fight with your body all the time."},{"Title":"Oldsmobile Cutlass '74'88 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"My advice is to save your money and buy the Chilton's. Better yet try to find used versions of the original single model year Chilton's or Motor's Manuals that were sold to professionals for the specific year(s) you require. A major problem I see with this book is trying to cover too many model years in too few pages. If you have a 1981 to 1988 Cutlass you definitley want to look elsewhere. Chapter 13 is titled \\"Revisions and information on later models\\", which means everything from 1981 to 1988, a total of 38 pages of which 4 pages are specifications and 18 are full page electrical schematics of \\"Typical later model\\" items, of which most are of no value. Unless you just want a book to use as filler on your automotive shelf this book won't be of much value. Just one man's opinion."},{"Title":"Oldsmobile Cutlass '74'88 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"Manual is good in some areas like engine maintenance, but lacking details in most others. Example: 7 lines of information on how to remove and install rear stabilizer bar. Just to many years to cover in one book."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I couldn't even be bothered to finish it.

This book answered all of the WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHY and HOW. The author was on point with each of these men. Yes, he used his commentary to help paint a picture so you can better understand what each of them was going through. Finally, I enjoyed the method used. He used the \\"WHAT IF\\" method. By using this method, it gave the painting clarity."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I really liked this book. I had never given much thought to some of these men.

In fact for the number of years ago that this was written - it felt that he was talking about the many things we face society today. Sometimes he appeared to get off the subject but then I found out that it was really relevant to what he was bringing out. The men that he comments on - are not the ones that one would think that he would comment on. This book reallyinspired me to delve deeper into the lives of these men's lives and to understand how God used the circumstances in their lives to draw them into His holiness and to use these men to inspire others to follow a Holy and Righteous God."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"Great perspective of a lost generation's outlook of our Saviour Jesus Christ!

Good study material for any Christian who wants to dig deeper in God's word."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"This is an outstanding work that will edify anyone who reads it.

I was lost before I read the information & looked into the book. Thanks again. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"Here's the thing I especially like about Dwight Lyman Moody: He tells it like it is. He was not a pastor that tiptoed around an issue, nor did he have long flowery sermons. He always went right to the heart of the manner in such a straightforward way. So I was delighted to find the his book Men Of The Bible was written in this characteristic style.Men Of The Bible digs into the lives of several men we read about in Scripture. Some of them are prominent, and some are rather obscure; some were godly men, and some were not. But in every instance, Moody gets right to the key points of their lives, and then shows us how to apply them.Since the focus of the book is the men of the Bible, this would be an excellent resource for a men's Bible study, or a small group meeting; although I think anyone would benefit from studying this very readable book."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I've read women of the bible and wanted to see what was said about the men of the bible. very interesting."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"Moody was a powerful preacher and teacher who had great influence on Christianity.

Moody's Men of the Bible isn't about all of the men of the Bible, but of Abraham, Moses, Naaman, Nehemiah, Herod (Antipas)and John the Baptist, the Man Born Blind and Joseph of Arimathea, the Penitent Thief.The are not biographies, but extended sermons on these men. Herod and John, Blind Man and Joseph are two paired sets that contrast and compare the two. They do not sound preachy, even if they are sermons, instead examining the lives of these men for the lessons we can gain from them. And are well done at that. The Blind man for example actually brought out more than most commentaries covering him and how he was healed and then examined by the Pharisees. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"D.L. Moody is one of the leading theologians of the past 100 years. You will LOVE this book. Thorough and well-organized.

It is a great tool in the use of studying the character and lives of several of the patriarchs in the OT as well as some men of the NT.

It only takes a few hours to read this book, but by doing so you could change your entire life."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"This is a slim volume, which reads more like a sermon than a text book.

Starting at about age one, my children would pull this book off the shelf day after day, pouring over the pictures. They loved the covers right off of each copy. We used it as a sort of rudimentary \\"I Spy\\" book -- \\"I spy an animal with horns,\\" or \\"I spy something blue.\\" It taught my children scores of early vocabulary words. I agree with a previous poster that it is not the kind of book that you read cover to cover in one sitting, but it is more of a reference book for the pre-school set.It was my go-to first birthday present for many years, and I am disappointed that it is no longer in print. Please bring it back, DK!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My 19-month-old LOVES this book and has loved it for the past six months. Already she says \\"butterfly,\\" \\"circle,\\" \\"airplane,\\" \\"zebra\\" and \\"banana\\" along with the easier words like keys, shoe, ball, etc.One of her favorite things to do is play sort of a \\"seek-and-find.\\" I'll give her the book closed and say, \\"Em, find me the apple.\\" She'll sit and diligently start combing through the book until she finds what she is looking for, then point and say \\"apple.\\" (\\"Apple\\" was her first real word beyond \\"Da-Da\\"). She'll play this game for quite some time.Anyway, I recommend this book (and most of the other DK \\"first\\" book publications) to anyone with very small children. It is never too soon to start teaching a love of books."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We were so happy receiving this book in the mail for our newborn.

She learned lots from it since she was 16 months."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I am teaching a refugee couple from Africa who are in their forties. They have never gone to school. They have spoken English all their lives, but language learned without literacy is far less exact. Final sounds are lost. \\"It\\" and \\"is\\" and \\"in\\" all sound the same.This book was the best find for teaching them the names of familiar objects. It has nice bright illustrations that are readily identified. The page layouts show many objects (but not too many) clearly, and the accompanying names are close enough to each object so as not to be confused with others.It is a true visual dictionary and does not rely on verbal explanations at all.It was the best I found for this specific purpose. And my students were thrilled with it."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"What a wonderful book for babies 12 years and up! My daugter points to the pictures and verbalizes them. She relates what is in the book to real life. Great vocabulary booster! All young children should have this book!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We have a few of the \\"My First\\" books and they are perfect for young toddlers who are learning new words.

Great books and I would recommend to anyone with a child learning to talk!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My baby loves this book. She loves looking at the pictures, she points to them and I say the word to her.

I bought two: one for my 2 year old daughter and one for my 6 years old niece. She will start to learn English in september at Elementary school and this book is great, with so many words. I intend to buy this book for my other niece because I think it's just great. Specially for kids who learn English as a second language. And I found few words I didn't know..."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We had checked out this book at our local library and my daughter loved it so much that we renewed it as many times as we could. When the time came that we had to return it, I bought it here on Amazon. She loves pointing at the pictures and telling me what they are. It's a great tool for learning words!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I am a speech therapist who works with preschoolers. I bought the most recent edition of this book, having used the first edition until duct ape would no longer hold it together. My chief complaint about the first edition was that it used many photographs of toys rather than the of real objects.The current edition uses photographs of the real items, but I felt it actually used too many for my purposes. It has many photographs of scenes in various locations. This makes them too busy for many of the kids I work with; there is too much happening for us to be able to focus on only one or two objects or actions. The first edition featured pages full of pictures that were isolated on the page rather than embedded in scenes. I prefer the context-free format.I was also disappointed with some of the vocabulary categories. Do preschoolers really need two pages of Places that feature Rocky Desert, Dry Desert, a Geyser and more? I could offer more examples here, but I've already given the book away to my niece.Having pointed out my reservations, let me mention some of this books strengths. It does cover a lot of vocabulary; more than the first edition did. The pictures are all of the highest quality. It is a fine book.If you want to share this book with a child whose vocabulary and language skills are average or above average, then I can recommend this book. However, for my purposes of teaching children whose skills are delayed, it just does not fill the bill."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I bought several of these type board books for my 2 year old speech delayed daughter. We are currently working on building her vocabulary, and this book has been one of the best because it not only catagorizes the objects (as mentioned in another review), but it also has full color photographs. Young children are unable to distinguish that an abstract drawing of a cow is a cow, but with photographs of actual items they can more clearly understand and label the objects.This book is durable, colorful, and has many many pictures to help give my daughter the vocabulary she needs to communicate with us. She loves to &quot;read&quot; her book, and now her older sister is reading it to her, which also helps my seven year old in her reading skills."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My one-year-old enjoys looking at this book, though he doesn't have the attention span for me to point out everything on the page every time. I have two complaints though--one is that the photos are very small in this board book format--the monkey, for example, is really hard to see. The other is that the objects photographed are VERY European-looking. The bicycle doesn't look anything like an American bike, the perfume bottle is unrecognizable, the ice cream looks like three macaroons in a bowl, the telephone is a red and black dial phone, etc. I think it would've been better to have American-looking drawings than these European photos."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My 4 year old had a bigger version of this book when he was 1 and I recently bought this version for my twin 1 year old daughters and as a gift for an 18 month old. The pictures are clear, bright, and simple and really hold your child's attention. The thing I like best about this book is that it arranges items in categories rather than by letter. A 1 year old doesn't care that apple starts with &quot;A&quot; as shown in many books, s/he needs to know that an apple is food or that a sock is clothing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. You will reap many times your investment from it. I think it is a must have for your little one's library."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We read this book often but never all the way through. We skip around a lot. It can be overwhelming since it offers tons of material. I agree with the reviewer who gets bored with it. (Let's face it, a 1000 words with no plot can get a bit dry for an adult!) Some other reviewers complained about the illustrations or plastic figures -- these don't bother me since there is so much to see, you don't really miss anything if you skip that stuff.I do suggest a better alternative if you really want to capture the heart and mind of a toddler and help to expand their vocabulary. Find a topic they love and get a smaller, more focussed book on that topic. For example, my 2 year old loves vehicles. He picked out &quot;My Big Machine Book&quot; at the bookstore and he runs it into my room to read everyday!Summary: Good for what it is, but I'd recommend several smaller more focussed board books instead."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My 15 month old son loves this book and the others in the series (My first ABC and My First Animals). He will not sit still for any other picture book. Living near a farm, it was important to us that he see &quot;real&quot; animals in his books that he could easily associate with the ones he visits. He recognizes these pictures and is beginning to use the appropriate words for each. We love it and have given it as a gift to other parents of young children."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"This book has been wonderful for our little girl who we adopted from Romania at age 3 1/2 years. She only spoke three words in Romanian. This book has helped her make sense of her new surroundings by seeing photgraphs and learning the words. She loves to find the foods, animals and toys that she likes and to name them. I would highly recommend this book for every child as well as second language learner. There is no guessing about what the pictures are as almost everything is real. The few drawings are very clear and understandable. There is a Spanish version that gives the Spanish and the English word. I am an elementary principal and I ordered multiples of this book for each of my kindergarten through second grade classrooms. 90% of our students have Spanish as a first language so it has been great to share with our families. Our parents use it as a reference, too, to learn English!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We have had the book since our first boy was born. It has been literally torn to shreads since he has read it more than any other book. I am continually amazed as he pulls it out of the pile again and again to look at all the pictures. Kids love details and he notices them all. The book is full of intricate pictures and he and his brother love to pore over it for a long time. I came online just now to buy another copy since ours has lasted only three years and he still loves it. Maybe the publisher would consider a version made of rip-stop nylon?"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"DK publishes the popular \\"My First Word Books\\" series, made up of word lists illustrated with brightly colored photographs. They are intended as a tool to help children develop vocabulary. Although many preverbal children do enjoy looking at the books, I believe they are of limited value for building vocabulary in a meaningful way.Most children speak their first word at about age one, and by the age of six they have a vocabulary of about 14,000 words. This means they naturally learn about eight new words per day (see Language Files, chapter 9.3 for a discussion of this process). But, unlike adults learning a foreign language, young children learn language as they learn about the world. When Raul gets hurt, he might hear an adult exclaim, \\"Raul bonked his head on the counter!\\" By this he learns that the topmost part of himself is called \\"head\\" and the object he collided with is called \\"counter.\\" When Melinda finishes eating spaghetti with her fingers and an adult says \\"Let me wash your hands and face,\\" she learns what those parts of herself are called, as well as the meaning of the verb \\"wash.\\"This process is quite different from the way adults study a second language, where rote memorization is the norm. My problem with word-list books is that while objects are grouped thematically (multiple articles of clothing on a double-page spread, for example), they are experienced apart from their natural context. The pictures are also uniformly sized on the page, so a soccer ball may look the same size as a television.For developing vocabulary in specific areas, the I Spy books may be a better fit. Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever also presents many different objects and activities in a natural context. But the best way to build a child's vocabulary is to read them stories and rhymes about a wide variety of activities and contexts. Preverbal babies and young toddlers respond very well to picture books with images of human faces. They also love to listen to rhythmic, repetitive books, which usually have genuine story quality that baby can grow into."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I know that sounds like a terrible parent, but I really did hide this book because I got so bored of reading it constantly! My son got it for his first birthday and loved it so much that he tended to rip pages, etc. Our copy is in very bad condition from so much use! I did break down and bring it out of hiding later on when he was older and could take care of it a little better when reading it himself. My son is 5 now and still likes it a lot - he can now read the words that go with the pictures. If you are buying this book for a really young child, you might want to consider the My First Word Board Book instead - that way you won't have to supervise so closely and your child can read it himself."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My little ones love this book!

We had to buy a second book for the other twin to prevent fights. The same author has other books on animals. All are great. Only one minor criticism: some objects in the book don't look like modern objects in my American home."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"We gave this book to my 20 month-old daughter for Christmas.

He's now 18 months and we look at it daily. It has helped him acquire new vocabulary and he especially enjoys making the noises of the animals in the book. Angela Wilke's &quot;First ABC Book&quot; is equally enjoyable, but with less objects. The one negative aspect of this book is that plastic figurines are often substituted for the real thing in the photos. I would prefer a real photo of a horse than a plastic figure or drawing."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"Grandma bought this for our daughter when she was about 1-yr-old and it's been almost worn out.

However, she does need to improve her page turning skill to minimise the tears!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I bought this book for my daughter when she was about 13 months old. I wish I'd gotten it sooner! Her interest in the book grows and grows as she learns more and more what things are. Her favorite pages by far are the front cover, the food page, and the animal pages. She even learned about the letter O from the front cover (she thought they were balls, and so we taught her about O's).She even uses the foods page as a menu. Before she learned the signs for some of her food, she'd bring the book over to me and point at what she wanted to eat. It was very cute.She is 17 months old now, and the book is still one of her favorites. As she learns more and more what things are, she likes to point at all of them and tell me as we turn the pages. I think this book will give us even a lot more use out of it because there's still a lot of things she doesn't know.My only complaints are:1. How in the world is a baby going to figure out what a \\"combine tractor\\" and some of the really off-the-wall things are. We always skip things like that. Even the tools page has very little interest in it.2. Some of the pictures are difficult to discern to a young child what they are. The bag of flour, the coffee, and the ice cream, to name a few.3. I would have liked to see more animals. How about a mouse or a bunny?Aside from those, I think this book is a must-have in any baby's board book collection."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"As a former teacher and new mom, I've been trying to expose my son to many books including the classic's (Guess How Much I Love You...) as well as ones with funny rhymes and cartoons(Seuss). However, these DK books are his FAVORITES. He enjoys trying to find the objects and rejoices in saying their names. It is wonderful to see his eyes scan the pages at all the new objects he is seeing. If you are limited in how many books you can purchase, I recommend these as a staple. This one &quot;My First Word Book&quot; is my son's favorite (that we own) of the series since it is filled with all the words he's learning."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I'm glad to see that my child is not the only one that loved this book so much he ripped it apart. We still read it all the time (at his request) even though it's in two pieces. I bought it for him before he even turned one and he has been fascinated with it from day one. He's three now and still can't get enough.I buy this book for every one year old birthday party we attend. Everyone loves this!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"This is the first book my daughter, now 17 months, really showed an interest in.

I'm now ordering my second copy as she's decided it tastes good also."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"I bought this book for my first child in 1995 and now my second child loves it just as much. EVERY page is taped up because they looked at it so much and both were very young so they would tear the pages as well. They both were probably 7-8 months old when they first fell in love with it. The revised edition is similar but yet very different; it is definately going under my tree this Christmas! Worth every penny and then some!!"},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"My one year old daughter loves these books! She is pointing at all the pictures after I ask her where an item is. She can turn the pages at her own pace, point, and I tell her what it is, and she remembers after that. It's amazing. It's also great for those family members who are not comfortable reading out loud to children. We are working our way towards owning the whole collection."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"Yeah, sure, it's educational ... but far more importantly, this book quickly became a favorite with my then-10-month-old -- and now, at almost a year, she still loves it. Older babies and toddlers are dying to know the names of things, and this book delivers. I expect it to keep its interest for quite a while, as we move on to color and \\"do you have one of these?\\", etc. She's fascinated by the brightly colored pictures and loves seeing familiar things, like the banana and the cat."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"This series of board books are fantastic.I started collecting these for my daughter after she was given one at 6 months and this is what we started to read to her every night. She woud sit and demand it to be read over and over and over again. The board pages and are easy for baby and toddler to turn and the pictures (real photography not illustrations) are wonderful.The word book has a little bit of everything - like a mini dictionary - of things that baby will come accross in their daily life - clothes, food, utensils. My toddler can now read and say the names of each thing herself while pointing to them. It has helped her give names (and learn to say things by us reading the book over and over) to things in her world.If your looking for a great picture book to share with your baby this is the one (and the series of books) to buy. You can never have too many books to read with your children."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"Again, we love this book! It's almost as much fun as the Animal Book that DK published. The photos are so wonderful and they are all of things that a toddler recognizes.Being a board book, too, helps! Our son loves to look at and occasionally gnaw on his books. Luckily, these are tough enough to take both his reading and chewing.I'm glad that we discovered DK Publishing and want to buy all of their board books for our son."},{"Title":"My Very First Word Book","review":"Our 2 1/2 year old son increaed his vocabulary quite quickly with this book. My wife's mother tounge is French, so during the day he is usually accustomed to speaking French. His ability to express himself in English was lacking far behind of his French. After the first two or three times of reading the book together, he now picks up the book, points to items and says what they are. Of course there are certain items that he has troubles with and that is where the parental help comes in.

For example, a photograph of a pillow with pairs of animals on it, simply did not look like a &quot;pillow&quot; and a tube of toothpaste or container of talcum powder without a label or any coloring (re: a generic label) simply does not look like the article trying to be delineated. Also, the illustrations would have better left out, in my opinion--I believe that photographs of real objects should be maintained throughout the book. The actual photos of real animals in the &quot;At the zoo&quot; page, for example, look foolish beside the inferior &quot;illustrations.&quot; Surely, photographs could have been obtained for animals such as tigers, buffalo, penguins, etc.Also, the book seems like it's trying too hard at times. Unnecessary inclusions seemed quite prevalent, as if the &quot;voluminous index&quot; was the aim rather than, simply, a picture book for 0-3 year old children.Some of the unnecessary inclusions include: cotton swabs (especially the way they are photographed), barette (looks atypical), soap frog (looks like a green frog toy), bubbles, lawnmover (photo would have been great, but illustration is not good), canes for the garden (they look like sticks of incense), traffic circle (another bad illustration), cygnet (swan=okay; cygnet=not okay, too sophisticated), no school bus (in &quot; things that move&quot;), tidal pool (bad illustration and unnecessary addition), &quot;weather&quot; illustrations behind children and bad illustrations re: &quot;seasons&quot;; also, &quot;Actions&quot; section and others with pictures of children doing things are too &quot;chock-full&quot; to be effective; etc.Again, some photos are nice and my son truly enjoys the book--I'm just voicing some things that I would have omitted and/or done differently for the overall aesthetics of the book. In the end, it seems &quot;overly-ambitious&quot; and some photographs are taken from too far away (the plate of rice is indistinct as is the floor mat, among other items). Also, the colors of &quot;everyday objects&quot; are too colorful to be recognized as objects that one might have in their own home (red and/or black telephone, TV, teapot, placemat, dustpan, mixing bowl, broom, to name a few). Also, the ham looks like it's a week old. Very unappetizing.Other than all that, the book is quite good.

Then she finds out that her father's relationship with his best friend isn't what she thought it was.

Then you've got to love a professional e-book production. Thanks Amazon for high standards."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is a story about a little American boy, Cedric who suddenly finds himself the heir-apparent to a title in England. His grandfather, the present Lord Fauntleroy, (who originally disowned the boy's now-dead father for marrying his American mother) sends for the boy to live with him. His faultless mother of course agrees to let him take this opportunity, while she goes to live in a nearby cottage.Then a woman appears with a boy she claims to be the son of an older son, apparently displacing Cedric as heir. It is a testament to Little Lord Fauntleroy's sweetening effect that his grandfather unites with his mother to fight against this alternate claim (successfully, of course...this is no book for bittersweet endings--the good always triumph, the evil always meet they're downfall, and the good and the evil are always on opposite sides).Enough sugar to gag a horse, but no story. From the start, the little boy is perfect...charitable, pretty, strong, and smart--but infinitely oblivious of others' defects. He does not grow or change. He does not wrestle with problems. He does not even realize there are problems. He is not a character--he's a pro-American fantasy.The real protagonist is the present Lord, the boy's grandfather. His transition from conceited grump to true grandfather is mildly interesting. However, far too often Cedric's perfect little self takes center stage, constantly presenting himself to be admired by the other characters, who were not so fortunate as to be perfect or American."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I got to know this book \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" through the President of SGI, Daisaku Ikeda. This book tells us how a pure, innocent and kind-hearted boy, Ceddie, changed his ill-tempered grandfather. Little Ceddie's mother played a very important role in bringing up his son into such a good character, who always look at people's good points. This good quality of Little Ceddie is what a society need."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is the fable of a young boy (Cedric) who is nothing short of saintly. His arrival in England as a new lord replacing his grandfather casts off the contrast of dark and light. The Earl is nothing short of a brute. Cedric is a saint. Cedric's charm, handsome looks and demeanor evolve the Uncle into a saint himself. That's the story. There really isn't a plot or some great cause and effect drama. The author's gift is the ability to tell a fable -- good can conquer evil.The problem with Little Lord Fauntleroy is of course it's dated. Since contemporary themes were inserted into the tale and contemporary characters were inserted (unlike Secret Garden or Little Princess) that really crunches teeth together. Were this book published today as-is civil rights groups would be up in arms and I wouldn't blame them. Francis doesn't have King's English speak and some of the characters speak with their accent making it hard to understand.Many have called the book sentimental and I didn't feel that. Too many stereotypes and too many shallow characters with not enough flavor made the book flat.On the positive end the language is richer than expected and I liked that insertion and even politics and class warfare get the light of day.Personally I liked the later reads better than this one."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

If you've enjoyed The Little Princess and The Secret Garden, you surely will want to read her third famous children's classic. The seven-year-old American protagonist is simply too sweet and good-natured to be true; his widowed mother is a study in patient suffering.Suddenly informed that her son is the heir to an Earldom in England, the mother gives up her homeland to restore her son to his rightful legacy. But his crusty old grandfather(who cast out his youngest son when he married a mere American) proves mean and selfish-universally hated by his tenants. Now this unexpected grandson may be his last chance--not only to continue the family name and honor, but more importantly, for the old man's personal growth.It's a challenge for American readers to understand the dialogue which Burnett often presents in dialect, while ignoring the distinction between New Yorkese and British peasant slang. Neverthless, this book is a gently told tale which will touch those unjaded readers who remain. The underlying theme may be that of the restorative power of innocence."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"First, its so sugary sweet as the interwebs say 'diabeetus' will be imminent. you have the basics, poor father-less kid makes friends with EVERYONE, crotchity relative they never knew about is richer then Midas it seems and suddenly wants poor kid to come be the heir.

The quality of the writing is very good and makes for a great reading. Yet it is so syrupy and idealistic that my head was somewhat spinning. Here are several excerpts from Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, the house is so beautiful!\\" exclaims Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, Dearest, the pony is so beautiful!\\" \\"You are the most wonderful, kindest man I've ever known!\\" Like I wrote, these are few examples, but in the book, there are a lot of them. Mostly, the tone of Little Lord Fauntleroy is that England is a better country than United States of America. The characters of the book are one-dimensional, but there is a good play with positivism and negativism. However, the values set forth by the book don't fit me well because people just can't buy other people's way out of their miseries. Although the therapeutic effect is short-lived, it is unrealistic and condescending. Little Lord Fauntleroy arouses jealousy in the readers that this boy will inherit the vastness of the treasure in forms of money, house, property, and so on and that he has the power to change people's lives. Really, changing people's lives doesn't require any money at all. At the same time, Little Lord Fauntleroy introduces the idea of materialism that it is deemed to be cool to possess a lot of stuff (and why? I ask). Again, the book was written in 1886, and it is difficult for the author to foresee the effects of materialism have on the environment and living space. Another terrible crime committed by the author is that her book is literally about beautiful people. So, the idea is that it is very important that you look beautiful as possible. Hm...sure. All in all, Little Lord Fauntleroy is an okay book, but I have no desire of reading it again."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I ordered this audio CD because I like childrens' classic literature and because I like to listen to audio books while on trips. When this audio CD arrived I was disappointed because on the cover it said MP3 CD. I do not have an MP3 player and have not been able to listen to the CD in the car like I planned. This product was advertised as an audiobook without mention of MP3 on your website."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This book was a heart warmer! I think that everyone should read it!! It was better than best!!!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I have a 1886 edition of Little Lord Fauntleroy in good condition and it is for sale."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy stirred my emotions. Would I have let my seven-year-old live with his ill-tempered grandfather who despised me? Probably not! Yet as the story unfolded, I admired the wise words and kind ways of Fauntleroy's mother, Dearest. I empathized with the mother's caring for her only child and her concern for the poor and less fortunate. This book renewed my faith in goodness and kindness. It made me reflect on all that I have."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"When the Earl of Fauntleroy decides to bring his favourite son's son to England from America, young Cedric's life is dramatically changed forever. With an ever-innocent and trusting perspective on life he manages to turn his bitter grandfather into a loving, generous man while also endearing himself to every other person he comes in contact with."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"When I was little, two of my favorite books wereA Little PrincessandThe Secret Garden (HarperClassics)by Frances Hodgson Burnett. When I grew up, they were still favorites. So a year ago when I was buying them for my little cousin, and I noticed \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\", I was astounded. How did I miss such a gem?The story of little Cedric who warms his old grandfather's heart is beautifully written and quite touching. There is also a lesson to be learned, as we watch what Cedric does with his newfound wealth. What would you do if you were suddenly gifted with such a fortune? This story is perfect for anyone who enjoyed \\"A Little Princess\\" or \\"The Secret Garden\\"!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"The company's service was good, but the book itself was full of printing errors. A large speech was absent at the end, and I caught that only because I'd looked it up; the ending made no sense without it. There was also computer code on the pages here and there in the middle of text. I definitely don't recommend this publisher's version of the book."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This delightful story has a reputation for being very sentimental, and it is, but it is also filled with humour. Cedric Errol, an all-American boy, discovers to his dismay that he is the heir to an English earldom, and has to go to England to live with his stern old grandfather, who despises Americans (he must have been reading the Guardian, I suppose). Gradually they learn to like each other, and the grandfather even comes around to liking Cedric's American mother. There is a melodromatic sub-plot involving a false heir, but the story is really interesting enough without it. The best character in the book is Cedric's friend Mr. Hobbs, a staunchly Republican grocer who despises earls \\"I'd like to catch one of em inside here; that's all!\\" he tells Cedric, before he knows Cedric is one of them \\"I'll have no graspin tyrants sittin round on my buiscuit barrels!\\" By the end of the book though, he has become so attached to Cedric that he sells his grocery business and settles in England, where he becomes an avid follower of aristocratic doings. He says he'll never return to America \\"It's a good enough country for them that's young and stirrin - but there's faults in it. there's not an aunt-sister among em - nor an earl!\\" Which pretty much sums up how I feel about America too."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an example of the difficulties of shopping online.I had read the book several years ago and wanted to give a volume as a gift. This printing is unacceptable - unpleasant font, cramped pages and flimsy binding. You will do better with the purchase of a used hardcover volume"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I found this book in my school library a year ago...and i think it was indeed,a very pleasant heartwarming story.So nice was that i even managed to catch Burnett's other titles!Basically,this novel is about a boy living in America who realises that his long dead father was actually a lord's son back in old England.The story goes back when the lord's (youngest and favourite) son fell for a young maiden in America.So madly in love with her that he even dare to forsake his home,his title and his father to be with her.Despite they being poor,the trio led a fulfilling and wonderful life,that was,when the son was contracted with some incurable disease and died.Back in England,the old sire (the lord,of course) never forgave his youngest son for his action.He never liked the maiden,either.Coincidence as it may be,the Lord's two oldest sons either died or ran away(sorry,but i can't remeber this part).Knowing that his time was up,and he needed a heir,the Lord called for his long-lost grandson to come stay with him in England.For a boy who was born and bred in America,and had friends like the baker,the apple seller,the barber and roams round the street during his leisure time,moving in with a stern and grouchy old man in a cold castle was a far cry from his life in America.The old Lord found children a nuisance,but had it not been a fact that he needs a heir,he'd have probably wished his grandson to continue rotting away in America.Cedric Roy (the protagonist and grandson)was nevertheless,the sweet and innocent 7-year-old.He never questions why his grandfather was old and bitter,or why the servants were extremely afraid of their master,or why the castle was cold and dark and empty,or why his mother could not come and live with him (the Lord refused the maided to be within his castle grounds).Overtime,as Cedric Roy discovered more of his grandpa's self,the latter too,was amused by his grandson.A boy of 7,compassionate and caring for others,the old man began to open up...and change his perspection of life...It was amazing indeed,that this lovely bond between a boy of 7 and an old elderly man could get along easily.Burnett's novel was extremely well-written...depicting the childishness and innocence of a child,as well as the black-hearted old Lord.I give this book two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I wanted to read this book because the idea of Little Lord Fauntleroy is such a part of our culture, but I knew nothing about the original. The child is sympathetically drawn (except for the fact of calling his mother \\"dearest\\" which I found odd) and charms all he comes in contact with. He is just an ordinary boy in the US when news comes to him that he will inherit his grandfather's title and is to go to England to learn to be a lord. The grandfather is wonderfully curmudgeonly, the mother is too good to be true, and of course there is a happy ending. There was gentle humour and I liked seeing the change in the old man. A pleasant read."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I had never read Little Lord Fauntleroy, and after reading The Secret Garden recently, which was completely enchanting and full of metaphoric wisdom, I wanted to read more of Francis Hodgson Burnett's work. Personally, the title of this book had become associated with a rather pompous characterization as in &#34;who do you think you are, little lord Fauntleroy?&#34; so I had no idea what the book was even about.To my surprise and delight, just like The Secret Garden, her drawing of the characters in the midst of their circumstances was vivid and real, and completely drew me in. With good reads such as this, I have to force myself to put the book down, so I can prolong the pleasure. From the very beginning all the way to the end, not a scene was wasted or uninteresting. Some writers spend a good deal of time explaining why their characters act the way they do, which becomes tedious.Ms. Burnett's characters speak through their actions, and the story of the little boy who becomes a lord is simply about living spontaneously from the ideals of highest character. So much of the stories in the world today shows us humans who are tortured within by what they can't quite integrate in their lives. They don't touch the realm that this book simply opens one into, the part of humanity that is giving and loving without cause or reason. Reading this book was very refreshing. It's characters are uniquely portrayed and Ms. Burnett, in my opinion, never moralizes. Had she done so, the book would have been far less engaging.If you want to remember your childhood feeling of delight and innocence, if you want to be filled with simple joy and delight without requiring that you be perfect, if you want to remember a part of who you are as an eternal child, I believe you will relish this book."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"One again I'm embarrassed to say I've made it to fifty and never read this book. I watched an old black and white as a mid so I knew the story but that's not the same as reading it.

Do not remember hearing about this book while growing up, and saw that it was on the top 100 classic books.

The reason I gave it a four star is necause it jumps a little and goes somewhat off track.The story remains however timeless. I am going to see the movie again because I think I miss a few things. I you want a quick classic to read then you should read this especially to your kids."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This once quite famous and very sweet children's novel from the Victorian era has always been one of my favorites. It is a reminder to me that when my world becomes over-rich with the troubles of adult life, taking a step back to view the world through the lens of trust, love and innocence can make all the difference. The Kindle version is fine, and how nice that it is free!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"my goodness this is one of the best books ive read....which i am a BIG fan of fhb and have liked everything i have read written by her...this has to be one of my favorites....great story great meaning to the story!!! please read!!!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is not a full novel like some of the author's other works, but it is still overall an enjoyable book about a little boy who finds out about a family he never knew he had (a rich grandpa) The writing style is a bit dated, so people who are more used to contemporary literature may be thrown off a bit, but it's still a cute book. If you're familiar with Ms. Burnett's writing style, this should be nothing new for you."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"nothing satisfies the imagination like a plot that contains a huge unexpected life-change for the protagonist.
