From the colonial period through Reconstruction, lawmakers passed legislation that curbed the rights and privileges of these non-enslaved residents, from prohibiting their testimony against whites to barring them from the ballot box. While such laws suggest that most white North Carolinians desired to limit the freedoms and civil liberties enjoyed by free people of color, Milteer reveals that the two groups often interacted praying together, working the same land, and occasionally sharing households and starting families. Some free people of color also rose to prominence in their communities, becoming successful businesspeople and winning the respect of their white neighbors. Milteer s innovative study moves beyond depictions of the American South as a region controlled by a strict racial hierarchy. He contends that although North Carolinians frequently sorted themselves into races imbued with legal and social entitlements with whites placing themselves above persons of color those efforts regularly clashed with their concurrent recognition of class, gender, kinship, and occupational distinctions. Whites often determined the position of free nonwhites by designating them as either valuable or expendable members of society. In early North Carolina, free people of color of certain statuses enjoyed access to institutions unavailable even to some whites. Prior to 1835, for instance, some free men of color possessed the right to vote while the law disenfranchised all women, white and nonwhite included. North Carolina s Free People of Color, 17151885 demonstrates that conceptions of race were complex and fluid, defying easy characterization. Despite the reductive labels often assigned to them by whites, free people of color in the state emerged from an array of backgrounds, lived widely varied lives, and created distinct cultures all of which, Milteer suggests, allowed them to adjust to and counter ever-evolving forms of racial discrimination.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-bkDwAAQBAJ&dq=FREE+PEOPLE+OF+COLOR&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What if?","description":"The creator of the incredibly popular webcomic xkcd presents his heavily researched answers to his fans' oddest questions, including  What if I took a swim in a spent-nuclear-fuel pool?  and  Could you build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns?  100,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tgZIBAAAQBAJ&dq=What+if%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Art of Visual Basic Game Programming","description":"The first part of this book covers playing-field design, creating and moving objects using the Windows BitBlt API, detecting collisions, and adding sound, with example code given with each topic.

Backgammon is not just a game; it is an obsession. In some countries of Southern Europe and the Middle East, it is a way of life. A typical game of backgammon lasts 6-8minutes if it is \\"Hit\\" or Gioul, and double that if it is Plakoto or Moultezim. These are the fastest, most absorbing minutes in a player's lifetime. The game moves in lightening speed and requires total concentration. The mixture of chance and skill are perfectly balanced in \\"Hit\\" the other games leaning heavier on skill. There is hardly a moment of boredom when you play backgammon. Even when the game seems hopelessly lost, there is still a finite probability of a turnaround. The suspense is always there, the tension is never ending. What more would you want for an evening of . . . relaxation? This book is written to fill a void the almost total absence of information on backgammon games, other than basic \\"Hit\\" usually called backgammon in the West. The authors find it incredible that Gioul, Plakoto and Moultezim still remain a well-kept secret among backgammon connoisseurs. Gioul is the most fun-filled game played on the board every dice throw a surprise. Plakoto is without doubt the king of Backgammon games. Moultezim is a serious game for the purist, the consummate space strategist. Players who are unaware of these games are not really fulfilled. This book, illustrated with more than 300 diagrams, illustrations and exercises, aims to change all that, and turn all casual players into full-fledged backgammon experts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9wgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Backgammon+Games+and+Strategies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychic and the Rabbi: A Remarkable Correspondence","description":"\\"The Psychic and the Rabbi\\" is a spellbinding correspondence between the world's most celebrated paranormalist and one of the most controversial and famous religious figures.

Gilchrist has a distinctive ear for language, and a deep understanding of her flawed, sometimes tragic characters. These fourteen stories, divided into three sections -- There's a Garden of Eden, Things Like the Truth, and Perils of the Nile -- are about mostly young, upper-class Southern women who are bored with the Junior League and having babies, and chafe against the restrictions of their sheltered lives. Talented and bright, but living in the shadow of men -- their husbands and fathers -- they resort to outrageous actions in pursuit of freer lives and uncompromised love, despite the consequences. This collection first introduced readers to some of Gilchrist's most beloved characters, such as Rhoda Manning and Nora Jane Whittington. PRAISE: \\"It's difficult to review a first book as good as this one without resorting to every known superlative clich ...Gilchrist is the real thing.\\"  Washington Post  A sustained display of delicately and rhythmically modulated prose and an unsentimental dissection of raw sentiment.

These varied landscapes meld the sensuality of nature with the disciplines of cosmology, poetry and meditation. Japanese aristocrats created these gardens to display not just wealth and power, but cultural sensitivity and an appreciation for transcendent beauty. A class of professional gardeners eventually emerged, transforming Japanese landscape design into a formalized art. Today, Kyoto's gardens display an enormous range of forms from rock gardens display of extreme minimalism and subtle hues, to stroll gardens of luscious proportions and vibrant colors. In Kyoto Gardens Simmons' photographs present a fresh and contemporary look at Kyoto's most important gardens. Their beauty is enhanced and humanized by gardeners tending the grounds using the tools of their art.

Stories found in this selection include Jesus' birth in a cave, his childhood escapades, his secret sayings, and his descent to the underworld; the torments in Hell; Saint Paul baptizing a lion; the death of Pontius Pilate and Saint Peter being crucified upside down. These all come from early Christian legends which did not get into the Bible, yet have had a profound influence on art, literature, and theology from the second century through the Middle Ages and even modern times. Some of the stories included here, especially those involving the Virgin Mary, have affected matters of doctrine; others have influenced the church's teaching on the after life, whilst from the apocryphal Acts there are some of the best examples of accounts of the lives of Christianity's earliest saints.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yC_8ciERUz0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MacArthur and Defeat in the Philippines","description":"A compelling portrait of the World War II battle for the Philippines traces Douglas MacArthur's special relationship with the islands. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gfFmAAAAMAAJ&dq=MacArthur+and+Defeat+in+the+Philippines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jeanne Rose: Herbal Body Book: The Herbal Way to Natural Beauty & Health for Men & Women","description":"Jeanne Rose's Herbal Body Book pairs a wide variety of ailments with possible plant cures.

Upon discovering that she suffered from Usher syndrome (a genetic condition that causes both deafness and blindness), however, Fischer began an unlikely journey toward reclaiming her heritage. She and Cathryn Carroll tell the story of her heroic struggle and cultural odyssey in Orchid of the Bayou: A Deaf Woman Faces Blindness. \\"By this time Mama knew I was 'not right,'\\" Fischer says of her early childhood. \\"She knew the real words for 'not right,' too, though she never said those words. I was deaf and dumb.\\" Initially Fischer's parents turned to folk healers to try and \\"cure\\" their daughter's deafness, but an aunt's fortunate discovery of the Louisiana School for the Deaf would rescue Fischer from misunderstanding and introduce her to sign language and Deaf culture. She weathered the school''s experiments with oralism and soon rose to the top of her class, ultimately leaving Louisiana for the academic promise of Gallaudet. While in college, Fischer met and married her future husband, Lance, a Jewish Deaf man from Brooklyn, New York, and each landed jobs close to their alma mater. After the birth of their first child, however, Fischer could no longer ignore her increasing tunnel vision. Doctors quickly confirmed that Fischer had Usher syndrome. While Fischer struggled to come to terms with her condition, the high incidence of Usher syndrome among Cajun people led her to re-examine her cultural roots. \\"Could I still be me, Catherine Hoffpauir Fischer, had I not been born of a mix that codes for Usher syndrome?\\" she asks. \\"To some extent, the history of my people explains the constitution of my genes and the way my life has unfolded.\\" Today Fischer prospers, enjoying her time with family and friends and celebrating the Deaf, Cajun, Blind, and Jewish cultures that populate her life.

Within its pages, he serialized the groundbreaking Ed the Happy Clown, revealing a macabre universe of parallel dimensions. Thanks to its wholly original yet disturbing story lines, Ed set the stage for Chester Brown to become a world-renowned cartoonist. Ed the Happy Clown is a hallucinatory tale that functions simultaneously as a dark roller-coaster ride of criminal activity and a scathing condemnation of religious and political charlatanism. As the world around him devolves into madness, the eponymous Ed escapes variously from a jealous boyfriend, sewer monsters, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a janitor with a Jesus complex. Brown leaves us wondering, with every twist of the plot, just how Ed will get out of this scrape. The intimate, tangled world of Ed the Happy Clown is definitively presented here, repackaged with a new foreword by the author and an extensive notes section, and, as with every Brown book, astonishingly perceptive about the zeitgeist of its time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TjoEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Name Is Joel: Searching for God in a Son's Disability","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F8VnAAAACAAJ&dq=His+Name+Is+Joel:+Searching+for+God+in+a+Son%27s+Disability&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long, Tall Texans: Burke & Coltrain (Long, Tall Texans)","description":"Once-burned Todd Burke had no intention of getting hitched to anyone.

And how do I break the news to my boyfriend? * How do I teach my kids the value of money, when my parents shower them with expensive gifts? * My wife makes more money than I do, does that give her a greater voice in our financial decisions? Are we still equal? * How much should I give my child in allowance? And will it really help him learn the value of a dollar? * We want to have our first baby, but we don't know if we can afford it yet. How much money do we really need to have in the bank? If you're like most people, you're struggling with questions like these. Whether we like it or not, money makes a big difference in the choices we make and the lives we lead.

In Politics and the English Language, the second in the Orwell s Essays series, Orwell takes aim at the language used in politics, which, he says,  is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . In an age where the language used in politics is constantly under the microscope, Orwell s Politics and the English Language is just as relevant today, and gives the reader a vital understanding of the tactics at play.

Blavatsky and the masters of the wisdom","description":"A rigorous historical and philosophical examination of the controversial spiritual Masters who guided Madame H.P. Blavatsky in opening the world to Eastern and esoteric spirituality in the late nineteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, Russian noblewoman and occult philosopher Madame H.P. Blavatsky enthralled the world with revelations of an ancient  secret doctrine  behind the major faiths and a cosmic theology that united the insights of religion and science. Blavatsky said she was operating under the guidance of hidden Masters of wisdom, or mahatmas, who led her to reveal forgotten wisdom to modern people. The mythos of Blavatsky s Masters left a deep mark on Western culture and spawned more than a century of debate: Were the Masters real? What did they teach? Are they reachable today? Now, independent scholar of religion Edward Abdill provides an authoritative, historically reliable, and delightfully readable study of the background and ideas of the Masters  in particular highlighting their message and its enduring relevance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nEkCDAAAQBAJ&dq=H.P.+Blavatsky+and+the+masters+of+the+wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Health Information Security: HIPAA","description":"Use this book to learn how to conduct a timely and thorough Risk Analysis and Assessment documenting all risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), which is a key component of the HIPAA Security Rule. The requirement is a focus area for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) during breach investigations and compliance audits. This book lays out a plan for healthcare organizations of all types to successfully comply with these requirements and use the output to build upon the cybersecurity program. With the proliferation of cybersecurity breaches, the number of healthcare providers, payers, and business associates investigated by the OCR has risen significantly. It is not unusual for additional penalties to be levied when victims of breaches cannot demonstrate that an enterprise-wide risk assessment exists, comprehensive enough to document all of the risks to ePHI. Why is it that so many covered entities and business associates fail to comply with this fundamental safeguard? Building a HIPAA Compliant Cybersecurity Program cuts through the confusion and ambiguity of regulatory requirements and provides detailed guidance to help readers: Understand and document all known instances where patient data exist Know what regulators want and expect from the risk analysis process Assess and analyze the level of severity that each risk poses to ePHI Focus on the beneficial outcomes of the process: understanding real risks, and optimizing deployment of resources and alignment with business objectives What You ll Learn Use NIST 800-30 to execute a risk analysis and assessment, which meets the expectations of regulators such as the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Understand why this is not just a compliance exercise, but a way to take back control of protecting ePHI Leverage the risk analysis process to improve your cybersecurity program Know the value of integrating technical assessments to further define risk management activities Employ an iterative process that continuously assesses the environment to identify improvement opportunities Who This Book Is For Cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance professionals working for organizations responsible for creating, maintaining, storing, and protecting patient information","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ueYNtAEACAAJ&dq=Health+Information+Security:+HIPAA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Painful People and How to Deal with Them","description":"While explaining why there are so many painful people in the world and why there is hope for them, Joseph Dunn outlines 10 ways of approaching and understanding the behaviour of people we must deal with every day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cIsDAAAACAAJ&dq=Painful+People+and+How+to+Deal+with+Them&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Europe 2005 (PartyEurope)- The supplemental guide to fun and social travel (Now This Is Life)","description":"The perfect supplement to traditional guidebooks, PartyEurope'ss 429 pages are packed with over 600 reviews of fun and social, day and night activities in the 14 hottest European destinations.

It argues that while young people in Japan in their teens, twenties and early thirties are not engaged in overt social or political resistance, they are turning against the existing Japanese social order, whose legitimacy has been undermined by the past decade of economic downturn. The book shows how young people in Japan are thinking about their bodies and identities, their social relationships, and their employment and parenting, in new and generationally contextual ways, that may help to create a future Japan quite different from Japan of the recent past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y4K2D1O5tkQC&dq=Japan%27s+Changing+Generations:+Are+Young+People+Creating+a+New+Society%3F+(Japan+Anthropology+Workshop+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highland Sunset (Onyx)","description":"When beautiful, dark-haired Vanessa MacIan met Edward Romney, Earl of Linton, she told herself she should hate this strong and handsome English lord.

In American murder cases, for instance, studies show that blacks who kill a white are much more likely to receive the death penalty than if they kill a black. Indeed, in Georgia, they are 30 times more likely to be condemned, and in Texas a staggering 90 times more likely. Conversely, in Texas, of 143 whites convicted of killing a black, only one was sentenced to die. But how extensive is discrimination in the courtroom? Is it strictly a matter of racial prejudice, or does it respond to a wide range of social factors? In Sociological Justice, eminent legal sociologist Donald Black challenges the conventional notion that law is primarily an affair of rules and that discrimination is an aberration. Law, he contends, is a social process in which bias is inherent. Indeed, Black goes well beyond the documented instances of racial discrimination to show how social status (regardless of race), the degree of intimacy (are they family members, friends, or complete strangers?), speech, organization, and numerous other factors all greatly influence whether a complaint will be filed in court, who will win, and what the punishment or other remedy will be. Moreover, he extends his analysis to include not only the litigants, but also the lawyers, the jurors, and the judge, describing how their social characteristics can also influence a case. Sociological Justice introduces a new field of legal scholarship that will have important consequences for the future of law: the sociology of the case. Black discusses how lawyers can use the sociology of the case to improve their practice and, for those interested in reform, he suggests ways to minimize bias in the courtroom. Beyond this, Black demonstrates that modern jurisprudence, with its assumption that like cases will be treated in like fashion, is out of touch with reality. He urges the adoption of a new sociological jurisprudence, with a new morality of law, that explicitly addresses the social relativity of justice. A major contribution to legal scholarship, this thought-provoking volume is essential reading for anyone interested in law and justice in modern society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANv-wAEACAAJ&dq=Sociological+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creativity of Jonathan Knight A Visual Dialogue","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_hVpGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Creativity+of+Jonathan+Knight+A+Visual+Dialogue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The road to many a wonder","description":"Roman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QocRAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+road+to+many+a+wonder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Stress, Bad Stress: An Indispensable Guide to Identifying and Managing Your Stress","description":"Stress! It's become a universal condition, the most pervasive psychological ailment in our society, and a contender for the most widespread health problem of any kind. But all stress is not created equal. Good stress and bad stress have been called the yin and yang of modern work life. Arguably, good stress (a less formal name for what researchers call \\"challenge\\" stress) is the kind that motivates and excites and yields good results on the job or at home. Bad stress (what researchers call \\"hindrance\\" stress) diminishes one's performance and manifests itself in career dissatisfaction, deteriorating health, and procrastination. Now, in Good Stress, Bad Stress, Barry Lenson clearly maps the differences between the two types of stress and offers strategies and action plans for getting rid of the bad stress and focusing on making the most of good stress.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9fIruTrBBjsC&dq=Good+Stress,+Bad+Stress:+An+Indispensable+Guide+to+Identifying+and+Managing+Your+Stress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish Regional Cooking","description":"A collection of more than 200 Jewish recipes from 23 countries around the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MVeBAAAACAAJ&dq=Jewish+Regional+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Europe, Second Edition (Now This Is Life)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=onMHiVW112AC&dq=Party+Europe,+Second+Edition+(Now+This+Is+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voltage Quality in Electrical Power Systems (IEE Power & Energy Series, 36)","description":"Annotation This book details the theoretical and practical background to low voltage conducted disturbances including harmonics, voltage fluctuation/flicker and asymmetrical voltages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FrXWk2Dyc2sC&dq=Voltage+Quality+in+Electrical+Power+Systems+(IEE+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 2nd Coming (The Best of Pirate Writings Ser., Vol. 2)","description":"THE 2ND COMING is Volume 2 of The Best of Pirate Writings, featuring science fiction & fantasy collected from the pages of Pirate Writings magazine.

Nevertheless, America's \\"culture of celebrity\\" remains misunderstood, particularly when critics discuss its historical roots. In this pathbreaking book, Charles Ponce de Leon provides a new interpretation of the emergence of celebrity. Focusing on the development of human-interest journalism about prominent public figures, he illuminates the ways in which new forms of press coverage gradually undermined the belief that famous people were \\"great,\\" instead encouraging the public to regard them as complex, interesting, even flawed individuals and offering readers seemingly intimate glimpses of the \\"real\\" selves that were presumed to lie behind the calculated, self-promotional fronts that celebrities displayed in public. But human-interest journalism about celebrities did more than simply offer celebrities a new means of gaining publicity or provide readers with the \\"inside dope,\\" says Ponce de Leon. In chapters devoted to celebrities from the realms of business, politics, entertainment, and sports, he shows how authors of celebrity journalism used their writings to weigh in on subjects as wide-ranging as social class, race relations, gender roles, democracy, political reform, self-expression, material success, competition, and the work ethic, offering the public a new lens through which to view these issues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=parqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby of the Family (Harvest Book)","description":"Follows the coming of age of Lena McPherson, who was born with the ability to predict the future, as she grows into a fearful, ostracized teenager, and finally learns to accept love and find her own way","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kvJx674ILwAC&dq=Baby+of+the+Family+(Harvest+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ancient Engineers","description":"Describes methods used by early irrigators, architects, and military engineers to build and maintain structures to serve their ruler's wants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cauMt9vJLs0C&dq=The+Ancient+Engineers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GEORGE MULLER - The Children's Champion","description":"George M ller was a thief but God changed him so he became a champion for orphans.

Women now outperform men academically at all levels of school, and are more likely to obtain college degrees and enroll in graduate school. What accounts for this enormous reversal in the gender education gap? In The Rise of Women: The Growing Gender Gap in Education and What It Means for American Schools, Thomas DiPrete and Claudia Buchmann provide a detailed and accessible account of women s educational advantage and suggest new strategies to improve schooling outcomes for both boys and girls. The Rise of Women opens with a masterful overview of the broader societal changes that accompanied the change in gender trends in higher education. The rise of egalitarian gender norms and a growing demand for college-educated workers allowed more women to enroll in colleges and universities nationwide. As this shift occurred, women quickly reversed the historical male advantage in education. By 2010, young women in their mid-twenties surpassed their male counterparts in earning college degrees by more than eight percentage points. The authors, however, reveal an important exception: While women have achieved parity in fields such as medicine and the law, they lag far behind men in engineering and physical science degrees. To explain these trends, The Rise of Women charts the performance of boys and girls over the course of their schooling. At each stage in the education process, they consider the gender-specific impact of factors such as families, schools, peers, race and class. Important differences emerge as early as kindergarten, where girls show higher levels of essential learning skills such as persistence and self-control. Girls also derive more intrinsic gratification from performing well on a day-to-day basis, a crucial advantage in the learning process. By contrast, boys must often navigate a conflict between their emerging masculine identity and a strong attachment to school. Families and peers play a crucial role at this juncture. The authors show the gender gap in educational attainment between children in the same families tends to be lower when the father is present and more highly educated. A strong academic climate, both among friends and at home, also tends to erode stereotypes that disconnect academic prowess and a healthy, masculine identity. Similarly, high schools with strong science curricula reduce the power of gender stereotypes concerning science and technology and encourage girls to major in scientific fields. As the value of a highly skilled workforce continues to grow, The Rise of Women argues that understanding the source and extent of the gender gap in higher education is essential to improving our schools and the economy. With its rigorous data and clear recommendations, this volume illuminates new ground for future education policies and research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8QlRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attentat (Romans, Nouvelles, Recits (Domaine Francais)) (French Edition)","description":"Includes, 1982-1995: Les Livres du mois, also published separately.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dxQvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Attentat+(Romans,+Nouvelles,+Recits+(Domaine+Francais))+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam: the Use of the Atomic Bomb and the American Confrontation With Soviet Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4AB3AAAAMAAJ&dq=Atomic+Diplomacy:+Hiroshima+and+Potsdam:+the+Use+of+the+Atomic+Bomb+and+the+American+Confrontation+With+Soviet+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Tundra Dog","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v10OGAkHumoC&dq=The+adventures+of+Tundra+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arrian: Anabasis of Alexander, Books I-IV (Loeb Classical Library No. 236)","description":"Greece, Macedon and Persia contains a collection of papers related to the history and historiography of warfare, politics and power in the Ancient Mediterranean world.

On April 18, 2005, the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church gathered to elect a successor to Pope John Paul II. Faced with several potential candidates, the cardinals made a bold choice, entrusting the Keys of the Kingdom to 78-year-old Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, a man whose views on the challenges facing the Church and the broader culture could not be more unambiguous, or controversial. Questions arose as the world watched while Ratzinger was installed as Pope Benedict XVI, the 266th pontiff of the Catholic Church. Why Ratzinger? Why someone so clearly identified with the previous pope? Why not a  compromise  choice? Why a Cardinal from Western Europe and not from Africa or Latin America? What would this mean for the future of the Catholic Church? No one can tell the story of exactly what took place during the closed doors meeting, known as the conclave, when Cardinals from around the world cast their votes for the next pope, better than John L. Allen, Jr. As a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter and a Vatican analyst for CNN and National Public Radio, Allen has spent years covering Vatican politics and personalities, and his unique access to Roman halls of power has enabled him to write the ultimate behind-the-scenes account of the election of Pope Benedict XVI. The Rise of Benedict XVI is based on extensive research and exclusive interviews with eight cardinals representing five nationalities, guaranteeing readers an intimate glimpse into this monumental decision. But Allen s insight also means that he is in a unique position to evaluate the accomplishments and legacy of the man now known as Pope Benedict XVI, and to provide some analysis of the direction he would take the Catholic Church in the coming years. Ratzinger s long career as a major Vatican insider, force of influence, and occasionally polarizing figure, has ensured that his pontificate will be one of the most fascinating in the history of the Catholic Church. Benedict XVI would certainly have a major impact on the lives of the faithful around the world, and John Allen s riveting new book is the definitive work on this turning point in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jXhRFZDK8HIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only Angels Have Wings","description":"John H Evans has been a commercial airline pilot and airline executive for almost 40 years. He grew up as an asthmatic child in the confines of the mining valley of the Rhondda in Wales and was drawn to flying largely by his memories of a Second World War Bomber Pilot from his own village who went missing later in the war.

Their lands had been called \\"splendid and fertile\\" by French governor Bienville at the time they were being coveted by early European settlers. The people were also termed \\"splendid\\" and described by documents of the 1700s as \\"tall, well made, and of an unparalleled courage. . . . The men have regular features, well shaped and neatly dressed; they are fierce, and have a high opinion of themselves.\\" The progenitors of the sociopolitical entity termed by European chroniclers progressively as Chicasa, Chicaca, Chicacha, Chicasaws, and finally Chickasaw may have migrated from west of the Mississippi River in prehistoric times. Or migrating people may have joined indigenous populations. Despite this longevity in their ancestral lands, the Chickasaw were the only one of the original \\"five civilized tribes\\" to leave no remnant community in the Southeast at the time of removal. Atkinson thoroughly researches the Chickasaw Indians, tracing their history as far back as the documentation and archaeological record will allow. He historicizes from a Native viewpoint and outlines political events leading to removal, while addressing important issues such as slave-holding among Chickasaws, involvement of Chickasaw and neighboring Indian tribes in the American Revolution, and the lives of Chickasaw women. Splendid Land, Splendid People will become a fundamental resource for current information and further research on the Chickasaw. A wide audience of librarians, anthropologists, historians, and general readers have long awaited publication of this important volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1EyjqCEKLwC&dq=Splendid+Land,+Splendid+People:+The+Chickasaw+Indians+to+Removal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Touch: The Men of Sugar Mountain (Zebra Bouquet Romances)","description":"Ten years after Paige, Kate, and Zoe seclude themselves in a mountainside cottage and emerge with a baby boy, they still refuse to identify the child's mother, until circumstances lead them back into the lives of the Skylar brothers, one of whom is the father.

In Preaching: How to Preach Biblically, John MacArthur ' well-known passion for the Bible combines with the expertise of faculty members at The Master's Seminary to inspire and equip preachers in effective biblical preaching. Preaching: How to Preach Biblically flows from biblical foundations for expository preaching through a detailed process of developing expositions and creating sermons to the actual delivery of expository messages, connecting what pastors learn in seminary with the sermons preached in a local church. This volume shows how to progress purposefully from one phase to the next in preparing to minister to God's people through preaching. This book answers these questions and more: What is expository, biblical preaching? What are the theological and historical foundations for insisting on expository preaching? What are the steps involved in preparation for and participation in biblical preaching? What models exist for expository preaching today? The Master's Seminary faculty, with over thirty years' experience in preaching and seminary training of preachers, contributes a treasury of expertise alongside insights from expositor John MacArthur. While united on their commitment to exposition, the variety of individual expressions and methodological preferences discussed offers beneficial assistance for any preacher seeking a higher level of expository excellence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_g2hmoTDb9AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key Concepts in Cinema Studies","description":"Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts is an essential guide for anyone interested in film.

In Architects of the Culture of Death, authors Donald DeMarco and Benjamin Wiker expose the Culture of Death as an intentional and malevolent ideology promoted by influential thinkers who specifically attack Christian morality's core belief in the sanctity of human life and the existence of man's immortal soul. In scholarly, yet reader-friendly prose, DeMarco and Wiker examine the roots of the Culture of Death by introducing 23 of its architects, including Ayn Rand, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Sanger, Jack Kevorkian, and Peter Singer. Still, this is not a book without hope. If the Culture of Death rests on a fragmented view of the person and an eclipse of God, the future of the Culture of Life relies on an understanding and restoration of the human being as a person, and the rediscovery of a benevolent God. The personalism of John Paul II is an illuminating thread that runs through Architects, serving as a hopeful antidote.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x1d4DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"KENDERMORE (Dragonlance: Preludes)","description":"First launched over a decade ago, the Preludes series has continued to prove popular with Dragonlance fans.

In Airlines and Air Mail, F. Robert van der Linden persuasively argues that Progressive republican policies of Herbert Hoover actually fostered the growth of American commercial aviation. Air mail contracts provided a critical indirect subsidy and a solid financial foundation for this nascent industry. Postmaster General Walter F. Brown used these contracts as a carrot and a stick to ensure that the industry developed in the public interest while guaranteeing the survival of the pioneering companies. Bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, and politicians of all stripes are thoughtfully portrayed in this thorough chronicle of one of America's most resounding successes, the commercial aviation industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_EooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angels and earthly creatures,: A sequence of sonnets","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PqseAAAAIAAJ&dq=Angels+and+earthly+creatures,:+A+sequence+of+sonnets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dean Koontz: A Reader's Checklist and Reference Guide (Checkerbee Checklists)","description":"-- Color photos of every Cherished Teddies \\"RM\\" piece -- What's new for 2000 -- Up-to-date secondary market prices -- A spotlight on artist Priscilla Hillman","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0l8CAAAACAAJ&dq=Dean+Koontz:+A+Reader%27s+Checklist+and+Reference+Guide+(Checkerbee+Checklists)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Statistics for Business and Economics","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZ0cAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Direct and Cross-Examination of John Dean in U.S. v.

This study is part of a series designed to help women live out significant Christianity in specific areas of their lives.To some, developing healthy habits with food and exercise may not seem like a significant lifestyle issue. But those who have tested this guide will tell you differently. Here are some of their testimonies:I never realized before that my eating habits were related to my obedience to God. As I am developing obedience in this area of my life, it is radiating out to other areas of my walk.I've been to other diet groups, but none that dealt with the spiritual dimension, and I've come to realize that my poor eating habits are a spiritual problem. Another emphasis I've come to appreciate is that the habits I've learned during these 10 weeks are not a diet, but a lifestyle. I'm going through the guide again, right away, with a friend, to help cement those lifestyle habits.This guide spills over into all of life: topics like perspective, persistence, and convictions have a much broader application than just my eating habits.I've never been through a study that kept me so accountable! There were times when I considered bailing out, but I'm so thankful I didn't-not only because of the weight I lost, but because I've seen some real changes in my eating habits.It's common for weight control support groups to begin with many members and then dwindle. Therefore, make a commitment now to yourself and to the other group members, to stay with the group for the entire study, to weigh in every week, and to do the disciplines required. Sometimes it will be painful, but there's seldom victory without a cost. Determine now to pay the cost.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xaPTTioLCrQC&dq=The+Joy+of+Eating+Right!:+Spiritual+and+Nutritional+Principles+for+Weight+Control+(Bible+Study+for+Women)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Faith of a Scientist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=19QnAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Faith+of+a+Scientist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crone's Book of Magical Words","description":"There is a traditional basis for many of the spells in this book and a psychological basis for all of them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fxYGxZ77J10C&dq=Crone%27s+Book+of+Magical+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Verses and Fly Leaves","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

In his book, Bill Burke captures the dramatic history of Indochina from the influence of French colonialism, through the rise of communism and the devastating effects of the Vietnam War, and to the repopulation of Cambodia after the fall of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge and the opening of the area to capitalism. Autrefois, Maison Priv e is the only book to delineate this transformation. Featuring Burke's signature gritty layout and design, Autrefois, Maison Priv e is a marvel livre deluxe of history, architecture, and photography. Photographer Bill Burke has taken annual trips to Indochina ever since he first traveled to Asia in 1982. Although he usually photographed the people, Burke became aware of how the architecture absorbed as much as reflected the region's history. Transfixed by buildings like the municipal offices built by the French in the 1860s, the vaulted railroad stations and post offices of the 1930s, and the art deco fantasy cinemas of the 1960s, Burke saw the region as an architectural museum, rotting in the humidity and untouched by economic ambition, and began to trace the cultural changes in the area through its architecture. Burke's first entr e into Indochina occurred during the period of Soviet control, a period of recovery that allowed for the current explosion of capitalism, which has already begun to devastate an architectural heritage that was well preserved in the deep freeze of socialism. What the B-52s and tanks didn't destroy during decades of war, developers from neighboring countries are busily replacing and defacing with their shrines of commerce.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fcJkAAAACAAJ&dq=Autrefois,+Maison+Privee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Departing Glory Theodore Roosevelt as Ex-President","description":"Historical biography of the personal political tragedy related to Theodore Roosevelt's efforts to regain power after he left the White House.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SG93AAAAMAAJ&dq=Departing+Glory+Theodore+Roosevelt+as+Ex-President&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Venezuela (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)","description":"Discusses the history of Venezuela from the appearance of hunter-gatherers approximately twenty thousand years ago to its present day status as a major exporter of petroleum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=krJxx5adqHoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs: Correspondence","description":"Correspondence between the two twentieth-century German poets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mfIgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Paul+Celan,+Nelly+Sachs:+Correspondence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pyro : A Novel of Suspense","description":"FROM THE ASHES, EVEN THE MONSTERS CAN BE REBORN.Mackenzie wakes up, naked, in front of a burning apartment with amnesia and a voice in her head telling her to run.

As they move from darkness to light, from rage to self-governance, from primitive ritual to civilized institution, their spirit of struggle and regeneration becomes an everlasting song of celebration. In Agamemnon, a king's decision to sacrifice his daughter and turn the tide of war inflicts lasting damage on his family, culminating in a terrible act of retribution; The Libation Bearers deals with the aftermath of Clytemnestra's regicide, as her son Orestes sets out to avenge his father's death; and in The Eumenides, Orestes is tormented by supernatural powers that can never be appeased. Forming an elegant and subtle discourse on the emergence of Athenian democracy out of a period of chaos and destruction, The Oresteia is a compelling tragedy of the tensions between our obligations to our families and the laws that bind us together as a society. The only trilogy in Greek drama that survives from antiquity, Aeschylus' The Oresteia is translated by Robert Fagles with an introduction, notes and glossary written in collaboration with W.B. Stanford in Penguin Classics. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to rip them apart. Kate is the lawyer hired to prosecute the case: an experienced professional who knows that the law is all about winning the argument. And yet Kate seeks the truth at all times. She is certain James is guilty and is determined he will pay for his crimes. Who is right about James? Sophie or Kate? And is either of them informed by anything more than instinct and personal experience? Despite her privileged upbringing, Sophie is well aware that her beautiful life is not inviolable. She has known it since she and James were first lovers, at Oxford, and she witnessed how easily pleasure could tip into tragedy. Most people would prefer not to try to understand what passes between a man and a woman when they are alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in an elevator...Or alone in the moonlit courtyard of an Oxford college, where a girl once stood before a boy, heart pounding with excitement, then fear.

The Secret Doctrine, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's masterwork on the origin and evolution of the universe and humanity itself, is arguably the most famous, and perhaps the most influential, occult book ever written. Published since 1888 only in expensive, two-volume editions of some 1,400 pages, it has long eluded the grasp of modern readers- until now. This single-volume edition, abridged and annotated by historian and Theosophical scholar Michael Gomes, places the ideas of The Secret Doctrine within reach of all who are curious. In particular, Gomes provides a critical sounding of the book's famous stanzas on the genesis of life and the cosmos- mysterious passages that Blavatsky said originated from a primeval source and which form the heart of The Secret Doctrine. Gomes scrupulously scales down the book's key writings on symbolism to their essentials, and offers notes and a glossary to illuminate arcane references. His historical and literary introduction casts new light on some of the book's sources and on the career of its brilliant and elusive author, one of the most intriguing personages of the nineteenth century. At once compact and representative of the work as a whole, this new edition of The Secret Doctrine brings unprecedented accessibility to the key esoteric classic of the modern era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qbkCCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays (Dover Thrift Editions)","description":"The most durable of medieval morality plays, along with 3 other classics: The Second Shepherd s Play, Noah s Flood and Hickscorner.

Perhaps it's because of the unquiet ghosts of the Aboriginals slaughtered by the Answerth ancestors. Whatever the reason, most people are content to give Venom House and its occupants a wide berth... until a couple of corpses turn up in the lake... The strength of Upfield's accomplishment in this book is so overwhelming it makes the reader cower. The characters are well-developed, the conversation vernacular for the Australian outback, and the development compelling. The story is the nearest Upfield comes to a story that would have made Edgar Allen Poe envious, Upfield maintains a kind of corpse-like humour which is very amusing...

This is the true story of a girl's extraordinary survival during the German occupation of Holland of World War II. Annie was only ten years old, but because she was Jewish, she was forced to leave her family, her home, and everything she knew. Annie was taken in, far from home, by complete strangers who risked everything to help her. They showed Annie where she had to stay - the cramped upstairs room of their farmhouse. She would remain there while Nazis, who were ever vigilant, patrolled the streets outside. If Annie made even a sound from upstairs, or if a nosy neighbor caught sight of her in the window, it would surely mean a death sentence for her and the family that took her in. Elie Wiesel writes,  This admirable account is as important in every aspect as the one bequeathed to us by Anne Frank.\\" A Newbery Medal Honor Book, ALA Notable Book, and winner of the Jewish Book Council Children s Book Award.

On the other hand, this is not the satire of Ambrose Bierce or H.L. Mencken. It is more like the kind of in-your-face semantic slapstick that you might expect of a George Carlin or Lenny Bruce...

Stephen King When a small-town family is pushed to the brink, how far will they go to protect one of their own? An edgy, propulsive read about what we will do in the name of love and blood Tony has always looked out for his younger brother, Nick. So when he's called to a hospital bed where Nick is lying battered and bruised after a violent sexual assault, his protective instincts flare, and a white-hot rage begins to build. As a small-town New England lawyer, Tony's wife, Julia, has cases involving kids all the time. When Detective Rice gets assigned to this one, Julia feels they're in good hands. Especially because she senses that Rice, too, understands how things can quickly get complicated. Very complicated. After all, one moment Nick was having a drink with a handsome stranger; the next, he was at the center of an investigation threatening to tear not only him, but his entire family, apart. And now his attacker, out on bail, is disputing Nick's version of what happened. As Julia tries to help her brother-in-law, she sees Tony's desire for revenge, to fix things for Nick, getting out of control. Tony is starting to scare her.

Before Lawrence Durrell became a renowned novelist, poet, and travel writer, he spent four youthful years on Corfu, an island jewel with beauty to match the long and fascinating history within its rocky shores. While his brother, Gerald, was collecting animals as a budding naturalist, Lawrence fished, drank, and lived with the natives in the years leading up to World War II, sheltered from the tumult that was engulfing Europe until finally he could ignore the world no longer. Durrell left for Alexandria, to serve his country as a wartime diplomat, but never forgot the wonders of Corfu. In this  brilliant  journey through that idyllic time and place, Durrell returns to the land that made him so happy, blending his love of history with memories of his adventures there (The Economist). Like the blue Aegean, Prospero s Cell is deep and crystal clear, offering a perfect view straight to the heart of a nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5v0ccSnRPMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gabriel and the hour book, (Roses of St. Elizabeth series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eYz-wAEACAAJ&dq=Gabriel+and+the+hour+book,+(Roses+of+St.+Elizabeth+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Die deutsche Militarelite 1939-1945: Zeitgeschichte in Farbe (The German Military Elite 1939-1945 in Color)","description":"Presents tips and advice for creating a new business, utilizing the author's experience in creating her own successful business to guide readers in planning, funding, promotion, pricing, and self-evaluation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6HaxJCM7ek0C&dq=Die+deutsche+Militarelite+1939-1945:+Zeitgeschichte+in+Farbe+(The+German+Military+Elite+1939-1945+in+Color)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man Corn: Cannibalism and Violence in the Prehistoric American Southwest","description":"Using detailed osteological analyses and other lines of evidence, this study of prehistoric violence, homicide, and cannibalism explodes the myth that the Anasazi and other Southwest Indians were simple, peaceful farmers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h2Z0AAAAMAAJ&dq=Man+Corn:+Cannibalism+and+Violence+in+the+Prehistoric+American+Southwest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Room for Rabbit","description":"There s a strong biblical connection between people and trees. They both come from dirt. They re both told to bear fruit. In fact, arboreal language is so often applied to humans that it s easy to miss, whether we're talking about family trees, passing along our seed, cutting someone off like a branch, being rooted to a place, or bearing the fruit of the Spirit. It s hard to deny that trees mean something, theologically speaking. This book is in many ways a memoir, but it s also an attempt to wake up the reader to the glory of God shining through his creation. One of the first commands to Adam and Eve was to  work and keep  the garden. Award-winning author and songwriter Andrew Peterson, being as honest as possible, shares a story of childhood, grief, redemption, and peace, by walking through a forest of memories:  I trust that by telling my story, you ll encounter yours. Hopefully, like me, you ll see that the God of the Garden is and has always been present, working and keeping what he loves.  Sometimes he plants, sometimes he prunes, but in his goodness he intends to reap a harvest of righteousness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tUlKEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Travels of IBN Battuta A.D. 1325-1354- 3 Vol.'s","description":"Vols. for 1898-1968 include a directory of publishers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SNsaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Travels+of+IBN+Battuta+A.D.+1325-1354-+3+Vol.%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2002 Record Book Indianapolis 500 (Trackside Publications)","description":"\\"The Legend of the First Super Speedway,\\" is a gritty tale punctuated by humor that chronicles the hero's journey through the pioneering age of American auto racing.

From neighborhood coalitions organizing against the building of a sport facility for professional sports teams subsidized by public funds, to global campaigns for equity for women in sport, to worldwide bans of apartheid regimes, sites and levels of protest, resistance and activism have been present throughout the history of sport. Contentious forms of collective actions are now ever more present in various forms at the local, the national and the global levels. Sport and Social Movements: From the Local to the Global is the first book-length treatment of the way social movements have intersected and continue to intersect with sport. It traces the history of various social movements associated with labour, women, peace, the environment and rights (civil, racial, disability and sexual), and their relationship to sport and sports mega-events such as the Olympic Games. Based on research conducted by a multinational team of authors that draws on theories of social movements and new social movements, the book includes a valuable chronology of social movements, illustrations of key episodes in the development of the relationships between sport and different social movements and an agenda for future research and scholarship. Written in a clear and comprehensive style it is suitable for all levels of higher education, researchers and the general reader who want to know more about the role that sport has played in the development of social movements and campaigns for social justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jc8BAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greatest Cat Stories Ever Told: Thirty Unforgettable Cat Tales","description":"From the tiniest of kittens to the lordliest of lions, the most memorable feline stories ever written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8yhGvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Cat+Stories+Ever+Told:+Thirty+Unforgettable+Cat+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yurok Myths","description":"Creation, institutional, and other myths, heroic legends, folk tales, and other traditional narratives of the Northwest Coast tribe are accompanied by biographical and psychological studies of the informants and explanatory notes","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ADnOwAEACAAJ&dq=Yurok+Myths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billy Boyle","description":"What s a twenty-two-year-old Irish American cop who s never been out of Massachusetts before doing at Beardsley Hall, an English country house, having lunch with King Haakon of Norway?

This is an account of one ship's voyage and of the sailors who daily risk their lives to deliver six million containers a year to United States ports alone. Inside these twenty-foot and forty-foot steel boxes are the thousands of imports -- from chinos and Game Boys to garlic and frozen shrimp -- without which North America's consumer society would collapse. To explore this little-known and dangerous universe of modern seafaring, Richard Pollak joined the Colombo Bay in Hong Kong and over the next five weeks sailed with her and her 3,500 containers across the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. En route, this mammoth vessel called at Singapore and Colombo, passed through the Suez Canal (toll: $250,000), then put in at Malta and Halifax before tangling with Hurricane Karen on the two-day run to New York. Here is the story of the ship's unheralded twenty-four-man company; of the unflappable British captain, Peter Davies, a veteran of four decades at sea; of Federico Castrojas, who like the rest of the hard-working Filipino crew must daily confront the loneliness of being away from his family for nine months at a stretch; of Simon Westall, the twenty-one-year-old third mate, who reveals what it is like to be gay in the broad-shouldered world of the merchant service. It is a world where pirates in the Malacca Strait sneak up behind ships at night in fast power boats, then clamber aboard and either rob the unarmed sailors at gunpoint and escape into the dark or throw the crew into the sea and hijack the ship, plundering her cargo and sometimes repainting her and setting out to do business under another name and flag. It is a world where families desperate to get to the United States or Europe pay thousands of dollars to the Chinese Snakeheads and other criminal gangs, who secrete these wretched migrants in stifling containers; after a week or more at sea these stowaways arrive in the Promised Land either starving or dead. Pollak sailed on September 13, 2001, into a changed world, on one of 7,000 container ships whose millions of uninspected boxes suddenly had become potential Trojan horses in which terrorists could transport weapons of mass destruction into the heart of the United States. Throughout his riveting narrative, Pollak interweaves the insights of Herman Melville and Joseph Conrad, whose masterful portrayals of seafaring make the voyage of the Colombo Bay a dramatic reminder of what a hard and rarely reported life merchant seamen have always led out on the \\"unhooped oceans of this planet.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HRo4AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"De Anima (Oxford Classical Texts) (Ancient Greek Edition)","description":"Please note, this is the original Greek text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zCC8s_T-07UC&dq=De+Anima+(Oxford+Classical+Texts)+(Ancient+Greek+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Kiss: Thick Black Kiss","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0RuyAAAACAAJ&dq=Black+Kiss:+Thick+Black+Kiss&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overcoming Abigail","description":"In turn-of-the-century New Orleans, beautiful and virginal Abigail Du Pre has just been given to the mysterious Dr. Lucien Trier, sent to be his servant in exchange for her father's onerous gambling debts.

Through her own submission to the Doctor's perverse desires, Abigail discovers a strength and sexuality within herself equal to any man's, and the Doctor finds himself helplessly in love with this sensual and passionate woman.

Hess describes a distinct subculture whose behavioral patterns have been largely determined by the specific political, economic, and social history of Sicily, a society characterized by a weak state and organized on the basis of self-help. This subculture was and is the breeding ground for the strong-arm man \\"mafioso\\" or \\"uomo d'onore,\\" man of honor, as he is called in Sicily, the proud, taciturn, independent man who believes in the use of violence to achieve personal goals. As a rule, the men come from poor families and rise through violent crime, shrewd diplomacy and the building of a \\"family\\" of followers to a respected position of power and wealth. Most important are the mafioso's reciprocal arrangements with politicians and government officials whom he supports in the elections and who protect him from law enforcement. Mafia, popularly conceived as a strictly centralized secret society, is instead proven to be a system of independent families which might on many occasions cooperate, but just as easily be driven to bloody feud. Only in the last decade have there been a number of so-called \\"pentiti,\\" crown witnesses who cooperate with the criminal justice system. Using their testimonies, an extensive afterword brings the book up to date.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0-qglRPSAQC&dq=Mafia+and+Mafiosi:+Origin,+Power,+and+Myth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hamlet and the Enormous Chinese Dragon Kite","description":"Hamlet the pig???s enthusiasm and unflinching optimism is a comical juxtaposition to his best friend Quince, an eternally worrying porcupine.

It is precisely the broad sweep of Barth s theology that makes a book like The Great Passion of such great value a succinct yet comprehensive introduction to Barth s entire theological program. Of the many people who write on the life and thought of Karl Barth, Eberhard Busch is uniquely placed. A world-renowned expert on Barth s theology, he also served as Barth s personal assistant from 1965 to 1968. As Busch explains, one cannot fully understand Barth the theologian apart from understanding Barth the man. In this book he weaves doctrine and biography into a superb presentation of Barth s complete work. Busch s purpose in this introduction is to guide readers through the main themes of the multivolume Church Dogmatics against the horizon of our own times and problems. In ten sections Busch clearly explains Barth s views on all of the major subject areas of systematic theology: the nature of revelation, Israel and Christology, the Trinity and the doctrine of predestination, the problem of religion, gospel and law, creation, salvation, the Holy Spirit, ecclesiology, and eschatology. A distinctive feature of the book is the way Busch lets Barth speak for himself, often through surprising quotations and paraphrases. Busch also shows how Barth s writing should be read as a dialogue, constantly and consciously engaging other voices past and present, both inside and outside the church. Most important, The Great Passion demonstrates that Barth s thought is still remarkably helpful today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jXWmbGr86jEC&dq=The+Great+Passion:+An+Introduction+to+Karl+Barth%27s+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboys","description":"From Dandy Don Meredith and Roger Staubach to the three mid-nineties Super Bowls won by the unbeatable trio of Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, and Emmitt Smith to TO, Tony Romo, and the glitzy soap opera team of today, the Dallas Cowboys have been the NFL's star franchise for more than 50 years. Love them or hate them, the Cowboys are widely celebrated as \\"America's Team.\\" But the Cowboys have never been just about football. With their oil baron roots, overbearing, ego-driven owner, players who can't stay out of the tabloids, a palatial new home that sets the standard for modern sports stadiums, fans as enthusiastic as cheerleaders, and cheerleaders who are as famous as the team itself, the Cowboys have become a touchstone of American popular culture. Joe Nick Patoski plumbs all these stories in a book that is a rich, sometimes scandalous, always entertaining portrait of a time, a place, and an irreplaceable team.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3OrsrUG9S8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wednesday Girl","description":"Right before Gwendolyn's case closed as written about in docu-eroticamentary Eight Weeks in May, Robert Hauser, III, the diligent states attorney handling the case, sent two of his best detectives over to Gwendolyn's house to \\"end their relationship\\" in December 2013.

Harris,  Flight has been part of the human dream for aeons, and its military application has likely been the dark side of that dream for almost as long.  In the twentieth century, this dream and its dark side unfolded as the air forces of the world went to war, bringing destruction and reassessment with each failure. Why Air Forces Fail examines the complex, often deep-seated, reasons for the catastrophic failures of the air forces of various nations. Higham and Harris divide the air forces into three categories of defeat: forces that never had a chance to win, such as Poland and France; forces that started out victorious but were ultimately defeated, such as Germany and Japan; and finally, those that were defeated in their early efforts yet rose to victory, such as the air forces of Britain and the United States. The contributing authors examine the complex causes of defeats of the Russian, Polish, French, Arab, British, Italian, German, Argentine, and American air services. In all cases, the failures stemmed from deep, usually prewar factors that were shaped by the political, economic, military, and social circumstances in the countries. Defeat also stemmed from the anticipation of future wars, early wartime actions, and the precarious relationship between the doctrine of the military leadership and its execution in the field. Anthony Christopher Cain s chapter on France s air force, l Arm e de l Air, attributes France s loss to Germany in June 1940 to a lack of preparation and investment in the air force. One major problem was the failure to centralize planning or coordinate a strategy between land and air forces, which was compounded by aborted alliances between France and countries in eastern Europe, especially Poland and Czechoslovakia. In addition, the lack of incentives for design innovation in air technologies led to clashes between airplane manufacturers, laborers, and the government, a struggle that resulted in France s airplanes  being outnumbered by Germany s more than three to one by 1940. Complemented by reading lists and suggestions for further research, Why Air Forces Fail provides groundbreaking studies of the causes of air force defeats.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T0gt_RjeCrgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fuhgeddaboutit: How to Badda Boom, Badda Bing, and Find Your Inner Mobster","description":"Fuhgeddaboutit: How to Badda Boom, Badda Bing, and Find Your Inner Mobster is the definitive guide on how to be a twenty-first-century made man.

The citizens of ancient Athens enjoyed a freedom of speech as broad as our own. This freedom, parrhesia, the right to say what one pleased, how and when one pleased, and to whom, had no more fervent champion than the brilliant fifth-century comic playwright Aristophanes. His plays, immensely popular with the Athenian public, were frequently crude, even obscene. He ridiculed the great and the good of the city, showing up their hypocrisy and arrogance in ways that went far beyond the standards of good taste, securing the ire (and sometimes the retaliation) of his powerful targets. He showed his contemporaries, and he teaches us now, that when those in power act obscenely, patriotic obscenity is a fitting response. Aristophanes s satirical masterpieces were also surpassingly virtuosic works of poetry. The metrical variety of his plays has always thrilled readers who can access the original Greek, but until now, English translations have failed to capture their lyrical genius. Aaron Poochigian, the first poet-classicist to tackle these plays in a generation, brings back to life four of Aristophanes s most entertaining, wickedly crude, and frequently beautiful lyric comedies the pinnacle of his comic art:   Clouds, a play famous for its caricature of antiquity s greatest philosopher, Socrates;   Lysistrata, in which a woman convinces her female compatriots to withhold sex from their warmongering lovers unless they negotiate peace;   Birds, in which feathered creatures build a great city and become like gods;   and Women of the Assembly, Aristophones s most revolutionary play, which inverts the norms of gender and power. Poochigian s new rendering of these comic masterpieces finally gives contemporary readers a sense of the subversive pleasure Aristophones s original audiences felt when they were first performed on the Athenian stage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lzTxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston: The Breath of Her Voice","description":"Filtered through black womanist perspectives, Zora Neale Hurston: The Breath of Her Voice breaks new ground through innovation and imagination, by fusing interpretive methods in ethnographic writing and literary studies.

But the selective process of memory has radically shaped our picture of the conflict. Why else, for instance, was a 1995 Smithsonian exhibition on Hiroshima that was to include photographs of the first atomic bomb victims, along with their testimonials, considered so controversial? And why do we so readily remember the civilian bombings of Britain but not those of Dresden, Hamburg, and Tokyo? Marianna Torgovnick argues that we have lived, since the end of World War II, under the power of a war complex a set of repressed ideas and impulses that stems from our unresolved attitudes toward the technological acceleration of mass death. This complex has led to gaps and hesitations in public discourse about atrocities committed during the war itself. And it remains an enduring wartime consciousness, one most recently animated on September 11. Showing how different events from World War II became prominent in American cultural memory while others went forgotten or remain hidden in plain sight, The War Complex moves deftly from war films and historical works to television specials and popular magazines to define the image and influence of World War II in our time. Torgovnick also explores the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, the emotional legacy of the Holocaust, and the treatment of World War II's missing history by writers such as W. G. Sebald to reveal the unease we feel at our dependence on those who hold the power of total war. Thinking anew, then, about how we account for war to each other and ourselves, Torgovnick ultimately, and movingly, shows how these anxieties and fears have prepared us to think about September 11 and our current war in Iraq.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L1mfUVX7y-IC&dq=The+War+Complex:+World+War+II+in+Our+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"De profundis, (The modern library of the world's best books)","description":"Portrays the lives of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas through a letter written by Wilde, professing his love for Douglas and his disappointment of his own deteriorating life in prison.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n3m2mAEACAAJ&dq=De+profundis,+(The+modern+library+of+the+world%27s+best+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Changelings (The Twins of Petaybee, Book 1)","description":"When a visiting scientist to the planet of Petaybee discovers the shapeshifting talents of the Shongili twins, who are able to transform between human and seal bodies, the twins are in danger of being kidnapped and must flee their home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-5S-w6orJLcC&dq=Changelings+(The+Twins+of+Petaybee,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tiber Afire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=elomAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Tiber+Afire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cloudstreet: Library Edition","description":"Winner of the Miles Franklin Award and recognised as one of the greatest works of Australian literature, Cloudstreet is Tim Winton's sprawling, comic epic about luck and love, fortitude and forgiveness, and the magic of the everyday. After two separate catastrophes, two very different families leave the country for the bright lights of Perth. The Lambs are industrious, united and  until God seems to turn his back on their boy Fish  religious. The Pickleses are gamblers, boozers, fractious, and unlikely landlords. Chance, hardship and the war force them to swallow their dignity and share a great, breathing, shuddering joint called Cloudstreet. Over the next twenty years they struggle and strive, laugh and curse, come apart and pull together under the same roof, and try as they can to make their lives.  This is that rare book, a novel of both heart and intellect. It pulses with a sense of wonder and shines with the clear light of truth.  Robert Drewe  One of the great masterpieces of world fiction.  Philip Hensher  If you have not read Cloudstreet, your life is diminished . . . if you have not met these characters, this generous community, these tragedies, the humour. It is so wonderful.

Michael Gamer offers a sharply focused analysis of how and why Romantic writers drew on Gothic conventions whilst, at the same time, denying their influence in order to claim critical respectability. He shows how the reception of Gothic literature, including its institutional and commercial recognition as a form of literature, played a fundamental role in the development of Romanticism as an ideology. In doing so he examines the early history of the Romantic movement and its assumptions about literary value, and the politics of reading, writing and reception at the end of the eighteenth century. As a whole the book makes an original contribution to our understanding of genre, tracing the impact of reception, marketing and audience on its formation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u1bJ2WOaWU8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Always My Child: A Parent's Guide to Understanding Your Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered or Questioning Son or Daughter","description":"Offers advice and support for parents with adolescents dealing with sexual identity, personal confusion, bigotry, tension, and other challenges of being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OjJHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Always+My+Child:+A+Parent%27s+Guide+to+Understanding+Your+Gay,+Lesbian,+Bisexual,+Transgendered+or+Questioning+Son+or+Daughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Floor Sample","description":"An unflinching memoir by the woman who has helped thousands of people uncover their creative inspiration.

Nicknamed \\"The Hoosier Tornado\\" for her energetic personality, Carole Lombard did as much as anyone to define the genre, delighting audiences with her zany antics in such films as Twentieth Century, My Man Godfrey, Nothing Sacred, and To Be or Not to Be. She also captured America's attention through her romance with and eventual marriage to screen idol Clark Gable. In this inaugural volume in the Indiana Historical Society Press's Indiana Biography Series, Wes D. Gehring, a noted authority on film comedy, examines Lombard's legacy, focusing on both the public and private figure from her early days as merely beautiful window dressing in Mack Sennett silent films, to her development as the leading motion-picture comedienne of her time, to her tragic death in a January 1942 plane crash following a successful war-bond rally in Indianapolis. He also explores the rapport this sometimes \\"Profane Angel\\" (Lombard swore like a sailor) enjoyed with not only directors, but also the blue-collar workers who toiled on movie sets. The biography also features a foreword written by Scott Robert Olson, dean of the college of communications, information, and media, and professor of communication studies at Ball State University. In her comedic roles, Gehring states in the book, Lombard offered the life lesson that \\"the irrational mind -- crazy Carole -- stood a much better chance of surviving in the equally irrational modern world.\\" Lombard's film persona continues to survive in the public's collective conscious. \\"Her screwball heroine is as significant for modern audiences as yesteryear's more traditional literary figures,\\" Gehring writes. Nationally respected for its publication program, the Indiana Historical Society Press has always excelled particularly in one area: telling the life and times of those who have had an impact on the Hoosier State. The Press continues this tradition with its new Indiana Biography Series, which pairs writers with Indiana subjects of note. Future volumes in the series will highlight such personalities as Jonathan Jennings, Gus Grissom, Thomas Marshall, James Dean, Meredith Nicholson, Susan Wallace, David L. Chambers, and Cleo Blackburn.

That \\"the whole nine yards\\" comes from (pick one) the length of a WWII gunner's belt; the amount of fabric needed to make a kilt; a sarcastic football expression? That Chicago is called \\"The Windy City\\" because of the bloviating habits of its politicians, and not the breeze off the lake? If so, you need this book. David Wilton debunks the most persistently wrong word histories, and gives, to the best of our actual knowledge, the real stories behind these perennially mis-etymologized words. In addition, he explains why these wrong stories are created, disseminated, and persist, even after being corrected time and time again. What makes us cling to these stories, when the truth behind these words and phrases is available, for the most part, at any library or on the Internet? Arranged by chapters, this book avoids a dry A-Z format. Chapters separate misetymologies by kind, including The Perils of Political Correctness (picnics have nothing to do with lynchings), Posh, Phat Pommies (the problems of bacronyming--the desire to make every word into an acronym), and CANOE (which stands for the Conspiracy to Attribute Nautical Origins to Everything). Word Myths corrects long-held and far-flung examples of wrong etymologies, without taking the fun out of etymology itself. It's the best of both worlds: not only do you learn the many wrong stories behind these words, you also learn why and how they are created--and what the real story is.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5LEWiomDiEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Internet: A Chronology, 1843 to the Present","description":"A chronology of telecommunications from Babbage's earliest theories of a \\"Difference Engine\\" to the impact of the Internet in 1998 to future trends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hu5SAAAAMAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Internet:+A+Chronology,+1843+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Been There, Done That : A Novel","description":"Theirs was a forever kind of love, until it was stolen.

In a small flat in London, a young man is turning to gold. But before he dies, before his skin and eyes and tongue harden into a golden death mask, he wants to share the amazing story of his life. Born and raised on the barren Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland, his childhood is a brutal one, devoid of tenderness. It is a miracle when he meets Tracy, falls in love, and discovers his true gift: the merest touch of him is enough to induce visions of angels and orchids. The physical heights he is able to reach-and to which he can bring others-go far beyond any normal sensual pleasure. Armed with this inexplicable talent, he makes his way to London, where he falls in with a group of teens forced to make a living on the street. Luke Sutherland's modern-day myth about the power of love veers from stratosphere to gutter, from visions of heaven to the all-too-mortal yearning for even one glimpse of it. With Venus as a Boy Sutherland has written a moving, poetic novel that manages to imbue the harsh realities of life on the street with a mesmerizing and ethereal beauty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z5LdRVSPucYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superconducting Magnets (Monographs on Cryogenics: No. 2)","description":"Over the years the aim of the International Conference on Magnet Technology has been the exchange of information on the design, construction and operation of magnets for a variety of applications, such as high energy physics, fusion, electrical machinery and others.

The papers were reviewed not only by the Program Committee but also by foreign participants. Working sessions and social events were characterized by a truly international atmo sphere.

Once a luxurious southern getaway on a rustic lake, then reduced to a dilapidated crash pad, the Summer House is now the grisly scene of a nighttime mass murder. Eyewitnesses point to four Army Rangers known as the Night Ninjas recently returned from Afghanistan. To ensure that justice is done, the Army sends Major Jeremiah Cook, a veteran and former NYPD cop, to investigate. But the major and his elite team arrive in sweltering Georgia with no idea their grim jobs will be made exponentially more challenging by local law enforcement, who resists the Army's intrusion and stonewall them at every turn. As Cook and his squad struggle to uncover the truth behind the condemning evidence, the pieces just won't fit and forces are rallying to make certain damning secrets die alongside the victims in the murder house. With his own people in the cross-hairs, Cook takes a desperate gamble to find answers even if it means returning to a hell of his own worst nightmares . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q6S0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s","description":"This is the story of four San Francisco 49ers: Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson, and Y.

In the tradition of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', Grove examines the idea of a utopian society through the story of a group of travelling ants who find themselves in North America. An amateur scientist encounters the colony and makes telepathic contact with a very special elder of the ant community. In fact, the ant infuses the scientist with her memory and uses her new friend as a medium through which she tells the colony's incredible story, a tale that holds up a mirror to our culture, demonstrating to both worlds the parallels and contrasts between the pastoral ways of the ants and the North American life of excess. This classic Canadian novel is back in print for the first time in 20 years, allowing readers to more completely assess Grove's body of works. Fans of speculative fiction will be delighted to see that his prose is as fresh as it was 50 years ago. This was Grove's last novel, and it stands as a testament both to his writing and his prescience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q-18CUD6p1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stripes and spots","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GgJOMQAACAAJ&dq=Stripes+and+spots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitler's Secret Backers","description":"The book you are about to read is one of the most extraordinary historical documents of the 20th century.

Here is the story of an anonymous counter-terrorism expert, a young woman, who, in disguise, has penetrated front groups of anti-American terrorist organizations operating in this country. In this edge-of-the-seat memoir, she chronicles her escape from Iraq via Iran to Israel, following a great tragedy that befell her family at the hands of Saddam Hussein. She also details how she became involved in intelligence gathering for the United States, her adoptive country, while working for an antiterrorism group. With her unique insights into how terrorist groups veil their true operations by various means, she was able to infiltrate and identify dangerous terrorist organizations and entities working undetected in the United States. Terrorist Hunter provides fascinating and shocking information on how federal agencies, chiefly the FBI and the State Depart-ment, repeatedly ignored or mishandled important information she provided. She reveals her role in exposing terrorist supporters who the White House considered to be friends, in preventing the government from funding terrorist activities, and in the deportation of terrorists and their supporters. She also reveals how she discovered a billion-dollar scheme that rich Saudi Arabians set up to filter money to terrorist groups, through charities and businesses in the United States -- information that the FBI sat on for years, until after 9-11.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DFz63lc14LEC&dq=Terrorist+Hunter+:+The+Extraordinary+Story+of+a+Woman+Who+Went+Undercover+to+Infiltrate+the+Radical+Islamic+Groups+Operating+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sloop of War (Bolitho Novels)","description":"For the young Richard Bolitho the spring of 1778 marked a complete transformation for himself and his future.

To many academics this question seems absurd. In their judgment, religion is fundamentally dogmatic while the life of the mind requires openness, creativity, and imagination. This stereotypical assumption about the nature of religion in general, and Christianity in particular, has contributed significantly over the past century to the divorce between faith and learning at countless colleges and universities in the United States. But is this assessment of the intellectual nature of faith justified, or the academic rift it has opened?In this powerful -- yet very personal -- reflection on faith and scholarship, Richard T. Hughes counters the widespread perception of Christians as steeped in narrowness and dogmatism and provides a compelling argument that faith, properly pursued, in fact nourishes the openness and curiosity that make a life of the mind possible. Neither an assessment of church-related higher education today nor a lamentation over the process of secularization, this book is instead a badly needed aid for academics in both private and public institutions who want to connect Christian faith with scholarship and teaching in meaningful and effective ways.Defining the \\"life of the mind\\" in terms of disciplined search for truth, conversation with diverse viewpoints, critical analysis, and intellectual creativity, Hughes shows that such life, far from being impeded by Christian faith, can actually be enhanced by it -- but only if Christians learn to think theologically and break through the particularities of their traditions.Hughes first examines the way that the Deism of the Founding Fathers defines the values of themodern academy in the United States, and he asks how the Christian tradition might interact with these values in meaningful ways. He then looks at four different Christian traditions -- Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, and Mennonite -- and the different ways they sustain the life of the mind. When he turns to teaching, Hughes uses his own classroom work as an illustration of how a commitment to some of the great themes of Christian theology can undergird both the form and the content of the teaching task. Finally, in an especially poignant chapter, Hughes explores how good teaching and scholarship can be rooted in human suffering and tragedy.After a spate of books and articles that merely mourn the decline of Christian intellectual life, here -- at last -- is a volume that offers a constructive assessment of how Christian faith might, indeed, sustain the life of the mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pFByu9zue2EC&dq=How+Christian+Faith+Can+Sustain+the+Life+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Tyme Chocolate Cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LXG_oQEACAAJ&dq=Old+Tyme+Chocolate+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ongoing Crisis Communication: Planning, Managing, and Responding (SAGE Series in Public Relations)","description":"Ongoing Crisis Communication: Planning, Managing, and Responding provides an integrated approach to crisis communication that spans the entire crisis management process and crosses various disciplines.

This book puts together curriculum plans, advice, and in-the-field experience so that educators of all stripes can leap into journaling with their students. The approaches are designed to work in a range of ecosystems and settings, and are suitable for classroom teachers, outdoor educators, camp counselors, and homeschooling parents. Full-color illustrations and sample journal pages from notable naturalists show how to put each lesson into practice.

Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called The Long Week-End. Now they embarked on this new project,  a handbook for writers of English Prose,  to be called The Reader Over Your Shoulder. The world was in total upheaval. Graves had already fled Majorca three years earlier at the start of the Spanish Civil War. As they labored over their new writing project, Graves and Hodge witnessed the fall of France and the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk. In early September 1940 began the bombing of London by the German Luftwaffe, a concentrated effort to destroy the resolve of the English people. Graves s and Hodge s idea was simple enough: at a time when their whole world was falling apart, the survival of English prose sentences, of writing that was clear, concise, intelligible, had become paramount if hope were going to survive the onslaught. They came up with forty-one principles for writing, the majority devoted to clarity, the remainder to grace of expression. They studied the prose of a wide range of noted authors and leaders, finding much room for improvement. Quoting grammarian and bestselling author Patricia T. O Conner from her new introduction,  With a new war to be won, the kingdom couldn t afford careless, sloppy English. Good communication was critical.  The book they would write would turn out to be one of the most erudite, and at the same time one of the most spontaneous and inspired, ever to take on the challenge of writing well. O Conner in her introduction describes The Reader Over Your Shoulder as nothing less than  the best book on writing ever published.  The present edition restores, for the first time in three-quarters of a century, the original, 1943, text, which in subsequent printings and editions had been shortened by over 150 pages, including much of the heart of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+reader+over+your+shoulder%3B:+A+handbook+for+writers+of+English+prose,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"3 WEEKS","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SLQVAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Charity: The Call to Christian Community Development","description":"A powerful call to action to bring reconciliation and restoration to broken communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MLQS21wxz4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memoirs of General Sir Henry Dermot Daly","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_LUcAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lawyer's Guide to Creating Persuasive Computer Presentations, Second Edition","description":"This book explains the advantages of computer presentation resources, how to use them effectively in and out of the courtroom, and the legal issues involved in their use.

But Baudrillard is not merely intending to lament the disappearance of the real, an occurrence he recently described as 'the most important event of modern history,' nor even to meditate upon the paradoxes of reality and illusion, truth and its masks. The Perfect Crime is also the work of a great moraliste: a penetrating examination of vital aspects of the social, political and cultural life of the 'advanced democracies' in the (very) late twentieth century. However, whether stripping away the layers of hypocrisy which surround our smug perceptions of the former Yugoslavia, or deploring the New European Order characterized by 'white fundamentalism, protectionism, discrimination and control', the moraliste is also the deft and disturbing social theorist. Where critics like McLuhan once exposed the alienating consequences of 'the medium', Baudrillard lays bare the depredatory effects of an oppressive transparency on our social lives, of a relentless positivity on our critical faculties, and of a withering 'high definition' on our very sense of reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ygVpD2h29LwC&dq=Bouvard+et+Pcuchet.+(Texte+intgral)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DK Dictionary/Thesaurus","description":"A combined dictionary and thesaurus for school-aged children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbn0PQAACAAJ&dq=DK+Dictionary/Thesaurus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death of Hockey, or, How a Bunch of Guys with Too Much Money and Too Little Sense are Killing the Greatest Game on Earth","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wRzwAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Death+of+Hockey,+or,+How+a+Bunch+of+Guys+with+Too+Much+Money+and+Too+Little+Sense+are+Killing+the+Greatest+Game+on+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet The Gambia and Senegal","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PBCBQwAACAAJ&dq=Lonely+Planet+The+Gambia+and+Senegal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy Of Silver Birch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=77jdAAAACAAJ&dq=Philosophy+Of+Silver+Birch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signs of the Inka Khipu: Binary Coding in the Andean Knotted-String Records (The Linda Schele Series in Maya and Pre-Columbian Studies)","description":"In an age when computers process immense amounts of information by the manipulation of sequences of 1s and 0s, it remains a frustrating mystery how prehistoric Inka recordkeepers encoded a tremendous variety and quantity of data using only knotted and dyed strings. Yet the comparison between computers and khipu may hold an important clue to deciphering the Inka records. In this book, Gary Urton sets forth a pathbreaking theory that the manipulation of fibers in the construction of khipu created physical features that constitute binary-coded sequences which store units of information in a system of binary recordkeeping that was used throughout the Inka empire. Urton begins his theory with the making of khipu, showing how at each step of the process binary, either/or choices were made. He then investigates the symbolic components of the binary coding system, the amount of information that could have been encoded, procedures that may have been used for reading the khipu, the nature of the khipu signs, and, finally, the nature of the khipu recording system itself emphasizing relations of markedness and semantic coupling. This research constitutes a major step forward in building a unified theory of the khipu system of information storage and communication based on the sum total of construction features making up these extraordinary objects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xwf-DAAAQBAJ&dq=Signs+of+the+Inka+Khipu:+Binary+Coding+in+the+Andean+Knotted-String+Records+(The+Linda+Schele+Series+in+Maya+and+Pre-Columbian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'll Never Have Sex with You Again! : Tales from the Delivery Room","description":"FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT CHILDBIRTH.

In my opinion there are two contending theories of the price level: that deriving from the Equation of Exchange in one or another of its forms, and that based on cost, especially wage, phenomena. Thus the debate must be resolved primarily between two major sets of ideas on the subject of inflation. In this light it would be a welcome event, if those Keynesians in economics, who long ago abandoned the various versions of the Quantity Theory of Money and have little truck with the cost theory of the price level, would at least re-examine their views on this subject. It is my deep conviction that most of the literature oriented toward what has been regarded as Keynesian thinking has had very little to contribute toward understanding price level phenomena despite superficial appearances toward the contrary. The importance of this assertion cannot be overstated for, in bulk, this literature is already voluminous and in teaching importance it represents the dominant modern fashion. Yet, in my opinion, on the fundamental problems of price level inflation and deflation, I believe it to be wholly barren and devoid of substance. Perhaps these essays will reveal the stark nakedness of the concepts in the price dimensions that interest all of us.

Whether they are arguing a murder case or a complex financial securities case, they can capably explain a chain of events to judges and juries so that they understand them. The best lawyers are also able to construct narratives that have an emotional impact on their intended audiences. But what is a narrative, and how can lawyers go about constructing one? How does one transform a cold presentation of facts into a seamless story that clearly and compellingly takes readers not only from point A to point B, but to points C, D, E, F, and G as well? In Storytelling for Lawyers, Phil Meyer explains how. He begins with a pragmatic theory of the narrative foundations of litigation practice and then applies it to a range of practical illustrative examples: briefs, judicial opinions and oral arguments. Intended for legal practitioners, teachers, law students, and even interdisciplinary academics, the book offers a basic yet comprehensive explanation of the central role of narrative in litigation. The book also offers a narrative tool kit that supplements the analytical skills traditionally emphasized in law school as well as practical tips for practicing attorneys that will help them craft their own legal stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K3QoAgAAQBAJ&dq=Storytelling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healers of the Wild: People Who Care for Injured and Orphaned Wildlife","description":"Describes the work done by wildlife rehabilitators and suggests agencies to contact for animal rescue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Eu1JAAAAYAAJ&dq=Healers+of+the+Wild:+People+Who+Care+for+Injured+and+Orphaned+Wildlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cat Sat on the Mat","description":"This funny rhyming story starring a big orange tabby cat helps kids learn to read!

This is a welcome reissue of a restaurant classic that should be read by every culinary and food service student in America and sit comfortably next to Orwell's Down and Out on every shelf.

In Royal and Ancient, Curt Sampson, the bestselling author of Hogan and The Masters, draws a definitive and affectionate portrait of this legendary tournament, with a fascinating narrative of both its rich history and its exciting present. The thread of Royal and Ancient is the 1999 cham-pionship--the most astonishing four days in British Open history. Sampson follows individual players as they meet the gut-wrenching challenge of the links at Carnoustie: the icy classicist, Steve Elkington; the good-looking bon vivant, Andrew Magee; the struggling hopeful, Clark Dennis; Zane Scotland, the youngest Open qualifier in history. Sampson is there for Jean Van de Velde's dramatic collapse on the final day, probing both Van de Velde and his caddie for their emotional insights. He gets inside the heads of stars and journeymen, caddies and groundskeepers, and shows how they prepare and how they think as the tournament pro-gresses, from the qualifying rounds to the practice sessions, all the way through the play-off on the final day. Beyond his excellent reportage, Curt Sampson captures British Open history as it's never been captured before. With an insider's knowledge and expertise, he draws us into the rare-fied atmosphere of tradition and myth, telling the amazing--and sometimes heartbreaking--stories of past champions, of triumphs and tragedies, of deaths and ghosts. We hear the unexpectedly poignant story of one of the early greats, Tommy Morris, the invincible champion of the 1860s and 1870s, and explore the loyal Scottish fascination with the legendary Ben Hogan. The reminiscences of past and current participants combine with the behind-the-scenes stories of everyone from the club superintendent to the local pub owners to give an intimate look at this unique tournament. In his book The Majors, John Feinstein called Curt Sampson's The Masters the best book ever written about that Augusta event. Now, in Royal and Ancient, Sampson cracks the inner circle of another remarkable major to provide this fascinating and truly all-embracing view of the British Open.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cx-vLXjdNRUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great American Quilts 1993","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vwmZMgEACAAJ&dq=Great+American+Quilts+1993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Color is Love?","description":"Illustrations and text pose the question, what color is love?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sJpMAQAAIAAJ&dq=What+Color+is+Love%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiking the Grand Canyon's Geology (Hiking Geology)","description":"A guide to the Grand Canyon for rim walkers, day hikers, and serious backpackers, presented from the point of view of geologists.

The Italian Navy special forces were particularly active and respected in the Mediterranean, where 10th Motor-Torpedo Boat Flotilla (Xa MAS) used frogmen, 'two-man torpedoes' and explosive ram-boats; Italian midget submarines were also deployed against the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea. After September 1943 the Germans allowed the expansion of Count Borghese's Xa MAS, which continued fighting on their side at sea and on land, most notoriously in anti-partisan operations. The marines of the 'San Marco' Regiment fought hard in North Africa, earning the respect of their opponents and the German general Hans-J rgen von Arnim, who described them as the best soldiers he had ever commanded; they also gave birth to a paratroop-frogman section. The Italian Air Force formed a special commando unit, ADRA (Arditi Distruttori Regia Aeronautica), before the 1943 surrender; it was tasked with attacking Allied airfields and communications in North Africa alongside the 'Loretto' Battalion, which was made up of ground crew trained to operate captured enemy airfields. Men from ADRA and diehard Army paratroopers formed the new 'Folgore' Regiment, which also continued to fight alongside German forces until 1945. In both cases, the pro-Allied Italian forces also formed 'mirror' units to fight alongside US and British forces, including the Recce Squadron 'F', the first Italian military unit to take up arms against the Germans occupying their country, and the Mariassalto, made up of personnel from Xa MAS who fought alongside British Royal Navy special units. Featuring rare photographs and specially commissioned artwork, this book tells the story of the little-known elite forces fielded by Italy's navy and air force in World War II, some of whose successors remain in service with today's Italian armed forces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJVmswEACAAJ&dq=Army+Commandos+1940-45+(Elite)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Orlando Innamorato (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"\\"Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (1532) is the culmination of the chivalric legends of Charlemagne and the Saracen invasion of France, a brilliantly witty parody of the medieval romances, and a fitting monument to the court society of the Italian Renaissance which gave it birth. In a kaleidoscope of scenes and emotions, three principal stories are developed: the love of Orlando for Angelica; the war between the Franks and the Saracens; and the love of Ruggiero, a Saracen, for Bradamant, a Christian. Enlivening and unifying the whole work is the vital personality of the author, endlessly teasing his readers and dropping casual asides about his contemporaries.

In Imagery in Healing, Jeanne Achterberg brings together modern scientific research and the practices of the earliest healers to support her claim that imagery is the world's oldest and most powerful healing resource. The book has become a classic in the field of alternative medicine and continues to be read by new generations of health care professionals and lay people. In Imagery in Healing, Achterberg explores in detail the role of the imagination in the healing process. She begins with an exploration of the tradition of shamanism, \\"the medicine of the imagination,\\" surveying this time-honored way of touching the nexus of the mind, body, and soul. She then traces the history of the use of imagery within Western medicine, including a look at contemporary examples of how health care professionals have drawn on the power of the imagination through such methods as hypnosis, biofeedback, and the placebo effect. Ultimately, Achterberg looks to the science of immunology to uncover the most effective ground for visualization, and she presents data demonstrating how imagery can have a direct and profound impact on the workings of the immune system. Drawing on art, science, history, anthropology, and medicine, Imagery in Healing offers a highly readable overview of the profound and complex relationship between the imagination and the body.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W8OtThlJRr8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature's Religion","description":"In the wake of both the semiotic and the psychoanalytic revolutions, how is it possible to describe the object of religious worship in realist terms? Semioticians argue that each object is known only insofar as it gives birth to a series of signs and interpretants (new signs). From the psychoanalytic side, religious beliefs are seen to belong to transference energies and projections that contaminate the religious object with all-too-human complexes. In Nature's Religion, distinguished theologian and philosopher Robert S. Corrington weaves together the concept of infinite semiosis with that of the transference to show that the self does have access to something in nature that is intrinsically religious. Corrington argues that signs and our various transference fields can and do connect us with fully natural religious powers that are not of our own making, thereby opening up a path past the Western monotheisms to a capacious religion of nature. With a foreword by Robert C. Neville, Nature's Religion is essential reading for philosophers of religion, scholars of the psychology of religion, and theologians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MCy0N7tzSdYC&dq=Nature%27s+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basketball Diaries (Audio Literature Presents)","description":"Mother Jones is an award-winning national magazine widely respected for its groundbreaking investigative reporting and coverage of sustainability and environmental issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_uYDAAAAMBAJ&dq=The+Basketball+Diaries+(Audio+Literature+Presents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Mountains (The story of Martha Berry)","description":"A biography of Martha Berry and the story of how she built the Berry Schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9X4fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Miracle+in+the+Mountains+(The+story+of+Martha+Berry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lessons from the Western Warriors: Dynamic Self Defense Techniques","description":"Examines methods of hand-to-hand fighting developed from the Greeks and other Western peoples, contrasts them with the Eastern martial arts, and gives instructions in using boxing and other techniques in self-defense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DiDrPQAACAAJ&dq=Lessons+from+the+Western+Warriors:+Dynamic+Self+Defense+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funerals Are Fatal Pocket 50445","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m45BAQAAIAAJ&dq=Funerals+Are+Fatal+Pocket+50445&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology: A Comprehensive Text","description":"In Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology: A Comprehensive Text, Frank Summers provides thorough, lucid, and critically informed accounts of the work of major object relations theorists: Fairbairn, Guntrip, Klein, Winnicott, Kernberg, and Kohut. His expositions achieve distinction on two counts. First, the work of each object relations theorist is presented as a comprehensive whole, with separate sections expounding the theorist's ideas and assumptions about metapsychology, development, psychopathology, and treatment, with a critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the theory in question. Second, the emphasis in each chapter is on issues of clinical understanding and technique. Making extensive use of case material provided by each of the theorists, he shows how each object relations theory yields specific clinical approaches to a variety of syndromes, and how these approaches entail specific modifications in clinical technique. Beyond his detailed attention to the theoretical and technical differences among object relations theories, Summers' penultimate chapter discusses the similarities and differences of object relations and interpersonal theories. And his concluding chapter outlines a pragmatic object relations approach to development, psychopathology, and technique that combines elements of all object relations theories without opting for any single theory. Object Relations Theories and Psychopathology is that rare event in psychoanalytic publishing: a substantial, readable text that surveys a broad expanse of theoretical and clinical landscape with erudition, sympathy, and critical perspective. It will be essential reading for all analysts, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers who wish to familiarize themselves with object relations theories in general, sharpen their understanding of the work of specific object relations theorists, or enhance their ability to employ these theories in their clinical work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZyMiAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hallelujah A Cat Comes Back","description":"Granny Cat advises that if cats can make their way through life's ups and downs with character, no matter how bad things become, a cat will always come back.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iyOBMAEACAAJ&dq=Hallelujah+A+Cat+Comes+Back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Greek plays: Prometheus bound, Agamemnon, The Trojan women,","description":"Three classic Greek tragedies are translated and critically introduced by Edith Hamilton. -- From product description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WSNJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Three+Greek+plays:+Prometheus+bound,+Agamemnon,+The+Trojan+women,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Molecular Cardiology for the Cardiologist (Developments in Cardiovascular Medicine)","description":"Molecular Cardiology for the Cardiologist provides a short, easily readable summary of what the new biology brings to cardiology.

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study.

Mechanics is most commonly formulated today in terms of the vector algebra developed by the American physicist J. Willard Gibbs, but for some applications of mechanics the algebra of complex numbers is more efficient than vector algebra, while in other applications matrix algebra works better. Geometric algebra integrates all these algebraic systems into a coherent mathematical language which not only retains the advantages of each special algebra but possesses powerful new capabilities. This book covers the fairly standard material for a course on the mechanics of particles and rigid bodies. However, it will be seen that geometric algebra brings new insights into the treatment of nearly every topic and produces simplifications that move the subject quickly to advanced levels. That has made it possible in this book to carry the treatment of two major topics in mechanics well beyond the level of other textbooks. A few words are in order about the unique treatment of these two topics, namely, rotational dynamics and celestial mechanics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbTUBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Believe in Yourself.

While the church in Birmingham was indeed a spiritual community, it was also the central institution in the African American community at large, providing leadership as well as economic, political, and social functions in a segregated racist society. This historical analysis begins in the period of slavery with the development of a particularly African American version of Christianity from the merging of African and white evangelical religions. As African Americans moved to Birmingham from the black belt of Alabama, they formed churches which were spiritual communities where African Americans sought hope, security, moral discipline, and self-esteem in the face of racism and segregation. In addition, the study illustrates how churches established institutions that met educational, benevolent, and economic needs. The study concludes with a look at the leadershipprovided by churchmen in the civil rights movement, who brought Martin Luther King, Jr. to the city for massive civil rights demonstrations.

His method is exploratory, meandering, personal. He begins by encircling it, first by car then on foot. He finds that the mountain is a complex of moss-bearded hemlocks and old-growth firs, high meadows that blossom according to a precise natural timeclock, sheets of crumbling pumice, fractured glaciers, and unsteady magma. Its snow fields bristle with bug life, and its marmots chew rocks to keep their teeth from overgrowing. Rainier rumbles with seismic twitches and jerks some one-hundred-thirty earthquakes annually. The nightmare among geologists is the unstoppable wall of mud that will come rolling down its slopes when a hunk of mountain falls off, as it does every half century (and we re fifty years overdue). Rainier is both an obsession and a temple that attracts its own passionate acolytes: scientists, priests, rangers, and mountain guides. Rainier is also a monument to death: every year someone manages just to disappear on its flanks; imperiled climbers and their rescuers perish on glaciers; a planeload of Marines remains lodged in ice since they crashed into the mountain in 1946. Referred to by locals as simply \\"the mountain,\\" it is the single largest feature of the Pacific Northwest landscape provided it isn t hidden in clouds.

As young, single, and ambitious professionals, their friendship occasionally deteriorates into a vicious cycle of jealousy, gossip, selfishness, and backstabbing. Outside the walls of Montaqua Publications, Avont , Ina, and Nakia also endure the disappointments and failed expectations of personal relationships that, even when seemingly on the brink of success, prove to be struggles. In this fast-paced story about friends and coworkers, V. Anthony Rivers deftly conveys the ugly realities of personal and professional relationships. Demonstrating a deep understanding of people -- their ulterior motives, the emotional baggage they inevitably carry, and of course their issues -- Rivers crafts a novel that is as easy to identify with as it is entertaining.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lT1XR2Fqq-YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sectas (Sects) (Spanish Edition)","description":"This Festschrift is dedicated to the former Director and Editor-in-chief of the Monumenta Serica Institute in Sankt Augustin (Germany), Roman Malek, S.V.D. in recognition of his scholarly commitment to China.

Yet how the divine and human come together in the life of Jesus still remains a question needing exploring. The Council of Chalcedon sought to answer the question by speaking of one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in divinity and also perfect in humanity, the same truly God and truly a human being. But ever since Chalcedon, the theological conversation on Christology has implicitly put Christs divinity and humanity in competition. While ancient (and not-so-ancient) Christologies from above focus on Christs divinity at the expense of his humanity, modern Christologies from below subsume his divinity into his humanity. What is needed, says Ian A. McFarland, is a Chalcedonianism without reserve, which not only affirms the humanity and divinity of Christ but also treats them as equal in theological significance. To do so, he draws on the ancient christological language that points to Christs nature, on the one hand, and his hypostasis, or personhood, on the other. And with this, McFarland begins one of the most creative and groundbreaking theological explorations into the mystery of the incarnation undertaken in recent memory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4cS8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People in Control: Human Factors in Control Room Design (IEE Control Engineering Series, Vol. 60) (I E E Control Engineering Series)","description":"Written in a practical, easy to understand style, this text provides a step-by-step guide to System Analysis and Engineering by introducing concepts, principles, and practices via a progression of topical, lesson oriented chapters.

Florida Courier Received historical wisdom casts abolitionists as bourgeois, mostly white reformers burdened by racial paternalism and economic conservatism. Manisha Sinha overturns this image, broadening her scope beyond the antebellum period usually associated with abolitionism and recasting it as a radical social movement in which men and women, black and white, free and enslaved found common ground in causes ranging from feminism and utopian socialism to anti-imperialism and efforts to defend the rights of labor. Drawing on extensive archival research, including newly discovered letters and pamphlets, Sinha documents the influence of the Haitian Revolution and the centrality of slave resistance in shaping the ideology and tactics of abolition. This book is a comprehensive history of the abolition movement in a transnational context. It illustrates how the abolitionist vision ultimately linked the slave s cause to the struggle to redefine American democracy and human rights across the globe.

Its basic elements-- the steep gabled roofs, mullioned windows made of leaded glass, and half-timbering-- are instantly recognizable and iconic. Tudor Style showcases the wide variety of Tudor homes and how American Tudor style differs from their English counterparts. Renowned photographer Paul Rocheleau and architectural historian Lee Goff have traveled across the United States, from the suburbs of metropolitan New York to Lake Forest, Illinois, from St. Louis to Los Angeles, capturing the unique Tudor styles each geographic location offers. The Tudors featured in the book range from modest homes to grand estates, making this a perfectly accessible book for all Tudor homeowners and aficionados. In addition to displaying the architectural structures of these buildings, Goff examined the history of these houses, why they became so popular in the United States, and what their appeal is today. The first book ever on this wildly popular style, Tudor Style will delight architecture enthusiasts who have been desperately waiting for a book on this favorite architectural style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VW7qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tudor+Style:+Tudor+Revival+Houses+in+America+from+1890+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So That's What God Is Like","description":"\\"Children who are introduced to God, through attending church or having loved ones who speak often about God, often have a lot of questions, including this ever-popular one: What is God like?

Scientists and academics have spent entire careers investigating the nature of relationships, dating, and marriage, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals read only by other academics. Now the bestselling author of the 100 Simple Secrets series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand studies on relationships and spells out the key findings in plain English. The advice is not based on one person's unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying the lives and loves of average Americans. Each of the findings is accompanied by a true story that shows the results in action. Love is hard to calculate: Researchers have proven that a partner's age, income, education, and religion are unrelated factors in the likelihood of relationship satisfaction. Always trying to win can lead to a major loss: People who feel a sense of competition with their partner are 37 percent less likely to feel that their relationship is satisfying. leave the past in the past: More than 40 percent of people report that jealousy over a previous relationship is a source of conflict in their current relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BhcIaa17OdAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kick me in the traditions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7_SKMAEACAAJ&dq=Kick+me+in+the+traditions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going to the Root: Nine Proposals for Radical Church Renewal","description":"The church today is often tired, lacking vision, and mired in bureaucratic structures.

Now, Western readers can explore the fascinating history of the vory v zakone, a group that has survived and thrived amid the changes brought on by Stalinism, the Cold War, the Afghan War, and the end of the Soviet experiment. The vory--as the Russian mafia is also known--was born early in the twentieth century, largely in the Gulags and criminal camps, where they developed their unique culture. Identified by their signature tattoos, members abided by the thieves' code, a strict system that forbade all paid employment and cooperation with law enforcement and the state.

[Kenji] Yoshino offers his personal search for authenticity as an encouragement for everyone to think deeply about the ways in which all of us have covered our true selves. . . . We really do feel newly inspired.  The New York Times Book Review Everyone covers. To cover is to downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream. Because all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives. Racial minorities are pressed to  act white  by changing their names, languages, or cultural practices. Women are told to  play like men  at work. Gays are asked not to engage in public displays of same-sex affection. The devout are instructed to minimize expressions of faith, and individuals with disabilities are urged to conceal the paraphernalia that permit them to function. Given its pervasiveness, we may experience this pressure to be a simple fact of social life. Against conventional understanding, Kenji Yoshino argues that the work of American civil rights law will not be complete until it attends to the harms of coerced conformity. Though we have come to some consensus against penalizing people for differences based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and disability, we still routinely deny equal treatment to people who refuse to downplay differences along these lines. At the same time, Yoshino is responsive to the American exasperation with identity politics, which often seems like an endless parade of groups asking for state and social solicitude. He observes that the ubiquity of covering provides an opportunity to lift civil rights into a higher, more universal register. Since we all experience the covering demand, we can all make common cause around a new civil rights paradigm based on our desire for authenticity a desire that brings us together rather than driving us apart. Praise for Covering  Yoshino argues convincingly in this book, part luminous, moving memoir, part cogent, level-headed treatise, that covering is going to become more and more a civil rights issue as the nation (and the nation s courts) struggle with an increasingly multiethnic America.

His work is leading General Technics to the forefront of global domination, both in the marketplace and politically---it's about to take over a country in Africa. Donald Hogan is his roommate, a seemingly sheepish bookworm. But Hogan is a spy, and he's about to discover a breakthrough in genetic engineering that will change the world...and kill him. These two men's lives weave through one of science fiction's most praised novels. Written in a way that echoes John Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy, Stand on Zanzibar is a cross-section of a world overpopulated by the billions. Where society is squeezed into hive-living madness by god-like mega computers, mass-marketed psychedelic drugs, and mundane uses of genetic engineering. Though written in 1968, it speaks of now, and is frighteningly prescient and intensely powerful.

There's \\"releaf\\" when you turn to the humor in the family tree. Award-winning journalist Grace Witwer Housholder has assembled her best funny kids stories regarding family humor into a new gift book called: \\"Quotable Kids -- Fun in the Family Tree\\". The 144-page book has an eye-catching upside down design because kids can turn life upside down. \\"Quotable Kids\\" is actually two books in one: Sibling Revelry and Parent 'Releaf.' Housholder compares humor to the leaves on a tree. \\"Leaves enable trees to grow and flourish\\", she writes. \\"Leaves provide refreshing shade on hot days. That's the way laughter and humor work. Laughter refreshes, reduces stress, increases creativity and builds stronger relationships. Laughter cools us down when we are about to boil over. Humor helps us to grow and flourish..\\".

Tozer said, \\"Every time a Christian picks up his Bible he is reminded of his debt to the Jews. It is an astonishing thing that multitudes of Bible students and lovers of the truth should calmly overlook their obligation to Israel.\\" This book is a study on the validity of the Old Testament Jewish Law and traditions in the life of the modern Christian. It clears the confusion concerning what part the Old Testament still plays in the life of the Believer. Many hold to the idea that the only value and purpose the Torah has is historical and poetical, and that it lacks any real legitimacy in governing the modern-day believer. Yet, in spite of this confusion and supposed outdatedness, many Jewish and Gentile Christians have taken up a search for a historical, Biblical lifestyle and have returned to some of the early Jewish traditions and practices as outlined in the Old Testament. This book portrays a zealous attempt by the author to rediscover Scriptural roots and heritage for all Believers. Author Data Reverend Michael Marks serves as the Messianic Pastor of Shammash Ariel Messianic Congregation of Pueblo, Colorado. Michael, along with his wife Winnie, founded their congregation in 1997. The Marks' also serve as field representatives of Alliance Jewish Ministries, which is the Messianic arm of the C&MA.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yXz2PAAACAAJ&dq=The+New+Testament+and+the+Law:+A+New+Testament+Study+on+the+Validity+of+Jewish+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holt Science & Technology Forces, Motion, and Energy (Holt Science and Technology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c4hRPgAACAAJ&dq=Holt+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catherine of Aragon [Illustrated]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pduxtwEACAAJ&dq=Catherine+of+Aragon+%5BIllustrated%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chistes de Profesiones (Jokes on Professions) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Daily instruction on reading strategies and skills needed to improve comprehension and raise test scores.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qYeStAEACAAJ&dq=Chistes+de+Profesiones+(Jokes+on+Professions)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Superstring Theory: Volume 2, Loop Amplitudes, Anomalies and Phenomenology (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics)","description":"Twenty-fifth anniversary edition featuring a new Preface, invaluable for graduate students and researchers in high energy physics and astrophysics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-XldXe3IjMC&dq=Superstring+Theory:+Volume+2,+Loop+Amplitudes,+Anomalies+and+Phenomenology+(Cambridge+Monographs+on+Mathematical+Physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aid and Reform in Africa","description":"Finally, when the country enters the second generation of reforms, such as public sector institutional reform, short-term, conditionality-based aid can once again be harmful - by reducing ownership, participation, and sustainability of the reform process.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tlAzk-LIj0EC&dq=Aid+and+Reform+in+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel in Charge","description":"Ten-year-old Angel and her little brother Rags have to cope with an incompetent sitter and several crises while their mother is away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fixf7xoz4WwC&dq=Angel+in+Charge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to MathCAD","description":"ESource-Prentice Hall's Engineering Source-provides a comprehensive, customizable introductory engineering and computing library.

Widely revered yet steadily vanishing from our cultural landscape, the barn is an expression of pastoral romance, painstaking craftsmanship, and tradition. The authors, both practitioners of historic barn restoration, offer a tribute to and exploration of the many extant forms of the American barn, following the evolution of the form from this country's earliest days to today, when these structures are repurposed as country lofts and spaces for living. They also show successful efforts to restore, adapt, and repurpose these simple, soulful structures. Barns embody the ethos of another age, one still to be found in these beautiful buildings. Due to the ravages of time, weather, and neglect, these essential American edifices are threatened as never before. Barn afficionados and enchanting storytellers, the authors demonstrate here a profound love and respect for the form. Their book reminds us that barns are as much a part of us as our love of apple pie and should be cherished for their artistry and cultural significance. This revised and updated edition of Barn coincides with the premiere of the PBS series Barnstruck and describes the process of barn preservation through relocation, focusing on the work of The New Jersey Barn Company, whose dedicated efforts over thirty-five years have saved more than 150 structures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6FFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Barn:+Preservation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guinness Book of the 20th Century","description":"List milestones, notable events, developments in the arts and culture, and other details about each year in the twentieth century, especially in Britain and the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0v8CCFD2xS0C&dq=Guinness+Book+of+the+20th+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saint Augustine: Select Letters (Loeb Classical Library #239)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=81ZfngEACAAJ&dq=Saint+Augustine:+Select+Letters+(Loeb+Classical+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cot Death Cover-Up?

After an unsatisfactory marriage, Phyllis, a thirty-year-old divorcee, had to support herself and so became a portrait painter. It is doing this job and trying to find her patron's houses that Phyllis became increasingly frustrated at the lack of proper maps of London. Instead of just cursing the fact as many fellow Londoners probably did, Phyllis decided to do something about it. Without hesitation she covered London's 23,000 streets on foot during the course of one year, often leaving her Horseferry Road bedsit at dawn to do so. To publish the map, and in light of its enormous success, she sets up her own company, The Geographer's Trust, which still publishes the London A-Z and that of every major British city.

Grilling with Chef George Hirsch features 250 easily prepared, flavorful, and exciting new recipes. In this companion to the first-ever cooking show devoted to grilling, Chef George Hirsch combines the primal love of cooking over fire with the modern demand for flavor and originality. George is no stranger to cooking outdoors. He got his first taste of fire and smoke as a young child, where his chore was to gather kindling for the family campfire. In those days, the fare consisted of hot dogs and toasted marshmallows. Today, Chef George Hirsch is on public television nationwide grilling Shark K-Bobs, Caramelized Garlic, Lobster with Dijon Mustard, Country Fried Pork Chops, Fresh Tuna Burgers, and more. In these pages you'll find not only the beloved burger (better tasting than -- ever before) but creative and unexpected recipes for Smoked Pecans, Portobello Mushrooms with Belgian Endive, and Cajun Pizza (yes, pizza on the grill). Other surprises include full-flavored vegetables -- Roasted Chinese Eggplant and Baked Potatoes with Gorgonzola Stuffing -- and inventive and indispensable marinades, sauces, and dressings. A grilling book would be incomplete without a dazzling selection of meat, seafood, and poultry dishes, and with creations such as Smoked Pork Tenderloin, Salmon with a Basil and Red Pepper Crust, and Spit-Roasted Turkey, Chef Hirsch doesn't disappoint. There is even a whole section on smoking. But you'll also find the real surprises his show is justly famous for -- Linguine with Sea Scallops and Grilled Pepper Pesto, Shinnecock Clam Chowder, and a wealth of sumptuous desserts. Also included is a section on tools and types of grills -- from the hibachi grills favored by urbanites to the elaborate, six-foot gas-burning behemoths now seen on nearly every suburban patio.

A new introduction contextualizes the book for the contemporary moment and situates it within current directions in cultural theory. Investigating the cultural politics of how inequalities are both reproduced and challenged, Bettie examines the discursive formations that provide a context for the complex identity performances of contemporary girls. The book s title refers at once to young working-class women who have little cultural capital to enable class mobility; to the fact that analyses of class too often remain insufficiently transformed by feminist, ethnic, and queer studies; and to the failure of some feminist theory itself to theorize women as class subjects. Women without Class makes a case for analytical and political attention to class, but not at the expense of attention to other social formations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fWRVBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A TRAILSIDE SERIES GUIDE BICYCLING","description":"A guide for women, both novice and expert cyclers alike, provides information on equipment, riding techniques, practical tips, off-road repair and safety","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zi-C7JTxA2gC&dq=A+TRAILSIDE+SERIES+GUIDE+BICYCLING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching and Learning Elementary Social Studies","description":"With more and more attention to interdisciplinary teaching and learning and a new emphasis on constructivism, teachers need better strategies for involving their students in social studies content.

Mangual offers an incisive critique of America's increasingly radical criminal justice reform movement, and makes a convincing case against the pursuit of \\"justice\\" through mass-decarceration and depolicing. After a summer of violent protests in 2020 sparked by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks a dangerously false narrative gained mainstream acceptance: Criminal justice in the United States is overly punitive and racially oppressive. But, the harshest and loudest condemnations of incarceration, policing, and prosecution are often shallow and at odds with the available data. And the significant harms caused by this false narrative are borne by those who can least afford them: black and brown people who are disproportionately the victims of serious crimes. In Criminal (In)Justice, Rafael A. Mangual offers a more balanced understanding of American criminal justice, and cautions against discarding traditional crime control measures. A powerful combination of research, data-driven policy journalism, and the author's lived experiences, this book explains what many reform advocates get wrong, and illustrates how the misguided commitment to leniency places America's most vulnerable communities at risk. The stakes of this moment are incredibly high. Ongoing debates over criminal justice reform have the potential to transform our society for a generation for better or for worse. Grappling with the data and the sometimes harsh realities they reflect is the surest way to minimize the all-too-common injustices plaguing neighborhoods that can least afford them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JVFVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolf's Temptation","description":"In Wolf's Temptation, Dawson Caedmon gets more than he bargains for when he agrees to help Alessia-a witch in peril-uncover a mystery surrounding her heritage.

Suzuki analyzes those deep spiritual needs, rooted in nature, that are a crucial component of a loving world.

With technological advances in typesetting, printing, distribution, and sales, self-publishing has become a reality. But while converting your writing into a commercially available title may sound relatively easy--based upon the claims of some companies that offer this service--there are many important considerations you should be aware of before going to press. Publishing expert Dr. Jan Yager has created an easy-to-follow guide that will take you from a book's conception and writing to its production and sales. Whether your work is fiction or nonfiction, How to Self-Publish Your Book offers sound and proven advice at every turn, enabling you to avoid common pitfalls along the way to becoming a self-published author. The book is divided into three parts. Part One takes you through the initial manuscript preparation--setting your goals, writing, sequencing, editing, and proofing, as well as creating a business plan for your book's eventual release. Part Two focuses on the actual production of your book. It explains the importance of cover and interior design, what you need to know about producing physical books and e-books, and how to turn your title into an audiobook. Part Three provides key information on how to market and sell your book--subjects that are crucial to a title's success, but of which most writers have very little understanding. Also included is a valuable resource section that guides you to websites which offer essential information on self-publishing service providers, including complete self-publishing companies as well as freelance editors, proofreaders, printers, distributors, marketers, and publicists. Today, self-publishing workshops and lecturers charge hopeful writers hundreds of dollars, promising to turn their self-published books into bestsellers. The fact is that your book's chance of success starts at its origin, not with the finished product. However you choose to produce your book, whether through a self-publishing company or through separate services, here is a complete road map to what lies ahead--based not on hype or wishful thinking, but on Dr. Jan Yager's lifetime of experience in the world of publishing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tbjEtAEACAAJ&dq=Publishing+with+Students:+A+Comprehensive+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living in a Psychic's World: A True-Life Experience","description":"It's a problem that's seldom talked about.

The author's childhood in the high Sierra with her forest ranger father led her to embrace the entire natural world, while her Southern Baptist relatives prepared eagerly and busily to leave this world. Peterson survived fierce  sword drill  competitions demanding total recall of the Scriptures and awkward dinner table questions ( Will Rapture take the cat, too? ) only to find that environmentalists with prophecies of doom can also be Endtimers. Peterson paints such a hilarious, loving portrait of each world that the reader, too, may want to be Left Behind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FGz5nz1VD3QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle Royale","description":"Reads from back to front and from right to left.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0OPHWBW0jVgC&dq=Battle+Royale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chic Simple: Shirt and Tie Hb","description":"Valuable flea market finds... A peeling, antioue vanity in muted sea green... An elegant, cracked chandelier... An enormous, slipcovered sofa with deep, cushions... Comfort, the beauty of imperfections, the allure of time-worn objects, and the appeal of simple practical living: these are the cornerstones of what has come to be known as the Shabby Chic style. Like the cozy familiarity of a well-worn pair of faded jeans, the dilapidated elegance of an Italian viIla, or the worn grandeur of faded velvets and mismatched floral china handed down from your grandmother's attic, the Shabby Chic style is a revived appreciation for what is used, well-loved, and worn. It is a respect for natural evolution and a regard for what is easy and sensible. The hundreds of lavish photographs in this book invite you inside the unique world of Shabby Chic. Rachel Ashwell, founder of theShabby Chic home decor stores, for the first time provides her invaluable and much-sought-after advice on how to re-create Shabby Chic style in your own home. With engaging text and easy-to- follow instructions, Rachel details the Shabby Chic basics in a way that will put even the most apprehensive or novice decorators at ease. From flowers to fabrics to lighting, Rachel illuminates all of the elements essential to this unpretentious yet truly exquisite style. A behind-the-scenes look at a flea market lets readers in on Rachel's personal secrets of how to cull hidden treasures from flea market trash--an old trunk, its paint peeling around the edges, can be given new life as a coffee table, while a chipped white iron salvage piece becomes the perfect frame for a vintage mirror. This book tells you not only how to restore these pieces but how to find the perfect place for them in your home. Gorgeous color photographs and accompanying text reveal how this relaxed look works with a variety of different styles, from Victorian to Mediterranean to contemporary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wbiMR3NnQ6oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Mama Ain't Happy, Ain't Nobody Happy : 52 Rules Women Want Men to Know","description":"Fifteen years of marriage and experience as marriage and family consultants are brought to bear in this hilarious look at the rules of relationships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YbnDz4xGxjEC&dq=When+Mama+Ain%27t+Happy,+Ain%27t+Nobody+Happy+:+52+Rules+Women+Want+Men+to+Know&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wise Moves in Hard Times: Creating & Managing Resilient Colleges & Universities","description":"Leslie and Fretwell have produced as good a book as I have seen in the timely field of higher education's response to it pervasive long-range financial dilemmas. --D.

But now, acclaimed linguist Guy Deutscher has dared to reopen the issue. Can culture influence language and vice versa? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? Could our experience of the world depend on whether our language has a word for \\"blue\\"? Challenging the consensus that the fundaments of language are hard-wired in our genes and thus universal, Deutscher argues that the answer to all these questions is yes. In thrilling fashion, he takes us from Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water a \\"she\\" becomes a \\"he\\" once you dip a tea bag into her, demonstrating that language does in fact reflect culture in ways that are anything but trivial. Audacious, delightful, and field-changing, Through the Language Glass is a classic of intellectual discovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oore9h_L48EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gente Independiente (El Dia Siguiente) (Spanish Edition)","description":"USA TODAY BESTSELLER Un nuevo libro de memorias de la cantante ganadora del Latin Grammy y autora bestseller del New York Times, Chiquis Rivera, quien comparte sus triunfos, desaf os y lecciones de vida tras la muerte de su madre, Jenni Rivera.

The book opens with the arrival of the Nahataean Arabs in their magnificent capital at Petra and describes the growth of their hellenized culture based on trade in perfume and spices. It traces the transformation of the region from an Arab kingdom under Roman influence into an imperial province, one that played an increasingly important role in the Roman strategy for control of the Near East. While the primary emphasis is on the relations of the Arabs of the region with the Romans, their interactions with neighboring states, Jewish, Egyptian, and Syrian, are also stressed.

This book is about twins and twinning processes. The existence of an actual twin, alive or dead, may be experienced as an embodiment of the phantasy of having a twin, with developmental consequences. Twinning processes in twins lead to the creation of an internal twin relationship that is enduring. The twin relationship may be at the narcissistic end of the spectrum leading to an enmeshed twinship, or it may be a more mature object relationship. All twin relationships will be manifest in the transference relationship with the analyst. The twin transference has been largely neglected in the psychoanalytic literature, to the detriment of our understanding of dynamic processes in twin patients. In this book, case material is used to explore the nature of the twin transference relationship and the necessity of analysing the twin transference, as well as maternal and paternal transference relationships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=de5aDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Machiavellian Manager's Handbook for Success","description":"They lurk in the shadows of every business, preying on the innocent and unsuspecting.

The book's four central crises provide perspectives that speak to Adventism a century later with as much force as they should have spoken to our spiritual forebears. Perhaps learning the lessons of Minneapolisis even more important today than it was in 1888, since learning and applying that learning seems to be the key to our future. The book concludes on a positive note--the infinite possibilities of God's saving grace. Those possibilities, not fully grasped as yet, hold the promises of the future. - A Word To The Reader.

The fundamentals of seismic wave propagation are developed using a physical approach and then applied to show how refraction, reflection, and teleseismic techniques are used to study the structure and thus the composition and evolution of the earth. The book shows how seismic waves are used to study earthquakes and are integrated with other data to investigate the plate tectonic processes that cause earthquakes. Figures, examples, problems, and computer exercises teach students about seismology in a creative and intuitive manner. Necessary mathematical tools including vector and tensor analysis, matrix algebra, Fourier analysis, statistics of errors, signal processing, and data inversion are introduced with many relevant examples. The text also addresses the fundamentals of seismometry and applications of seismology to societal issues. Special attention is paid to help students visualize connections between different topics and view seismology as an integrated science. An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure gives an excellent overview for students of geophysics and tectonics, and provides a strong foundation for further studies in seismology. Multidisciplinary examples throughout the text - catering to students in varied disciplines (geology, mineralogy, petrology, physics, etc.). Most up to date book on the market - includes recent seismic events such as the 1999 Earthquakes in Turkey, Greece, and Taiwan). Chapter outlines - each chapter begins with an outline and a list of learning objectives to help students focus and study. Essential math review - an entire section reviews the essential math needed to understand seismology. This can be covered in class or left to students to review as needed.

This book brings the groundbreaking framework of Bavinck's \\"organic motif\\" to the fore in one of Bavinck's most influential works. In the best sense of the title, the modern, yet orthodox Bavinck offers readers here both a philosophy of revelation and a philosophy of revelation. Philosophy of Revelation was originally presented by Bavinck at the Stone Lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1908, that by itself deserves being published. This classic text is updated and annotated and may function as a supreme entry into the mind of Bavinck. Bavinck saw theology as the task of \\"thinking God's thoughts after him and tracing their unity.\\" This project can be seen as \\"thinking Bavinck's thoughts after him and tracing their unity.\\" Chapters include: - The Idea of a Philosophy of Revelation - Revelation and Philosophy - Revelation and Nature - Revelation and History - Revelation and Religion - Revelation and Christianity - Revelation and Religious Experience - Revelation and Culture - Revelation and the Future Author Bio Cory Brock is the assistant Pastor at First Presbyterian in Jackson, Mississippi.

Divided into two parts, the text begins by explaining major theoretical approaches for interpreting the environment-society relationship and discussing different perspectives about environmental problems. Part II examines a series of objects, each viewed through a sample of the theoretical tools from Part I, helping readers think critically about critical environmental topics such as deforestation, climate change, the global water supply, and hazardous e-waste. This fully revised third edition stresses a wider range of competing ways of thinking about environmental issues and features additional cases studies, up-to-date conceptual understandings, and new chapters in Part I on racializd environments and feminist approaches.

In this collection of essays, Stalls explores walking as waking up: how a cross-country journey through the family farms of West Virginia, the deep freedom of Nevada s High desert, and everywhere in between unlocked connections to his deepest aches and dreams--and opened new avenues for renewal, connection, and change. While most of us won t walk or roll across the country, the deep wisdom and insights that Stalls receives from the people, land, and animals he meets on his pilgrimage have profound impacts for each of us. He shares how walking deepened his relationship to himself as a gay man, offering deep and clarifying emotional medicine. He confronts the systemic racism, classism, and ableism that shape and reshape the communities he walks through. And he invites readers to become awakened activists, to begin healing our culture s profound separation from the natural world. WALK is for those who crave to feel and embody, not just know and study, their way through complex themes that live in each chapter: vulnerability, human dignity, presence, mystery, and resistance. With dedicated practices--like connecting to Earth stewardship, moving into vulnerability, and walking and rolling with intention--Stalls  WALK is an urgent and glorious call to slow down, look around, and engage with the world in front of us. It awakens us to what we miss when we re driving by, flying over, and rushing past what surrounds us. It s an invitation to move, to connect, to participate deeply in the world--and to dissolve the barriers that disconnect us from each other and the living Earth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uyVPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord, Teach Me to Pray","description":"Introducing a practical resource for making prayer and priority--adapted form the bestselling book, Lord Teach Me to Pray in 28 Days--from one of the most renowned Bible teachers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DRM8WJUOJEgC&dq=Lord,+Teach+Me+to+Pray&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johnny Cash: He Walked the Line 1932-2003","description":"Johnny Cash's death in September 2003 left the music world bereft.

Raimundo Silva is a middle-aged, celibate clerk, proofing manuscripts for a respectable publishing house. Fluent in Portuguese, he has been assigned to work on a standard history of the country, and the twelfth-century king who laid siege to Lisbon. In a moment of subversive daring, Raimundo decides to change just one single word of text a capricious revision that completely undoes the past. When discovered, his insolent disregard for facts appalls his employers save for his new editor, Maria Sara. She suggests that Rainmundo take his transgressions even further. Through Rainmundo and Maria s eyes, what transpires is an alternate view of history and a colorful reinvention of a debatable truth. It s a serpentine journey through time where past and present converge, fact becomes myth, and fiction and reality blur especially for Rainmundo and Maria themselves, who begin to find themselves erotically drawn to each other.  Walter Mitty has nothing on Raimundo Silva . . . this hypnotic tale is a great comic romp through history, language and the imagination.

Topics that the contributors tackle include: how a collaborative dream could differ from hallucination, the difference between the Matrix and the \\"real\\" world; why living in the Matrix would be considered \\"bad\\"; the similarities between the Matrix and Plato's Cave; the moral status of artificially created beings, whether one can behave immorally in illusory circumstances, and the true nature of free will and responsibility.

Environmental Management in the Tropics discusses the ecology of the tropics and examines how it is different from the temperate zone where western science evolved. The author discusses how native people traditionally subsisted in different ecological zones of the tropics and how they rationalized their relationship. The author also takes a critical look at the impact of colonialism in the tropics and how it changed traditional cultures and their relationship with the environment. The current clash between economics and ecology in the tropics is explored in depth. According to the author, we are now able to draw \\"a line in the sand\\" and illustrate the consequences of continuing current practices. Environmental Management in the Tropics shows how this situation developed and discusses how the two opposing concepts must be brought back into harmony. The book is one of the few studies to take a truly interdisciplinary approach combining the serious inevitabilities of natural science with the variables of history, culture, politics, and economics. It gives us a new respect for the past and tradition of the tropics and clearly spells out why dramatic changes must occur to prevent further degradation of the tropical environment. Environmental Management in the Tropics is an important reference for ecologists, conservationists, scientists, researchers, environmental consultants, land managers and developers, members of the world regulatory community, and anyone working on projects in tropical regions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FwSbzQEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+Management+in+the+Tropics:+An+Historical+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be My Sorority Sister-Under Pressure","description":"Beta Gamma Psi had been a part of Eva Perkins life since birth.

Something different? Something better? For Christians, perhaps the deepest expression of what we re waiting for is found in the phrase  eternal life.  But what is eternal life? Why do we want it? And how do we know if we have it? In Eternity Is Now in Session, bestselling author John Ortberg dispels the myth that eternal life is something way out in outer space that we can only hope to experience after we die and that being saved is merely about meeting the minimal entrance requirements for getting into heaven. Instead, John unpacks the reality that the moment we trust Christ, we are initiated into  eternal living  with God as a here and now reality, one that will continue beyond our life on this earth. Jesus defined eternal life just once, in John 17:3:  . . . that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.  The kind of  knowing God  that is eternal life is an interactive relationship, not just an affirmation of certain facts about God. Once we begin the transformative journey of truly knowing God, we can start to experience His presence, favor, and resurrection power right here on this earth in the details, tasks, and challenges of daily, ordinary life. And as we begin to know God this way, we ll realize each moment of our lives is a vehicle to the eternity we ve been longing for all along.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XG1PDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colossians and Philemon (Crossway Classic Commentaries)","description":"Part of the highly regarded Crossway Classic Commentary series, this historic work has been stylistically adapted for the modern reader while preserving the message of the original expositor, J.

Those who have endeavoured to read Chinese texts apart from the apprehension of a Sanskrit background have generally made a fallacious interpretation, for the Buddhist canon is basically translation, or analogous to translation. In consequence, a large number of terms existing are employed approximately to connote imported ideas, as the various Chinese translators understood those ideas. Various translators invented different terms; and, even when the same term was finally adopted, its connotation varied, sometimes widely, from the Chinese term of phrase as normally used by the Chinese. For instance, kl sa undoubtedly has a meaning in Sanskrit similar to that of, i.e. affliction, distress, trouble. In Buddhism affliction (or, as it may be understood from Chinese, the afflicters, distressers, troublers) means passions and illusions; and consequently fan-nao in Buddhist phraseology has acquired this technical connotation of the passions and illusions. Many terms of a similar character are noted in the body of this work. Consequent partly on this use of ordinary terms, even a well-educated Chinese without a knowledge of the technical equivalents finds himself unable to understand their implications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TMOSDE1RIuAC&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Chinese+Buddhist+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Involuntary repossession: Or, In the steal of the night","description":"Originally written for auto repossessors, police and locksmiths, this unique guide tells how to open and start any locked, keyless car in minutes!

The 1957 Pescara Grand Prix marked the end of an era in motor racing.

Stirling Moss won the race, beating the great Juan Manuel Fangio (in his final full season) and ending years of supremacy by the Italian teams of Ferrari and Maserati.

One of the largest, fastest, and most beautiful ships in the world, the Andrea Doria was on her way to New York from her home port in Genoa. Departing from the United States was the much smaller Stockholm. On the foggy night of July 25, 1956, fifty-three miles southeast of Nantucket in the North Atlantic, the Stockholm sliced through the Doria s steel hull. Within minutes, water was pouring into the Italian liner. Eleven hours later, she capsized and sank into the ocean. In this  electrifying book,  Associated Press journalist Alvin Moscow, who covered the court hearings that sought to explain the causes of the tragedy and interviewed all the principals, re-creates with compelling accuracy the actions of the ships  officers and crews, and the terrifying experiences of the Doria s passengers as they struggled to evacuate a craft listing so severely that only half of its lifeboats could be launched (Newsweek). Recounting the heroic, rapid response of other ships which averted a catastrophe of the same scale as that of the Titanic and the official inquest, Moscow delivers a fact-filled, fascinating drama of this infamous maritime disaster, and explains how a supposedly unsinkable ship ended up at the bottom of the sea. In the New York Times Book Review, Walter Lord, author of A Night to Remember, said of Collision Course:  More than a magnificent analysis of the accident and sinking; it is a warmly compassionate document, full of understanding for the people on each side.

At Jefferson's defeat of Adams for the presidency in 1800, they became estranged, and the correspondence lapses from 1801 to 1812, then is renewed until the death of both in 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence. Lester J. Cappon's edition, first published in 1959 in two volumes, provides the complete correspondence between these two men and includes the correspondence between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. Many of these letters have been published in no other modern edition, nor does any other edition devote itself exclusively to the exchange between Jefferson and the Adamses. Introduction, headnotes, and footnotes inform the reader without interrupting the speakers. This reissue of The Adams-Jefferson Letters in a one-volume unabridged edition brings to a broader audience one of the monuments of American scholarship and, to quote C. Vann Woodward, 'a major treasure of national literature.'","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GDHqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A boot full of memories: Captain Leonard Williams, 2nd South Carolina Cavalry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gdg_AAAACAAJ&dq=A+boot+full+of+memories:+Captain+Leonard+Williams,+2nd+South+Carolina+Cavalry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboys Don't Cry","description":"Shane Morgan's world is shattered when his mother is killed in a car accident.

It begins with the shock of hammer blows as the Titan Prometheus is shackled to a rock in the Caucasus. This is his punishment for giving the gift of fire to humankind and for thwarting Zeus s decision to exterminate the human race. Prometheus s pain is unceasing, but he refuses to recant his commitment to humanity, to whom he has also brought the knowledge of writing, mathematics, medicine, and architecture. He hints that he knows how Zeus will be brought low in the future, but when Hermes demands that Prometheus divulge his secret, he refuses and is sent spinning into the abyss by a divine thunderbolt. To whom does humanity look for guidance: to the supreme deity or to the rebel Titan? What law controls the cosmos? Prometheus Bound, one of the great poetic achievements of the ancient world, appears here in a splendid new translation by Joel Agee that does full justice to the harsh and keening music of the original Greek.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGA9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Prometheus+bound,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Think and Grow Rich","description":"Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - The most famous of all teachers of success spent \\"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\\" to produce the \\"Law of Success\\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized and explained for the general public in this book. In Think and Grow Rich, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles.

But the growing paranoia of absolute power and the infidelity of his promiscuous young wife Messalina mean that his good fortune will not last forever.

Its horrors are notorious, but its powerful poetry of grief is the work of a true tragic poet. Introducing this edition, E.M. Waith provides a fresh view of the play in its historical context as well as an original discussion of the famous \`Peacham' drawing - the only surviving contemporary Shakespeare illustration. An illustrated account of performances, notably Peter Brook's production with Oliver as Titus, leads to an assessment of the play's qualities in the light of its critical reception. The eighteenth-century version of the play's probable source is given in one of the appendices.

The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two? or three? semester course sequence or its equivalent.

Service providers must satisfy the always-increasing networking demands of customers while keeping costs to a minimum. Optical networks must meet the challenge of supporting multiple types of transmissions including voice, video, and data traffic.

The Cisco Systems? end-to-end IP + Optical networking strategy provides an intelligent converged network in which optical infrastructures can be used to their fullest potential.

For both professor and students, the course provided a wonderful opportunity to work out one's point of view on ethical issues. But the major pedagogical stumbling block came in attempting to assign appropriate readings for the juicy subject matter. I either assigned the students a dozen different books to cover the course material, or I prohibited them from reading anything, insisting that the course's substantive content would come from the lectures. Now, after all these years, the problem has been solved. Living Issues in Ethics, a new book by Richard T. Nolan and Frank G. Kirkpatrick, fulfills admirably the need for a one-volume text discussing the basic problems in ethics and dealing with them in both a theoretical and a practical way. It is a solid book, totally contemporary and aware of the latest developments in Christian ethical thinking. In a lucid and engaging way, the authors present the following topics: \\"The Search for a Moral Philosophy,\\" \\"Personal Identity and Fulfillment,\\" \\"Health and Sexuality\\" and \\"Social Ethics.\\" They engage the reader in subject matter ranging from \\"The Ingredients of a Moral Philosophy\\" to an insightful rendering of the history of that philosophy, as well as problems of femininity, varieties of love, marriage and the family, medical ethics, moral sexual conduct, obligations of the political order, the socialist alternative, the demand for expression versus the right to privacy, the dilemmas of dissent, sexual justice, energy and ecology, \\"life-boat\\" ethics, \\"just-war\\" theory, and many, many others. Each chapter contains a review and a section on suggested readings. The book is so good that I plan to use it in next year's \\"Problems in Christian Ethics.\\" William A.

IT TAKES A VILLAGE is a textbook for caring, filled with truths that are worth a read, and a reread. In her substantial new introduction, Senator Clinton reflects on how our village has changed over the last decade, from the internet to education, and on how her own understanding of children has deepened as she has watched Chelsea grow up and take on challenges new to her generation, from a first job to living through a terrorist attack. She discusses how the work she is doing in the Senate is helping children and looks at where America has been successful, improvements in the foster care system and support for adoption, and where there is still work to be done, providing pre-school programmes and universal health care to all our children. This new edition elucidates how the choices we make about how we raise our children, and how we support families, will determine how all nations will face the challenges of this century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aB5mySwpuE8C&dq=It+Takes+A+Village&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on Ethics","description":"Lecture notes taken by Kant's students of his university courses in ethics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5kCTORPawb4C&dq=Lectures+on+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too much, too soon,","description":"Recollections of the daughter of John Barrymore and Blanche Oelrichs Thomas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TbckAQAAMAAJ&dq=Too+much,+too+soon,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Humble Boy: A Play","description":"An award-winning new play that has been called \\"a brilliant latter-day variant on Elsinore in an English country garden blitzed by bees\\" (Sheridan Morley, The Spectator) All is not well in the Humble hive.

Once there he and his demanding mother, Flora, a glamorous former showgirl who resents having spent the last thirty years in suburban exile, attempt to reconcile themselves to James's death and to each other, plumbing the depths of their anger as well as their love. The emotional turmoil increases exponentially with the arrival of George, Flora's longtime lover, and his daughter Rosie, Felix's former girlfriend, as Felix is forced to acknowledge that his search for unity must include his own chaotic home life.

Drawing upon years of unparalleled experience in diplomacy and government, Azzam examines the social and economic ramifications of the Muslim state, one based on humane ideals of law and justice expressed in the Qur'an, and one which can provide the foundation for a just society. Abd al-Rahman Azzam (1893-1976) is generally considered as the father of the Arab League. He served as the League's first Secretary-General between 1945-52 as well as distinguishing himself in a long career as an ambassador and parliamentarian. As Vincent Sheean points out in his introduction, 'In Damascus as well as in Djakarta, Istanbul and Baghdad, this man is known for valour of spirit and elevation of mind...He combines in the best Islamic mode, the aspects of thought and action, like the Muslim warriors of another time who are typified for us Westerners by the figure of Saladin.' Malcolm X's reading of The Eternal Message of Muhammad and his meeting with Azzam Pasha are vividly recounted in his Autobiography. It is clear that these events marked the point in his life at which Malcolm X turned towards orthodox traditional Islam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jsqIAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+eternal+message+of+Muhammad+(Mentor+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Warfare","description":"A terrorist organization spreads its poisonous ideology beyond its homeland.

Highly recommended for health professionals, faculty, and students at all levels. - ChoiceModern medicine is one of the most successful branches of science, with a distinguished history of conquering many of the twentieth century's deadliest diseases. Yet today people are turning in record numbers to alternative therapies that have little or no scientific basis. What accounts for this flight from reason in the face of hard evidence that medical doctors do a better job of treating disease and alleviating suffering than their alternative counterparts?In Magic or Medicine? Dr. Robert Buckman and Karl Sabbagh offer a response to this question by critically evaluating both alternative and conventional medical approaches to patient care. The authors argue that healing has always been partly the science of clinical treatment (medicine) and partly an art (magic). Medicine may make the patient get well, but often it is magic that makes the patient feel well.With all the pressures under which they work, modern medical doctors often neglect the magic in their dealings with patients.

Attorney David Hirsch was the managing partner of one of St. Louis s most prestigious law firms, until he was convicted of embezzlement and sent to the federal penitentiary for seven years. He emerges from prison humbled and genuinely contrite, eager to patch things up with his estranged daughter and to build up a modest legal practice. In forging his life afresh, Hirsch has rediscovered his Judaism and has become part of the daily minyan, the group of ten men necessary to pray together, at the synagogue near his home. When an elderly man in the group asks for his help with a product liability case involving his daughter s death, Hirsch reluctantly takes it on only to discover that the seemingly straightforward lawsuit conceals a cold-blooded murder. With the help of Dulcie Lorenz, the altruistic, public-spirited attorney the dead woman worked for, Hirsch pursues the liability case while quietly amassing evidence against the highly placed person he suspects of murder. His attempt to bring his powerful adversary to justice draws Hirsch into a fierce, seesawing battle of wits and ultimately to an act that expresses the true depth of his atonement. A page-turner in the tradition of Scott Turow, The Mourning Sexton goes beyond the question of  who done it  to explore the more intriguing questions of why the crime was committed and what it reveals about human nature. Set against the richly textured backdrops of St. Louis s legal establishment and the city s tight-knit Jewish community, and animated by a vivid cast of characters, it marks the debut of an extraordinary new talent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ezQgAzrt9QcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Girls and a God (Goddesses, No. 2)","description":"The muses were doing fine until he showed up....Dylan from Denver, on dinner with Thalia: \\"I'm not sure, but I feel this is fate.

Phillips Oppenheim was first published in 1918 and is set during WWI. When a Zeppelin crashes in a small English town the passenger escapes to wreak havoc. Dissatisfied in her marriage, local woman Phillipa finds herself attracted to the dangerous stranger and her allegiances are torn as she begins to help him with his espionage, despite her patriotic leanings. Will she really betray her country for the love of a stranger? E. Phillips Oppenheim (1866-1946) was a hugely prolific and highly popular British author of novels and short stories. Born in Tottenham, London, Oppenheim left school as a teenager and worked for his leather-merchant father for 20 years prior to launching his literary career. Oppenheim published five novels under the pseudonym  Anthony Partridge  before establishing his reputation as a writer under his own name. An internationally successful author, Oppenheim s stories revolved mainly around glamourous characters, luxurious settings, and themes of espionage, suspense, and crime. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of the thriller and spy-fiction genre as it is recognised today. Oppenheim s incredible literary success meant that his own life soon began to mirror that of his opulent characters. He held lavish, Gatsby-style parties at his French Villa and was rumoured to have had frequent love affairs aboard his luxury yacht. Oppenheim s success earned him the cover of Time magazine in 1927. Some of his most well-known novels include  The Great Impersonation ,  The Long Arm of Mannister  and  The Moving Finger .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t3NFEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language, Society and Power: An Introduction","description":"Language, Society and Power is an accessible introduction to studying language in a variety of social contexts.

House of Bush, House of Saud begins with a politically explosive question: How is it that two days after 9/11, when U.S. air traffic was tightly restricted, 140 Saudis, many immediate kin to Osama Bin Laden, were permitted to leave the country without being questioned by U.S. intelligence? The answer lies in a hidden relationship that began in the 1970s, when the oil-rich House of Saud began courting American politicians in a bid for military protection, influence, and investment opportunity. With the Bush family, the Saudis hit a gusher -- direct access to presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. To trace the amazing weave of Saud- Bush connections, Unger interviewed three former directors of the CIA, top Saudi and Israeli intelligence officials, and more than one hundred other sources. His access to major players is unparalleled and often exclusive -- including executives at the Carlyle Group, the giant investment firm where the House of Bush and the House of Saud each has a major stake. Like Bob Woodward's The Veil, Unger's House of Bush, House of Saud features unprecedented reportage; like Michael Moore's Dude, Where's My Country? Unger's book offers a political counter-narrative to official explanations; this deeply sourced account has already been cited by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer, and sets 9/11, the two Gulf Wars, and the ongoing Middle East crisis in a new context: What really happened when America's most powerful political family became seduced by its Saudi counterparts?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AyEMV1sd5S4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Lies & Superspeedways","description":"Explains how to use handwriting analysis to interpret people's character traits, personalities, and backgrounds, and examines the handwriting of such dangerous individuals as Ted Bundy, Jack the Ripper, and Osama bin Laden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kUNzGomsKI4C&dq=Sex,+Lies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trash Talk","description":"Praise for Trash Talk: Words Matter Trash Talk: Words Matter is needed now more than ever. As a school district administrator, time and again, I see conflicts arising because kids (and adults) arent mindful of what they say. We all forget that words can build people up or tear people down. With this book, kids will learn to understand others as well as themselves through speech. This book is fun, empowering, and powerful. G. Peter Bohatch, Ed.D; Director of Student Services: Lee County Schools; Florida I recommend Trash Talk: Words Matter for kids so they can build respectful and happy relationships. I also think this book is perfect for the language arts classroom. The text IS the students speech, and this book coaches all learners in purpose, audience, tone, and interpretation. What better text is there than how kids speak every day?

The loving nature of humans seems to be almost a Universalist theological underpinning that flows through the frank conversational prose without being preachy.

Out of 19th century Australia rides a hero of his people and a man for all nations: Ned Kelly, the son of poor Irish immigrants, viewed by the authorities as a thief (especially of horses) and, as a cold-blooded killer. To the people, though, he was a patriot hounded unfairly by rich English landlords and their stooges. In the end, Kelly and his so-called gang (his younger brother and two friends) led a massive police manhunt on a wild goose chase that lasted twenty months, in which Ned s talents as a bushman were augmented by bank robberies and the support of nearly everyone not in a uniform. His one demand  for which he would have surrendered himself was his jailed mother s freedom.

Firstborn son of a warrior father who defeated the French at Agincourt, Henry VI of the House of Lancaster inherited the crown not only of England but also of France, at a time when Plantagenet dominance over the Valois dynasty was at its glorious height. And yet, by the time he died in the Tower of London in 1471, France was lost, his throne had been seized by his rival, Edward IV of the House of York, and his kingdom had descended into the violent chaos of the Wars of the Roses. Henry VI is perhaps the most troubled of English monarchs, a pious, gentle, well-intentioned man who was plagued by bouts of mental illness. In The Shadow King, Lauren Johnson tells his remarkable and sometimes shocking story in a fast-paced and colorful narrative that captures both the poignancy of Henry s life and the tumultuous and bloody nature of the times in which he lived.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G6WSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unchosen","description":"Kay, Debbie, and Ellen are best friends and share the same experiences of being the \\"have-nots\\" and \\"undesirables.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rz2WtgEACAAJ&dq=The+Unchosen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One, two, three ... infinity;: Facts & speculations of science (Compass books C127)","description":"Over 120 delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by the author add another dimension of good-natured charm to these wide-ranging explorations.

As one advance reader says, \\"This book is not only for the dedicated fan but for anyone interested in human endurance and courage and the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\\" For decades, the Senators were the doormat of the American league, a disappointment to the presidents and ordinary people who flocked to Griffith Stadium to watch Walter Johnson, arguably the best pitcher of all time, \\"Goose\\" Goslin, one of the most feared hitters in baseball and another future Hall of Famer, and other great players labor year after year in vain. But then in 1924 everything unexpectedly came together. Team owner Clark Griffith made shrewd off-season deals for journeyman players who would have their best years. The aging Johnson, whom some sportswriters said was finished, put together a final great season. Bucky Harris, the \\"Boy Wonder,\\" managed with a shrewdness that confounded those who thought he was too young for the job. And the author's grandfather, Joe Judge, the best fielding first baseman in the league and a lifetime .300 hitter, anchored the team. \\"Damn Senators\\" tells the dramatic story of how Washington managed to beat Babe Ruth and the Yankees, perennial champions of the American League, and then triumphed over the heavily favored New York Giants in what sports writers consider one of the most dramatic World Series in baseball history. In recreating this championship season, the author interweaves the story of Judge, son of an Irish immigrant who became a baseball legend not only for his steady play (he would eventually be inducted into RFK Stadium's Hall of Stars) but also because of what came after his retirement. In his later years, Judge was befriended by writer Douglas Wallop who made him the prototype for Joe Hardy, the lead character in his novel \\"The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant,\\" later fabulously successful as a stage play and movie under the title \\"Damn Yankees.\\" Recalling \\"The Boys of Summer\\" and other classics, \\"Damn Senators\\" is filled with unforgettable portraits of baseball legends like the wily Griffith; the noble \\"Big Train\\" Johnson; Ty Cobb, the meanest player of the day; Al Schacht, \\"The Clown Prince of Baseball\\" whose comedy act played between innings; the Giants  \\"Little Napoleon,\\" John McGraw, and of course, the larger than life Babe Ruth. Mark Judge returns us to a golden past. But with a new baseball franchise rumored to be on its way back to the nation's capitol, he may be taking us back to the future as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eNUHAAAACAAJ&dq=Damn+Senators:+My+Grandfather+and+the+Story+of+Washington%27s+Only+World+Series+Championship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Dark Below","description":"Black Swan meets Paranormal Activity in this compelling ghost story about a former dancer whose grip on reality slips when she begins to think a dark entity is stalking her.

When you date someone, you're more than just holding another's hands; you're holding that person's heart.

Harwood here gives us a glorious picture of Baltimore in the heyday of the streetcar, combining the story of lines and equipment with a nostalgic view of Baltimore when so many of her people relied on street railways. From the late 1800s through World War II, streetcars transported Baltimore's population to and from work, play, and just about everything else. Bankers and clerks, factory workers and managers, domestics, schoolchildren, shoppers, all rode side-by-side on the streetcars regardless of economic status, level of education, or ethnic background. In a city where residences and schools were segregated, streetcar passengers sat wherever they could. In addition to being a truly democratic institution, streetcars considerably influenced Baltimore's physical growth, enabling families to live farther than ever before from workplaces and thus encouraging early suburbs. Despite rising competition from the private automobile, streetcars remained the mainstay of Baltimore's public transportation system until after World War II, when gas rationing ended and family cars multiplied. Environmentally friendly and for the most part comfortable and reliable, streetcars also had their peculiar charm. Today some people in Baltimore miss them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KwtfsspuhKoC&dq=Baltimore+Streetcars:+The+Postwar+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Curse","description":"The third book in the Tales of the Frog Princess series, now with a brand new look!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zkb4AwAAQBAJ&dq=Once+Upon+a+Curse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Girls' Book of Love: Cool Quotes, Super Stories, Awesome Advice, and More","description":"The Girls' Book of Friendship and The Girls' Book of Wisdom This lively collection includes cool quotes, true stories, love poems, fascinating facts, and more from over 175 dynamic girls and women.

This lovely book is full of joy. Much more than the story of a woman s enduring love for an ordinary, flawed man, it s an ode to messy, imperfect, glorious, unsung humanity.  The Washington Post A runaway international bestseller, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry followed its unassuming hero on an incredible journey as he traveled the length of England on foot a journey spurred by a simple letter from his old friend Queenie Hennessy, writing from a hospice to say goodbye. Harold believed that as long as he kept walking, Queenie would live. What he didn t know was that his decision to walk had caused her both alarm and fear. How could she wait? What would she say? Forced to confront the past, Queenie realizes she must write again. In this poignant parallel story to Harold s saga, acclaimed author Rachel Joyce brings Queenie Hennessy s voice into sharp focus. Setting pen to paper, Queenie makes a journey of her own, a journey that is even bigger than Harold s; one word after another, she promises to confess long-buried truths about her modest childhood, her studies at Oxford, the heartbreak that brought her to Kingsbridge and to loving Harold, her friendship with his son, the solace she has found in a garden by the sea. And, finally, the devastating secret she has kept from Harold for all these years. A wise, tender, layered novel that gathers tremendous emotional force, The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy underscores the resilience of the human spirit, beautifully illuminating the small yet pivotal moments that can change a person s life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XZJoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Network Security Tools : Writing, Hacking, and Modifying Security Tools","description":"If you're an advanced security professional, then you know that the battle to protect online privacy continues to rage on.

If you owe money on your credit cards and cannot make payments anymore because of financial difficulty, this book is for you. I owed over $100,000 in credit card debt and the debt was hurting my life. I had trouble sleeping at night thinking how long my ever-increasing debt would continue to gnaw at me. Even if I could afford to make the minimum payments and do not borrow anymore, with interest of 25% APR, I will still owe a lot of money after many years of making only minimum payments. The interest alone would total close to $100,000. It took a year of trial and error, hours on the phone and writing meaningless letters most of which I copied from the internet before I saw the light at the end of the tunnel. None of the free advice and letters in the internet worked because the truth is I was not insolvent. I did not qualify for bankruptcy protection. I could have paid my credit card debt by liquidating my assets, selling my house, but that would have been devastating for my family. I kept on thinking of a way for my creditors to reduce my debt. I finally came up with The Letter that uniformly worked in negotiating down my debt. After mailing The Letter to my creditors, I received a reply from one of them offering to accept 50% of what I owed as full payment of my debt. I countered with 5%. We finally agreed on 10% of the original amount as full and final settlement of my balance. Considering I had not paid them for a year, I accumulated a little cash, so I was happy to grab the offer and pay the 10%. I had five credit cards with large balances and The Letter worked satisfactorily on four of the accounts. I settled the 4 accounts for between 5% and 15%. The last hold-out, surprisingly the account with the smallest balance at $13,000 chose to take me to arbitration. This negotiation-resistant creditor perceived that they might collect more money from me that way but they were wrong. I was surprised that not one of the 4 creditors even referred to the contents of The Letter or attempted to verify what I had written in the letter. The Letter aims to convey this message: \\"Take my final settlement offer or sue me. But if you sue me, you will lose\\". Ken Clark, author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Out of Debt: \\"So many people are trying to get their balances reduced, you call and try to negotiate a balance, and it's 'Get in line.'\\" The card company's attitude may be, \\"Yeah, you and everybody else\\"\\". My Comment - That's because you called to negotiate instead of sending them The Letter shown at the end of this chapter. Trust me there aren't that many accounts in default as a percentage of the whole or our banking system would collapse. If you write The Letter shown at the end of this chapter, the creditor will put you at the front of the line.Brian Tawney, Director of Clear One Advantage: \\"Based on experience negotiating with creditors, debt settlement companies know what percentage of debt owed each creditor is likely to agree to. We use an algorithm that considers 140 different variables and tells us the accounts that have the highest opportunity to settle at any given time. We negotiate in bulk. We can negotiate thousands of cases and get a better settlement for everyone\\". Translation: Debt Settlement Agencies take only the easy cases that's why they \\"negotiate in bulk\\". If they have to spend more time on your case because you have wages a creditor can garnish and assets they can put a lien on, they will not take your case. I like my system better. You write The Letter shown at the end of this chapter which begs creditors to forgive 85% to 95% of your debt. The creditors can take it or leave it. If they take it, you win.

Twenty years ago, they were young and innocent and on the brink of passion. Then something terrible happened. Now a chance encounter will take them back to the night that changed their lives forever... It is eight P.M., a few weeks before Chritsmas. New York is vibrantly alive with holiday cheer. With snow blanketing the ground, last-minute shoppers rush in and out of brightly lit stores, while carolers brave the cold to bring music to the streets. Stopping at an old stone church with his girlfriend, Nicole, Taj joins in song with the other worshippers...and hears a soulful, hauntingly familiar voice. Moments later, Cheyenne, seated in the front pew, is stunned when a stranger leans in and softly murmurs a name she thought she'd never hear again: \\"Jazz...\\" Suddenly, she is hurled back through the years, to the brutal event that shattered their innocence and ideals, and the pact she and Taj made in its horrific afemath. But two decades have brought changes. Cheyenne is married now. Yet from the moment she and Taj meet again -- awakening long-buried memories and rekindling desire -- they realize that they hold the power to liberate themselves from the dark echoes of the past. For they have been given a precious gift -- one that will determine the rest of their lives. The choice is up to them. Introducing a pair of unforgettable characters, whose bond transcends time and distance, Jasminium tells a mesmerizing story of the very human need for connection, and of the power of love to transform lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZCo9CYFdCo0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Heart: The Autobiography of Michael Pinball Clemons","description":"It's the feel good autobiography of the year - the uplifting story of Michael \\"Pinball\\" Clemons, the Canadian Football League superstar whose heart, talent and dedication are far bigger than his famed small 5'6\\" stature would indicate.

Soon it was gone, only to be succeeded by another. And another. Strange, Karinthy thought, it had been years since Budapest had streetcars. Only then did he realize he was suffering from an auditory hallucination of extraordinary intensity. What in fact Karinthy was suffering from was a brain tumor, not cancerous but hardly benign, though it was only much later after spells of giddiness, fainting fits, friends remarking that his handwriting had altered, and books going blank before his eyes that he consulted a doctor and embarked on a series of examinations that would lead to brain surgery. Karinthy s description of his descent into illness and his observations of his symptoms, thoughts, and feelings, as well as of his friends  and doctors  varied responses to his predicament, are exact and engrossing and entirely free of self-pity. A Journey Round My Skull is not only an extraordinary piece of medical testimony, but a powerful work of literature one that dances brilliantly on the edge of extinction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=trCxtdw5OHcC&dq=A+journey+round+my+skull&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goddesses #3: Muses on the Move","description":"Presents evidence to support the author's woman-centered interpretation of prehistoric civilizations, considering the prehistoric goddesses, gods and religion, and discussing the living goddesses--deities which have continued to be venerated through the modern era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7DfI39EDbMcC&dq=Goddesses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Academy of Love (Thorndike Press Large Print Paperback Series)","description":"Aided by Lady Challis, a widow, Prudence travels to France in seach of her missing parents, witnesses the Battle of Waterloo, and is reunited with the man she loves","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g1yNCRwp1NsC&dq=The+Academy+of+Love+(Thorndike+Press+Large+Print+Paperback+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Peewee/Sylvester","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=75cfYAAACAAJ&dq=Little+Peewee/Sylvester&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Headed for a Hearse","description":"Just days from meeting the reaper, a convicted murderer hires Chicago s most hard-boiled PI to save his neck before the executioner can claim it Robert Westland s death is just around the corner when he finally decides to fight the murder rap that s sending him to the electric chair.

Cyn Lystris leaves Free Trade because he is tired of making deliveries with the goods in one hand and his blaster in the other.

The younger son of the Mother Empress intends to challenge his corrupt brother for the throne. The Imperial Challenger boards Cyn's ship in disguise, followed by agents who want to capture or kill him.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training. Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card Welcome to Battleschool. Growing up is never easy. But try living on the mean streets as a child begging for food and fighting like a dog with ruthless gangs of starving kids who wouldn't hesitate to pound your skull into pulp for a scrap of apple. If Bean has learned anything on the streets, it's how to survive. And not with fists. He is way too small for that. But with brains. Bean is a genius with a magician's ability to zero in on his enemy and exploit his weakness. What better quality for a future general to lead the Earth in a final climactic battle against a hostile alien race, known as Buggers. At Battleschool Bean meets and befriends another future commander - Ender Wiggins - perhaps his only true rival. Only one problem: for Bean and Ender, the future is now.

Wherever I have gone, recently, among educated Christians in Britain and America, I have encountered profound curiosity and a good deal of anxiety concerning modern methods in philosophy as they relate to the logical nature and validity of theological affirmations. Similarly I have found many of my students in contemporary philosophy and in the philosophy of religion becoming deeply absorbed in the issues raised by a critical examination of theological speech. From both groups, the intellectually alert Christians and the thoughtful graduate and undergraduate students of philosophy and religion, I have been heavily bombarded with appeals for direction to some book which would (1) set forth the central issues and arguments concerning theological discourse for readers who have familiarity with traditional philosophy but who are relatively untrained in contemporary philosophical practices and (2) place into perspective the present state of philosophical and theological discussion in this area of burgeoning interest. To my frustration, I have had to answer such requests with the admission that no such book exists and with the promise that I would try, some day, to provide that book myself. In preparing this volume, therefore, I have done my best to keep those promises in mind.

Alex's investigation unearths stories that some have gone to desperate lengths to conceal: forbidden affairs, family rivalries, and the truth about Alex's own ancestry.

Nowhere else did science and democracy arise; nowhere else was slavery outlawed. Only Westerners invented chimneys, musical scores, telescopes, eyeglasses, pianos, electric lights, aspirin, and soap. The question is, Why? Unfortunately, that question has become so politically incorrect that most scholars avoid it. But acclaimed author Rodney Stark provides the answers in this sweeping new look at Western civilization. How the West Won demonstrates the primacy of uniquely Western ideas among them the belief in free will, the commitment to the pursuit of knowledge, the notion that the universe functions according to rational rules that can be discovered, and the emphasis on human freedom and secure property rights. Taking readers on a thrilling journey from ancient Greece to the present, Stark challenges much of the received wisdom about Western history. How the West Won shows, for example:   Why the fall of Rome was the single most beneficial event in the rise of Western civilization   Why the  Dark Ages  never happened   Why the Crusades had nothing to do with grabbing loot or attacking the Muslim world unprovoked   Why there was no  Scientific Revolution    Why scholars  recent efforts to dismiss the importance of battles are ridiculous: had the Greeks lost at the Battle of Marathon, we probably would never have heard of Plato or Aristotle Stark also debunks absurd fabrications that have flourished in the past few decades: that the Greeks stole their culture from Africa; that the West s  discoveries  were copied from the Chinese and Muslims; that Europe became rich by plundering the non-Western world. At the same time, he reveals the woeful inadequacy of recent attempts to attribute the rise of the West to purely material causes favorable climates, abundant natural resources, guns and steel. How the West Won displays Rodney Stark s gifts for lively narrative history and making the latest scholarship accessible to all readers. This bold, insightful book will force you to rethink your understanding of the West and the birth of modernity and to recognize that Western civilization really has set itself apart from other cultures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wqwMAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collector's Encyclopedia of Vogue Dolls, Indentification and Values, 2nd Edition","description":"More than 1,400 color photos of the most endearing dolls of the century are featured in this fantastic book.

Now, with the first major reinterpretation of his life in a generation, historian Andrew Burstein brings back Jackson with all his audacity and hot-tempered rhetoric. The unabashedly aggressive Jackson came of age in the Carolinas during the American Revolution, migrating to Tennessee after he was orphaned at the age of fourteen. Little more than a poorly educated frontier bully when he first opened his public career, he was possessed of a controlling sense of honor that would lead him into more than one duel. As a lover, he fled to Spanish Mississippi with his wife-to-be before she was divorced. Yet when he was declared a national hero upon his stunning victory at the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson suddenly found the presidency within his grasp. How this brash frontiersman took Washington by storm makes a fascinating story, and Burstein tells it thoughtfully and expertly. In the process he reveals why Jackson was so fiercely loved (and fiercely hated) by the American people, and how his presidency came to shape the young country s character.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-kWLhnBQreMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women's Best Friendships: Beyond Betty, Veronica, Thelma, and Louise (Haworth Innovations in Feminist Studies)","description":"Explore the distinct relationships of close female friends! Women s Best Friendships: Beyond Betty, Veronica, Thelma, and Louise gives new and comprehensive insight into the complex world of women s closest friendships. Recent studies have shown that women place enormous value on best friendships and consider them to be woven tightly into the fabric of their lives. Using in-depth interviews, along with close readings of relevant literature and theory, this book focuses on the many facets of these relationships. With heartfelt first-person accounts and insightful commentary from the author, this book examines three intertwining themes: feelings of competition, issues of dependence and independence, and knowing/understanding. This book sheds light on areas of tension among women, especially difficulties in communication, frustration about not being entirely let into a friend s life and thought processes, and the feeling that one friend may value the friendship more than the other. It also discusses women s struggles to maintain closeness over increased distances and the realization that one s friends are flawed, even as friends. This informative book, grounded in established research and theory, presents stories of real friendships--told by the people who live them. These women talk candidly about what makes a best friend, about navigating the choppy waters of friendship, and much more:  Somehow, when we started living farther apart there were ways in which we were being insensitive. We recognized that there was a really strong bond, but we were taking it for granted. So we talked about how close we feel to one another and perhaps how that leads to some arguments or hurt feelings.  --Liz, on how distance has affected her relationship with her best friend Susan  Em and I don t fight at all. I don t know if that s good or bad. I don t think I do well with fights. I think that s probably a lot of conflict avoidance on my part. And I think it does lead to some distance, even though it s a best friendship. I think I m uncomfortable asserting myself. And so it s easier not to have to do that. So maybe my inability to deal with the problems keeps the friendship at a distance, where it s safe and comfortable for me, in that one respect.  --Linda, about her desire to avoid any confrontation with Emily, her best friend Women s Best Friendships: Beyond Betty, Veronica, Thelma, and Louise is a fresh and exciting look at the inner workings of relationships between women. Drawing upon a multitude of issues and insights, this book is a must-have for women s studies classes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pbYsBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychometry: The science of touch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPbkHAAACAAJ&dq=Psychometry:+The+science+of+touch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jean Santeuil","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xzD5jgEACAAJ&dq=Jean+Santeuil&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be My Sorority Sister: Under Pressure","description":"Beta Gamma Psi had been a part of Eva Perkins life since birth.

Now that work has been fully revised and includes a complete up-to-date summary of the archaeology of the region (and relevant neighboring areas of China and Oceania), as well as a comprehensive discussion of new and important issues (such as the \\"Eve-Garden of Eden\\" hypothesis and its relevance to the Indo-Malaysian region) and recent advances in macrofamily linguistic classification. Moving north to south from northern Peninsular Malaysia to Timor and west to east from Sumatra to the Moluccas, Bellwood describes human prehistory from initial hominid settlement more than one million years ago to the eve of historical Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic cultures of the region. The archaeological record provides the central focus, but chapters also incorporate essential information from the paleoenvironmental sciences, biological anthropology, linguistics, and social anthropology. Bellwood approaches questions about past cultural and biological developments in the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. Historical issues given extended treatment include the significance of the Homo erectus populations of Java, the dispersal of the present Austronesian-speaking peoples of the region within the past 4,000 years, and the spread of metallurgy since 500 B.C. Bellwood also discusses relationships between the prehistoric populations of the archipelago and those of neighboring regions such as Australia, New Guinea, and mainland Asia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4obAfGBGKY0C&dq=Prehistory+of+the+Indo-Malaysian+Archipelago+(Revised)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pay Days: A Harpur & Iles Mystery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MxztngEACAAJ&dq=Pay+Days:+A+Harpur&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billy and the Big New School (Concept Books (Albert Whitman))","description":"Billy is nervous about starting school, but as he cares for a baby sparrow that eventually learns to fly on its own, he realizes that he too can look after himself.

The contours of the king's face are so lifelike that he appears to be almost three- dimensional. It seems as though the twenty-first century artist has traveled back in time nearly five hundred years to photograph his royal subject. While Sugimoto's portraits of historical figures appear to capture a lived moment in time, they are fictions. These portraits are in fact at least twice removed from the subject: his photograph captures a wax figure that has been created by a sculptor from either a photographic portrait or a painted one. Sugimoto has photographed his portraits of historical subjects in black and white, with each \\"sitter\\" posed against a black background, giving the images an austere formality. The black backdrop, free of any props or additional visual information, amplifies the illusion that we are viewing a contemporary portrait in which the subject has stepped out of history. Other portraits appear to be photojournalistic. Sugimoto's image of the Duke of Wellington at Napoleon's deathbed is actually a photograph of the mise en scene created by the wax museum, but it registers as real in our minds. The portraits of wax figures, which in this volume are presented alongside a handful of portraits of living subjects and photographs of memento mori, call into question what it is the portrait captures. As with his other major bodies of work--Dioramas, Seascapes, Theaters--Sugimoto's Portraits address the passage of time and history. We recognize these historical figures because of the many contemporaneous drawings, paintings, sculptures, and photographs that have recorded them. We take it for granted that a photograph of a living subject is true, but what does that mean? Are Sugimoto's portraits of living subjects more \\"true\\" than the historical portraits of wax figures? Is Hans Holbein's painted portrait of Henry VIII truer than Sugimoto's photograph of the wax figure made from Holbein's painting?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ruQetAEACAAJ&dq=Sugimoto+Portraits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bass Guitar for Dummies","description":"Way more than just the bass-ics . . .

There is Murder in every syllable, and Want, Misery and Pestilence take startling form and crowd upon the imagination as the pen traces the words.\\" So wrote a reporter about Five Points, the most infamous neighborhood in nineteenth-century America, the place where \\"slumming\\" was invented. All but forgotten today, Five Points was once renowned the world over. Its handful of streets in lower Manhattan featured America's most wretched poverty, shared by Irish, Jewish, German, Italian, Chinese, and African Americans. It was the scene of more riots, scams, saloons, brothels, and drunkenness than any other neighborhood in the new world. Yet it was also a font of creative energy, crammed full of cheap theaters and dance halls, prizefighters and machine politicians, and meeting halls for the political clubs that would come to dominate not just the city but an entire era in American politics. From Jacob Riis to Abraham Lincoln, Davy Crockett to Charles Dickens, Five Points both horrified and inspired everyone who saw it. The story that Anbinder tells is the classic tale of America's immigrant past, as successive waves of new arrivals fought for survival in a land that was as exciting as it was dangerous, as riotous as it was culturally rich. Tyler Anbinder offers the first-ever history of this now forgotten neighborhood, drawing on a wealth of research among letters and diaries, newspapers and bank records, police reports and archaeological digs. Beginning with the Irish potato-famine influx in the 1840s, and ending with the rise of Chinatown in the early twentieth century, he weaves unforgettable individual stories into a tapestry of tenements, work crews, leisure pursuits both licit and otherwise, and riots and political brawls that never seemed to let up. Although the intimate stories that fill Anbinder's narrative are heart-wrenching, they are perhaps not so shocking as they first appear. Almost all of us trace our roots to once humble stock. Five Points is, in short, a microcosm of America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BP-Hhfe0jOwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hero's Homecoming, Special Edition (Montana Mavericks: Return to Whitehorn)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GnJppwAACAAJ&dq=A+Hero%27s+Homecoming,+Special+Edition+(Montana+Mavericks:+Return+to+Whitehorn)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of the Unknown: Monsters","description":"Part of Usborne's cult classic 1970s series, back by popular demand for a new generation.

Dan Flavin (1933-96), an innovative and prolific American sculptor who can be considered an abstract, minimalist, and installation artist, chose as his medium commercial fluorescent tubes, and with these everyday lights created works of radiant and evocative beauty. Flavin had many major shows and created a number of permanent public installations; now his work is being celebrated in a magnificent retrospective exhibition that will travel across the country. This handsomely produced volume by Govan, director of the Dia Art Foundation, and Bell, who worked with Flavin, presents exquisite photographs of Flavin's seminal light compositions and expert biographical and critical assessments. Citing Byzantine icons, William Ockham, and Barnett Newman as influences, Flavin created ravishingly beautiful colors and profoundly nuanced constructions with seemingly banal industrial materials, transforming ordinary spaces into places of wonder.

Here, fundraisers will discover: how to get things done when they're not in charge; how to motivate others when they don't have formal authority; how to convince or persuade their colleagues and superiors about their need for action and involvement; and how to lead when they're not recognized leaders by virtue of power or position. Focusing on problem-solving concepts, Leading Up is packed with thought provoking questions, exercises, and practical application steps that allow professionals to practice and implement the principles they've just learned. The book also includes inspirational quotes on leadership from recognized and successful professionals and leaders. Leadership qualities have to be learned and practiced by all who wish to achieve success in fundraising, whether boss or not. Leading Up provides readers with the groundwork they need to not only build up their causes and organizations, but also influence a professional field that is still developing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rnNIEAAAQBAJ&dq=Leading+Up:+Transformational+Leadership+for+Fundraisers+(The+AFP/Wiley+Fund+Development+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tokyo Station","description":"1922, Tokyo.

Instead of beginning from a set of deductive theological assumptions and then attempting to support that system from Scripture, Forster and Marston examine Scripture and attempt to build their case directly from the text. The authors unabashedly admit that their views are very similar to those of Arminian and Weslyan traditions, but they state in the beginning of the book that they do not want to be labeled with these names, but want to construct a theology that is in line with the teachings of the first 300 years of Christianity. Anyone who reads their appendix will come to understand that the teachings presented in this book were the orthodox consensus of the early Church for the first 300 years, and that it was Augustine who introduced serious deviations into the mainstream orthodox Christianity of his time. Forster and Marston begin by describing the battle that is being waged between God and the spiritual forces that oppose Him. They examine the book of Job and see how this relates to the overall struggle. Then the authors examine the 9th chapter of Romans to see if this book is dealing with election and individual destinies, or God's actions within human history. The authors do an excellent job of arguing for their opinion that this chapter is speaking about God's involvement in human history and it deals with God's choosing of one nation or individual over another nation or individual to accomplish His purpose. Other sections of interest in this book are the sections on foreknowledge and predestination and the chapters on faith and works. The section on faith and works was particularly interesting because it relies on much of the teaching of the new perspective which has shed much light on how a 1st century Palestinian Jew would have approached Scriptural issues. The research, argumenation, and exegesis in this book are solid so every chapter is excellent, but the ones mentioned above were two of my favorites.\\"--Amazon.com.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dntKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sammy Davis, Jr. Reader","description":"The great entertainer comes alive in this anthology of writings about him--from the 1966 Playboy interview by Alex Haley and New Yorker profiles to the 1983 autobiography of porn star Linda Lovelace.

Kienzle, author of the classic mystery, The Rosary Murders. The redoubtable Father Robert Koesler is preparing to welcome into his parish Father Zachary Tully. An obstacle to Father Tully's assumption of his duties is suddenly put forth by the bishop, Vincent Delvecchio, a man Father Koesler has known since seminary days. An evening of talk leads Koesler and Tully into a discussion about the difficult bishop. As Father Koesler tries to explain the character of Delvecchio and his relationship to the many people in their common past, our holy sleuth uncovers a murder that had previously gone unnoticed.

The neighborhood has also welcomed generations of immigrants, from newly arrived Italians and Jews to today's Latino and Asian newcomers. This history has become somewhat obscured, however, as the Lower East Side can appear more hip than historic, with wealth and gentrification changing the character of the neighborhood. Chronicling these developments, along with the hidden gems that still speak of a vibrant immigrant identity, Joyce Mendelsohn provides a complete guide to the Lower East Side of then and now. After an extensive history that stretches back to Manhattan's first settlers, Mendelsohn offers 5 self-guided walking tours, including a new passage through the Bowery, that take the reader to more than 150 sites and highlight the dynamics of a community of contrasts: aged tenements nestled among luxury apartment towers abut historic churches and synagogues. With updated and revised maps, historical data, and an entirely new community to explore, Mendelsohn writes a brand-new chapter in an old New York story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9FmQLYB4h6MC&dq=The+Lower+East+Side+Remembered&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Not Your Fault: How Healing Relationships Change Your Brain and Can Help You Overcome a Painful Past","description":"A guide for survivors of trauma and abuse who have not found help from popular self-help guides explains that the brain responds to trauma in ways that may prevent a response to conventional methods, outlining a spiritual approach to healing that involves the empathic support of caregivers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AtlaDpP7sAAC&dq=It%27s+Not+Your+Fault:+How+Healing+Relationships+Change+Your+Brain+and+Can+Help+You+Overcome+a+Painful+Past&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petals on the Wind","description":"On the heels of the successful Lifetime TV version of Flowers in the Attic comes the TV movie tie-in edition of Petals On the Wind, the second book in the captivating Dollanganger saga.

This book explores her development as an assertive woman and outspoken writer, emphasizing the impact of the African American oral traditions and vernacular speech patterns of Harlem, Polk County, and her hometown of Eatonville, Florida on the development of her personal and artistic voice. The study traces the development of her assertive women characters, the emphasis upon verbal performance and verbal empowerment, the significance of down home Southern humor, and the importance of an ideology of assertive individualism in Hurston's writings and analyzes changes in Hurston's personal style. Hurston articulated an assertive spirit and voice that had a profound influence on the development of her professional reputation and on the course of African American literature, folklore, and culture of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. This study combines literary criticism and biography in tracing her often controversial career. This wide-ranging book focuses upon links between Hurston's fiction and nonfiction, and includes analysis of her plays, which have often been neglected in studies of her writing.(Ph.D. dissertation, State University of New York-Buffalo, 1989; revised with new introduction)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BXdACwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love or Fate (Goddesses, 4)","description":"Being trapped in Hades has proven to be nearly impossible to bear, and Era, Polly, and Thalia may be stuck there for eternity if they cannot outsmart the furies enough to escape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xM4alwEACAAJ&dq=Love+or+Fate+(Goddesses,+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jocelyn","description":"Describes how to break away from email addiction by prioritizing business workflow, writing effective emails, and understanding the psychology of reciprocity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BPnQDQAAQBAJ&dq=Jocelyn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Help for Today","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lp-BaXpQOU4C&dq=Help+for+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Crime Pay","description":"Most Americans are not aware that the US prison population has tripled over the past two decades, nor that the US has the highest rate of incarceration in the industrialized world. Despite these facts, politicians from across the ideological spectrum continue to campaign on \\"law and order\\" platforms and to propose \\"three strikes\\"--and even \\"two strikes\\"--sentencing laws. Why is this the case? How have crime, drugs, and delinquency come to be such salient political issues, and why have enhanced punishment and social control been defined as the most appropriate responses to these complex social problems? Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics provides original, fascinating, and persuasive answers to these questions. According to conventional wisdom, the worsening of the crime and drug problems has led the public to become more punitive, and \\"tough\\" anti-crime policies are politicians' collective response to this popular sentiment. Katherine Beckett challenges this interpretation, arguing instead that the origins of the punitive shift in crime control policy lie in the political rather than the penal realm--particularly in the tumultuous period of the 1960s.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GthgEFCEQNIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The NetWare Toolbox: 100 Tips and Tricks for Your NetWare Environment","description":"In this book, author Rob Bastiaansen has put together 100 tips that will make the life of NetWare system administrators easier.

Excerpt: Canada has an extensive history with regards to its currency. Beginning in the early 16th Century, items such as wampum and furs were actually considered currency. With the colonization of France and England, various coins were introduced in the 18th and 19th Century. In the 20th Century, it has issued many commemorative coins into circulation, temporarily replacing current coinage designs. For information on some non-circulating coins, go here. Another coinage that was used was the Sol (Sou). The sol was equivalent to the size of a 20th Century one-cent coin and was produced between 1738 and 1756. The Sol was rated at 12 deniers. The Double Sol was produced until 1764, although large shipments to Quebec and Cape Breton ended in 1756. The Double Sol was rated at 24 deniers. In 1841, the Province of Canada adopted a new system based on the Halifax rating. The new Canadian pound was equal to 4 U.S. dollars (92.88 grains gold), making one pound sterling equal to 1 pound 4 shillings 4 pence Canadian. Thus, the new Canadian pound was worth 16 shillings 5.3 pence sterling. The 1850s was a decade of wrangling over whether to adopt a sterling monetary system or a decimal monetary system based on the US dollar. The local population, for reasons of practicality in relation to the increasing trade with the neighbouring USA, had an overwhelming desire to assimilate the Canadian currency with the American unit, ..","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gc_1nQEACAAJ&dq=Coins+of+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Poems by 100 Poets: An Anthology","description":"A wonderfully readable anthology of our greatest poetry, chosen by the author of A Little History of Poetry A poem seems a fragile thing.

So now it behooves you to thread your way back through the maze of food traumas and conditioning to discover what God intended you to do with the natural bounty he provided.

As a figure of material plenty, the yaksis epitomized as Kubera, god of wealth and king of the yaks In demonic guise, the yaksis related to a large family of demonic and quasi-demonic beings, such as nagas, gandharvas, raksand the man-eating pisaacas. Translating and interpreting texts and passages from the Vedic literature, the Hindu epics, the Puranas, Kalidasa's Meghaduta, and the Buddhist Jataka Tales, Sutherland traces the development and transformation of the elusive yaksfrom an early identification with the impersonal absolute itself to a progressively more demonic and diminished terrestrial characterization. Her investigation is set within the framework of a larger inquiry into the nature of evil, misfortune, and causation in Indian myth and religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TK7Bt_SjaL4C&dq=The+Disguises+of+the+Demon:+the+Development+of+the+Yaksa+in+Hinduism+and+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's My Turn","description":"Want to gain freedom from your manipulative and self-centered parent?

This dynastic hierarchy meets in private; neither its minutes nor the church's finances are available for public review. Members are reassured by public relations spokesmen that all is well and that harmony prevails among these brethren. But by interviewing former church aides, examining hundreds of diaries, and drawing from his own past experience as an insider within the Latter-day Saint historical department, D. Michael Quinn presents a fuller view. His extensive research documents how the governing apostles, seventies, and presiding bishops are likely to be at loggerheads, as much as united. These strong-willed, independent menlike directors of a large corporation or supreme court justiceslobby among their colleagues, forge alliances, out-maneuver opponents, and broker compromises. There is more: clandestine political activities, investigative and punitive actions by church security forces, personal  loans  from church coffers (later written off as bad debts), and other privileged power-vested activities. Quinn considers the changing role and attitude of the leadership toward visionary experiences, the momentous events which have shaped quorum protocol and doctrine, and day-to-day bureaucratic intrigue from the time of Brigham Young to the dawn of the twenty-first century. The hierarchy seems at root well-intentioned and even at times aggressive in fulfilling its stated responsibility, which is to expedite the Second Coming. Where they have become convinced that God has spoken, they have set aside personal differences, offered unqualified support, and spoken with a unified voice. This potential for change, when coupled with the tempering effect of competing viewpoints, is something Quinn finds encouraging about Mormonism. But one should not assume that these men are infallible or work in anything approaching uninterrupted unanimity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VnbZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Mormon+Hierarchy:+Origins+of+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Accidental Entrepreneur: Practical Wisdom for People Who Never Expected to Work for Themselves","description":"This is an upbeat, encouraging, no-nonsense guidebook that takes the mystery out of launching, growing and running a successful business for both newly minted and experienced small business owners.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a3y1AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Accidental+Entrepreneur:+Practical+Wisdom+for+People+Who+Never+Expected+to+Work+for+Themselves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century","description":"Young women today have benefited from the strides made by grassroots social activists in the 1960s and 1970s, yet they are hesitant to identify themselves as feminists and seem apathetic about carrying the torch of older generations to redress persistent sexism and gender-based barriers. Contesting the notion that we are in a post-feminist age, this provocative collection of original essays identifies a third wave of feminism. The contributors argue that the next generation needs to develop a politicized, collective feminism that both builds on the strategies of second wave feminists and is grounded in the material realities and culture of the twenty-first century. Organized in five sections that mirror the stages of consciousness-raising, this is an engaging, often edgy, look at a broad range of perspectives on the diversity, complexity, multiplicity, and playfulness of the third wave. It is also a call to action for new voices to redefine a feminism that is not only personally aware but also politically involved.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h_PwCgAAQBAJ&dq=Catching+a+Wave:+Reclaiming+Feminism+for+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film","description":"Looking at Movies is the most effective, engaging, and widely adopted introduction to film analysis available.
