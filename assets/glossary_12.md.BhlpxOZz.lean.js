During this time, the Great Schism divided the church which led to the establishment of the papacy in Avignon and an unpopular poll-tax provided the spark which ignited the Peasants' Revolt.

Anthropologist Kathleen S. Fine-Dare focuses on the history and culture of both the impetus to collect and the movement to repatriate Native American remains. Using a straightforward historical framework and illuminating case studies, Fine-Dare first examines the changing cultural reasons for the appropriation of Native American remains. She then traces the succession of incidents, laws, and changing public and Native attitudes that have shaped the repatriation movement since the late nineteenth century. Her discussion and examples make clear that the issue is a complex one, that few clear-cut heroes or villains make up the history of the repatriation movement, and that little consensus about policy or solutions exists within or beyond academic and Native communities. The concluding chapters of this history take up the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which Fine-Dare considers as a legal and cultural document. This highly controversial federal law was the result of lobbying by American Indian and Native Hawaiian peoples to obtain federal support for the right to bring back to their communities the human remains and associated objects that are housed in federally funded institutions all over the United States. Grave Injustice is a balanced introduction to a longstanding and complicated problem that continues to mobilize and threatens to divide Native Americans and the scholars who work with and write about them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hl0F6n7wriEC&dq=Grave+Injustice:+The+American+Indian+Repatriation+Movement+and+NAGPRA+(Fourth+World+Rising)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"European Alliances and Alignments, 1871-1890: with Supplementary Bibliographies, 2nd Edition (A Caravelle Edition)","description":"Includes entries for maps and atlases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aDkQ5cSWR1gC&dq=European+Alliances+and+Alignments,+1871-1890:+with+Supplementary+Bibliographies,+2nd+Edition+(A+Caravelle+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Then Palestine","description":"Photographs taken in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem from 1993 to 1997.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Np5GAQAAIAAJ&dq=Then+Palestine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Hina, Vol. 8","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6J5aOQAACAAJ&dq=Love+Hina,+Vol.+8&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Touch of Silk","description":"'Fraser keeps the reader hooked' Sunday Times To all the world, Leo Davies is both a successful and charismatic QC, whose flourishing career is the envy of the legal profession.

Bucher argues that Luther gradually developed a doctrinal hermeneutic for determining whether a particular church teaching is an article of faith obligatory for all Christians. His doctrinal hermeneutic consisted of two canons (scriptural and evangelical) that served as interpretive lenses through which he judged whether a doctrine is necessary for salvation. Luther applied his doctrinal hermeneutic to ecumenical discussions to ascertain and ensure that only articles of faith would serve as a basis for unity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uo8MAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Ecumenical+Luther:+The+Development+and+Use+of+His+Doctrinal+Hermeneutic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emails from Mt.

In Fever of War, Carol R. Byerly uncovers the startling impact of the 1918 influenza epidemic on the American army, its medical officers, and their profession, a story which has long been silenced. Through medical officers' memoirs and diaries, official reports, scientific articles, and other original sources, Byerly tells a grave tale about the limits of modern medicine and warfare. The tragedy begins with overly confident medical officers who, armed with new knowledge and technologies of modern medicine, had an inflated sense of their ability to control disease. The conditions of trench warfare on the Western Front soon outflanked medical knowledge by creating an environment where the influenza virus could mutate to a lethal strain. This new flu virus soon left medical officers  confidence in tatters as thousands of soldiers and trainees died under their care. They also were unable to convince the War Department to reduce the crowding of troops aboard ships and in barracks which were providing ideal environments for the epidemic to thrive. After the war, and given their helplessness to control influenza, many medical officers and military leaders began to downplay the epidemic as a significant event for the U. S. army, in effect erasing this dramatic story from the American historical memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=haCUuvaj-58C&dq=Fever+of+War:+The+Influenza+Epidemic+in+the+U.S.+Army+during+World+War+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Parliamentary Guide for Church Leaders","description":"Written by the chief parliamentarian of the Southern Baptist Convention, A Parliamentary Guide for Church Leaders has become a standard reference work in the field of church administration for ministers, seminary students, church leaders, convention officers and delegates/messengers.

Larn was good-looking, well-mannered, and gentle around women and children. He was a successful rancher and renowned frontier sheriff.

Part of the allure are their stunning locations -- in the hills of Tucson, Arisona, and in the Berkshire mountains in Massachusetts -- but one of the best parts of a visit to Canyon Ranch is the food. Jeanne Jones developed and supervised the Canyon Ranch menu, and in Canyon Ranch Cooking, she offers everyone a chance to eat the spas' low-cal, low-fat delicious food. The recipes all have detailed nutritional breakdowns to help you plan a healthy meal with a lot of variety. Perhaps best of all are the tips and techniques to help enhance flavor without adding calories. Why does spa food taste so good when nearly all the fat has been removed? Jones reveals all the secrets -- such as adding citrus or vinegar to lift \\"flat\\" flavors; grilling over aromatic wood; marinating meat and vegetables; cooking at low temperatures for long periods to \\"marry\\" flavors; roasting rapidly for crispy crusts and tender interiors; using dried fruit for rich and creamy fat-free sauces; and much, much more. Try the Canyon Ranch Guacamole, Osso Bucco and Cheese Enchiladas; enjoy Chocolate Mint Cake and Cherry Streusel Pie. This is not a cuisine of deprivation -- the food is wonderful, and the recipes for making it easy and sensible. This book can't give you a workout or a hike, but it does tell you how to plan your own spa weekend at home, with suggestions for exercise, relaxation, even theme parties for special Saturday night dining. The wonderful recipes and the luscious photographs are here to delight and inspire.

Yu s translation of The Journey to the West,initially published in 1983, introduced English-speaking audiences to the classic Chinese novel in its entirety for the first time. Written in the sixteenth century, The Journey to the West tells the story of the fourteen-year pilgrimage of the monk Xuanzang, one of China s most famous religious heroes, and his three supernatural disciples, in search of Buddhist scriptures. Throughout his journey, Xuanzang fights demons who wish to eat him, communes with spirits, and traverses a land riddled with a multitude of obstacles, both real and fantastical. An adventure rich with danger and excitement, this seminal work of the Chinese literary canonis by turns allegory, satire, and fantasy. With over a hundred chapters written in both prose and poetry, The Journey to the West has always been a complicated and difficult text to render in English while preserving the lyricism of its language and the content of its plot. But Yu has successfully taken on the task, and in this new edition he has made his translations even more accurate and accessible. The explanatory notes are updated and augmented, and Yu has added new material to his introduction, based on his original research as well as on the newest literary criticism and scholarship on Chinese religious traditions. He has also modernized the transliterations included in each volume, using the now-standard Hanyu Pinyin romanization system. Perhaps most important, Yu has made changes to the translation itself in order to make it as precise as possible. One of the great works of Chinese literature, The Journey to the West is not only invaluable to scholars of Eastern religion and literature, but, in Yu s elegant rendering, also a delight for any reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=viGduAAACAAJ&dq=The+Journey+to+the+West,+Volume+4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelin In Your Pocket Malta, 1e (In Your Pocket)","description":"The Green Guide to Italy is a useful travel companion, offering suggestions on what to see and what to do, background on history and cultural heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WQTHyvuJjZMC&dq=Michelin+In+Your+Pocket+Malta,+1e+(In+Your+Pocket)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Construction Claims : Analysis Presentation and Defense","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AmRPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Construction+Claims+:+Analysis+Presentation+and+Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bontoc Igorot","description":"The book \\"\\" The Bontoc Igorot, has been considered important throughout the human history, and so that this work is never forgotten we have made efforts in its preservation by republishing this book in a modern format for present and future generations.

Clearly this is a necessary primer to understand the coming apocalypse of biblical proportions in consciousness, climate, culture, and civilization.

This noise results from the always dangerous combination of wishful thinking on the part of research and industry and of a lack of clear understanding of how Web services came to be. On the one hand, multiple contradictory interpretations are created by the many attempts to realign existing technology and strategies with Web services. On the other hand, the emphasis on what could be done with Web services in the future often makes us lose track of what can be really done with Web services today and in the short term. These factors make it extremely difficult to get a coherent picture of what Web services are, what they contribute, and where they will be applied. Alonso and his co-authors deliberately take a step back. Based on their academic and industrial experience with middleware and enterprise application integration systems, they describe the fundamental concepts behind the notion of Web services and present them as the natural evolution of conventional middleware, necessary to meet the challenges of the Web and of B2B application integration. Rather than providing a reference guide or a \\"how to write your first Web service\\" kind of book, they discuss the main objectives of Web services, the challenges that must be faced to achieve them, and the opportunities that this novel technology provides. Established, as well as recently proposed, standards and techniques (e.g., WSDL, UDDI, SOAP, WS-Coordination, WS-Transactions, and BPEL), are then examined in the context of this discussion in order to emphasize their scope, benefits, and shortcomings. Thus, the book is ideally suited both for professionals considering the development of application integration solutions and for research and students interesting in understanding and contributing to the evolution of enterprise application technologies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5KqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American social order;: Social rules in a pluralistic society,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GI_ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+social+order%3B:+Social+rules+in+a+pluralistic+society,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caterpillars of Eastern North America: A Guide to Identification and Natural History (Princeton Field Guides)","description":"\\"Many caterpillars are illustrated here for the first time.

UML incorporates the object-oriented community's consensus on core modeling concepts and provides a standard way for developers to communicate the details of system design and development. In addition to object-oriented modeling of applications, UML is also used for business-process modeling, data modeling, and XML modeling. Purpose of modeling: Models for software systems are as important as having a blueprint for a large building, or an outline for a book. Good models enhance communication among project teams and assure architectural soundness. The more complex the software system, the more important it is to have models that accurately describe the system and can be understood by everyone. UML helps provide this via a standard for graphical diagrams. Just like an architect can understand the notations on any blueprint, UML enables software engineers and business managers to understand the design of any software system, even if the original designers have long left the company. Organization behind it: Object Management Group (OMG) (www.omg.org). (UML Resource Page at OMG Web site is www.omg.org/uml.) The OMG produces and maintains the UML standard, an internationally recognized standard. The OMG is an open membership, not-for-profit consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications. Its membership roster (about 800) includes just about every large company in the computer industry and hundreds of smaller ones. Most of the companies that shape enterprise and Internet computing are represented on the OMG's Board of Directors. Companies that contributed to the UML Standard: Realizing that UML would be strategic to their business, the following companies contributed their ideas to the first UML standard: Digital Equipment Corp, HP, i-Logix, IntelliCorp, IBM, ICON Computing, MCI, Microsoft, Oracle, Rational Rose, TI, and Unisys. Companies that use UML: It is safe to say that all Fortune 1000 companies are currently using UML, or are moving toward UML to model and design their applications and systems. This includes companies from all vertical industries, from Coca Cola to Warner Brothers, from CVS Pharmacy to Lockhead Martin Aerospace. You name the company - if they have an IT department, they are using UML.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UOu2iiVKXYEC&dq=UML+Weekend+Crash+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julia Morgan, Architect","description":"Julia Morgan, America's first truly independent female architect, left a legacy of more than 700 buildings, many of which are now designated landmarks, in cities throughout California, as well as in Hawaii, Utah, and Illinois.

As this edition enables modern readers to discover, its enormous success is easy to understand. Love in Excess is a well crafted novel in which the claims of love and ambition are pursued through multiple storylines until the heroine engineers a melodramatic conclusion. Haywood s frankness about female sexuality may explain the later neglect of Love in Excess. (In contrast, her accomplished domestic novel, The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless, has remained available.) Love in Excess and its reception provide a lively and valuable record of the challenge that female desire posed to social decorum.

From the outset it was mired in disrepute. Cleland penned the novel to liberate himself from debtors  prison, and the book s manifestly lewd content led to its legal suppression within a year of publication. Though versions of the novel, nearly always abridged in some form, continued to find a way into print, the Memoirs remained an underground text until the 1960s. Only as that decade ushered in a culture less socially deferential and more sexually permissive was the moment opportune for the obscenity ban to be successfully challenged. Cleland s novel is a triumph of literary style, resting on his invention of an entirely new, vividly metaphoric, terminology for describing sexual pleasure. This Broadview Edition provides extensive materials on Cleland s biography and career, contemporary censorship, and pornography and prostitution in the eighteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NmFCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+woman+of+pleasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firing Offense","description":"When rising-star reporter Eric Truell accepts information from a maverick CIA agent, he becomes enmeshed in an international trade war in which even his own newspaper may be an unsuspecting participant.

What, then, is this invention that evokes such strong and contradictory emotions in Americans? In many ways malls represent the apotheosis of American consumerism, and this synthetic and wide-ranging investigation is an eye-popping tour of American culture's values and beliefs. Like your favorite mall, One Nation under Goods is a browser's paradise, and in order to understand America's culture of consumption you need to make a trip to the mall with Farrell. This lively, fast-paced history of the hidden secrets of the shopping mall explains how retail designers make shopping and goods  irresistible.  Architects, chain stores, and mall owners relax and beguile us into shopping through water fountains, ficus trees, mirrors, and covert security cameras. From food courts and fountains to Santa and security, Farrell explains how malls control their patrons and convince us that shopping is always an enjoyable activity. And most importantly, One Nation Under Goods shows why the mall's ultimate promise of happiness through consumption is largely an illusion.

Winning the Dust Bowl traces Revard's development from a poor Oklahoma farm boy during the depths of the Depression to a respected medieval scholar and outstanding Native American poet. It recounts his search for a personal and poetic voice, his struggle to keep and expand it, and his attempt to find ways of reconciling the disparate influences of his life. In these pages, readers will find poems both new and familiar: poems of family and home, of loss and survival. In linking  what he calls \\"cocooning\\"  essays, Revard shares what he has noticed about how poems come into being, how changes in style arise from changes in life, and how language can be used to deal with one's relationship to the world. He also includes stories of Poncas and Osages, powwow stories and Oxford fables, and a gallery of photographs that capture images of his past. Revard has crafted a book about poetry and authorship, about American history and culture. Lyrical in one breath and stingingly political in the next, he calls on his mastery of language to show us the undying connection between literature and life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JbQs-eKwJuEC&dq=Winning+the+Dust+Bowl+(Sun+Tracks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Objects of His Affection: Coming Alive to the Compelling Love of God","description":"To see our sins, wounds, idols, and failures apart from God's is simply too much.

Speaking to a group of sunbathing women who remind him of lovers past, this elderly rou  tells the story of his life or at least unburdens himself of a lifetime s worth of stories. Thus we learn of amatory conquests (and humiliations), of scandals both private and public, of military adventures and domestic feuds, of what things were like  in the days of the monarchy  and how they ve changed since. As the book tumbles restlessly forward, and the comic tone takes on darker shadings, we realize we are listening to a man talking as much out of desperation as from exuberance. Hrabal, one of the great Czech writers of the twentieth century, as well as an inveterate haunter of Prague s pubs and football stadiums, developed a unique method which he termed  palavering,  whereby characters gab and soliloquize with abandon. Part drunken boast, part soul-rending confession, part metaphysical poem on the nature of love and time, this astonishing novel (which unfolds in a single monumental sentence) shows why he has earned the admiration of such writers as Milan Kundera, John Banville, and Louise Erdrich.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rqZDQ05jRC8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncommon Sense: The Achievement of Griffin Bell","description":"A biography of former attorney general Griffin Bell that addresses his influence on modern legal history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bxIRPQAACAAJ&dq=Uncommon+Sense:+The+Achievement+of+Griffin+Bell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Popcorn Dragon","description":"Though his hot breath is the envy of all the other animals, a young dragon learns that showing off does not make friends. You could hardly blame Dexter, ordinarily a well-behaved young dragon, for showing off when he suddenly found that he could make clouds of smoke. The temptation is irresistible, but Dexter quickly becomes insufferable. First he watches his own reflection in the river in order to admire the smoke. Then he puffs it in the faces of his friends: the zebra, the giraffe, and the elephant. He even blows smoke rings around his own tail to prove how clever he is. Soon Dexter has no friends left. He is a very lonely dragon indeed, until quite by accident he discovers a way his talent can be used to win back his playmates. This wonderful story -- first published in 1953 -- will delight both young readers and their parents, and so will Lisa McCue's appealing new pictures of this lovable show-off.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wDHMrS2Q0KYC&dq=The+Popcorn+Dragon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Don","description":"A masterful saga of the last great American Mafia family and its powerful reach into Hollywood and Las Vegas, from the author of The Godfather The Last Don is Domenico Clericuzio, a wise and ruthless old man who is determined to see his heirs established in legitimate society but whose vision is threatened when secrets from the family's past spark a vicious war between two blood cousins. The Last Don is a mesmerizing tale that takes us inside the equally corrupt worlds of the mob, the movie industry, and the casinos where beautiful actresses and ruthless hitmen are ruled by lust and violence, where sleazy producers and greedy studio heads are drunk on power, where crooked cops and desperate gamblers play dangerous games of betrayal, and where one man controls them all.

Behind the headlines about controversial grants to the arts abides a realm of conservatism, bureaucracy, and jostling special interests, Alice Goldfarb Marquis maintains. With well-established, mainstream institutions capturing the bulk of government subsidies, artistic repertoires are reaching ever further into the past while truly innovative artists languish on the sidelines.\\" \\"Art Lessons is a fresh look at how Americans fund the arts - and why - by a major cultural historian. Packed with anecdotes about the creation of such leading cultural institutions as Lincoln Center, the National Endowment of the Arts, and the American Film Institute, and filled with stories about politicians, artists, philanthropists, and NEA chairs, the book offers a behind-the-scenes look at our cultural elite: the early battles over whether to allow affluent Jews to be part of the fund-raising establishment ... the controversies over the influence of popular artists such as Leonard Bernstein (\\"Nobody liked him except the public,\\" carped one critic) ... the monumental mistakes made in the building of Washington's Kennedy Center, which have necessitated repeated federal bailouts ... and much more. From John Kennedy's determination to bolster America's arts as part of his Cold War strategy against the Soviets, to Richard Nixon's support of the NEA's greatest expansion, to Ronald Reagan's abortive efforts to slash arts funding when Republican arts patrons and corporate funders objected, the book is filled with surprises.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In this erudite and informative book, a distinguished scholar provides the first coherent account of the lives and writings of these so-called Cappadocians (named for a region in what is now eastern Turkey), showing how they managed to be Greek and Christian at the same time. Jaroslav Pelikan describes the four Cappadocians--Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Macrina, sister and teacher of the last two--who were trained in Classical culture, philosophy, and rhetoric but who were also defenders and expositors of Christian orthodoxy. On one issue of faith and life after another--the nature of religious language, the ways of knowing, the existence of God, the universe as cosmos, time, and space, free will and immortality, the nature of the good life, the purpose of the universe--they challenged and debated the validity of the Greek philosophical tradition in interpreting Scripture. Because the way they resolved these issues became the very definition of normative Christian belief, says Pelikan, their system is still a key to our understanding not only of Christianity's diverse religious traditions but also of its intellectual and philosophical traditions. This book is based on the prestigious Gifford Lectures, presented by Jaroslav Pelikan at the University of Aberdeen in 1992 and 1993.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x9pu3b2_D68C&dq=Christianity+and+Classical+Culture:+The+Metamorphosis+of+Natural+Theology+in+the+Christian+Encounter+with+Hellenism+(Gifford+Lectures+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fly, Eagle, Fly: An African Tale","description":"After a stormy night, a farmer, searching for his lost calf, finds a baby eagle that has been blown out of its nest. He takes it home and raises it with his chickens. When a friend comes to visit one day, he tells the farmer that an eagle should be flying high in the sky, not staying on the ground. \\"But this eagle walks like a chicken, eats like a chicken, even thinks like a chicken,\\" the farmer replies. Twice, the farmer's friend tries to get the eagle to fly, but it sees the chickens on the ground and drops down each time. At last the friend, followed by the farmer, carries the young eagle back into the mountains and places the great bird on a rocky ledge, just before sunrise. As the air is filled with golden light and the sun appears, the friend cries, \\"Fly, Eagle, fly!\\" and the eagle raises its wings and soars upward, out of sight. This simply told yet dramatic story from Africa will delight children everywhere and encourage them to \\"lift off and soar,\\" as Archbishop Tutu puts it in his foreword.

In compact and suggestive prose, Fournel conveys the experience of cycling--from the initial charm of early outings to the dramas of the devoted cyclist. An extended meditation on cycling as a practice of life, the book recalls a country doctor who will not anesthetize the young Fournel after he impales himself on a downtube shifter, speculates about the difference between animals that would like to ride bikes (dogs, for instance) and those that would prefer to watch (cows, marmots), and reflects on the fundamental absurdity of turning over the pedals mile after excruciating mile. At the same time, Fournel captures the sound, smell, feel, and language of the reality and history of cycling, in the mountains, in the city, escaping the city, in groups, alone, suffering, exhausted, exhilarated. In his attention to the pleasures of cycling, to the specific \\"grain\\" of different cycling experiences, and to the inscription of these experiences in the body's cycling memory, Fournel portrays cycling as a descriptive universe, colorful, lyrical, inclusive, exclusive, complete.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iOgREAAAQBAJ&dq=Need+for+the+Bike&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MySQL Enterprise Solutions","description":"With more than three million users, MySQL is the most popular open-source database server in the world, providing an extremely fast, reliable, and inexpensive alternative to commercial database management systems Gives corporate users a complete guide to building enterprise-level database applications with MySQL Covers the pros and cons of adopting MySQL and installing, testing, and configuring the MySQL server Written by one of the lead programmers of the MySQL product and reviewed by Monty Widenius, the creator of MySQL Companion Web site includes all code examples as well as links to useful online resources","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rChIjihVGLEC&dq=MySQL+Enterprise+Solutions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Innocents Story","description":"Newly translated into English for the first time, these four novellas from the acclaimed German writer Gertrud von le Fort are from her later works of historical fiction.

Reading works by Ayn Rand, Ralph Ellison, Saul Bellow, Phillip Roth, Flannery O'Connor, Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, and others, he shows how both the form and content of postwar fiction responded to the transformation of the American middle class from small property owners to white-collar employees. In the process, he produces \\"compelling new accounts of identity politics and postmodernism that will be of interest to anyone who reads or teaches contemporary fiction. Hoberek argues that despite the financial gains and job security enjoyed by the postwar middle class, the transition to white-collar employment paved the way for its current precarious state in a country marked by increasingly deep class divisions. Postwar fiction provided the middle class with various imaginative substitutes for its former property-owning independence, substitutes that since then have not only allowed but abetted this class's downward mobility. To read this fiction in the light of the middle-class experience is thus not only to restore the severed connections between literary and economic \\"history in the second half of the twentieth \\"century, but to explore the roots of the contemporary crisis of the middle class.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P-Wr9iBAuR4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luscious: Stories of Anal Eroticism","description":"\\"When I pick up a book of erotica,\\" says Alison Tyler, \\"I don't want to read about 'beautiful' and 'loving.'

The discussion is arranged so that students can read only the RP or GA portions, if desired.

All the other kids get to do it!\\" Few behavioral problems challenge and frustrate parents, caregivers, and teachers as does verbal rudeness in children of any age. Reinforced by the wise-cracking kids on TV and in the movies, backtalk has become all too common among today's youngsters. But there is nothing cute about this behavior. Remarks like \\"Yeah, right,\\" \\"Big deal,\\" and \\"Make me\\" -- form children as young as three -- get in the way of real communication between parents and kids, and can also be detrimental to a child's social and intellectual development. Now two experts in the field share their simple and specific four-step program for ending backtalk and restoring balance in relationships between parents and children, from preschoolers to teens. You'll learn how to recognize backtalk, how to choose and enact a response that will make sense to you and the backtalker, and when to disengage from the struggle and move forward. Full of advice and encouragement as well as suggestions on how to keep track of what works and what doesn't, Backtalk can be put to use immediately, before you hear another \\"Whatever.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=33yzDAEACAAJ&dq=Backtalk:+4+Steps+to+Ending+Rude+Behavior+in+Your+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Risk Calculation in Genetic Counseling","description":"The process of genetic counseling involves many key components, such as taking a family genetic history, making a diagnosis, and providing communication and support to the family. Among these core processes is the mathematical calculation of the actual risk of a possible genetic disorder. For most physicians and counselors, the mathematics and statistics involved can be major challenge which is not always helped by complex computer programs or lengthy papers full of elaborate formulae. In this clear, reader-friendly guide, Ian Young addresses this problem and demonstrates how risk can be estimated for inherited disorders using a basic knowledge of the laws of probability and their application to clinical problems. The text employs a wealth of clearly explained examples and key points in order to guide the reader to an accurate assessment of the risk of genetic disease. It primarily will appeal to genetic counselors, geneticists, and all those involved in providing medical genetic services. In this new edition, Dr. Young has pruned redundancies and extensively updated the concepts in each of the 10 chapters, and he has included more working examples, a popular feature of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mHLnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Risk+Calculation+in+Genetic+Counseling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gillian Wearing (Contemporary Artists)","description":"Artist Gillian Wearing uses photography and video to produce a portrait of the complexities of contemporary life.

Behind the bright promise of life-saving vaccines and life-enhancing technologies lies the true cost of the efforts to develop them. Knowledge has a price; often that price has been human suffering. The ethical limits governing use of the human body in experimentation have been breached, redefined, and breached again---from the moment the first plague-ridden corpse was heaved over the fortifications of a besieged medieval city to the use of cutting-edge gene therapy today. Those limits are in constant need of redefinition, for the goals and the techniques have become both more refined and more secretive. The German and Japanese human experiments of the 1930s and 1940s horrified the world when they came to light. These barbaric exercises in pseudoscience grew out of assumptions of racial superiority. The subjects were deemed subhuman; ordinary guidelines could therefore be suspended. What has happened in the decades since World War II has differed only in degree. Explicitly or implicitly, any organization or government that undertakes or sponsors scientific research applies some measure of human worth. Experimentation rests upon an equation that balances suffering against gain, the good of the collective against the rights of the individual, and the risk of unknown consequences against the rewards of scientific discovery. Everything depends upon who makes that equation. The sobering and gripping accumulation of evidence in this book proves exactly what has been justified in the name of science. The science of \\"eugenics\\" justified enforced sterilization. The need to gain an upper hand in the Cold War justified CIA experiments involving mind control and drugs. The desperate race to control nuclear proliferation was used to justify radiation experiments whose effects are still being felt today. Chemical warfare, gene therapy, molecular medicine: These subjects dominate headlines and even direct our government's foreign policy, yet the whole truth about the experimentation behind them has never been made public. Though not a cheering book, In the Name of Science is a crucially important one, and it deserves a wide audience. A biologist by training, Goliszek presents each topic clearly and explains fully its significance and implications. Connecting the history of scientific experimentation through time with the topics that are likely to dominate the future, he has performed an invaluable service. No other book on the market provides the research included here, or presents it with such persuasive force.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jzbcSdD9RG4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Troubles with Women","description":"Collects some of the author's comics that reflect his relationships with women and his passion for sex.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cmNORnEfdkoC&dq=My+Troubles+with+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tooth And Claw (Super Bolan)","description":"When hit teams begin assaulting the innocent people living on the island of Hong Kong, Mack Bolan carefully maneuvers a retaliation program that escalates to full-scale public warfare.

And it certainly wasn't, but still the author and his wife went to Avea, tucked away amongst the woods and gorges of the Lazio countryside. There they found no Colosseum, or Pantheon; there were no Ferraris racing around the Palazzi Navona, Venezia or Farnese. Instead they discovered the true agony and beauty of Italy: the instinctive warmth of the Avea villagers, the camorra, Little Tony - Italy's answer to Elvis - the elegant and sophisticated Colasanti family and a landlord like no other, Pippo, the self-styled Duca di Avea. This is not a story of the high culture of Italy's big cities, instead of how two foreigners learned to eat the Italian way, drive the Italian way, survive the Italian way - even to have a child the Italian way - and how in doing it they came to love this hidden corner of the most visited and least understood country in Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iPLr6-qV2SEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Book of Shakespeare","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1vzsswEACAAJ&dq=The+Little+Book+of+Shakespeare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simplicity's Simply the Best Home Decorating Book","description":"Offers ideas and project instructions for home decor, including window treatments, bed coverings, pillows, and decorative accessories","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kOPcH_jGof8C&dq=Simplicity%27s+Simply+the+Best+Home+Decorating+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The little prince,","description":"Hello, I am the Little Prince.

Or does it go back even further than that? The very real probability that non-human intelligences visited and even copulated with primordial humans is detailed in civilization's most ancient cultural and religious records. These historical records further reveal that these intelligences were reptilian in nature--or, at the very least, have been represented throughout human history in reptilian form. From the Serpent, Nawcash, in the Garden of Eden; Atum, the Egyptian snake-man; and Quetzalcotl, the feathered serpent god of the Mayans to the double-helix snake symbol of Enki/Ea in ancient Sumerian literature, the serpent has been the omnipresent link between humans and the gods in every culture. In The Secret History of the Reptilians, Scott Alan Roberts investigates and examines the pervasive presence of the serpent in human history, religion, culture, and politics.

A new paradigm for postmodern psychology emerges as the author presents a dynamic theoretical model containing rational and irrational aspects of individual and collective life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lpnWBIMCGCUC&dq=Living+at+the+Edge+of+Chaos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-In-One Novell 5 Cna/Cne Exam Guide (All-in-One Certification)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AVEIAAAACAAJ&dq=All-In-One+Novell+5+Cna/Cne+Exam+Guide+(All-in-One+Certification)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LA Cantatrice Chauve","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=m7m_YgEACAAJ&dq=LA+Cantatrice+Chauve&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"General (Aviation Maintenance Technician)","description":" There's a dirty little secret about aviation maintenance: it often breaks aircraft instead of fixing them.   Manifesto  is the much-anticipated first book from renowned aviation columnist and speaker Mike Busch. Written in typical no-nonsense style, it lays out the basis of Mike's  minimalist  maintenance philosophy for owner-flown general aviation aircraft. An owner who follows the book's guidance can save a small fortune on maintenance costs and end up with a safer, more reliable aircraft. Owners are advised to perform the absolute least amount of maintenance required to make their aircraft safe, reliable and legal  and nothing more. The book explains in detail why engine and propeller TBOs and most other manufacturer-prescribed maintenance intervals should be disregarded. And  Manifesto  explains exactly how to do it. About the Author: Mike Busch is arguably the best-known A&P/IA in general aviation. In 2008, he was honored by the FAA as  National Aviation Maintenance Technician of the Year.  Mike has been a prolific aviation writer for more than four decades. His  Savvy Aviator  columns have appeared in numerous publications including EAA Sport Aviation, AOPA's Opinion Leader's Blog, AVweb, and magazines for the three largest GA type clubs (ABS, CPA, and COPA). He is renowned for his free monthly maintenance webinars and his standing-room-only forums at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh. Mike has been a pilot and aircraft owner for 45 years with 7,500+ hours logged, and he is a CFIA/I/ME. He's founder and CEO of Savvy Aircraft Maintenance Management, Inc., the world's largest firm providing maintenance-management services for owner-flown aircraft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4lHKoAEACAAJ&dq=General+(Aviation+Maintenance+Technician)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing, Society and Culture in Early Rus, c.950-1300","description":"This book provides a thorough survey and analysis of the emergence and functions of written culture in Rus (covering roughly the modern East Slav lands of European Russia, Ukraine and Belarus). Part I introduces the full range of types of writing: the scripts and languages, the materials, the social and physical contexts, ranging from builders' scratches on bricks through to luxurious parchment manuscripts. Part II presents a series of thematic studies of the 'socio-cultural dynamics' of writing, in order to reveal and explain distinctive features in the Rus assimilation of the technology. The comparative approach means that the book may also serve as a case-study for those with a broader interest either in medieval uses of writing or in the social and cultural history of information technologies. Overall, the impressive scholarship and idiosyncratic wit of this volume commend it to students and specialists in Russian history and literature alike. Awarded the Alec Nove Prize, given by the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies for the best book of 2002 in Russian, Soviet or Post-Soviet studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1OmOUqbdZ6wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexandria","description":"Hypatia brilliant mathematician, eloquent Neoplatonist, and a woman renowned for her beauty was brutally murdered by a mob of Christians in Alexandria in 415. She has been a legend ever since. In this engrossing book, Maria Dzielska searches behind the legend to bring us the real story of Hypatia's life and death, and new insight into her colorful world. Historians and poets, Victorian novelists and contemporary feminists have seen Hypatia as a symbol of the waning of classical culture and freedom of inquiry, of the rise of fanatical Christianity, or of sexual freedom. Dzielska shows us why versions of Hypatia's legend have served her champions' purposes, and how they have distorted the true story. She takes us back to the Alexandria of Hypatia's day, with its Library and Museion, pagan cults and the pontificate of Saint Cyril, thriving Jewish community and vibrant Greek culture, and circles of philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and militant Christians. Drawing on the letters of Hypatia's most prominent pupil, Synesius of Cyrene, Dzielska constructs a compelling picture of the young philosopher's disciples and her teaching. Finally she plumbs her sources for the facts surrounding Hypatia's cruel death, clarifying what the murder tells us about the tensions of this tumultuous era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UCkgLBCh2m0C&dq=Alexandria&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berserker's Planet","description":"Five hundred years have passed since the combined fleets of humanity met and broke the berserker armada at Stone Place.

Khaghani introduces and reconsiders the mosques of eighth- to fifteenth-century Iran in terms of poststructural theory and developments in historiography in order to develop a brand new dialectical framework. Using the examples of mosques such as the Friday Mosques in Isfahan and Yazd as well as the Imam mosque in Isfahan, Khaghani presents a new way of thinking about and discussing Islamic architecture, making this valuable reading for all interested in the study of the art, architecture and material culture of the Islamic world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c-iVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"July's People (Curley Large Print Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wFfpAAAAMAAJ&dq=July%27s+People+(Curley+Large+Print+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Effective Project Management: Traditional, Adaptive, Extreme","description":"The popular guide to the project management body of knowledge, now fully updated Now in its eighth edition, this comprehensive guide to project management has long been considered the standard for both professionals and academics, with nearly 40,000 copies sold in the last three editions!

Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation presents the journeys of pioneering - and often accidental - social innovators who, faced with a problem, used their courage, tenacity and creative thinking to find a solution. Using their own words to reflect open their experiences, these cases do not gloss over the setbacks and the dead ends social entrepreneurs can face. Instead, readers will gain a realistic insight into the challenges and an engaging look at the problem-solving mindset needed to overcome them. From a life-saving project to bring solar-powered lighting to midwives in Nigeria, to a news dissemination service that's grown from small beginnings to have a global impact, each case study draws out the lessons learnt by the innovators, providing guidance and advice for those looking to follow in their footsteps. Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation is an invaluable resource for social entrepreneurs and innovators looking for new ideas and insight into what really works - and what doesn't.

She asks general questions as to the nature of artistic interpretation, the differences between virtuosity and artistry, and how artists interplay with audience, aesthetics, and style. To support her case, she examines artists as diverse as Fokine and the Ballets Russes, Tewa Indian dancers, 17th century commedia dell'arte, Japanese kabuki and butoh, Zapotec shamans, and the mime of Marcel Marceau, adding her own observations as a professional dancer in the classical ballet tradition. Royce also points to the recent move toward collaboration across artistic genres as evidence of the universality of aesthetics. Her analysis leads to a better understanding of artistic interpretation, artist-audience relationships, and the artistic imagination as cross-cultural phenomena. Over 29 black and white photographs and drawings illustrate the wide range of Royce's cross-cultural approach. Her well-crafted volume will be of great interest to anthropologists, arts researchers, and students of cultural studies and performing arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=g4CuD-Z5M5gC&dq=Anthropology+of+the+Performing+Arts:+Artistry,+Virtuosity,+and+Interpretation+in+Cross-Cultural+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dem","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RN5UAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Wilf","description":"A classic of humorous science fiction from SF legend Gordon R.

Born in Baghdad, Michael fled in 1948 to Iran, and later to Israel, to escape imprisonment or execution due to his involvement with the Iraqi Communist Party. Early in his career Michael was deemed merely an \\"ethnic\\" writer, but his incredible popular success and indelible influence on his Israeli audience have forced critics to consider his writings anew. Nancy E. Berg sheds light on Michael's belated canonization and traces his development as a storyteller. Berg offers fresh readings of each of Michael's major novels. She shows us that by questioning and exploring Israeli and Jewish identity via characters otherwise rare in Hebrew literature (non-European immigrants, Sephardis, and Arabs), Michael has recast the Zionist master narrative. Berg notes that Michael's rise to literary prominence owes not only to his growing sophistication as a writer but also to changing norms and attitudes in Israeli society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tdPoszBHumoC&dq=More+and+More+Equal:+The+Literary+Works+of+Sami+Michael&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"USA sub 21: Un joven por Estados Unidos (Andar y ver) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TBMT88CssRsC&dq=USA+sub+21:+Un+joven+por+Estados+Unidos+(Andar+y+ver)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Notes / Puck Of Pook's Hill","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wr6zAAAACAAJ&dq=American+Notes+/+Puck+Of+Pook%27s+Hill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The function of the orgasm: Sex-economic problems of biological energy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iutqAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+function+of+the+orgasm:+Sex-economic+problems+of+biological+energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red HatLinuxBible","description":"Authoritative guide to a rapidly growing Linux distribution This is one of the first, if not the first comprehensive guide to the CentOS Linux operating system.

One of the most feared Chicago mobsters, Sam Giancana clawed his way to the top of the Mafia hierarchy by starting as a hitman for Al Capone. He was known as one of the best vehicle escape artists, a tenacious business man, and a ruthless killer. He partied with major stars such as Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe and did business with agents ranging from the CIA to the Vatican to the Shah of Iran. When politician Joe Kennedy gave Giancana the chance to use mob muscle to get his son John elected, Giancana jumped at the task.

Written with suspense and conviction, we learn about how the CIA asked Giancana to assassinate Fidel Castro.

Chicago and North Western s modern, sleek, and fast rail line began with a conventional steam-powered train dubbed the  400  and named after its ambitious schedule:  400 miles in 400 minutes.  In 1939, it evolved into an even faster diesel-powered streamlined train, eventually expanding into a fleet of streamliners that served Wisconsin, Minnesota, and upper Michigan. The 400 Story captures the excitement of this era, tracing the rise and fall of the premier passenger system that made  Twin Cities 400  a household term in the upper Midwest.

After inheriting a fortune on the death of his father in 1761, Banks devoted his life to studying natural history. His fame following his participation in Captain Cook's epic voyage on the Endeavour between 1768 and 1771 led to his election as President of the Royal Society in 1778, a post which he then held until his death. This volume, first published in 1896, contains Banks' account of the voyage of the Endeavour across the Pacific Ocean. Edited by the great botanist Sir Joseph Hooker, it describes in fascinating detail the peoples, cultures and wildlife Banks encountered in Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia.

The fourteen-year-old narrator of In Zanesville is a late bloomer. She flies under the radar   a sidekick, a marching-band dropout, a disastrous babysitter. Luckily, she has a best friend with whom she shares the everyday adventures of a 1970s American girlhood, incidents through which a world is revealed and character is forged. In time, the two girls' friendship is tested   by their families' claims on them, by a clique of popular girls who stumble upon them, and by their first startling, subversive intimations of womanhood. With dry wit and piercing observation, Jo Ann Beard shows us that in the seemingly quiet streets of America's innumerable Zanesvilles is a universe of wonders, and that within the souls of the awkward and the overlooked often burns something radiant. \\"Probably my favorite novel of the year...A marvelous reading experience...I don't think I'll ever forget the unnamed, perfectly realized narrator of In Zanesville.\\"  Nancy Pearl, NPR","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=id00AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting to Know the General: The Story of an Involvement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3-EOtAEACAAJ&dq=Getting+to+Know+the+General:+The+Story+of+an+Involvement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Enemy","description":"Nicola had never met Jason Wilde, but she hated him for the way he had hurt and deceived her sister, and was determined to be revenged on him.

Behind the romantic image of the galloping Iron Horse, however, lies a rich history of American business activity. Railway giants have dominated this history, but small companies such as the Quanah, Acme & Pacific Railway Company (QA&P), a short line that operated in four counties of northwestern Texas from near the turn of the century into the 1980s, had just as great an impact in their areas of operation as the giants did on the national scene. The QA&P developed in an era when railroads were tightly regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas and the federal Interstate Commerce Commission. The in-depth historical analysis of an American short line railroad presented here is in essence the study of all such carriers in the era before deregulation. Fully illustrated with photographs and memorabilia, this volume covers the Quanah Route's birth, valiant struggle for life, and eventual demise in a changing regulatory and competitive environment. This then is a history not only of a railroad but also of its service area, particularly during one of the last great railroad construction booms, which took place in West Texas during the 1920s. Through the years of the QA&P's life, energetic men such as Sam Lazarus and Charles Sommer juggled political and financial concerns against the changing times, Lazarus making the deal by which the QA&P became a subsidiary of the St. LouisSan Francisco (Frisco) road. In the end, the \\"good roads movement,\\" trucking industry, and growing American passion for the private automobile spelled the end of the railroads' golden age as the prime carrier of passengers and products. As traced by Don L. Hofsommer in the full archives of the QA&P, the history of this short line railroad embodies the pulse and pathos of a place through the changing times of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qWnbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Quanah+Route:+A+History+of+the+Quanah,+Acme,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Bronte Poems","description":"A collection of classic poems that provide an accessible introduction to the poetry of the Bronte Sisters.

Physical control over space was no longer symbolic after 1874. This is a history told from the perspective of its victims. With vivid examples of the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment, this dramatic account of barbed wire presents modern history through the lens of motion being prevented. Drawing together the history of humans and animals, Netz delivers a compelling new perspective on the issues of colonialism, capitalism, warfare, globalization, violence, and suffering. Theoretically sophisticated but written with a broad readership in mind, Barbed Wire calls for nothing less than a reconsideration of modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TQN-tI2Aa6MC&dq=Barbed+Wire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method","description":"This is a collection of articles dealing with the point of view of symbolic interactionism and with the topic of methodology in the discipline of sociology.

Blumer states that symbolic interactionism rests on three premises: that human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings of things have for them; that the meaning of such things derives from the social interaction one has with one's fellows; and that these meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HVuognZFofoC&dq=Symbolic+Interactionism:+Perspective+and+Method&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An encyclopedia of freemasonry and its kindred sciences,: Comprising the whole range of arts, sciences and literature as connected with the institution,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=E6oYAAAAIAAJ&dq=An+encyclopedia+of+freemasonry+and+its+kindred+sciences,:+Comprising+the+whole+range+of+arts,+sciences+and+literature+as+connected+with+the+institution,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EmUfLwEACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Dictionary+of+the+Christian+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Making of a Ministry","description":"After examining the lives of hundreds of historical, biblical, and contemporary leaders, Dr. J.

Some rich nuggets out of this vast gold mine will not be dug up at all, but left for you to mine for yourself. The book will deal with the content of the epistle rather than its contents. The message will be distinctly personal, for it is written of what one s eyes have seen and ears beard, and what has entered into one s own heart of all those wondrous things which God has prepared for them that love Him. If this message stimulates you to dig deep and to dwell deep in Ephesians, then the most fervent prayer for it will have been answered. The message purposely will be practical. Our desire is to show the essential order in and connection between the first three chapters, which deal with doctrine, and the last three, which deal with experience. We shall see in Ephesians how our wealth is to be manifested in our walk and maintained in our warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rWbwbSFNuggC&dq=Wealth+Walk+and+Warfare+of+the+Christians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coming Home (Heartland #1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0dG2Echgu9gC&dq=Coming+Home+(Heartland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something about Workmen","description":"Cat Harrington leads a double life.

Is het wel zo betoverend als het lijkt? JeriLee Randall heeft na vele woelige jaren als stripteasedanseres en gastvrouw in een seksclub zichzelf omhoog gewerkt tot topactrice. Na vele foute mannen, een stukgelopen huwelijk en schimmige baantjes, heeft ze een veelbewogen zoektocht naar haar seksualiteit doorstaan. Alsnog moet ze in de harde wereld van Hollywood sterk in haar schoenen staan om haar waardigheid en respect te behouden. Blijft het voor JeriLee eenzaam aan de top? In  Eenzame vrouw  vertelt Harold Robbins voor het eerst het verhaal van een ambitieuze en verleidelijke vrouw, die een heldin is geworden in de moderne literatuur. De in New York geboren Harold Robbins (1916-1997) is een van de meest gelezen auteurs ter wereld. Er zijn meer dan 750 miljoen exemplaren van zijn romans verkocht en zijn boeken zijn vertaald in 32 talen. In 1948 brak hij door met zijn allereerste roman  Hart zonder toegang  dat door enkele expliciete seksuele passages de aandacht wekte onder het Amerikaanse publiek. Ook werden maar liefst twaalf romans verfilmd met niemand minder dan Elvis Presley in de hoofdrol in  King Creole . In het boek  De droomfabrikanten , later ook verfilmd, vertelt Robbins over de filmindustrie in Hollywood dat gedeeltelijk gebaseerd is op zijn ervaringen uit de tijd dat hij daar werkzaam was. Andere bekende werken zijn  79 Park Avenue  (1955),  De duivel als leidsman  (1961) en  De avonturiers  (1966). Hoewel sommige romans bijna zeventig jaar oud zijn, komen hedendaagse onderwerpen aan bod zoals prestige, geld en macht.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SWwoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flexible Leadership: Creating Value by Balancing Multiple Challenges and Choices","description":"Publisher's description: Although there are many models of leadership available, none of the advice on leadership and leader effectiveness is comprehensive enough to be of genuine use to leaders and leadership development professionals ... until now.

Before World War II it was a thriving, small Polish town of 4,000 people, half Polish Catholics, half Jews, where family and the traditional ways of life were strong. It was the town where Norman Salsitz was born, in 1920, the last of nine children. It was the town that he helped to destroy, forced by the Nazis in 1941 to assist in the brick-by-brick destruction of the Jewish ghetto in which his family lived. Salsitz was subsequently sent to a German work camp, but escaped into the woods to live and later tell his story of Kolbuszowa to Richard Skolnik. Salsitz speaks to us both as an exceptional witness to everyday events in the town and as a shrewd observer of the broader landscape.

Maryland's Vanishing Lives is his vivid account of the people he met on those journeys. Working in a country store or an old-time movie house, on a small tobacco farm or a weathered skipjack, Sherwood's subjects interest us as people, as stubborn survivors who have watched sometimes defiantly, sometimes wistfully as the world moved on. These Marylanders' stories poignantly show what happens to family businesses and ordinary folk in the face of new technology, suburban sprawl, franchise outlets, and changing tastes. But Maryland's Vanishing Lives is also an engaging celebration of pride and craft, and the ability to survive. In this collection of sixty-six short profiles, illustrated with memorable photographs by Edwin Remsberg, Sherwood preserves for posterity the lives of Marylanders who hang on to values and skills that are quickly disappearing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mZi6h2nTl04C&dq=Maryland%27s+Vanishing+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Our Own, Together: Peer Programs for People with Mental Illness","description":"An intimate insiders' examination of various consumerrun services for mental health clients.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=l4UqA8wObaQC&dq=On+Our+Own,+Together:+Peer+Programs+for+People+with+Mental+Illness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Names: Names You Just Won't Find in the Other Books","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=30lksvNgwQsC&dq=The+Book+of+Names:+Names+You+Just+Won%27t+Find+in+the+Other+Books&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LOWER EAST SIDE MEMORIES","description":"Manhattan's Lower East Side stands for Jewish experience in America. With the possible exception of African-Americans and Harlem, no ethnic group has been so thoroughly understood and imagined through a particular chunk of space. Despite the fact that most American Jews have never set foot there--and many come from families that did not immigrate through New York much less reside on Hester or Delancey Street--the Lower East Side is firm in their collective memory. Whether they have been there or not, people reminisce about the Lower East Side as the place where life pulsated, bread tasted better, relationships were richer, tradition thrived, and passions flared. This was not always so. During the years now fondly recalled (1880-1930), the neighborhood was only occasionally called the Lower East Side. Though largely populated by Jews from Eastern Europe, it was not ethnically or even religiously homogenous. The tenements, grinding poverty, sweatshops, and packs of roaming children were considered the stuff of social work, not nostalgia and romance. To learn when and why this dark warren of pushcart-lined streets became an icon, Hasia Diner follows a wide trail of high and popular culture. She examines children's stories, novels, movies, museum exhibits, television shows, summer-camp reenactments, walking tours, consumer catalogues, and photos hung on deli walls far from Manhattan. Diner finds that it was after World War II when the Lower East Side was enshrined as the place through which Jews passed from European oppression to the promised land of America. The space became sacred at a time when Jews were simultaneously absorbing the enormity of the Holocaust and finding acceptance and opportunity in an increasingly liberal United States. Particularly after 1960, the Lower East Side gave often secularized and suburban Jews a biblical, yet distinctly American story about who they were and how they got here. Displaying the author's own fondness for the Lower East Side of story books, combined with a commitment to historical truth, Lower East Side Memories is an insightful account of one of our most famous neighborhoods and its power to shape identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LkT_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santa Fe in the Intermountain West, Colorado Rail Annual No. 23","description":"The model railroad empire of MTH Electric Trains continues to steam ahead and revolutionize the O gauge electric train market with its innovative product lines, helping to make O gauge the fastest growing segment in model railroading.

Now, in the first book to reflect the new communal and social awakening which emerged from Vatican Council II, here is a vibrant and compelling history of the American Catholic experience one that will surely become the standard volume for this decade, and decades to come. Spanning nearly five hundred years, the narrative eloquently describes the Catholic experience from the arrival of Columbus and the other European explorers to the present day. It sheds fascinating new light on the work of the first vanguard of missionaries, and on the religious struggles and tensions of the early settlers. We watch Catholicism as it spread across the New World, and see how it transformed and was transformed by the land and its people. We follow the evolution of the urban ethnic communities and learn about the vital contributions of the immigrant church to Catholicism. And finally, we share in the controversy of the modern church and the extraordinary changes in the Catholic consciousness as it comes to grips with such contemporary social and theological issues as war and peace and the arms race, materialism, birth control and abortion, social justice, civil rights, religious freedom, the ordination of women, and married clergy. The American Catholic Experience is not just the history of an institution, but a chronicle of the dreams and aspirations, the crises and faith, of a thriving, ever-evolving religious community. It provides a penetrating and deeply thoughtful look at an experience as diverse, as exciting, and as powerful as America itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E2P-GRjwqqgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Red Hat Linux 9 (Programmer to Programmer)","description":"Describes the Linux operating system, covering such topics as installation, connecting to the Internet, software, applications, user accounts, networking, system administration, security, and Perl.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lQoM_XEXaTwC&dq=Beginning+Red+Hat+Linux+9+(Programmer+to+Programmer)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bicycling for Life","description":"Bicycling magazine features bikes, bike gear, equipment reviews, training plans, bike maintenance how tos, and more, for cyclists of all levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=esUDAAAAMBAJ&dq=Bicycling+for+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Bright and Risen Angels","description":"The debut work of fiction from the National Book Award-winning author of Europe Central You Bright and Risen Angels is the work of an extraordinary imagination.

Her account of growing up on a cattle ranch in west-central New Mexico captivated readers from coast to coast, and it remains in print to this day. In her book, Cleaveland memorably portrayed herself and other ranchwomen as capable workers and independent thinkers. Her life, however, was not limited to the ranch. In Open Range, Darlis A. Miller expands our understanding of Cleaveland's significance, showing how a young girl who was a fearless risk-taker grew up to be a prolific author and well-known social activist. Following a hardscrabble childhood in remote regions of northern and central New Mexico, and then many years of rigorous education, Agnes Morley married Newton Cleaveland in 1899. The couple took up primary residence in Berkeley, California, where Agnes lived another kind of life as clubwoman and activist. Yet Agnes's ranch in the Datil Mountains always drew her back to New Mexico and provided the raw material for her writing. Seen as a whole, Cleaveland's life story spans the years from territorial New Mexico to the Cold War, includes the raising of her four children and interactions with a wide range of national and regional characters, and provides insight into such aspects of western culture as railroads, cattle, and tourism. Her biography is a case study in the roles that wealthy and well-educated women played during the first half of the twentieth century in both domestic and political spheres and will intrigue anyone familiar with the writings of this multifaceted woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sC6Z7-9czwoC&dq=Open+Range&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Want To Be An Architect","description":"Offers architects and creative services professionals exclusive insights and strategies for success from the former CEO of HOK.

Exercise, physical activity. Do challenging things. Seek out new things to interest you. Have love in your life. The way to develop a strong mind is really very simple: concentrate, pay attention and focus on whatever it is you're doing. You must love what you do and try to understand it. Strive to understand the information then organize it in your mind. You must first reduce all the material down into a few meaningful concepts then organize it in as simple a way as possible. Simplicity is the key to everything. Focus on titles, subheadings and keywords such that when one key point comes to mind, it opens the floodgates. More is not necessarily better. Eliminate all the trivial distractions and focus on the main points only. Seek to deeply understand the concept of whatever it is you're doing right off so as to avoid having to go back later to learn it again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xSFPCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse of Seven Moons","description":"In 1881, after sixteen-year-old Bin-daa-dee-nin, an Apache fugitive, prays for help to survive in the mountains of New Mexico, he encounters a unique horse, and the path of his life with that horse crosses the life path of fourteen-year-old Sarah Chilton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QCLoT-je2-EC&dq=Horse+of+Seven+Moons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access 2003 Programming Weekend Crash Course","description":"Get up to speed on Access 2003 programming - in a weekend!

This commentary on the origin and relationships of Latin words is an intriguing, but often puzzling, fragmentary work for classicists. Since Varro was engaged in defining how Romans saw themselves and how they talked about their world, Spencer reads along with Varro, following his themes and arcs, his poetic sparks, his political and cultural seams. Few scholars have accepted the challenge of tackling Varro and his work, and in this pioneering volume, Spencer provides a roadmap for considering these topics more thoroughly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_ROXDwAAQBAJ&dq=Latin:+Start+Speaking+Today!+(Language+30)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zagat New York City Restuarants (Zagat Survey: New York City Restaurants)","description":"Ratings and reviews for NYC's best restaurants as voted on by trusted diners, in celebration of Zagat's 40th Anniversary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xrj3wwEACAAJ&dq=Zagat+New+York+City+Restuarants+(Zagat+Survey:+New+York+City+Restaurants)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Nemo: The Essential Guide","description":"An illustrated guide to the characters in the animated film Finding Nemo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BdZCLuXqdU4C&dq=Finding+Nemo:+The+Essential+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Occasions : Readings for the Celebration of Birth, Coming of Age, Marriage, and Death","description":"Birth, maturity, marriage and death: These are the four cornerstones of human life, the great occasions. *Over 650 memorable selections to commemorate the milestones of life. *Poetry and prose from a broad spectrum of highly regarded writers, including Aiken, Pound, Dickinson, Seneca, Blake, Buddha, Bronte, Marcuse, Stevens, Sexton, Tagore, Lippman, Sandburg, Sarton, Pasternak, Lao Tzu, Yevtushenko, Yeats and many more.

It provides fresh interpretations of fundamental works and of the vital and challenging issues emerging in English literary studies. By engaging with the materiality of the literary text, its production, and reception history, and frequently testing and exploring the boundaries of the notion of text itself, the volumes in the series question familiar frameworks and provide innovative interpretations of both canonical and less well-known works. Living through Conquest is the first ever investigation of the political clout of English from the reign of Cnut to the earliest decades of the thirteenth century. It focuses on why and how the English language was used by kings and their courts and by leading churchmen and monastic institutions at key moments from 1020 to 1220. English became the language of choice of a usurper king; the language of collective endeavour for preachers and prelates; and the language of resistance and negotiation in the post-Conquest period. Analysing texts that are not widely known, such as Cnut's two Letters to the English of 1020 and 1027, Worcester's Confraternity Agreement, and the Eadwine Psalter, alongside canonical writers like ?lfric and Wulfstan, Elaine Treharne demonstrates the ideological significance of the native vernacular and its social and cultural relevance alongside Latin, and later, French. While many scholars to date have seen the period from 1060 to 1220 as a literary lacuna as far as English is concerned, this book demonstrates unequivocally that the hundreds of vernacular works surviving from this period attest to a lively and rich textual tradition. Living Through Conquest addresses the political concerns of English writers and their constructed audiences, and investigates the agenda of manuscript producers, from those whose books were very much in the vein of earlier English codices to those innovators who employed English precisely to demonstrate its contemporaneity in a multitude of contexts and for a variety of different audiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RfVQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 9","description":"LIFE WISH Syaoran reveals to his companions the heavy price he paid to be able to protect Sakura, one with consequences for many people, and his burden of guilt.

In this tightly argued study, Elizabeth Thompson shows how Syrians and Lebanese mobilized, like other colonized peoples, to claim the terms of citizenship enjoyed in the European metropole. The negotiations between the French and citizens of the Mandate set the terms of politics for decades after Syria and Lebanon achieved independence in 1946. Colonial Citizens highlights gender as a central battlefield upon which the relative rights and obligations of states and citizens were established. The participants in this struggle included not only elite nationalists and French rulers, but also new mass movements of women, workers, youth, and Islamic populists. The author examines the \\"gendered battles\\" fought over France's paternalistic policies in health, education, labor, and the press. Two important and enduring political structures issued from these conflicts: * First, a colonial welfare state emerged by World War II that recognized social rights of citizens to health, education, and labor protection. * Second, tacit gender pacts were forged first by the French and then reaffirmed by the nationalist rulers of the independent states. These gender pacts represented a compromise among male political rivals, who agreed to exclude and marginalize female citizens in public life. This study provides a major contribution to the social construction of gender in nationalist and postcolonial discourse. Returning workers, low-ranking religious figures, and most of all, women to the narrative history of the region--figures usually omitted-- Colonial Citizens enhances our understanding of the interwar period in the Middle East, providing needed context for a better understanding of statebuilding, nationalism, Islam, and gender since World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5t9eUXEJiagC&dq=Slick+Spins+and+Fractured+Facts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pit Prop Syndicate","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=amyF5IQAbicC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shop Like Coupon Quee","description":"The original \\"Coupon Queen\\" and New York Times bestselling author shares her unique Five-Step Supershopping System.

They were sentenced to thirty years and flung into the world's deadliest prison system, ending up in the notorious Yare. A place where drugs and weaponry are currency and the rules are: there are no rules. This is the gripping true-life story of how two men endured untold savagery in the most appalling conditions. It's about what it's like to witness murder and rape every day, fearing you'll be next. How it feels to join a dangerous Latino gang and eat dead rats in order to survive. And, what you do when you're at the centre of a riot between thousands of men with machine guns. As seen on Channel 5's Banged Up Abroad, this is the most shocking prison story ever told and an inspiring account of human endurance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GxezPKcg5sMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empires in Anarchy","description":"Kaplan shows how U.S. imperialism--from \\"Manifest Destiny\\" to the \\"American Century\\"--has profoundly shaped key elements of American culture at home, and how the struggle for power over foreign peoples and places has disrupted the quest for domestic order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_JstEAAAQBAJ&dq=Empires+in+Anarchy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An enemy of the people (The drama library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-9RCnQAACAAJ&dq=An+enemy+of+the+people+(The+drama+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Conquest: Trek Mi Q'an Books Four and Five: No Escape and No Fear","description":"Two Trek Mi Q'an books in one!

Writing for publications ranging from the Wall Street Journal to The Nation to France s Le Monde, David Rieff witnessed firsthand most of the armed interventions since the Cold War waged by the West or the United Nations in the name of human rights and democratization. In this timely collection of his most illuminating articles, Rieff, one of our leading experts on the subject, reassesses some of his own judgments about the use of military might to solve the world s most pressing humanitarian problems. At the Point of a Gun raises critical questions we cannot ignore in this era of gunboat democracy. When, if ever, is it appropriate to intervene militarily in the domestic affairs of other nations? Are human rights and humanitarian concerns legitimate reasons for intervening, or is the assault on sovereignty a flag of convenience for the recolonization of part of the world? And, above all, can democracy be imposed through the barrel of an M16? This is not an optimistic report, but the questions Rieff raises are of the essence as the United States grapples with the harsh consequences of what it has wrought on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gYGkFbNW_3wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jean-Louis: Cooking with the Seasons","description":"Offering a panoramic view of the history and culture of food and drink in America with fascinating entries on everything from the smell of asparagus to the history of White Castle, and the origin of Bloody Marys to jambalaya, the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink provides a concise, authoritative, and exuberant look at this modern American obsession. Ideal for the food scholar and food enthusiast alike, it is equally appetizing for anyone fascinated by Americana, capturing our culture and history through what we love most--food! Building on the highly praised and deliciously browseable two-volume compendium the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, this new work serves up everything you could ever want to know about American consumables and their impact on popular culture and the culinary world. Within its pages for example, we learn that Lifesavers candy owes its success to the canny marketing idea of placing the original flavor, mint, next to cash registers at bars. Patrons who bought them to mask the smell of alcohol on their breath before heading home soon found they were just as tasty sober and the company began producing other flavors. Edited by Andrew Smith, a writer and lecturer on culinary history, the Companion serves up more than just trivia however, including hundreds of entries on fast food, celebrity chefs, fish, sandwiches, regional and ethnic cuisine, food science, and historical food traditions. It also dispels a few commonly held myths. Veganism, isn't simply the practice of a few \\"hippies,\\" but is in fact wide-spread among elite athletic circles. Many of the top competitors in the Ironman and Ultramarathon events go even further, avoiding all animal products by following a strictly vegan diet. Anyone hungering to know what our nation has been cooking and eating for the last three centuries should own the Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GZVweuXhZlkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jazz Essentials: Nuts and Bolts Instruction for the Jazz and Pop Musician","description":"In music, students are often force-fed scales, without ever really being told why these scales are important.

This memoir was written by one of the three sons who sang with them. It focuses not only upon family singers that became famous on popular radio but also upon American gospel music. Although neglected by scholars and historians, it is loved by aficionados and is cherished by many devoted Christians everywhere. Here, in a frank, objective narrative Kenneth M. Johnson looks back on his singing days and details both the successes and struggles the Johnsons experienced during the years when their stirring music filled the air. He discusses what occurred behind the scenes and on the road to stardom. He tells how children who grew up in a singing family managed school life and how they balanced their social development with entertainment schedules. He gives details of the stresses that fame placed on family life, especially on his parents' troubled marriage, and of their survival through their love of gospel song. He speaks of humble beginnings, of the illegitimacy of family members, of legal problems, and of the heart-felt hymns that propelled the Johnsons onward and were their mainstay. On many Sabbaths CBS radio broadcast their program. Listeners getting ready for services were likely to hear the familiar litany: \\"Each Sunday morning at this time Columbia presents fifteen minutes of hymns and sacred songs with the Johnson Family Singers... a father, mother, and four children. Southern-born, steeped in the tradition of the Deep South, the Johnson Family Singers bring to the well-beloved, familiar songs of Christian people everywhere a sweetness and simplicity of interpretation.\\" Told with remarkable candor, We Sang for Our Supper recounts the public and the private life of the gospel group touted on the airwaves as \\"one of America's foremost singing families.\\" Kenneth M. Johnson is a retired United Methodist clergyman living at Lake Junaluska, North Carolina.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6ZEZAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Johnson+Family+Singers:+We+Sang+for+Our+Supper+(American+Made+Music+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snakehead: A Fish out of Water","description":"In this mix of memoir, essay and nature writing, Wong Yoon Wah evokes the beauty and seduction of the tropical rainforest and rubber plantations of his childhood in Malaya.

At the age of 34, John Pollack quit a prestigious speechwriting job on Capitol Hill to pursue an idea he had harbored since the age of six: to build a boat out of wine corks and take it on an epic journey. In Cork Boat, Pollack tells the charming and uplifting story of this unlikely adventure. Overcoming one obstacle after another, he convinces skeptical bartenders to save corks, corrals a brilliant but disorganized partner, and cajoles more than a hundred volunteers to help build the boat, many until their fingers bleed. Hired as a speechwriter for President Clinton midway through construction, Pollack soon has the White House saving corks, too. Ultimately, he and his crew set sail down the Douro River in Portugal, where the boat becomes a national sensation. Written with unusual grace and disarming humor, Cork Boat is a buoyant tale of camaraderie, determination, and the power of imagination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HsQ9BHss1hoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italian Grammar in Practice, Exercises, Theory and Grammar (Italian and English Edition)","description":"\\"A book for English-speaking students who want to practice Italian grammar in a complete and successful way.

And so young Martin sets out from the Wiltshire home of his supposed champion, the scheming architect Pecksniff, to seek his fortune in America. In depicting Martin's journey Dickens created many vividly realized figures, from Martin's optimistic manservant Mark Tapley to the drunken and corrupt private nurse Mrs Gamp. With its portrayal of greed, blackmail and murder, and its searing satire on America, Dickens's novel is a powerful and blackly comic story of hypocrisy and redemption.

Beloved for its unique lyrical style and musical language, his work stands as some of the most remarkable poetry of the past one hundred years. In Praise of Mortality is an artfully curated selection of poems from Sonnets to Orpheus and Duino Elegies that investigate the emotional and psychological impact of the industrial revolution, and meditate on themes of impermanence and the steady passage of time. Barrows, an award-winning poet herself, and Macy, a well-known spiritual teacher, bring to their translations a striking sensitivity to the subtle currents of the work, approaching the poems with a fresh perspective that highlights the delicacy of their craft and beauty. With a deep reverence for nature and a singular ability to embody the tenuous connection between the spiritual and material, Rilke's sonnets and elegies are a thoughtful antidote to the distractions, noise, and ever-increasing pace of the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wWF2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PAPER FOLDING","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jYWTzgEACAAJ&dq=PAPER+FOLDING&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Paragon: An Agatha Raisin Mystery","description":"She's practically perfect in every way!

Archaeologists investigating the prehistory of Chaco Canyon have long been impressed by its massive architecture, evidence of widespread trading activities, and ancient roadways that extended across the region. Research on Chaco Canyon today is focused on what the remains indicate about the social, political, and ideological organization of the Chacoan people. Communities with great houses located some distance away are of particular interest, because determining how and why peripheral areas became associated with the central canyon provides insight into the evolution of the Chacoan tradition. This volume brings together twelve chapters by archaeologists who suggest that the relationship between Chaco Canyon and outlying communities was not only complex but highly variable. Their new research reveals that the most distant groups may have simply appropriated Chacoan symbolism for influencing local social and political relationships, whereas many of the nearest communities appear to have interacted closely with the central canyon--perhaps even living there on a seasonal basis. The multifaceted approach taken by these authors provides different and refreshing perspectives on Chaco. Their contributions offer new insight into what a Chacoan community is and shed light on the nature of interactions among prehistoric communities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FfwoDkk77nkC&dq=Great+House+Communities+across+the+Chacoan+Landscape+(Anthropological+Papers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ethos Effect","description":"A military science fiction adventure from, L.

But there are now signs - argues Gilles Lipovetsky, one of the most original social thinkers in France today - that we've entered a new phase of 'hypermodernity', characterized by hyper-consumption and the hypermodern individual. Hyperconsumption is a consumption which absorbs and integrates more and more spheres of social life and which encourages individuals to consume for their own personal pleasure rather than to enhance their social status. Hypermodernity is a society characterized by movement, fluidity and flexibility, distanced more than ever from the great structuring principles of modernity. And the hypermodern individual, while oriented towards pleasure and hedonism, is also filled with the kind of tension and anxiety that comes from living in a world which has been stripped of tradition and which faces an uncertain future. Individuals are gnawed by anxiety; fear has superimposed itself on their pleasures, and anguish on their liberation. Everything worries and alarms them, and there are no longer any beliefs systems to which they can turn for assurance. These are hypermodern times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JdGFFTwHIdkC&dq=Hypermodern+Times+(Themes+for+the+21st+Century)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building PDA Databases for Wireless and Mobile Development","description":"Introduces the mobile databases (their architecture and features) and how they operate and handle the essential task of synchronization.

At the height of the Cold War, some of the nation s most precious secrets passed through a CIA contractor in Southern California. Only a handful of employees were cleared to handle the intelligence that came through the Black Vault. One of them was Christopher John Boyce, a hard-partying genius with a sky-high IQ, a passion for falconry, and little love for his country. Security at the Vault was so lax, Boyce couldn t help but be tempted. And when he gave in, the fate of the free world would hang in the balance. With the help of his best friend, Andrew Daulton Lee, a drug dealer with connections south of the border, Boyce began stealing classified documents and selling them to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. It was an audacious act of treason, committed by two spoiled young men who were nearly always drunk, stoned, or both and were about to find themselves caught in the middle of a fight between the CIA and the KGB. This Edgar Awardwinning book was the inspiration for the critically acclaimed film starring Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn a true story as thrilling as any dreamed up by Ian Fleming or John le Carr .

Peirce's theory of reasoning and signs based on an analysis of his system of Existential Graphs. At the dawn of modern logic, Charles S. Peirce invented two types of logical systems, one symbolic and the other graphical. In this book Sun-Joo Shin explores the philosophical roots of the birth of Peirce's Existential Graphs in his theory of representation and logical notation. Shin demonstrates that Peirce is the first philosopher to lay a solid philosophical foundation for multimodal representation systems. Shin analyzes Peirce's well-known, but much-criticized nonsymbolic representation system. She presents a new approach to his graphical system based on her discovery of its unique nature and on a reconstruction of Peirce's theory of representation. By seeking to understand graphical systems on their own terms, she uncovers the reasons why graphical systems, and Existential Graphs in particular, have been underappreciated among logicians. Drawing on perspectives from the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, logic, and computer science, Shin provides evidence for a genuinely interdisciplinary project on multimodal reasoning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VkKSJUtbGnYC&dq=The+Iconic+Logic+of+Peirce%27s+Graphs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rogues Gallery: A Compendium of Non-Player Characters (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VaQpAQAAIAAJ&dq=Rogues+Gallery:+A+Compendium+of+Non-Player+Characters+(Advanced+Dungeons+and+Dragons)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Foreign Language Classroom: Bridging Theory and Practice (Source Books on Education)","description":"First published in 1995.

In this companion volume to his acclaimed Juran on Planning for Quality, J.M. Juran provides top-level managers with the specific, field-tested methods they need to successfully lead their companies on the quest for superior quality. Managers have long recognized that the most sound response to a competitive challenge is to become more competitive. Today, informed managers also realize that quality improvement is the best source of competitive advantage. They know that return on investment in quality improvement projects is among the highest available. Yet, the means by which management can supply the leadership necessary to attain quality goals remains elusive. J.M. Juran has drawn on the experiences of thousands of chief executives in companies around the world to create a clear plan of action applicable to any industry, whether service or manufacturing. The famous \\"Juran Trilogy,\\" clearly presented step-by-step, shows how to apply the familiar business concepts of planning, control, and improvement to quality leadership. For each concept, Dr. Juran provides a succinct and proven series of actions. He gives criteria for selecting project-by-project improvements and mobilizing a team to carry them out. He also describes a realistic timetable of implementation and directs the formation of an ongoing quality council whose job is to launch, coordinate, and \\"institutionalize\\" annual quality improvement. The membership of this council, as Dr. Juran insists, must come from the ranks of senior managers; the stakes are too high for upper managers not to personally become the leaders and members of this vital council. Using real-world case examples of highly profitable quality improvements in such companies as Bethlehem Steel and Florida Power & Light, Dr. Juran illustrates how to guide a company into a continuing steep rate of improvement. The key, as Dr. Juran emphasizes, is that quality must be implemented from the top down. This essential handbook makes executive leadership the key to a company's quality revolution -- and to producing the real cost benefits over both the short and long run that superior quality brings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_30uNnb6dQIC&dq=Juran+on+Leadership+for+Quality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Facing the Music","description":"Ten stories confront the dark side of human life as characters are challenged by crisis and pathology, including how a couple faces the disfigurement of cancer in the bedroom, the rationalizations of a wife beater, or the mind of a teenage killer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ur6wAAAAIAAJ&dq=Facing+the+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drawing Landscapes in Pencil (Practical Art Books)","description":"Originally published by Watson-Guptill Publications, 1979.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QSwyjwEACAAJ&dq=Drawing+Landscapes+in+Pencil+(Practical+Art+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexy Voice and Robo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9r2MAAAACAAJ&dq=Sexy+Voice+and+Robo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep Learning","description":"Take a deep dive into deep learning Deep learning provides the means for discerning patterns in the data that drive online business and social media outlets.

A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep. Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside. Then she meets Michael Hosea, a man who seeks his Father s heart in everything. Michael obeys God s call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel s every bitter expectation, until despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw. But with her unexpected softening comes overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. Back to the darkness, away from her husband s pursuing love, terrified of the truth she no longer can deny: her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael does . . . the One who will never let her go.

Born in Constantinople in 331 or 332, Julian was raised as a Christian, but apostatized, and during his short reign tried to revive paganism, which, after the conversion to Christianity of his uncle Constantine the Great early in the fourth century, began losing ground at an accelerating pace. Having become an orphan when he was still very young, Julian was taken care of by his cousin Constantius II, one of Constantine's sons, who permitted him to study rhetoric and philosophy and even made him co-emperor in 355. But the relations between Julian and Constantius were strained from the beginning, and it was only Constantius' sudden death in 361 which prevented an impending civil war. As sole emperor, Julian restored the worship of the traditional gods. He opened pagan temples again, reintroduced animal sacrifices, and propagated paganism through both the spoken and the written word. In his treatise Against the Galilaeans he sharply criticised the religion of the followers of Jesus whom he disparagingly called 'Galilaeans'. He put his words into action, and issued laws which were displeasing to Christians--the most notorious being his School Edict. This provoked the anger of the Christians, who reacted fiercely, and accused Julian of being a persecutor like his predecessors Nero, Decius, and Diocletian. Violent conflicts between pagans and Christians made themselves felt all over the empire. It is disputed whether or not Julian himself was behind such outbursts. Accusations against the Apostate continued to be uttered even after the emperor's early death. In this book, the feasibility of such charges is examined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=scDXDQAAQBAJ&dq=Julian+the+Apostate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lambs of God","description":"Three devout nuns living in a crumbling monastery on a remote island are simultaneously attracted to and resentful of an ambitious priest who arrives to survey their land for the site of a spa for the wealthy","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kBc4Ic9VfysC&dq=Lambs+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Sexuality-Ancient Egyptian Tantric Yoga","description":"SACRED SEXUALITY: EGYPTIAN TANTRA YOGA: The Art of Sex Sublimation and Universal Consciousness This Volume will expand on the male and female principles within the human body and in the universe and further detail the sublimation of sexual energy into spiritual energy.

In their interpretation of the tale, they move back and forth between internal and external issues -- from how feminine and masculine parts of persons fit or do not fit together to how individuals conduct their lives with those of the same and opposite sexes, how they conflict, compete, or join harmoniously. After considering this rarely discussed human emotion, the authors focus on the nature of goodness as it surfaces in the envy experience. They reflect on its abundance, ability to unite disparate parts, its abiding presence, and its joy, then conclude with a glossary of terms and a brief review of the psychological literature on envy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1qMPyU3lb4sC&dq=CINDERELLA+AND+HER+SISTERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color-Blend Applique","description":"Now even beginners can reach a new level of beauty and sophistication in floral appliqu .

In Tales from the Underground, Cornell ecologist David Wolfe takes us on a tour through current scientific knowledge of the subterranean world. We follow the progress of discovery from Charles Darwin's experiments with earthworms, to Lewis and Clark's first encounter with prairie dogs, to the use of new genetic tools that are revealing an astonishingly rich ecosystem beneath our feet. Wolfe plunges us deep into the earth's rocky crust, where life may have begun-a world devoid of oxygen and light but safe from asteroid bombardment. Primitive microbes found there are turning our notion of the evolutionary tree of life on its head: amazingly, they represent perhaps a full third of earth's genetic diversity. As Wolfe explains, creatures of the soil can work for us, by providing important pharmaceuticals and recycling the essential elements of life, or against us, by spreading disease and contributing to global climate change. The future of our species may well depend on how we manage our living soil resources. Tales from the Underground will forever alter our appreciation of the natural world around-and beneath-us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mwc4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BILLY THE GREAT","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ap-jzgEACAAJ&dq=BILLY+THE+GREAT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranger in Paradise (A Carson Springs Novel)","description":"Three addictive novels of romance and suspense in a small California town from the New York Timesbestselling author of The Diary and Garden of Lies.

But there are now signs - argues Gilles Lipovetsky, one of the most original social thinkers in France today - that we've entered a new phase of 'hypermodernity', characterized by hyper-consumption and the hypermodern individual. Hyperconsumption is a consumption which absorbs and integrates more and more spheres of social life and which encourages individuals to consume for their own personal pleasure rather than to enhance their social status. Hypermodernity is a society characterized by movement, fluidity and flexibility, distanced more than ever from the great structuring principles of modernity. And the hypermodern individual, while oriented towards pleasure and hedonism, is also filled with the kind of tension and anxiety that comes from living in a world which has been stripped of tradition and which faces an uncertain future. Individuals are gnawed by anxiety; fear has superimposed itself on their pleasures, and anguish on their liberation. Everything worries and alarms them, and there are no longer any beliefs systems to which they can turn for assurance. These are hypermodern times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MOboNRqFsygC&dq=Hypermodern+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las nuevas finanzas en Mexico (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=B9HgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Las+nuevas+finanzas+en+Mexico+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddhism and Psychotherapy","description":"The very first systematic work on Buddhist Psychotherapy integrating psychological, medical and psychosomatic knowledge of Western culture, including largely unknown Buddhist practices.

The child's preoccupation with creating unusual sandwiches distracts him from the constant abuse Miss. Ma'am endures.

Though discounted by all, the child's singular skill that earns everyone's tolerance is an extraordinary ability to produce exquisite sandwiches, a talent which earns him the title, The Sandwich Man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wti-jgEACAAJ&dq=The+sandwich+man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baja Adventure Book","description":"Rather than simply recycling readily available tourist information, The Baja Adventure Book makes many original contributions to the knowledge about the peninsula.

Between 1998 and 2003, reported cybersecurity incidents increased over thirty-fold. Well-publicized information security breaches have made cybersecurity a critical and timely topic for the general public, as well as for corporations, not-for-profit organizations and the government. As a result, organizations need to be able to make the business case for spending the right amount on cybersecurity. They also need to know how to efficiently allocate these funds to specific cybersecurity activities. Managing Cybersecurity Resources is the first book to specifically focus on providing a framework for understanding how to use economic and financial management tools in helping to address these important issues. The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Series draws on frontline government, military, and business experts to detail what individuals and businesses can and must do to understand and move forward in this challenging new environment. Books in this timely and noteworthy series will cover everything from the balance between freedom and safety to strategies for protection of intellectual, business, and personal property to structures and goals of terrorist groups including Al-Qaeda.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KkxiQgAACAAJ&dq=Managing+Cybersecurity+Resources:+A+Cost-Benefit+Analysis+(The+Mcgraw-Hill+Homeland+Security+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Person From England And Other Travellers, A","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_xcrAAAAIAAJ&dq=Person+From+England+And+Other+Travellers,+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gardener's Year","description":"A lighthearted mock-treatise reflects upon the pains and rewards of tending a small garden plot. \\"This very entertaining volume with its delightfully humorous pictures should be read by all gardeners.\\"   Nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pTAnDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Gardener%27s+Year&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bouzi","description":"A Generation X love story starring Bouzi and Jesse, she searching for love, he trying to make it as a poet-performer.

Providing a unique and invaluable antidote to the efforts by agribusiness to obscure and disconnect us from the truth about industrialized foods, it demostrates that industrial food production is indeed a \\"fatal harvest\\"--fatal to consumers, fatal to our landscapes, fatal to genetic diversity, and fatal to our farm communities. As it exposes the ecological and social impacts of industrial agriculture's fatal harvest, Fatal Harvest details a new ecological and humane vision for agriculture. It shows how millions of people are engaged in the new politics of food as they work to develop a better alternative to the current chemically fed and biotechnology-driven system.

They tugged huge cameras with heavy glass plates over rugged, unfamiliar terrain. Interspersed throughout the book are passages from significant texts and travelers' diaries, observations and opinions that echo and illuminate the images.

The book examines well-known images such as William Hogarth's Gin Lane (1751), as well as lesser-known artworks including Alfred Priest's painting Cocaine (1919), in order to demonstrate how visual culture was both informed by, and contributed to, discourses of addiction in the period between 1751 and 1919. Through her analysis of more than 30 images, Julia Skelly deconstructs beliefs and stereotypes related to addicted individuals that remain entrenched in the popular imagination today. Drawing upon both feminist and queer methodologies, as well as upon extensive archival research, Addiction and British Visual Culture, 1751-1919 investigates and problematizes the long-held belief that addiction is legible from the body, thus positioning visual images as unreliable sources in attempts to identify alcoholics and drug addicts. Examining paintings, graphic satire, photographs, advertisements and architectural sites, Skelly explores such issues as ongoing anxieties about maternal drinking; the punishment and confinement of addicted individuals; the mobility of female alcoholics through the streets and spaces of nineteenth-century London; and soldiers' use of addictive substances such as cocaine and tobacco to cope with traumatic memories following the First World War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kikxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Visual+Addiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimating Probabilities of Extreme Floods: Methods and Recommended Research","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7ddRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Estimating+Probabilities+of+Extreme+Floods:+Methods+and+Recommended+Research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spiritual Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mzzQwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Spiritual+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Context and Culture in Language Teaching (Oxford Applied Linguistics)","description":"This is an attempt to redraw the boundaries of foreign language study.

While ostensibly purporting to be a history of that much derided (though currently fashionable) four-letter word, 'folk', Electric Eden will be a magnificent survey of the visionary, topographic and esoteric impulses that have driven the margins of British visionary folk music from Vaughan Williams and Holst to The Incredible String Band, Nick Drake, John Martyn and Aphex Twin. For the first time the full story of the extraordinary period of folk rock from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s will be told in a book with the breadth of a social history touching on sonic worship, pagan architecture, land art, ley lines and ther outer fringes of the avant garde. Electric Eden identifies a particularly English wellspring of imagery and imagination, an undercurrent that has fed into the creative and organic strand of Britain's music over the past century. From Edwardian composers assimilations of folk song and visionary poetry, via folk rock of the 60s and 70s, the story is brought up to date by placing these earlier movements in a continuum that links through significant figures in 21st century pastoral electronica.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mVyciqrCR2AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unceasing Prayer: A Beginner's Guide","description":"A guide for busy Christians offers practical, realistic examples for recalling God's presence often throughout the day, showing how to connect such simple acts as dressing and commuting to prayer.

What are the horizons? What are the political implications? John Pemberton explores these questions in this far-reaching ethnographic and historical interpretation of cultural discourse in Indonesia since 1965. Pemberton considers in particular how the appearance of order under Soeharto's repressive New Order regime is an effect of an enigmatic politics founded upon routine appeals to cultural values. Through a richly textured ethnographic account of events ranging from national elections to weddings, Pemberton simultaneously elucidates and disturbs the contours of the New Order cultural imaginary. He pursues the fugitive signs of circumstances that might resist the powers of New Order rule through unexpected village practices, among graveyard spirits, and within ascetic refuges. Key to this study is a reexamination of the historical conditions under which a discourse of culture emerges. Providing a close reading of a number of Central Javanese manuscripts from the late eighteenth century on, Pemberton outlines the conditions of knowledge formation in Indonesia since the beginning of Dutch colonial control. As he overturns common assumptions concerning colonial encounters, he discloses the gradual emergence in these texts of a discursive figure inscribed in contrast to the increasingly invasive presence of the Dutch: a figuration of difference that came to be called \\"Java.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EpJlDwAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+Subject+of+%22Java%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abortion's second victim","description":"This dissertation examines the development and consequences of what I call women-centered strategies within the prolife movement in the United States. While this movement has been characterized as a religious movement devoted to the rights of the unborn, I argue that since the early 1980s an important faction within the movement has contended that women, as well as the unborn, are victims of abortion. Drawing on textual analysis and interviews, I trace the rise of attempts to restrict access to abortion based on the claim that abortions are harmful to women who have them. The use of women-centered strategies has three consequences. First, the argument that abortion harms women has shaped scientific inquiry. Antiabortion organizations claim that abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and various mental disorders. However, these claims have been disputed by scientists and scientific institutions. Comparing the controversy over breast cancer risk with that over mental health outcomes, I show that researchers who are critical of abortion employ a range of tactics to prolong conflict and further politicize these scientific issues. Second, these strategies have led to new understandings of women who regret their abortions. These understandings are constructed within a network that includes women who regret their abortion, prolife researchers, therapists, movement leaders, and mental health researchers. Finally, women-centered strategies have had a profound impact on the policies that regulate abortion care in the United States. By juxtaposing scientific claims alongside narratives of abortion's harm to women, prolife groups have developed a framework that resonates with policymakers and federal judges. This research makes significant contributions to science studies and studies of social movements. Analyses of the process by which scientific debates end typically focus on the mechanisms that foreclose further inquiry and exclude dissenting voices. My research demonstrates that these mechanisms work differently depending on the social context and can, in some cases, serve to continue rather than end controversy. Additionally, this work expands on previous studies of the construction of identity and role of expertise in social movements as well as the impact of framing on social movement success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=P_y3tAEACAAJ&dq=Abortion%27s+second+victim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riley songs of friendship","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

We have also come to know Breslin as the cocky guy from Queens, New York, who speaks insolently to powerful people and institutions, his words always tinged with a healthy amount of unsentimental outer-borough humor. Now, with a mix of sadness and anger, Breslin turns his sights on the Roman Catholic Church. After a lifetime of attending mass every Sunday, Breslin has severed his ties to the church he once loved, and, in this important book, filled with a fury generated by a sense of betrayal, he explains why. When the church sex scandals emerged relentlessly in recent years, and when it became apparent that these scandals had been covered up by the church hierarchy, Breslin found it impossible to reconcile his faith with this new reality. Ever the reporter, he visited many victims of molestation by priests and found lives in emotional chaos. He questioned the bishops and found an ossified clergy that has a sense of privilege and entitlement. Thus disillusioned with his church, though not with his faith, he writes about the loss of moral authority yet uses his trademark mordant humor to good effect. Breslin s righteous anger is put to use. Imagining a renewed church, along with practical solutions such as married priests and female priests, The Church That Forgot Christ also reminds us that Christ wore sandals, not gold vestments and rings, and that ultimately what the Catholic Church needs most is a healthy dose of Christianity. In that sense, Breslin has written a dark book that is full of hope and possibility. It is a book that only Jimmy Breslin could have written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zdQhngEACAAJ&dq=The+Church+That+Forgot+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pony Rider Boys in New Mexico, The; or, The End of the Silver Trail","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Immediately it produced two thirds of America s raw steel and thirty percent of the steel made worldwide. The behemoth company would go on to support the manufacturing superstructure of practically every other industry in America. It would create and sustain the economies of many industrial communities, especially Pittsburgh, employing more than a million people over the course of the century. A hundred years later, the U.S. Steel Group of USX makes scarcely ten percent of the steel in the United States and just over one and a half percent of global output. Far from the biggest, the company is now considered the most efficient steel producer in the world. What happened between then and now, and why, is the subject of Big Steel, the first comprehensive history of the company at the center of America s twentieth-century industrial life. Granted privileged and unprecedented access to the U.S. Steel archives, Kenneth Warren has sifted through a long, complex business history to tell a compelling story. Its preeminent size was supposed to confer many advantages to U.S. Steel economies of scale, monopolies of talent, etc. Yet in practice, many of those advantages proved illusory. Warren shows how, even in its early years, the company was out-maneuvered by smaller competitors and how, over the century, U.S. Steel s share of the industry, by every measure, steadily declined. Warren s subtle analysis of years of internal decision making reveals that the company s size and clumsy hierarchical structure made it uniquely difficult to direct and manage. He profiles the chairmen who grappled with this  lumbering giant,  paying particular attention to those who long ago created its enduring corporate culture Charles M. Schwab, Elbert H. Gary, and Myron C. Taylor. Warren points to the way U.S. Steel s dominating size exposed it to public scrutiny and government oversight a cautionary force. He analyzes the ways that labor relations affected company management and strategy. And he demonstrates how U.S. Steel suffered gradually, steadily, from its paradoxical ability to make high profits while failing to keep pace with the best practices. Only after the drastic pruning late in the century when U.S. Steel reduced its capacity by two-thirds did the company become a world leader in steel-making efficiency, rather than merely in size. These lessons, drawn from the history of an extraordinary company, will enrich the scholarship of industry and inform the practice of business in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ixYEjoykrhYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Electricity and Electronics","description":"This book provides an overview of the basics of electrical and electronic engineering that are required at the undergraduate level.

Grief-stricken and further distressed by her mother-in-law's unannounced visit, Torie is dumbstruck when she learns that Sylvia has left all of her worldly possessions to Torie including the Gaheimer House, which houses the local historical society. With gigantic boxes of artifacts and paperwork dating back to the 1920's to sort through, Torie is quite overwhelmed. But cleaning out Sylvia's things, she finds something strange: an old postcard from the late twenties, addressed to Sylvia, with a photograph of a little girl on the front and an ominous message on the back. Torie quickly becomes determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious photograph. Who is the little girl? And where was the photograph taken? Unable to make sense of her discovery, Torie's suspicions deepen when she learns that Sylvia hired a private detective and installed a security system just prior to her death.

In Righteous Propagation, Michele Mitchell examines the reproductive implications of racial destiny, demonstrating how it forcefully linked particular visions of gender, conduct, and sexuality to collective well-being. Mitchell argues that while African Americans did not agree on specific ways to bolster their collective prospects, ideas about racial destiny and progress generally shifted from outward-looking remedies such as emigration to inward-focused debates about intraracial relationships, thereby politicizing the most private aspects of black life and spurring race activists to calcify gender roles, monitor intraracial sexual practices, and promote moral purity. Examining the ideas of well-known elite reformers such as Mary Church Terrell and W. E. B. DuBois, as well as unknown members of the working and aspiring classes, such as James Dubose and Josie Briggs Hall, Mitchell reinterprets black protest and politics and recasts the way we think about black sexuality and progress after Reconstruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lE7qCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Dollmaker%27s+Workbook:+Children+Dolls+(Volume+2:+French+Dolls)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sentient Advantage","description":"The Sentient Advantage is pure engaging, entertaining, and stimulating science fiction.

Violent government coups are almost annual events and it's difficult for a child to understand what's going on or who to believe. The need for secrecy means Lina cannot tell her best friend that they are just waiting for the right moment to flee. It is the 1960s and Lina is part of the dwindling Jewish community... Mona Yahia was born in Baghdad in 1954 and escaped with her family to Israel in 1970. In 1985 she moved to Germany to study fine arts and has remained there ever since. Winner of the Jewish Quarterly Wingate Prize for Fiction 2001 'Yahia rolls Baghdad around her tongue, savouring its suks, smells, and sweetmeats (reading her makes one hungry). This is a truly exotic novel, but it's also a coming-of-age work in which the almost imperceptible transformation from childhood to adolescence is saltily observed and never sentimentalised. Yahia's prose courses with insight and wit. Her deftness of touch means that, despite its subject-matter, this novel never becomes a bleak tale of religious persecution, but remains a fresh story about adolescent experience in adversity - with parallels in the most unlikely places.' Anne Karpf, The Guardian 'The novel powerfully conveys the author's outrage, as well as her nostalgia for her native land.' The Times 'Yahia's writing evokes both the sensuality of domestic intimacy...alongside the horror of public hangings...When the Grey Beetles Took Over Baghdad is most politically sophisticated, and also most poignant, when it explores questions of language and identity.'

Works thought to be merely \\"escapist\\" can often be more seriously mined for revelations regarding the worlds they portray, especially those of the disenfranchised. As detective fiction has slowly earned critical respect, more authors from minority groups have chosen it as their medium. Chicana/o authors, previously reluctant to write in an underestimated genre that might further marginalize them, have only entered the world of detective fiction in the past two decades. In this book, the first comprehensive study of Chicano/a detective fiction, Ralph E. Rodriguez examines the recent contributions to the genre by writers such as Rudolfo Anaya, Lucha Corpi, Rolando Hinojosa, Michael Nava, and Manuel Ramos. Their works reveal the struggles of Chicanas/os with feminism, homosexuality, familia, masculinity, mysticism, the nationalist subject, and U.S.-Mexico border relations. He maintains that their novels register crucial new discourses of identity, politics, and cultural citizenship that cannot be understood apart from the historical instability following the demise of the nationalist politics of the Chicana/o movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In contrast to that time, when Chicanas/os sought a unified Chicano identity in order to effect social change, the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s have seen a disengagement from these nationalist politics and a new trend toward a heterogeneous sense of self. The detective novel and its traditional focus on questions of knowledge and identity turned out to be the perfect medium in which to examine this new self.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XRXUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gender and the Poetics of Excess: Moments of Brocade","description":"The argument posed in this analysis is that the poetic excesses of several major female poets, excesses that have been typically regarded as flaws in their work, are strategies for escaping the inhibiting and sometimes inimical conventions too often imposed on women writers. The forms of excess vary with each poet, but by conceiving of poetic excess in relation to literary decorum, this study establishes a shared motivation for such a strategy. Literary decorum is one instrument a culture employs to constrain its writers. Perhaps it is the most effective because it is the least definable. The excesses discussed here, like the criteria of decorum against which they are perceived, cannot be itemized as an immutable set of traits. Though decorum and excess shift over time and in different cultures, their relationship to one another remains strikingly stable. Thus, nineteenth-century standards for women's writing and late twentieth-century standards bear almost no relation. Emily Dickinson's do not anticipate Gertrude Stein's or Sylvia Plath's or Jayne Cortez's or Ntozake Shange's. Yet the charges of indecorousness leveled at these women poets repeat a fixed set of abstract grievances. Dickinson, Stein, Plath, Cortez, and Shange all engage in a poetics of excess as a means of rejecting the limitations and conventions of \\"female writing\\" that the larger culture imposes on them. In resisting conventions for feminine writing, these poets developed radical new poetries, yet their work was typically criticized or dismissed as excessive. Thus, Dickinson's form is classified as hysterical and her figures tortured. Stein's works are called repetitive and nonsensical. Plath's tone is accused of being at once virulent and confessional, Cortez's poems violent and vulgar, Shange's work vengeful and self-righteous. The publishing history of these poets demonstrates both the opposition to such an aesthetic and the necessity for it.

In Battling Pornography, Carolyn Bronstein locates the origins of anti-pornography sentiment in the turbulent social and cultural history of the late 1960s and 1970s. Based on extensive original archival research, the book reveals that the seeds of the movement were planted by groups who protested the proliferation of advertisements, Hollywood films and other mainstream media that glorified sexual violence. Over time, feminist leaders redirected the emphasis from violence to pornography to leverage rhetorical power. Battling Pornography presents a fascinating account of the rise and fall of this significant American social movement and documents the contributions of influential activists on both sides of the pornography debate, including some of the best-known American feminists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYheMTwz2qIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deconstructing the Mind (Philosophy of Mind Series)","description":"During the past two decades, debates over the viability of commonsense psychology have occupied center stage in both cognitive science and the philosophy of mind. A group of prominent philosophers known as eliminativists argue that advances in cognitive science and neuroscience will ultimately justify a rejection of our folk theory of mind because it gives a radically mistaken account of mental life. In Deconstructing the Mind, distinguished philosopher Stephen Stich, once a leading advocate of eliminativism, offers a bold and compelling reassessment of this view. The book opens with a groundbreaking multi-part essay in which Stich maintains that even if the sciences develop in the ways that eliminativists foresee, none of the arguments for ontological elimination are tenable. Succeeding essays explore folk psychology in more detail, develop a systematic critique of simulation theory, and counter widespread concern about naturalizing psychological properties.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hbcsiGdZ0V0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optimizing R & D working order with dynamic programming","description":"Financial Risk Modelling and Portfolio Optimization with R, 2nd Edition Bernhard Pfaff, Invesco Global Asset Allocation, Germany A must have text for risk modelling and portfolio optimization using R.

In his latest book, Vaclav Smil tells the story of the Earth's biosphere from its origins to its near and long-term future. He explains the workings of its parts and what is known about their interactions. With essay-like flair, he examines the biosphere's physics, chemistry, biology, geology, oceanography, energy, climatology, and ecology, as well as the changes caused by human activity. He provides both the basics of the story and surprising asides illustrating critical but often neglected aspects of biospheric complexity. Smil begins with a history of the modern idea of the biosphere, focusing on the development of the concept by Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky. He explores the probability of life elsewhere in the universe, life's evolution and metabolism, and the biosphere's extent, mass, productivity, and grand-scale organization. Smil offers fresh approaches to such well-known phenomena as solar radiation and plate tectonics and introduces lesser-known topics such as the quarter-power scaling of animal and plant metabolism across body sizes and metabolic pathways. He also examines two sets of fundamental relationships that have profoundly influenced the evolution of life and the persistence of the biosphere: symbiosis and the role of life's complexity as a determinant of biomass productivity and resilience. And he voices concern about the future course of human-caused global environmental change, which could compromise the biosphere's integrity and threaten the survival of modern civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8ntHWPMUgpMC&dq=The+Earth%27s+Biosphere:+Evolution,+Dynamics,+and+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HOME DIETITIAN'S COOK BOOK - 1938 6th edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r0cWAQAAIAAJ&dq=THE+HOME+DIETITIAN%27S+COOK+BOOK+-+1938+6th+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tight Rope","description":"The next night, she went to another bar that has live bands.

As his reputation grew, so did his public displays, both artistic and otherwise: he clearly prefigured Warhol and the decade of the sixties.

Balancing homework with her duties as the one chosen to rid the Earth of evil forces sometimes puts a crimp in Buffy's social life, but she manages. That the buff high schooler can annihilate vampires and other monsters while remaining fashionably dressed and cutely dressed illustrates the dichotomy that is Buffy. In this companion guide Kathleen Tracy covers all aspects of the Buffy phenomena--from the 1992 feature film starring Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry, to the development and production of the hit TV series starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. Based on interviews with the show's creator, producers and principal cast members, the book includes cast biographies, critical summaries of each episode, trivia, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and more.

Een korte vakantie kan worden verstoord door een panter op zoek naar voedsel, of door een geheime seksuele uitspatting. De verhalen in Florida worden bevolkt door een stel door hun ouders verlaten zusjes, een jongen die in alle eenzaamheid opgroeit, een rusteloos echtpaar, een dakloze vrouw en een onvergetelijk en terugkerend personage: een echtgenote en moeder in tweestrijd. De verhalen in deze bundel beschrijven uiteenlopende personages, stadjes, decennia (en soms zelfs eeuwen), maar Florida - met zijn landschap, klimaat, geschiedenis en unieke temperament - blijft altijd het middelpunt.

The central purpose of Islamists, including terrorists, is to impose such law in all Muslim lands, and then throughout the world in a new Caliphate. Despite its importance, this worldwide growth of extreme shari'a is under-documented and little understood. By a comparative study over the last twenty-five years of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Indonesia, this book shows its terrible effects on human rights, especially the status of women and religious freedom, of Muslims as well as religious minorities, and on democracy itself. It also shows that such laws are a direct threat to the American interest of advancing democracy and human rights, that the United States lacks a policy for dealing with the spread of extreme shari'a, and concludes with policy recommendations for the United States regarding specific countries confronting extreme shari'a.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tVJ7AAAAQBAJ&dq=Radical+Islam%27s+Rules:+The+Worldwide+Spread+of+Extreme+Sharia+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walking in Cornwall: A Poem for the Solstice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wRhMPwAACAAJ&dq=Walking+in+Cornwall:+A+Poem+for+the+Solstice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Amazing Mazes (Kumon's Practice Books)","description":"Promotes fundamental pencil-control and concentration skills through a sequence of incrementally challenging maze exercises that are designed with three-dimensional illustrations of towns, streets, parks and other familiar scenes.

While this book does not seek to present a comprehensive scientific and technical coverage of all aspects of the subject matter, it makes the issues, ideas, and language of environmental engineering accessible and understandable to the nontechnical reader. Improvements introduced in the fourth edition include a complete rewrite of the chapters dealing with risk assessment and ethics, the introduction of new theories of radiation damage, inclusion of environmental disasters like Chernobyl and Bhopal, and general updating of all the content, specifically that on radioactive waste. Since this book was first published in 1972, several generations of students have become environmentally aware and conscious of their responsibilities to the planet earth. Many of these environmental pioneers are now teaching in colleges and universities, and have in their classes students with the same sense of dedication and resolve that they themselves brought to the discipline. In those days, it was sometimes difficult to explain what indeed environmental science or engineering was, and why the development of these fields was so important to the future of the earth and to human civilization. Today there is no question that the human species has the capability of destroying its collective home, and that we have indeed taken major steps toward doing exactly that. And yet, while, a lot has changed in a generation, much has not. We still have air pollution; we still contaminate our water supplies; we still dispose of hazardous materials improperly; we still destroy natural habitats as if no other species mattered. And worst of all, we still continue to populate the earth at an alarming rate. There is still a need for this book, and for the college and university courses that use it as a text, and perhaps this need is more acute now than it was several decades ago. Although the battle to preserve the environment is still raging, some of the rules have changed. We now must take into account risk to humans, and be able to manipulate concepts of risk management. With increasing population, and fewer alternatives to waste disposal, this problem is intensified. Environmental laws have changed, and will no doubt continue to evolve. Attitudes toward the environment are often couched in what has become known as the environmental ethic. Finally, the environmental movement has become powerful politically, and environmentalism can be made to serve a political agenda. In revising this book, we have attempted to incorporate the evolving nature of environmental sciences and engineering by adding chapters as necessary and eliminating material that is less germane to today's students. We have nevertheless maintained the essential feature of this book -- to package the more important aspects of environmental engineering science and technology in an organized manner and present this mainly technical material to a nonengineering audience. This book has been used as a text in courses which require no prerequisites, although a high school knowledge of chemistry is important. A knowledge of college level algebra is also useful, but calculus is not required for the understanding of the technical and scientific concepts. We do not intend for this book to be scientifically and technically complete. In fact, many complex environmental problems have been simplified to the threshold of pain for many engineers and scientists. Our objective, however, is not to impress nontechnical students with the rigors and complexities of pollution control technology but rather to make some of the language and ideas of environmental engineering and science more understandable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zxn3TgTOxggC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Times of King John.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1PF9AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Life+and+Times+of+King+John.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Korea's fight for freedom (A series of reprints of Western Books on Korea)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=t_utSAAACAAJ&dq=Korea%27s+fight+for+freedom+(A+series+of+reprints+of+Western+Books+on+Korea)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructivism and the Technology of Instruction: A Conversation","description":"This book is about the implications of constructivism for instructional design practices, and more importantly, it is about a dialogue between instructional developers and learning theorists. Working with colleagues in each discipline, the editors were amazed to find a general lack of familiarity with each others' work. From an instructional design perspective, it seems that the practice of instructional design must be based on some conception of how people learn and what it means to learn. From a learning theory perspective, it seems obvious that the value of learning theory rests in the ability to predict the impact of alternative learning environments or instructional practices on what is learned. Thus the interchange of ideas between these disciplines is essential. As a consequence of both the information rich environment and the technological capability, business is seen moving away from a fixed curriculum and toward providing information and instruction when it is needed. These changes bring about a window of opportunity establishing a dialogue that will provide for a richer understanding of learning and the instructional environment required to achieve that learning. The editors hope that this book is the beginning of the conversation and that it will serve to spur continued conversation between those involved in learning theory and those involved in the design of instruction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4QhGjtkobIUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Crimes and Punishments","description":"Cesare Beccaria's influential Treatise on Crimes and Punishments is considered a foundational work in the field of criminology. Three major themes of the Enlightenment run through the Treatise: the idea that the social contract forms the moral and political basis of the work's reformist zeal; the idea that science supports a dispassionate and reasoned appeal for reforms; and the belief that progress is inextricably bound to science. All three provide the foundation for accepting Beccaria's proposals. It is virtually impossible to ascertain which of several versions of the Treatise that appeared during his lifetime best reflected Beccaria's thoughts. His use of many Enlightenment ideas also makes it difficult to interpret what he has written. While Enlightenment thinkers advocated free men and free minds, there was considerable disagreement as to how this might be achieved, except in the most general terms. The editors have based this translation on the 1984 Francioni text, the most exhaustive critical Italian edition of Dei delitti e delle pene. This edition is the last that Beccaria personally oversaw and revised. This translation includes an outstanding opening essay by the editors and is a welcome introduction to Beccaria and the beginnings of criminology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rK3kjwEACAAJ&dq=On+Crimes+and+Punishments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breakthrough: The Power of Conscious Conversation","description":"Teaches abou the insights needed to become a more effective communicator in our personal and professional lives","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eCQ5AAAACAAJ&dq=Breakthrough:+The+Power+of+Conscious+Conversation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Japanese Touch For Your Garden","description":"Horticultural Society Mar.04.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zFhEAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+Japanese+Touch+For+Your+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signing exact English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Gey7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Signing+exact+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mid-Oceanic Ridges: Mountains Below Sea Level","description":"Despite turbulent actions of plate tectonics, continents, which since the first cooling of the planet float on its substratum, are a geological record of the history of Earth. Since the existing oceans are geologically relatively young, they register the activity, the life of the Earth. They formed when a large supercontinent (Pangea) broke apart some 150 Ma ago. The mid-oceanic ridges are narrow belts of submarine mountains marking the boundaries between plates which are moving apart, with new oceanic crust being created at the same time. Under the continents oceanic crust is subducted. The ocean bottom is an ideal location to study recent geodynamic processes on Earth. Of special interest to the reader will be the combination of the most recent oceanographic data with ophiolites, representing fossil ocean crust, obducted onto the continents by tectonic processes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=81DwAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Mid-Oceanic+Ridges:+Mountains+Below+Sea+Level&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient-Future Evangelism: Making Your Church a Faith-Forming Community","description":"Why is the church a mile wide but only an inch deep?

Weaving together vivid portraits of lawyers and such judges as Thurgood Marshall and Earl Warren, sketches of numerous black children throughout history whose parents joined lawsuits against Jim Crow schools, and gripping courtroom drama scenes, Irons shows how the erosion of the Brown decision especially by the Court s rulings over the past three decades has led to the  resegregation  of public education in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GLQuN2Bz350C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections of the Rav: Lessons in Jewish Thought","description":"Rabbi Besdin's first volume of \\"reconstructions\\" of the thought of \\"the Rav,\\" Rabbi J.B.

For its size, the city of Buffalo, New York, possesses a remarkable number and variety of architectural masterpieces from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Adler and Sullivan's Prudential building, H. H. Richardson's massive Buffalo State Hospital, Richard Upjohn's Sr. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, five prairie houses by Frank Lloyd Wright, and building by Daniel Burnham, Albert Kahn, and the firms of McKim, Mead, and White, and Lockwood, Green and Company, among others. These structures by prominent \\"outsiders\\" served to spur the efforts of local architects, builders, and craftsmen, and all of them built within the context of the city-wide park and parkway system designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. In addition, the city and its environs exhibit representative works by more recent architects, among them Eero and Eliel Saarinen, Walther Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Paul Rudloph, Minoru Yamasaki, and the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Buffalo's rich architectural and planning heritage has attracted the attention of several prominent historians, capable of the challenge of evaluating its significance. Reyner Banham is one of the world's leading authorities on the theory and practice of architecture, and he has written extensively on design in the industrial age (and Buffalo's innovative manufacturing plants and grain elevators are important exemplars of such design). Charles Beveridge, whose essay covers the park and parkway system, is editor of the Olmsted papers at The American University. And Henry Russell Hitchcock is the dean of American architectural historians, and the organizer of a 1940 exhibition on Buffalo's built environment. Their essays are followed by seven sections that delineate the city's neighborhoods, each provided with a map, neighborhood history, and a full complement of photographs with descriptive building captions. An eighth section, \\"Lost Buffalo,\\" describes demolished buildings, chief among them Wright's great Larkin administration building, while the remaining sections venture out of town, exploring Erie and Niagara Counties, other parts of Western New York, and southern Ontario.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gAwO1bacaqIC&dq=Buffalo+Architecture:+A+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Treasure","description":"For the treasure seeker in us all comes a stunning new book by esteemed author-illustrator Elly MacKay.

Teachers typically sit and listen to an expert who advocates hands-on learning for students but puts little of this talk into practice during the training. This style of professional development is not only hypocritical but outdated and a disservice to professional educators. Teachers deserve better and can have what they need in a relatively inexpensive manner by being given time to maintain a vibrant connection between training and practice. Ongoing professional development fosters the kind of support teachers do not have within their traditional culture of isolation. Fiszer shows that teachers learn best through an ongoing professional development model that marks a cultural shift from one of traditional isolation to one befitting an educational practitioner. How Teachers Learn Best reveals whether or not teachers believe professional development components such as reflective dialogue and peer observation can positively impact their teaching. The literature emphasizes a laboratory-type setting where teachers recognize their environment as learning enriched rather than learning impoverished. This book provides an excellent starting point for the shift in structure from one-shot, atheorectical, passive professional development sessions to sustained, proactive, theory-based activities that are part of a culture of ongoing professional development.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UvlmSwAACAAJ&dq=How+Teachers+Learn+Best,+An+Ongoing+Professional+Development+Model&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Matter of Difference: Materialist Feminist Criticism of Shakespeare","description":"This lively volume investigates Shakespeare's plays in terms of the relations between material conditions of Renaissance culture and differences of gender, class, race, and erotic practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bCkgAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Matter+of+Difference:+Materialist+Feminist+Criticism+of+Shakespeare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powerpuff Girls Chapter Book #09: Frighty Night (Powerpuff Girls, Chaper Book)","description":"As leader of the Powerpuff Girls, Blossom begins to let the power go to her head, but her sisters know how to give her a reality check before it's too late.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QT2gGwAACAAJ&dq=Powerpuff+Girls+Chapter+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation Revealed","description":"Centuries before anyone could make sense of these fantastic warnings, the prophets declared that the mysteries of Revelation would not be understood until the Last Days.

MacDonald published seventy novels and more than five hundred short stories in his lifetime, he is remembered best for his Travis McGee series. He introduced McGee in 1964 with The Deep Blue Goodbye. With Travis McGee, MacDonald changed the pattern of the hardboiled private detectives who preceeded him. McGee has a social conscience, holds thoughtful conversations with his retired economist buddy Meyer, and worries about corporate greed, racism and the Florida ecolgoy in a long series whose brand recognition for the series the author cleverly advanced by inserting a color in every title. Merrill carefully builds a picture of a man who in unexpected ways epitomized the Horatio Alger sagas that comprised his strict father's secular bible. From a financially struggling childhood and a succession of drab nine-to-five occupations, MacDonald settled down to writing for a living (a lifestyle that would have horrified his father). He worked very hard and was rewarded with a more than decent livelihood.

Richard Danzig, former secretary of the navy The first major bioterror event in the United States-the anthrax attacks in October 2001-was a clarion call for scientists who work with  hot  agents to find ways of protecting civilian populations against biological weapons. In The Demon in the Freezer, his first nonfiction book since The Hot Zone, a #1 New York Times bestseller, Richard Preston takes us into the heart of Usamriid, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, once the headquarters of the U.S. biological weapons program and now the epicenter of national biodefense. Peter Jahrling, the top scientist at Usamriid, a wry virologist who cut his teeth on Ebola, one of the world s most lethal emerging viruses, has ORCON security clearance that gives him access to top secret information on bioweapons. His most urgent priority is to develop a drug that will take on smallpox-and win. Eradicated from the planet in 1979 in one of the great triumphs of modern science, the smallpox virus now resides, officially, in only two high-security freezers-at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and in Siberia, at a Russian virology institute called Vector. But the demon in the freezer has been set loose. It is almost certain that illegal stocks are in the possession of hostile states, including Iraq and North Korea. Jahrling is haunted by the thought that biologists in secret labs are using genetic engineering to create a new superpox virus, a smallpox resistant to all vaccines. Usamriid went into a state of Delta Alert on September 11 and activated its emergency response teams when the first anthrax letters were opened in New York and Washington, D.C. Preston reports, in unprecedented detail, on the government  s response to the attacks and takes us into the ongoing FBI investigation. His story is based on interviews with top-level FBI agents and with Dr. Steven Hatfill. Jahrling is leading a team of scientists doing controversial experiments with live smallpox virus at CDC. Preston takes us into the lab where Jahrling is reawakening smallpox and explains, with cool and devastating precision, what may be at stake if his last bold experiment fails.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EM1vvtPA1scC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graven Image","description":"From the archetypical story of Abraham smashing his father's household idols to God's commandment at Mount Sinai that \\"You shall have no other gods before Me,\\" the prohibition in Judaism against the worship of idols has been unyielding. Idolatry is conceived as the antithesis to the worship of the invisible, unnamed, and articulate God. The proscription against using images in worship sets Judaism, together with Islam, apart from all other religious systems. In Beyond the Graven Image, Lionel Kochan sets out to explain the reasons for this prohibition and to demonstrate how influential this image-ban has been in determining key aspects of Jewish thinking. The Jewish conceptions of holiness and symbolism, our relationship with God, and the role of memory in religion, he argues, as well as the preference for non- material arts such as music over visual modes of artistic expression within Judaism, have all been profoundly shaped by the prohibition against physical representations of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oOw8DAAAQBAJ&dq=Graven+Image&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under Cover: My Four Years in the Nazi Underworld of America- The Amazing Revelation of How Axis Agents and Our Enemies Within Are Now Plotting to Destroy the United States","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=40x6hxg51Y4C&dq=Under+Cover:+My+Four+Years+in+the+Nazi+Underworld+of+America-+The+Amazing+Revelation+of+How+Axis+Agents+and+Our+Enemies+Within+Are+Now+Plotting+to+Destroy+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iuz the Evil (AD&D;/Greyhawk Module WGR5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IYHCPAAACAAJ&dq=Iuz+the+Evil+(AD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alicia Silverstone (Real-Life Reader Biography)","description":"Recounts the life and career of the young actress who starred as Cher in the movie \\"Clueless.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3KWuTwHusHkC&dq=Alicia+Silverstone+(Real-Life+Reader+Biography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science and Medicine","description":"With more than 7,500 entries and over 165 illustrations, this dictionary of sports science covers anatomy, biomechanics, exercise physiology, nutrition, sports psychology and sports medicine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pO45AQAAIAAJ&dq=Oxford+Dictionary+of+Sports+Science+and+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Newfoundland English","description":"First published in 1982 to international acclaim, the Dictionary of Newfoundland English introduced the world to an incredibly rich dialect with deep roots in Ireland and the English West Country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&dq=Dictionary+of+Newfoundland+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something Tastes Funny","description":"A practical culinary primer for the novice cook presents more than one hundred easy-to-prepare recipes for desserts, appetizers, salads, breakfasts, snacks, and main courses, accompanied by humorous anecdotes about the art of cooking.

Rachel Swaby s no-nonsense and needed Headstrong dynamically profiles historically overlooked female visionaries in science, technology, engineering, and math.  Elle In 2013, the New York Times published an obituary for Yvonne Brill. It began:  She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job, and took eight years off from work to raise three children.  It wasn t until the second paragraph that readers discovered why the Times had devoted several hundred words to her life: Brill was a brilliant rocket scientist who invented a propulsion system to keep communications satellites in orbit, and had recently been awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Among the questions the obituary and consequent outcry prompted were, Who are the role models for today s female scientists, and where can we find the stories that cast them in their true light? Headstrong delivers a powerful, global, and engaging response. Covering Nobel Prize winners and major innovators, as well as lesser-known but hugely significant scientists who influence our every day, Rachel Swaby s vibrant profiles span centuries of courageous thinkers and illustrate how each one s ideas developed, from their first moment of scientific engagement through the research and discovery for which they re best known.

As the years turned these people invigorated different sectors in the world of railway enthusiasm--train spotting, railway modeling, collecting railway relics--and then, in response to widespread grief at main line steam traction's death, Britain's now-huge preserved railway industry. Today this industry finds itself riven by tensions between preserving a loved past which ever fewer people can remember and earning money from tourist visitors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ecweAQAAIAAJ&dq=Marigolds+Grow+Wild+on+Platforms+Pb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Words of Mercury","description":"A career-spanning anthology from the greatest traveler and travel writer of the twentieth century.

Wright takes us on a fascinating journey through ancient beliefs about life after death, from the shadowy figures who inhabit Homer's Hades, through Plato's hope for a blessed immortality, to the first century, where the Greek and Roman world (apart from the Jews) consistently denied any possibility of resurrection. We then examine ancient Jewish beliefs on the same subject, from the Bible to the Dead Sea Scrolls and beyond. This sets the scene for a full-scale examination of early Christian beliefs about resurrection in general and that of Jesus in particular, beginning with Paul and working through to the start of the third century. Wright looks at all the evidence, and asks: Why did the Christians agree with Jewish resurrection belief while introducing into it - across the board - significant modifications? To answer this question we come to the strange and evocative Easter stories in the gospels and asks whether they can have been late inventions. Wright seeks the best historical conclusions about the empty tomb and the belief that Jesus really did rise bodily from the dead, recognizing that it was this belief that caused early Christians to call Jesus 'Son of God'. In doing so, they posed a political challenge as well as a theological one. These challenges retain their power in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-V6pAwAAQBAJ&dq=Resurrection+of+the+Son+of+God+(Christian+Origins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable","description":"In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive.

Together with Apollinaire, he brought cubism to French poetry. Anais Nin hailed him as \\"one of France's best writers,\\" and the Village Voice called him \\"the Indiana Jones of French literature.\\"\\" \\"Translated into English for the first time, Sky, the last of Cendrar's four autobiographical volumes, weaves together a dazzling collage of prose poetry, travel writing, reportage, detective story, and personal memoir. \\"His life itself reads like the Arabian Nights Entertainment,\\" writes Henry Miller. In Sky Cendrars recounts his adventures in Russia during the revolution of 1905, in the trenches of World War I (where he lost his right arm), in Brazil in the 1920s, and behind the lines during World War II. The two wars run throughout as a unifying thread.\\" \\"As the title announces, this is a memoir of the sky - of Cendrars's love of birds, levitation, and aviation. The opening of the book finds Cendrars, the great adventurer and traveler, sailing back from Brazil to Paris with 250 multi-colored birds, hoping to bring at least one of them alive to a child he loves. The second part moves back and forth between the author's recollections of life as a war correspondent in 1940 and an encyclopedic discourse on levitation he wrote in search of a patron saint of aviation (perhaps as compensation for the death of his young son, Remy, who was a pilot during the war).\\" \\"With unmatched exuberance, Cendrars writes on poetry, myths, existentialism, his life in Paris between the wars with the painter Delaunay and the Dadaists, and his exotic adventures in Brazil. His anecdotes of Russia, where he was a jeweler's assistant, are compelling and funny. His fiercely imaginative stories, such as one about a Brazilian coffee plantation owner who, obsessed with his love for Sarah Bernhardt, retreats into the wilderness, are magical. Descriptions of birds, stars, and countryside are sheer poetry. For good reason, Henry Miller writes how Cendrars has knocked me cold.\\"\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

It has been recognized as the first modern detective story; Poe referred to it as one of his \\"tales of ratiocination\\". Two works that share some similarities predate Poe's stories, including \\"Das Fr?ulein von Scuderi\\" (1819) by E. T. A. Hoffmann and \\"Zadig\\" (1747) by Voltaire. C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women. Numerous witnesses heard a suspect, though no one agrees on what language was spoken. At the murder scene, Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human. As the first fictional detective, Poe's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives, including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Many later characters, for example, follow Poe's model of the brilliant detective, his personal friend who serves as narrator, and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it. Dupin himself reappears in \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog t\\" and \\"The Purloined Letter\\". \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog t\\", often subtitled \\"A Sequel to 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue'\\", is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe written in 1842. This is the first murder mystery based on the details of a real crime. It first appeared in \\"Snowden's Ladies' Companion\\" in three installments, November and December 1842 and February 1843. \\"The Purloined Letter\\" is a short story by American author Edgar Allan Poe. It is the third of his three detective stories featuring the fictional C. Auguste Dupin, the other two being \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" and \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog t\\". These stories are considered to be important early forerunners of the modern detective story. It first appeared in the literary annual The Gift for 1845 (1844) and was soon reprinted in numerous journals and newspapers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z69WCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel Talk","description":"Two popular authorities on angels present a seven-step method for communicating with the angels through writing in order to gain their love, understanding, and help with the trials of daily life. 50,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=scw98BFeLsoC&dq=Angel+Talk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BAUENTWURFSLEHRE: HANDBUCH FUR DEN BAUFACHMANN, BAUHERRN, LEHRENDEN UND LERNENDEN","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jrUBnwEACAAJ&dq=BAUENTWURFSLEHRE:+HANDBUCH+FUR+DEN+BAUFACHMANN,+BAUHERRN,+LEHRENDEN+UND+LERNENDEN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirituality Without God","description":"A guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology considers how to learn from the examples of religious sages and saints from a secular and philosophical perspective without formally committing to religion. 100,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4E0ADAAAQBAJ&dq=Spirituality+Without+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irrawaddy Tango","description":"In a novel that spans five decades, a tango-dancing Asian beauty rises from her close-knit village life and impulsively marries a powerful military man, who will become her country's dictator. 12,500 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wPhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Irrawaddy+Tango&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tracks in the Snow","description":"A little girl investigates tracks in the snow, trying to determine what could have made them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gp6YPwAACAAJ&dq=Tracks+in+the+Snow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Another mouse to feed","description":"When Mr. and Mrs. Mouse become exhausted from overwork, caring for their many children, the little mice decide to take over.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EahKPwAACAAJ&dq=Another+mouse+to+feed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Rationalization of Sight - with an Examination of Three Renaissance Texts on Perspective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W5YqcgAACAAJ&dq=On+the+Rationalization+of+Sight+-+with+an+Examination+of+Three+Renaissance+Texts+on+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady lawyer","description":"Woman Lawyer tells the story of Clara Foltz, the first woman admitted to the California Bar.

It details the practical and theoretical insights that these members of the Association of Science Teacher Educators (ASTE) earned from experiences ranging from periodic guest teaching to full-time engagement in the teaching role. Science Teacher Educators as K-12 Teachers shows science teacher educators as professionals engaged in reflective analysis of their beliefs about and experiences with teaching children or adolescents science. With their ideas about instruction and learning challenged, these educators became more aware of the circumstances today's teachers face. Their honest accounts reveal that through teaching children and adolescents, teacher educators can also renew themselves and expand their identities as well as their understanding of themselves in the profession and in relation to others. Science Teacher Educators as K-12 Teachers will appeal to all those with an interest in science education, from teacher educators to science teachers, as well as teacher educators in other disciplines.

Most of the subject's names in the books have become household words and so one can readily conclude that this category of writing has largely become the province of celebrities or well-known personages, the so-called rich and famous. .....There are a few who unabashedly attribute their success to fortuitous circumstances such as being in the right place at the right time or perhaps facetiously crediting the \\"Man Upstairs.\\" On the other hand, in many of these accounts amazing feats of derring-do have been conjured up by ghost writers who had been given a free hand, thus lending a new shade of meaning to the phrase, \\"creative writing.\\" .....This writer states that Nicholas J. Besker's story is literally the truth and nothing but the truth, that he had no need to resort to fiction. \\"Just the facts,\\" as Sgt. Friday would say. Not only was I an eye witness to these events but was also a fellow-victim for eight years. Fortunately, I was not numbered among the Beerinsky group, the bedwetters, and consequently escaped the inhumane treatment and humiliation of those unfortunates. .....Despite my statement verifying the authenticity of Besker's book, I can well understand if skeptics regarded Besker's account as a figment of imagination. I consider it is an illustration of the old adage that indeed, \\"truth is stranger than fiction.\\" Except for the grammatical violation in using the term, it might well be said that his description of life in this childrens' warehouse, aka orphan home, is most unique. .....The time, setting and circumstances of Nick's \\"sojourn\\" in the orphanage have long since been obliterated by the sands of time and, like much of the long-ago past, cannot be recreated or duplicated today. To begin with, the location of the orphanage. It was situated on the shores of Lake Michigan on several acres of otherwise clear land, and was one of six Catholic institutions clustered in loose fashion in an enclave of a square mile or more. .....This community was fenced off by brick walls, wire fencing and dirt roads. While access to outsiders was not rigidly controlled, it was unlikely that one would stray onto the premises of this \\"Forbidden City\\" unintentionally. These buildings within were cold and soot-encrusted. For all intents and purposes, they were as isolated as though patrolled by armed guards. There is little doubt that this absolute isolation and shielding from public scrutiny were major factors in developing the peculiar lifestyle and sadistic methods of discipline (torture) practiced by these \\"Brides of Christ.\\" .....This memoir book is an account of child abuse, oppression, bestiality, discrimination, humiliation and fear which was compounded and sugar-coated with religious gobbledegook and/or superstitions of the infallible Holy Mother Catholic Church. It held the same credibility and validity as that offered for the torturous abuse of the various Inquisitions, that indeed, \\"the end justifies the means.\\" .....By the time Nick was unceremoniously drummed off the premises of the orphanage into the realms of the unknown to wit, the normal but mysterious outside world, he was little more than a shell of a fifteen year old boy, a caricature. To all outside appearance, except for the clothes on his back, he was indistinguishable from any other teenager. However, the exterior was little more than camouflage, offering no clue to the confusion and disorientation raging inside. At fifteen years of age, he was inured to a robot-like state of lethargy, devoid of initiative, stripped of any self esteem and submissive to any vestige of authority. In a word, his entire physical and mental makeup was adapted to one environment, life in the orphanage.

The London Times called Raymond Carver \\"the American Chekhov.\\" The beloved, mischievous, but more modest short-story writer and poet thought of himself as \\"a lucky man\\" whose renunciation of alcohol allowed him to live \\"ten years longer than I or anyone expected.\\" In that last decade, Carver became the leading figure in a resurgence of the short story. Readers embraced his precise, sad, often funny and poignant tales of ordinary people and their troubles: poverty, drunkenness, embittered marriages, difficulties brought on by neglect rather than intent. Since Carver died in 1988 at age fifty, his legacy has been mythologized by admirers and tainted by controversy over a zealous editor s shaping of his first two story collections. Carol Sklenicka penetrates the myths and controversies. Her decade-long search of archives across the United States and her extensive interviews with Carver s relatives, friends, and colleagues have enabled her to write the definitive story of the iconic literary figure. Laced with the voices of people who knew Carver intimately, her biography offers a fresh appreciation of his work and an unbiased, vivid portrait of the writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MC08SVlepfkC&dq=A+Writer%27s+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Depression (SuDoc HE 1.1002:C 61/8/VIDEO)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Those Oldies but Goodies","description":"Follow this young adult when he is released from the California Youth Authority.

I don't give a damn how many books you've read or how many people you interview, even I can't convey to you what it was like! I was very close to them, and I was under a lot of pressure. But I was not even remotely in their league.\\" (A quote from Allistar Taylor from: The Beatles, A Celebration) The Beatle story is one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies in the literary sense of Oedipus Rex or Hamlet. There is a tragic inevitability about the events of the Beatles' rise and fall that places the story in the realm of great literature. Consider the Breakup: what the public knows -- the Official Version -- is not even in the same universe as what actually happened. The Beatles themselves confirm this and none of the biographies written about them go much deeper than old clippings. \\"Carry That Weight\\" is the story of what likely occurred among the Beatles. It is a weave of highly researched truth and fictitious dialogue. What was really going on during \\"Beatlemania?\\" No one really knows but the Beatles and they have kept the full truth under wraps. This is fiction offering the reader a look inside the enormously successful group. The story structure was researched to follow reality as based on accounts that are more credible. A rumor that began in the late 1960s regarding the death of Paul is part of the story adding to the dramatic element. No biographer fails to mention it and it is well known that the music of the Beatles contains many clues about his death. Examples in the music are numerous and spell-binding; especially when linked to the abundance of circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, the book is not an attempt to prove that he died and was replaced even though readers may be convinced at the end of the read but that is not our purpose. The novel begins with the death of John Lennon as its prolog. The story traces development of the Band members on their way to \\"Beatlemania.\\" The young Beatles grow up in a tumultuous environment of tough clubs, then fame and fortune. The struggle then grows to try to live normal lives and futile attempts are made among them to keep the global frenzy concerning them in perspective. Like Oedipus the Beatles had within them, even at the very beginning of their rise, the elements that would eventually lead to their downfall: their intelligence and willingness to puncture artifice -- the very characteristics that made them such carefree, brazen, and therefore appealing figures. The problems associated with enormous fame led Lennon to deep and angry disillusionment and our first and second McCartney to the edge of sanity. This resulted in Lennon's depression that finally found pause in the arms of Yoko, who the media characterizes as the Celestial Witch. McCartney's anomie and his solution for it drove a wedge between the Beatles that became their undoing. McCartney was unwilling to end the play-acting and the myth making. Attempts to shed the illusions gracefully failed miserably. After a swan song LP that glossed over the myth, they went their separate ways. The early days have the group playing in the tough clubs of Europe with the savage crowds and death following them to super stardom. The hell and orgies of the tours are described, Brian is the somewhat competent manager who is always being blackmailed and the Band forces him to quit signing them up for more tours. A disagreement as to what path the music should take and a change in life styles come to a drunken climax in the now famous Studio number 2 at Abbey Road.

When another dead body - that of a young woman - is discovered just a few days later, the pressure becomes almost unbearable. Two victims in less than a week should provide a host of clues, but all Jesse runs into are dead ends. But what may be the most disturbing aspect of these murders is the fact that no one seems to care-not a single one of Weeks's ex-wives, not the family of the girl. And when the medical examiner reveals a heartbreaking link between the two departed souls, the mystery only deepens. Despite Weeks's reputation and the girl's tender age, Jesse is hard-pressed to find legitimate suspects. Though the crimes are perhaps the most gruesome Jesse has ever witnessed, it is the malevolence behind them that makes them all the more frightening. Forced to delve into a world of stormy relationships, Jesse soon comes to realize that knowing who he can trust is indeed a matter of life and death. 'Robert B.

Along the way, he rebels against his conservative religious upbringing; befriends famous artists, writers, and philosophers (and becomes a poet himself ); is attacked for his practice of  the black arts ; and teaches that science and magick can work together. While seeking to spread his infamous philosophy of  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,  Crowley becomes one of the most notorious figures of his day.

He argues that the most common feature of contemporary ethical discourse is that much of it is used to express individual preferences, which leads to disagreements among philosophers, and eventually results in debates that are interminable in character. MacIntyre attributes the cause of this situation to the activities of the enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries who, in an attempt to find rational justification for morality repudiated those essential elements that define the essence of morality and give it its contents. Such elements include historical narrative, tradition, teleology, and divine law. In MacIntyres opinion, morality so constructed was destined for failure, since it was not founded on the true nature of the human person. The obvious consequences of this failure were the birth of diverse post-enlightenment ethical theories and a substantial change in the conception of virtue. In order to remedy this deplorable condition of contemporary ethics MacIntyre, along with other virtue ethicists, advocates a certain renaissance of ethical principles that are founded on the true nature of the human person, characterized by historical narrative, tradition, and teleology, all grounded on divine legislation. Morality thus reconstructed finds its fullest expression in the theory of human character traits, i.e. virtues. This is what has motivated MacIntyres construction of virtue theory, which has brought him into confrontation with the enlightenment philosophers. Our study and analysis of MacIntyres theory of virtue reveals that his account of virtue is inadequate. This inadequacy is what has motivated our own project of reconstructing MacIntyres theory of virtue in view of offering an account of virtue that is adequate. In this way our own project complements that of MacIntyre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TlkQDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British and Irish cooking: Traditional dishes prepared in a modern way (Round the world cooking library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pQdXAAAAMAAJ&dq=British+and+Irish+cooking:+Traditional+dishes+prepared+in+a+modern+way+(Round+the+world+cooking+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reclaiming Evolution (Routledge Advances in Social Economics)","description":"Howard Sherman and William M.

Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and paganism, while Roland s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.

But, social turmoil prevailed at the heart of her territories, led by an increasing number of dispossessed farmers, too little manpower for the army, and an inevitable conflict with the allies who had fought side by side with the Romans to establish Roman dominion. Storming the Heavens looks at this dramatic history from a variety of angles. What changed most radically, Santosuosso argues, was the behavior of soldiers in the Roman armies. The troops became the enemies within, their pillage and slaughter of fellow citizens indiscriminate, their loyalty not to the Republic but to their leaders, as long as they were ample providers of booty. By opening the military ranks to all, the new army abandoned its role as depository of the values of the upper classes and the propertied. Instead, it became an institution of the poor and drain on the power of the Empire. Santosuosso also investigates other topics, such as the monopoly of military power in the hands of a few, the connection between the armed forces and the cherished values of the state, the manipulation of the lower classes so that they would accept the view of life, control, and power dictated by the oligarchy, and the subjugation and dehumanization of subject peoples, whether they be Gauls, Britons, Germans, Africans, or even the Romans themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N__EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Usborne Book of Origami","description":"The Usborne Book of Origami shows how to master the art of paper folding, with handy tips and projects for such things as party hats, jewellery, jumping frogs and action models.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uqSTNAAACAAJ&dq=Usborne+Book+of+Origami&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pilot's Wife (Oprah's Book Club Selection Ser. )","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VOro0sfUCikC&dq=The+Pilot%27s+Wife+(Oprah%27s+Book+Club+Selection+Ser.+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Klondike stampede, ([19th century Amer. lit. & hist.

The perfect novel for anyone who has ever spent Saturday nights howling at the moon, looking for a mate. From the Publisher: It is rare to find a book about modern dating from a male point-of-view.

Our hero must differentiate the frogs in disguise--some with deadly poison in their sensuous bites--to find the real princess.

The grit and agility of Mia Hamm. The slam-dunk style of Lisa Leslie. The skill and finesse of these sports figures are widely admired, no longer causing the puzzlement and discomfort directed toward earlier generations of athletic women. Built to Win explores this relatively recent phenomenon--the confident, empowered female athletes found everywhere in American popular culture. Leslie Heywood and Shari L., Dworkin examine the role of female athletes through interviews with elementary- and high school-age girls and boys; careful readings of ad campaigns by Nike, Reebok, and others; discussions of movies like Fight Club and Girlfight; and explorations of their own sports experiences. They ask: what, if any, dissonance is there between popular images and the actual experiences of these athletes? Do these images really \\"redefine femininity\\" and contribute to a greater inclusion of all women in sport? Are sexualized images of these women damaging their quest to betaken seriously? Do they inspire young boys to respect and admire female athletes, and will this ultimately make a difference in the ways gender and power are constructed and perceived? Proposing a paradigm shift from second- to third-wave feminism, Heywood and Dworkin argue that, in the years since the passage of Title IX, gender stereotypes have been destabilized in profound ways, and they assert that female athletes and their imagery are doing important cultural work to that end. Important, refreshing, and engrossing, Built to Win examines sport in all its complexity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wG57UVRVN8YC&dq=Built+to+Win:+The+Female+Athlete+as+Cultural+Icon+(Sport+and+Culture+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baggage Train to Apocalypse","description":"And on they ride, a swelling, surging neap tide of human flesh, pressing into the valley of death; a microcosm subject to neither time nor space nor the will of any who would curb their slaughter, and my half-David arrogant on a stamping white stallion with hooves striking fire like the flint that sparks from a tinderbox. Deeper into the valley, deeper and ghastlier. Pleasant and painful, hideous and ecstatic, lost in a lush meadow with clover blossoms and lilacs and wild roses and a stream filled with trout where boys swim in the summer, naked and not knowing how little time they have left to be ignorant of Apocalypse. And I stood there dry in the July sun, a commentator on roses and lilacs and Apocalypse and naked children swimming the streams that twist through the valley.

Travellers and guests flow into and past the inn   warriors on the march, lovers fleeing to a new life, pilgrims on their merry expeditions, great men going to and from the capital. The story of the Minaguchi-ya is a social history of Japan through 400 years, a ringside seat to some of the most stirring events of a stirring period.  Statler has created a strangely beautiful book that succeeds in conveying intact not only a great deal of its history but the mood of that land. The result is sheer delight. Japanese Inn is the work of a master craftsman; it is so well conceived that the narrative moves from past to present in the same paragraph without the slightest confusion to the reader; it is so well written that only in retrospect is one aware of its remarkable flawless style. Through the author s particular magic, the stories unfold as one narrative, as beautifully and memorably as the unrolling of a long Japanese scroll.  CURT GENTRY  The reader learns much of Japan s past   and, as is inevitable in a study of that country, of present-day Japanese as well. Mr Statler s prose succeeds in evoking the pageantry of the past in the brilliant color of the kabuki stage. Nothing seems to have been overlooked by the author. Mr Statler s book is Japanese history made easy, and grand entertainment.   NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW  Much of it is told in fictional form. Some of the episodes have come out of family annals and memories, some from the records of the temple; some are imagined; but all could have happened ... Mr Statler has told the story vividly and with sympathy. It moves. It has the authentic feel of Japan.

Iran has more web diarists than most countries, and in cyberspace many Iranians find a freedom to express opinions that is not available to them in print. Theirs is not the Iran of bearded ayatollahs and thuggish militias, but a country that has educated itself to the point where it finds the Islamist fundamentalists antiquated and laughable, where adult literacy (and computer literacy) is higher than in many European states, and where 70 per cent of the population is under 30 and keen to usher in a new Iran. Their voices - infused with Persian lyricism - are refreshing, utterly at odds with the grim vision of the country peddled by Western governments. They talk of their conflicts with the law, the condition of women, of repression and its subversion, the police and media, of singing and dancing, of snatched romance and nostalgia for lost heroes. Reading We Are Iran, you have the sense that, for more reasons than are obvious, the worst thing that could possibly happen to Iran now would be a US attack.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0V8nAQAAIAAJ&dq=We+Are+Iran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gallagher Justice (Intrigue Series Extra)","description":"Justice is in her blood  Fiona Gallagher hails from a long line of Chicago lawmen, and has fulfilled her heritage as a prosecutor, driven to put away the slime of the streets.

Orsi demonstrates that the Southern Pacific was not simply a predatory corporation obsessed with maximizing its profits and political power; it had a strong sense of the public good and a devotion to building stable, prosperous communities. This superb book should be required reading for all historians of the West, business, and the environment.\\" Donald J. Pisani, author of Water and American Government  This deep and extensive examination of the Southern Pacific's development activities in California will encourage readers to look beyond the overblown rhetoric of the railroad's many political enemies and see afresh its many positive economic accomplishments as it worked to build the Twentieth-Century West. Orsi s presentation is as luminous as it is impressive  Carlos Schwantes, author of Going Places: Transportation Redefines the Twentieth Century West  This brilliantly researched and beautifully written study of one of America's greatest railroads offers wonderful insights into both transportation and Western history. Orsi places the early history of the Southern Pacific Railroad in proper focus by skillfully untangling the long-standing Octopus myth. This work deserves to be called a landmark in the field.  H. Roger Grant, author of Follow the Flag: A History of the Wabash Railroad Company \\"Sunset Limited illuminates not only the workings and ambitions of the Southern Pacific railroad but teaches us a great deal about the late nineteenth and early twentieth century American West as well.

Om antwoord te geven op deze moeilijkste vraag der vragen combineert de gerenommeerde psycholoog Jordan B. Peterson de zwaarbevochten waarheden van oude tradities met verbluffende ontdekkingen van grensverleggend wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Op humoristische, verrassende en informatieve wijze vertelt Jordan Peterson ons waarom kinderen die aan het skateboarden zijn met rust gelaten moeten worden, welk verschrikkelijk noodlot mensen die te snel oordelen te wachten staat, en waarom je altijd een kat moet aaien als je er een tegenkomt. Peterson legt grote verbanden en distilleert daarbij uit alle kennis van de wereld 12 praktische en fundamentele leefregels. In 12 regels voor het leven maakt Jordan Peterson korte metten met de moderne clich s van wetenschap, geloof en de menselijke natuur, en tegelijkertijd transformeert en verrijkt hij de denkwijze van zijn lezers. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson (1962) is psycholoog, cultuurcriticus en hoogleraar psychologie aan de Universiteit van Toronto. Zijn wetenschappelijke artikelen hebben de moderne kijk op persoonlijkheid en creativiteit voorgoed veranderd. Peterson heeft honderdduizenden volgers op social media en zijn YouTube-clips zijn meer dan 27 miljoen keer bekeken. 'Peterson is vandaag de dag de invloedrijkste intellectueel van de westerse wereld. Voor miljoenen jonge mannen blijkt de methode-Peterson het perfecte tegengif voor de mengeling van knuffelen en beschuldigen waarin ze zijn grootgebracht.' - DAVID BROOKS, THE NEW YORK TIMES 'Hoewel ik in veel opzichten met Peterson van mening verschil, ben ik het hartgrondig eens met zijn nadruk op het zorgvuldig, zonder vooroordelen bekijken van grote maatschappelijke en persoonlijke kwesties om daar rationele, weloverwogen oplossingen voor te vinden.

He was fifteen and knew no Japanese. In the spring of 1945, loyal to his new country, Sano was drafted in the last levy raised in the war. Sent through Korea to join the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, Sano arrived in Hailar, one hundred miles from the Soviet border, as the war was coming to a close. In the confusion that resulted when the war ended, Sano had the bad luck to be in a unit that surrendered to the Russians. It would be nearly three years before he was released to return to Japan. Sano's account of life in the POW and labor camps of Siberia is the story of a little-known part of the great conflagration that was World War II. It is also the poignant memoir of a man who was always an outsider, both as an American youth of Japanese ancestry and then as a young Japanese man whose loyalties were suspect to his new compatriots. Iwao Peter Sano returned to California in 1952 and is now a retired architect living in Palo Alto.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6D2MNf9L0SgC&dq=One+Thousand+Days+in+Siberia:+The+Odyssey+of+a+Japanese-American+POW&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Summer Before the Dark","description":"The story of a middle-aged woman s search for freedom, from Doris Lessing, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ctWWR1-OVYQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Way","description":"Mother Jones is an award-winning national magazine widely respected for its groundbreaking investigative reporting and coverage of sustainability and environmental issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o-YDAAAAMBAJ&dq=Family+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Huichol Indian Sacred Rituals","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QQgWAAAACAAJ&dq=Huichol+Indian+Sacred+Rituals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and Money","description":"A book by women, for women, about money management.

Simultaneously, they explore the imaginative potential of shipwreck as they consider the many meanings that have historically attached to maritime disaster and suffering at sea. Spanning both popular and high culture, and addressing a range of political, spiritual, aesthetic and environmental concerns, this cross-cultural, comparative study sheds new light on changing attitudes to the sea, especially in the West.

Mendel in the Kitchen provides a clear and balanced picture of this tangled, tricky (and very timely) topic. Any farmer you talk to could tell you that we've been playing with the genetic makeup of our food for millennia, carefully coaxing nature to do our bidding. The practice officially dates back to Gregor Mendel -- who was not a renowned scientist, but a 19th century Augustinian monk. Mendel spent many hours toiling in his garden, testing and cultivating more than 28,000 pea plants, selectively determining very specific characteristics of the peas that were produced, ultimately giving birth to the idea of heredity -- and the now very common practice of artificially modifying our food. But as science takes the helm, steering common field practices into the laboratory, the world is now keenly aware of how adept we have become at tinkering with nature --which in turn has produced a variety of questions. Are genetically modified foods really safe? Will the foods ultimately make us sick, perhaps in ways we can't even imagine? Isn't it genuinely dangerous to change the nature of nature itself? Nina Fedoroff, a leading geneticist and recognized expert in biotechnology, answers these questions, and more. Addressing the fear and mistrust that is rapidly spreading, Federoff and her co-author, science writer Nancy Brown, weave a narrative rich in history, technology, and science to dispel myths and misunderstandings. In the end, Fedoroff arues, plant biotechnology can help us to become better stewards of the earth while permitting us to feed ourselves and generations of children to come. Indeed, this new approach to agriculture holds the promise of being the most environmentally conservative way to increase our food supply.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PwkOVO9BbnkC&dq=Mendel+in+the+Kitchen:+A+Scientist%27s+View+of+Genetically+Modified+Foods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Merrill's Atlas of Radiographic Positions and Radiologic Procedures","description":"More than 400 projections make it easier to learn anatomy, properly position the patient, set exposures, and take high-quality radiographs!

Diverse Amber Alerts leveren niets op. Hoe meer kinderen verdwijnen, hoe groter de onrust in het land wordt. Voor Mertens vormen de verdwijningen een onwelkome herinnering aan een oude zaak waarin een jong meisje slachtoffer werd. Toch maakt dit juist dat ze verbeten achter de ontvoerders aan gaat.

The fundamental old ways: chastity, rationality, harmony, sobriety, even democracy: blasted to nothing or crumbling under siege. The city glows. It echoes. It pulses. It bleeds pastel and fuzzy, spicy, paisley and soft. This is how it's always going to be: smashing clothes, brilliant music, easy sex, eternal youth, the eyes of everybody, everyone's first thought, the top of the world, right here, right now: Swinging London. Shawn Levy has a genius for unearthing the secret history of popular culture. The Los Angeles Times called King of Comedy, his biography of Jerry Lewis, \\"a model of what a celebrity bio ought to besmart, knowing, insightful, often funny, full of fascinating insiders' stories,\\" and the Boston Globe declared that Rat Pack Confidential \\"evokes the time in question with the power of a novel, as well as James Ellroy's American Tabloid and better by far than Don DeLillo's Underworld.\\" In Ready, Steady, Go! Levy captures the spirit of the sixties in all its exuberance. A portrait of London from roughly 1961 to 1969, it chronicles the explosion of creativityin art, music and fashionand the revolutionssexual, social and politicalthat reshaped the world. Levy deftly blends the enthusiasm of a fan, the discerning eye of a social critic and a historian's objectivity as he re-creates the hectic pace and daring experimentation of the timesfrom the utter transformation of rock 'n' roll by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to the new aesthetics introduced by fashion designers like Mary Quant, haircutters like Vidal Sassoon, photographers like David Bailey, actors like Michael Caine and Terence Stamp and filmmakers like Richard Lester and Nicolas Roeg to the wild clothing shops and cutting-edge clubs that made Carnaby Street and King's Road the hippest thoroughfares in the world. Spiced with the reminiscences of some of the leading icons of that period, their fans and followers, and featuring a photographic gallery of well-known faces and far-out fashions, Ready, Steady, Go! is an irresistible re-creation of a time and place that seemed almost impossibly fun.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Flu72MYM_EAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preservation of rural character and protection of natural resources","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Th9vHwAACAAJ&dq=Preservation+of+rural+character+and+protection+of+natural+resources&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wesley's 52 Standard Sermons","description":"The Rev.

By meticulously combing the archive records in England, Germany, Poland and the United States, Marilyn Jeffers Walton has reconstructed the final mission of her father and his crew and located the German cemetery where one crewmate, killed the day the plane was shot down, was buried. She searched for and found the remaining men of the crew of \\"Rhapsody in Junk\\" and reunited them after sixty years. Interviews with the crew and fellow prisoners of war contributed puzzle pieces, put together bit by bit, that enabled her to find where they were captured and interrogated. By searching old records, letters, diaries and mission records, she was finally able to return to Germany and find the crash site of her father's B-24 where pieces of the plane still remained. To her astonishment, she met the woman who watched her father bail out and saw the very field where he landed. During her return to Germany, she connected emotionally with the people of the peaceful farm community of Wagersrott where her father was taken prisoner over six decades before. In her quest to reconstruct the mission and her father's prisoner of war experiences, Walton presents not only his story but the stories of the British and German people who both suffered greatly, all caught up in the dictates of a mad man. Revealed within the pages is a first-hand account of the bombing of Dresden from a German couple who survived it. Walton's odyssey through Europe allowed her to discover the rich fabric of the people who endured and survived the war and to weave their stories into a multi-faceted mosaic that reflects the personal experiences of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vskhd2cPvD0C&dq=My+Father+had+a+Daughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transgenic Plants: A Production System for Industrial and Pharmaceutical Proteins","description":"Transgenic Plants: A Production System for Industrial andPharmaceutical Proteins provides a detailed guide to the principlesand practice of using transgenic plants as a system for theproduction of heterologous proteins.

Now a filmmaker has made a movie about it. The girl's parents call it invasion of privacy. A woman lawyer calls it murder. The bloodstains on the courtroom floor belong to attorney Nina Reilly. Months earlier she'd been shot during a heated murder trial. She should have died that day. Instead, Nina has returned to the same Lake Tahoe court. Her only concession to her lingering fear is to give up criminal law. She figures an invasion of privacy lawsuit is a nice, safe civil action that will help her support her young son and pay the bills for her one-woman law office. She figures wrong. Nina's client is Terry London, a filmmaker whose documentary about a missing girl is raising disturbing questions. The girl's distraught parents believe the film invades their privacy. But Terry's brutal murder changes everything. Breaking her promise to herself, Nina decides to defend Terry's accused murderer, a man she'd known years before and hoped never to see again.

It is the best nonfiction sex journalism of the year in one unforgettable book. In a single generation, Cleis Press has fundamentally changed the way people talk -- and what they read -- about sex and gender.

Dulles's The Craft of Intelligence. This classic of spycraft is based on Allen Dulles's incomparable experience as a diplomat, international lawyer, and America's premier intelligence officer. Dulles was a high-ranking officer of the CIA's predecessor--the Office of Strategic Services--and was present at the inception of the CIA, where he served eight of his ten years there as director. Here he sums up what he learned about intelligence from nearly a half-century of experience in foreign affairs. In World War II his OSS agents penetrated the German Foreign Office, worked with the anti-Nazi underground resistance, and established contacts that brought about the Nazi military surrender in North Italy. Under his direction the CIA developed both a dedicated corps of specialists and a whole range of new intelligence devices, from the U-2 high-altitude photographic plane to minute electronic listening and transmitting equipment. Dulles reveals much about how intelligence is collected and processed, and how the resulting estimates contribute to the formation of national policy. He discusses methods of surveillance, and the usefulness of defectors from hostile nations. His knowledge of Soviet espionage techniques is unrivaled, and he explains how the Soviet State Security Service recruited operatives and planted \\"illegals\\" in foreign countries. He spells out not only the techniques of modern espionage but also the philosophy and role of intelligence in a free society threatened by global conspiracies. Dulles also addresses the Bay of Pigs incident, denying that the 1961 invasion was based on a CIA estimate that a popular Cuban uprising would ensue. This account is enlivened with a wealth of personal anecdotes. It is a book for readers who seek wider understanding of the contribution of intelligence to our national security.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tf1ABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Perfect Swing","description":"A leading PGA instructor presents ways to identify natural tendencies, physical strengths and desired shot patterns to master a swing that's consistent and repeatable under pressure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ipk8B427R0oC&dq=Your+Perfect+Swing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phrase Book Danish (Phrase Books)","description":"English-Danish phrasebook and 1500-word concise dictionary The collection of \\"Everything Will Be Okay\\" travel phrasebooks published by T&P Books is designed for people traveling abroad for tourism and business.

You recognize them by their cardboard signs, their bags of aluminum cans, or their weathered skin. But you do not know them. In Nomads of a Desert City Barbara Seyda meets the gazes of our homeless neighbors and, with an open heart and the eye of an accomplished photographer, uncovers their compelling stories of life on the edge. Byrdy is a teenager from Alaska who left a violent husband and misses the young daughter her mother now cares for. Her eyes show a wisdom that belies her youth. Samuel is 95 and collects cans for cash. His face shows a lifetime of living outside while his eyes hint at the countless stories he could tell. Lamanda worked as an accountant before an act of desperation landed her in prison. Now she struggles to raise the seven children of a woman she met there. Dorothy?whose earliest memories are of physical and sexual abuse?lives in a shelter, paycheck to paycheck, reciting affirmations so she may continue  to grace the world with my presence.  They live on the streets or in shelters. They are women and men, young and old, Native or Anglo or Black or Hispanic. Their faces reflect the forces that have shaped their lives: alcoholism, poverty, racism, mental illness, and abuse. But like desert survivors, they draw strength from some hidden reservoir. Few recent studies on homelessness offer such a revealing collection of oral history narratives and compelling portraits. Thirteen homeless women and men open a rare window to enrich our understanding of the complex personal struggles and triumphs of their lives. Nomads of a Desert City sheds a glaring light on the shadow side of the American Dream?and takes us to the crossroads of despair and hope where the human spirit survives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q-thV5HbkicC&dq=Nomads+of+a+Desert+City:+Personal+Stories+from+Citizens+of+the+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Early Universe (Frontiers in Physics)","description":"The Early Universe has become the standard reference on forefront topics in cosmology, particularly to the early history of the Universe.

The book reexamines the transformation of some 7,000 Hispano settlers from citizens of New Mexico territory to citizens of the newly formed Colorado territory, as well as the effects of territorial legislation on the lives of those residing in the region as a whole. S nchez highlights the struggles experienced by Hispano territorial assemblymen trying to create opportunity and a better life in the face of cultural conflict and the institutional racism used to effectively shut them out of the process of establishing new laws and social order. For example, the federal and Colorado territorial governments did not provide an interpreter for the Hispano assemblymen or translations of the laws passed by the legislature, and they taxed Hispano constituents without representation and denied them due process in court. The first in-depth history of Hispano sociopolitical life during Colorado s territorial period, Pleas and Petitions provides fundamental insight into Hispano settlers  interactions with their Anglo neighbors, acknowledges the struggles and efforts of those Hispano assemblymen who represented southern Colorado during the territorial period, and augments the growing historical record of Hispanos who have influenced the course of Colorado s history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DwfQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oak Above the Kings: A Book of the Keltiad","description":"Combining the technology of science fiction and traditions of Celtic myth with the story of King Arthur, the sequel to The Tales of Arthur is seen through the eyes of Knight Taliesin, Chief Bard of Keltia.

He was by all accounts an indispensable part of Cubs teams that won four National League pennants and two World Series titles between 1906 and 1910. Yet today he is remembered by historians as a player at the center of two unresolved questions: Was Johnny Kling s absence from baseball in 1909 during the prime of his career the result of a salary holdout? And was he Jewish? This heavily researched biography ends the debate over those questions while restoring Kling to his place among the greats at his position. It covers in detail his exploits on and off the field (which included a world billiards championship in 1909) and his life after his playing career ended, when he became a philanthropist and gentleman farmer.

He has inherited, defended and developed Marxism-Leninism with genius, creatively and comprehensively, and has brought it to a higher and completely new stage. Mao Tse-tung's thought is Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is advancing to world-wide victory. It is a powerful ideological weapon for opposing imperialism and for opposing revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Tse-tung's thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the Party, the army and the country. Therefore, the most fundamental task in our Party's political and ideological work is at all times to hold high the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thought, to arm the minds of the people throughout the country with it and to persist in using it to command every field of activity. The broad masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers and the broad ranks of the revolutionary cadres and the intellectuals should really master Mao Tse-tung's thought; they should all study Chairman Mao's writings, follow his teachings, act according to his instructions and be his good fighters. In studying the works of Chairman Mao, one should have specific problems in mind, study and apply his works in a creative way, combine study with application, first study what must be urgently applied so as to get quick results, and strive hard to apply what one is studying. In order really to master Mao Tse-tung's thought, it is essential to study many of Chairman Mao's basic concepts over and over again, and it is best to memorize important statements and study and apply them repeatedly. The newspapers should regularly carry quotations from Chairman Mao relevant to current issues for readers to study and apply. The experience of the broad masses in their creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the last few years has proved that to study selected quotations from Chairman Mao with specific problems in mind is a good way to learn Mao Tse-tung's thought, a method conducive to quick results. We have compiled Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung in order to help the broad masses learn Mao Tse-tung's thought more effectively. In organizing their study, units should select passages that are relevant to the situation, their tasks, the current thinking of their personnel, and the state of their work. In our great motherland, a new era is emerging in which the workers, peasants and soldiers are grasping Marxism-Leninism, Mao Tse-tung's thought. Once Mao Tse-tung's thought is grasped by the broad masses, it becomes an inexhaustible source of strength and a spiritual atom bomb of infinite power. The large-scale publication of Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung is a vital measure for enabling the broad masses to grasp Mao Tse-tung's thought and for promoting the revolutionization of our people's thinking. It is our hope that all comrades will learn earnestly and diligently, bring about a new nation-wide high tide in the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and, under the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thought, strive to build our country into a great socialist state with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture and modern national defence","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=h53GLQAACAAJ&dq=Quotations+from+Chairman+Mao+tse-tung&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carpentry & Building Construction, Student Text","description":"The main subject areas covered are: Basic Skills, Surface Finishing, Finishing Components, Structural Components and Basic Joinery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hr9mqXeFfOYC&dq=Carpentry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The man to send rain clouds : contemporary stories by American Indians","description":"Fourteen stories about the strength and passion of today s American Indian including six from the acclaimed Leslie Marmon Silko. Anthropologists have long delighted us with the wise and colorful folktales they transcribed from their Indian informants. The stories in this collection are another matter altogether: these are white-educated Indians attempting to bear witness through a non-Indian genre, the short story. Over a two-year period, Kenneth Rosen traveled from town to town, pueblo to pueblo, to uncover the stories contained in this volume. All reveal, to varying degrees and in various ways, the preoccupations of contemporary American Indians. Not surprisingly, many of the stories are infused with the bitterness of a people and a culture long repressed. Several deal with violence and the effort to escape from the pervasive, and so often destructive, white influence and system. In most, the enduring strength of the Indian past is very much in evidence, evoked as a kind of counterpoint to the repression and aimlessness that have marked, and still mark today, the lives of so many American Indians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QjzZOgRrgEEC&dq=The+man+to+send+rain+clouds+:+contemporary+stories+by+American+Indians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhino Chasers","description":"They drove to the edge of fear and back, but still had time to surf.

Once, like all of us, Buddy dreamt of success. He and his wife, Alix, had just bought a new place, not too far from the beach. Their daughter, Brook, was out of the hospital. And the fans were cheering him on as the Invincible Man, one of the rising stars of the Southeastern Wrestling Confederacy. Then everything fell apart. An argument over Monday Night Football somehow crossed the line, Alix kicked him out, and Buddy moved in to the Motel 6. After that, winning just didn't seem right, so he traded in his golden cape for a latex mask and became one of the anonymous losers that fans love to hate. Every few weeks, he'd get a new mask, rechristen himself, and step into the ring to get beat all over again -- as the Grave Digger or the Widow Maker, the Deadbeat Dad or the Unknown Kentucky Terror. In the four years since the divorce, his record is 0-186, but that's okay by Buddy. Free of mad notions like happiness and success, he pops pink pills to control his rage and copes with his insomnia by watching John Wayne westerns and QVC. He has his job, his apartment, his truck, his once-a-week visits with Brook. Life as a failure isn't that bad, or so he's convinced himself. But now in an effort to boost pay-per-view ratings, Buddy's boss threatens a shake-up. As part of the plan, Buddy will have to end his safe days as a professional loser. He's actually slated to win a match. What he'll learn, though, is that like all new scripts, this one comes with its own cast and complications: a phone psychic living in fear, an alien-abductee with the secret to salvation, a championship match interrupted by a violent fanatic, what could be faith healings, and perhaps the most unlikely miracle of all -- a second chance to believe. A touching and wonderfully unpredictable literary debut about a professional loser who's forced into a rematch with life, Buddy Cooper Finds a Way announces the arrival of a fresh and original voice in American fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h5uSxIFFyPoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alaska Light: Ideas and Images from a Northern Land","description":"A portfolio of essays and images showing the quality of light on Alaskan landscapes, wildlife, people.

Why is it that at certain periods in American history, religious and political thought have followed a parallel course while at other times they have moved in entirely different directions? To what extent have minority perspectives challenged the majority position on the religious and political issues that impinge on each other? These are among the many important and fascinating questions examined in this book, the first thorough historical survey of the multi-layered connections between religion and politics in the United States. This unique collection presents previously unpublished essays by seventeen of America's leading historians and social scientists, including John Murrin, Harry Stout, John F. Wilson, Daniel Walker Howe, Bertram Wyatt-Brown, Robert Swierenga, Martin Marty, Robert Wuthnow, and George Marsden. Together, these distinguished contributors provide comprehensive coverage of the historical interaction between religion and politics in America, from the colonial and Revolutionary periods, with intense commitments to and disagreements over religion, through the evangelical Protestant ascendency that marked the nineteenth century, to the growing pluralism and heightened antagonism between liberal and conservative factions that typify our own era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ydCpVTC8PKoC&dq=Religion+and+American+Politics:+From+the+Colonial+Period+to+the+1980s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading of Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica: The Poetics of Uncertainty (Studies in Classics, V. 20)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jLbfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reading+of+Apollonius+Rhodius%27+Argonautica:+The+Poetics+of+Uncertainty+(Studies+in+Classics,+V.+20)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poverty of Liberalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HR9mAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Poverty+of+Liberalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Men Want","description":"A Doctor, A Lawyer, and an Accountant tell You Everything You Need To Know About What Men Want.

They introduce concepts and tasks, taking into account childrens' ''sensitive periods'' for learning such skills as dressing themselves, food preparation, and toilet training.

A poet, essayist, orator, statesman, abolitionist, and the martyred revolutionary leader of Cuba's fight for independence from Spain, Mart  lived in exile in New York for most of his adult life, earning his living as a foreign correspondent. Throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, Mart 's were the eyes through which much of Latin America saw the United States. His impassioned, kaleidoscopic evocations of that period in U.S. history, the assassination of James Garfield, the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, the execution of the Chicago anarchists, the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans, and much more, bring it rushing back to life. Organized chronologically, this collection begins with his early writings, including a thundering account of his political imprisonment in Cuba at age sixteen. The middle section focuses on his journalism, which offers an image of the United States in the nineteenth century, its way of life and system of government, that rivals anything written by de Tocqueville, Dickens, Trollope, or any other European commentator. Including generous selections of his poetry and private notebooks, the book concludes with his astonishing, hallucinatory final masterpiece, \\"War Diaries\\", never before translated into English.

This book starts with the rise of modernity and places the emergence of punk as a musical subculture into that longer historical narrative. It also reveals how punk itself became a contested terrain, as participants sought to imbue the production of music with greater meaning. It highlights all styles of punk and its wide variety of creators around the world, including from the LGBTQ+, feminist, and alternative communities.

As work and personal demands rise, we try to keep up by juggling everything better, moving faster, and doing more. While we might succeed in the short term, this approach comes at a high cost in the long term: it hurts our well-being, our relationships, and paradoxically our productivity. In this life-changing book, Emma Sepp?l? explains that the reason we are burning ourselves out is that we fall for outdated theories of success. We are taught that getting ahead means doing everything that s thrown at us with razor-sharp focus and iron discipline, that success depends on our drive and talents, and that achievement cannot happen without stress. The Happiness Track demolishes these counterproductive theories. Drawing on the latest scientific research on happiness, resilience, willpower, compassion, positive stress, creativity, and mindfulness, Sepp?l? demonstrates that being happy is the most productive thing we can do to thrive whether at work or at home. She shares practical strategies for applying these scientific findings to our daily lives. A fulfilling, successful, and anxiety-free life is within your reach.

Amy Cuddy, professor at Harvard Business School and author of Presence  Backed by extensive research in psychology and neuroscience, The Happiness Track offers a wealth of insight on changing how we approach our work, our personal lives, and our relationships. It s a carefully researched, engaging look at how to improve ourselves without losing our authenticity or our sanity.

Susan Cain, cofounder of Quiet Revolution and New York Times bestselling author of Quiet  For decades we ve been tied to theories of success that have burned us out and driven us into the ground because we don t know of any alternatives.

Few people realize how profoundly their lives are affected by self-reflection or how frequently inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships with others, and undermines their happiness. By allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine what might happen in the future, self-reflection conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, and other negative emotions. A great deal of unhappiness, in the form of addictions, overeating, and domestic violence, is due to people's inability to exert control over their thoughts and behavior. Is it possible to direct our self-reflection in a way that will minimize the disadvantages and maximize the advantages? Is there a way to affect the egotistical self through self-reflection?

A central theme is the evolution of gravitationally contained thermonuclear reactors, otherwise known as stars. Our current understanding is presented systematically and quantitatively, by combining simple analytic models with new state-of-the-art computer simulations. The narrative begins with the clues (primarily the solar system abundance pattern), the constraining physics (primarily nuclear and particle physics), and the thermonuclear burning in the Big Bang itself. It continues with a step-by-step description of how stars evolve by nuclear reactions, a critical investigation of supernova explosion mechanisms and the formation of neutron stars and of black holes, and an analysis of how such explosions appear to astronomers (illustrated by comparison with recent observations). It concludes with a synthesis of these ideas for galactic evolution, with implications for nucleosynthesis in the first generation of stars and for the solar system abundance pattern. Emphasis is given to questions that remain open, and to active research areas that bridge the disciplines of astronomy, cosmochemistry, physics, and planetary and space science.

The ancient dream of breaking gravity's hold and taking to space became a reality only because of the intense cold-war rivalry between the superpowers, with towering geniuses like Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolyov shelving dreams of space travel and instead developing rockets for ballistic missiles and space spectaculars. Now that Russian archives are open and thousands of formerly top-secret U.S. documents are declassified, an often startling new picture of the space age emerges: the frantic effort by the Soviet Union to beat the United States to the Moon was doomed from the beginning by gross inefficiency and by infighting so treacherous that Winston Churchill likened it to \\"dogs fighting under a carpet\\"; there was more than science behind the United States' suggestion that satellites be launched during the International Geophysical Year, and in one crucial respect, Sputnik was a godsend to Washington; the hundred-odd German V-2s that provided the vital start to the U.S. missile and space programs legally belonged to the Soviet Union and were spirited to the United States in a derring-do operation worthy of a spy thriller; despite NASA's claim that it was a civilian agency, it had an intimate relationship with the military at the outset and still does--a distinction the Soviet Union never pretended to make; constant efforts to portray astronauts and cosmonauts as \\"Boy Scouts\\" were often contradicted by reality; the Apollo missions to the Moon may have been an unexcelled political triumph and feat of exploration, but they also created a headache for the space agency that lingers to this day. This New Ocean is based on 175 interviews with Russian and American scientists and engineers; on archival documents, including formerly top-secret National Intelligence Estimates and spy satellite pictures; and on nearly three decades of reporting. The impressive result is this fascinating story--the first comprehensive account--of the space age. Here are the strategists and war planners; engineers and scientists; politicians and industrialists; astronauts and cosmonauts; science fiction writers and journalists; and plain, ordinary, unabashed dreamers who wanted to transcend gravity's shackles for the ultimate ride. The story is written from the perspective of a witness who was present at the beginning and who has seen the conclusion of the first space age and the start of the second.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TLKCmJSFJnYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Application Development Using Visual Basic and .NET","description":"Covers topics including .NET Framework and CLR fundamentals, .NET features, Web services, programming with GDI+, and interoperability, and provides a Visual Basic .NET overview.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vCj7Qq-3i10C&dq=Application+Development+Using+Visual+Basic+and+.NET&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terebori's Gold","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6x4eAAAACAAJ&dq=Terebori%27s+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry (Prepared for the Supremem Council of the Thirty-Third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States)","description":"This book has been considered by academicians and scholars of great significance and value to literature.

Set in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, home to celebrities seeking to escape the pressures of public life, as well as to xenophobes dedicated to establishing a bulkhead of patriotic paranoia, Burke s novel features Billy Bob Holland, former Texas Ranger and now a Texas-based lawyer, who has come to Big Sky Country for some fishing and ends up helping out an old friend in trouble. And big trouble it is, not just for his friend but for Billy Bob himself in the form of Wyatt Dixon, a recent prison parolee sworn to kill Billy Bob as revenge for both his imprisonment and his sister's death, both of which he blames on the former Texas lawman. As the mysteries multiply and the body count mounts, the reader is drawn deeper into the tortured mind of Billy Bob Holland, a complex hero tormented by the mistakes of his past and driven to make things all things right. But beneath the guise of justice for the weak and downtrodden lies a tendency for violence that at times becomes more terrifying than the danger he is trying to eradicate. As USA TODAY noted in discussing the parallels between Billy Bob Holland and Burke s other popular series hero, David Robicheaux,  Robicheaux and Holland are two of a kind, white-hat heroes whose essential goodness doesn t keep them from fighting back. The two series describe different landscapes, but one theme remains constant: the inner conflict when upright men are provoked into violence in defense of hearth, home, women, and children. There are plenty of parallels. Billy Bob is an ex-Texas Ranger; Dave is an ex-New Orleans cop. Dave battles alcoholism and the ghosts of Vietnam; Billy Bob actually sees ghosts, including the Ranger he accidentally gunned down....But most of all, both protagonists hold a vision of a pure and simple life.  In Bitterroot, with its rugged and vivid setting, its intricate plot, and a set of remarkable, unforgettable characters, and crafted with the lyrical prose and the elegiac tone that have inspired many critics to compare him to William Faulkner, James Lee Burke has written a thriller destined to surpass the success of his previous novels.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7MtehxyHMVkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's the Matter, Habibi?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jQBsRQAACAAJ&dq=What%27s+the+Matter,+Habibi%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hilarious Handwriting Age 5-6 (Magic Skills)","description":"This premium themed unicorn sketchbook is all about inspiring and motivating your girl to express her creativity & happiness!

Because the city was situated in what was initially remote and inhospitable territory, surrounded by pagans and coveted by regional powers like Poland, Sweden, and Muscovy, it was also a fortress encased by a wall. The House of Hemp and Butter begins in the twelfth century with the arrival to the eastern Baltic of German priests, traders, and knights, who conquered and converted the indigenous tribes and assumed mastery over their lands. It ends in 1710 with an account of the greatest war Livonia had ever seen, one that was accompanied by mass starvation, a terrible epidemic, and a flood of nearly Biblical proportions that devastated the city and left its survivors in misery. Readers will learn about Riga's people merchants and clerics, craftsmen and builders, porters and day laborers about its structures and spaces, its internal conflicts and its unrelenting struggle to maintain its independence against outside threats.

Not only are these studies often contradictory, but the actual scientific information is usually inaccessible. Moving beyond the myths and misinformation, the advice in these pages is not based on one person's opinions or one expert's study. For the first time the research available on the health of average Americans has been distilled into one hundred essential ways that we can become healthier and happier. Each of the core findings is accompanied by a real life example showing these results in action. Eat more often. Oxford University researchers found that people who ate five or six times a day had a 5 percent lower total cholesterol than average and were 45 percent more likely to be able to sustain their target weight than people who ate once or twice a day. Who says caffeine is bad for you? The majority of scientific evidence shows that, for a healthy adult, moderate quantities of caffeine (about three cups of coffee per day) pose no significant health risks. Home sweet home.

He considers economic systems from a moral as well as economic standpoint, considering such criteria as freedom, justice, and equal opportunity, as well as standards of productivity, growth, and employment levels.

Yet the two disciplines were already intertwined. In Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science, Weyl examines how advances in philosophy were led by scientific discoveries--the more humankind understood about the physical world, the more curious we became. The book is divided into two parts, one on mathematics and the other on the physical sciences. Drawing on work by Descartes, Galileo, Hume, Kant, Leibniz, and Newton, Weyl provides readers with a guide to understanding science through the lens of philosophy. This is a book that no one but Weyl could have written--and, indeed, no one has written anything quite like it since.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iNY4EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rule of St. Benedict (An Image Book Original)","description":"Since the 6th century, this has been one of the most influential documents of Western thought and civilization.

Should preachers protect their flocks from the inroads of scientific naturalism? Or is an informed scientific view of the universe compatible with Christian belief even a strong source of support for it? This world belongs to God, and the pulpit is a crucial vehicle for celebrating science s contribution to the understanding of creation. Beginning with a defense of the authority of Scripture, Scott Hoezee distinguishes between science as a physical field of inquiry and scientific naturalism, which often turns science into an atheistic, religious, or philosophical point of view. After establishing the fact that there is no necessary clash between theology and science, Hoezee summarizes some of the more recent discoveries in the fields of physics and cosmology, as well as current ideas about the biological and mental nature of human beings. He highlights intriguing scientific facts and points to the theological interpretations that can be drawn from them. Proclaim the Wonder offers specific suggestions and strategies for integrating science into preaching and provides sample sermons based on key biblical texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DdmjDwAAQBAJ&dq=Proclaim+the+Wonder:+Engaging+Science+on+Sunday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sip of Sherrie","description":"Literary Nonfiction.
