It has line drawings only, with no photos and is pocket size -- not a big glossy beauty at all. But boy is it loaded with the information you need! I'm a sucker for beautiful books and fell for another basic serger book that is big and beautiful. But guess what? It doesn't begin to answer my questions in the way Gail Brown and Patty Palmer's book does. The smaller size of this book lets it snuggle right up to machine where I find myself thumbing through it all the time.The book has a good section on serger features and how they are adjusted on various machines. This was a great help when I was shopping for my machine. The section I turn to most often (novice serger that I am) is the section describing basic stitches and their approrpirate uses. A comprehensive table describes how the machine forms each stitch, how it looks when correctly stitched and the advantages, disadvantages and typical uses of each. Another section offers excellent diagrams of stitches with incorrect tension and how to make the correcting adjustments. Almost half of the book covers serger applications in every type of sewing from business dress to children's clothes to home decor. The detail includes construction adaptations and sequences.All in all this is a jam packed reference. You probably can't find a more comprehensive book anywhere at three times the cost of this one!&quot;"},{"Title":"Sewing With Sergers: The Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing","review":"I just bought my first serger and once it was out of the box I realized I was going to need help. I bought 3 books: This one (the one I am reviewing), along with &quot;The Complete Serger Handbook&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Serger Answer Guide&quot;. After reading all of them I am glad I have all of them....they each address different needs.This book is wonderful once you are comfortable using your machine (ie. you can thread it and get the stitches to look like they are supposed to). It gives great advise on how to approach many different sewing projects so as to maximize the value of serging over sewing and save you time and hassle as well.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although it has great diagrams (and plenty of them), I prefer actual photos (in color)."},{"Title":"Sewing With Sergers: The Complete Handbook for Overlock Sewing","review":"I checked out all the books on serging at the library after purchasing my four-thread machine.

It tells you you can gather over cord, but doesn't tell you how. As mentioned in other reviews there are no actual pics, just line drawings that are of little to no help.

The clothing styles in the illustrations are a bit dated, and I wish the book was larger and had color photos rather than line illustrations so as to be easier on the eyes, but the techniques apply just as easily to current fashions. The content of this book more than makes up for the lackluster visual appeal. How to adapt commercial pattern instructions, change sewing order, and techniques for the serger in garment construction, proper threads and needles for different types of fabrics are all covered well.

Think Mark Twain meets John Geirach; in fact, author Albert Bigelow Paine wrote biographies of Twain, as well as a great deal else.The author writes in a style of his time, but much pleasure may be found in it and I found myself laughing or chuckling aloud as I read. I was so intrigued by the trip, I managed, after some casting about on the Internet, to find the general area he writes about and I am happy to see much of it is national park today.This is a time when dry flies were a novelty, canoes were birchbark, tents were canvas, and even a bamboo rod is seen as untried. Obviously there is no iPod, no cellphone, no ATV, no motorboat, no boombox or batteries. But for the absence of DEET, I think I would have fit in just fine.Despite the fact that the author is writing more than 100 years ago, he betrays a modern conservation sensibility. When the travelers catch more fish than they need for dinner, they catch and release. When his buddy wants to shoot a moose calf or a porcupine or pretty much anything else, the author roots against him, saying that anything they kill they should eat. Upon coming upon a beaver dam, he worries for the survival of that species.This is a book anyone for anyone who sees humor in the fouled cast or the foibles of his tentmates. It is also for whose heart is quickened by tug of the line and slowed by the campfire. It is for those who like to camp and fish and for those who can imagine themselves in wool and shoepacs, casting a Silver Doctor on a silk line."},{"Title":"The Tent Dwellers","review":"*The Tent Dwellers* by Albert Bigelow Paine was given to me by a Nova Scotian friend whose grandfather had actually been friends with one of the main characters in the book. *The Tent Dwellers* is full of wonderful self-deprecating humor and great tales of adventure and misadventure in the Nova Scotian wilderness at the turn of the twentieth century. I love Albert Bigelow Paine's descriptive language: \\"There wasn't any upstairs except for the treetops and the sky, though, after all, these made up for a good deal, for the treetops feathered up and faded into the dusky blue, and the blue was sown with stars that were caught up and multiplied by every tiny wrinkle on the surface of the great black bowl and sent in myriad twinkling to our feet.\\"I think anyone who has a love and appreciation for the Great Outdoors will enjoy this book.

Armed only with her pens, paints, papers, and pots of herbs, children's book author/illustrator Hedderwick recorded her voyage. She found that the romantic moments were scarce and the voyage fraught with danger and difficulty. But by finding humor in even the most adverse circumstances while conveying the beauty of the land and sea through her words and pictures, she is able to convey to the reader her unforgettable voyage of discovery.

More of a novella, rather than a full fledged novel, by virtue of its brevity, it is absolutely brilliant, well-written, and gripping from the get go. Ms. Rendell captures the reader with her first sentence, &quot;Eunice Parchman killed the Coverdale family because she could not read or write.&quot;This is a descriptive and insightful literary stunner about how an illiterate, middle aged women gets to the point that she wipes out a family one fateful evening. The book takes the reader, step by step, through the events that lead up to this crossroad. It explores the mind of Eunice Parchman, a woman so limited in her world view and so robotic in her actions that she is almost repellent. The reader marvels at her very existence and is sure to find her fascinating character study.Ms. Parchman's interactions with the well educated Coverdale family, who employs her as a housekeeper, are intriguing and always interesting, as she struggles to keep her illiteracy a secret. How Ms. Parchman circumvents its discovery for as long as does, the lengths to which she goes to maintain a facade of literacy, and her socially inappropriate responses to every day situations, paint an intriguing psychological portrait for the reader. The eventual discovery of her illiteracy results in a ghastly outcome, which makes for some gripping and chilling reading.Ms. Rendell is masterful in her storytelling, infusing mundane situations with an understated horror that is all the more chilling because of the common denominator that strikes a chord with the reader. Written is well-nuanced, taut, spare style, this book is a literary gem that will keep the reader riveted to its pages. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","review":"This book has 25 scientific contributors, ostensibly to answer for the Carnegie Commission Task Force on Early Primary Education the question whether the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 had any scientific merit. This book takes a look at the dataset and reanalyzes much of what Herrnstein and Murry had looked at.Though it brings more perspectives on the subject, and takes issue with much of what TBC concluded, it does vindicate that TBC is now a serious beginning look at intelligence, genetics, and its impact on the nation. This book says, as so many other researchers have contended, &quot;The Bell Curve is a serious book and is not to be ignored.&quot;However, when reading the book, which I recommend for anyone that is very familiar with the subject, remember that of the 25 contributors, only John B. Carroll was also a signatory to &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence: 52 scientists respond to The Bell Curve (12/13/1994) in the Wall Street Journal.&quot; This book is put together primarily by left-leaning academics. To balance its message, I would strongly recommend reading Arthur Jensen's book The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. So again, read this book but keep in mind it is highly biased."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","review":"This book was written as a response to the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; by Herrnstein and Murray. But unlike several other books that condemned TBC without any empirical data, this book actually does expand the issue of racial differences intelligence and is well worth reading by any one interested in this ongoing debate. At least in this book, while still motivated by an egalitarian goal to deny racial differences in intelligence, the authors do give TBC credit for being essentially a very sound book empirically, while picking away at some of the issues at its periphery. But as they do this, they also make many fundamental errors and omissions. This is to be expected however because TBC is very hard to refute on empirical grounds alone.As an example, the authors take TBC to task for using heritability in the broad sense rather in the narrow sense like breeders do, which reduces the heritability between races supposedly by about 20% or so. The problem is, as shown by Jensen in &quot;The g Factor&quot;, heritability in the broad sense should be used in comparing group averages, while heritability in the narrow sense should be used in predicting the expected intelligence of one's children. TBC was not a book on how to have smart kids or breeding cows for higher butter fat production. So the argument was a feeble attempt at obfuscation.Later in the book they admit that Blacks almost make as much money as Whites when wages are adjusted for the average difference in intelligence between the two groups. But they go on to say that &quot;almost&quot; is not good enough. The error here of course, as even they argue in this book, is that earnings are not just a matter of intelligence. It is the most important trait with regards to wages, but other traits are also important. Research has shown that conscientiousness is the second most important behavioral trait after intelligence in occupational success, and one would have to assume that conscientiousness would vary among racial groups as easily as intelligence due to evolutionary forces on selection under different ecological conditions. And Rushton has shown that many behavioral differences exist between Whites and Blacks on average, including conscientiousness.So this book is a mixed bag on not denying that there are differences in the average intelligence between Blacks and Whites while trying at the same time to ameliorate the damage that recent research has produced showing that the differences are in fact real and persistent. But the funding for this book was such that the authors had no choice but to use some very fancy footwork to dance around the primary issue and try to diffuse its impact with regards to education and equality. Politics always comes into play, depending on who is paying the piper."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","review":"This book is heavy stuff. It was written in a style similar to articles published in scientific journals. The opinions and views are drawn based on science and prior studies with thorough references. This book is not for the casual reader who is interested in the topic, but only wants to spend a few hours on it and hopes to walk away with a clearly understanding of the facts or the views of the experts."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","review":"When The Bell Curve first came out, I predicted that, 200 years from now, university professors would use it, along with the collapse of the iron curtain, to mark the end of &quot;the Socialist Epoch&quot; or &quot;the Egalitarian Age,&quot; which I suppose, to make a nice round number, they will have in their textbooks as 1789-1989. Now I'm even more convinced. In fact, nothing could possibly better confirm the essential validity of the Bell Curve's claims than the fact, behind all the self-fueling sound and fury it provoked, and behind the holier-than-thou pretentions to be &quot;debunking,&quot; &quot;refuting,&quot; and &quot;flattening&quot; the Bell Curve, the careful reader cannot help but notice a striking absence of real, substantive objections to it. Instead, the supposed objections are either opposed to something the Bell Curve never said (and indeed, explicitly denied), or else they tend to try to nit-pick without actually disagreeing. Indeed, with Cafalli-Sforza's lead, we see a new formula emerging. If you are involved in writing up some potentially politically incorrect scientific research, here is what to do. First, write up the research, which, of course, largely confirms the hereditarian heresy (which most people have always known, or secretly suspected, anyway). Then, decorate the outside of the package with a lot of ostentatious window dressing which, ingenuously, implies that your book &quot;flattens&quot; the evil heresy. That ought to keep YOUR head out of the noose! Besides, it makes the reviewers much more likely praise you, and sells more copies too. If your conscience bothers you, you can salve it with the thought that there is surely SOME version of the evil heresy which your arguments really DO oppose, even if this is just a straw man, i.e., some 100% hereditarian determinism which nobody, and certainly not the (&quot;40-60%&quot;) Bell Curve authors, has ever actually held. The only thing that surprises me is the fact that the media and publishing world falls for this sham. I guess the relatively moderate Murray and Herrnstein have simply been designated the official targets of popular wrath, if only because they came out FIRST. And perhaps everybody else, from the most heretical hereditarian to the most orthodox Marxist, has an interst in keeping it that way."},{"Title":"Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to THE BELL CURVE (Statistics for Social Science and Public Policy)","review":"We are all taught as little children to make a distinction between two fundamental issues.#1.

Truly two wonderful works of literature."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"_Puck of Pook's Hill_ is a set of stories, somewhat linked, about the history of England, built around a frame story involving two young children, Dan and Una, meeting Puck in a meadow near their Sussex home. Puck somehow arranges for a series of historical people, ghosts, I suppose, to come and tell stories of events near their home in the past 2000 years. There are four stories told by Sir Richard Dalyngridge, one of William the Conqueror's men, on the theme of assimilation of the Normans and Saxons into one people: the English. There are three Roman stories, set in 375 AD or so, about a Centurion from the Isle of Wight who holds Hadrian's Wall against the Picts and the Norsemen while Maximus, his general, declares himself Emperor and takes Gaul then heads into Rome (where the real Emperor had him killed, understandably enough). The three other stories deal with the rebuilding of the local church in Henry VII's time, a rebuilding project menaced by smugglers, with the flight of the fairies from England at the time of the Reformation, and with the role of a Jew in forcing John to sign the Magna Carta. (This last an uneasy mixture of anti-Semitism with an apparent attempt to not be anti-semitic.)_Rewards and Fairies_ presents eleven more stories told by Puck's agency to Dan and Una. We meet some familiar characters again (the church builder, and Richard Dalynrydge), and even some major historical figures: Queen Elizabeth, George Washington, Napoleon. On the whole the stories aren't quite as good as those in _Puck_, though &quot;Marklake Witches&quot; is very good, very moving.Both books include a number of poems, usually closely associated with the themes of the stories.These are generally fine stories, but for my taste not up to the level of my favorite Kipling stories, such as &quot;Mrs. Bathurst&quot; and &quot;'They'&quot; and &quot;The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes&quot; and &quot;The Story of Mohammed Din&quot;. Still, the plain craft of the stories is as ever with Kipling remarkable."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"It seems to be fashionable, in this politically correct time, to find fault with Rudyard Kipling. But Kipling was a great writer with big ideas and a big heart. He wrote \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" and \\"Rewards and Fairies\\" to share his love of his mother country with young readers. These books are a great introduction to English history. I find it hard to imagine a reader not falling in love with the land and people of this great country after reading \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\". The curious reader will seek out more information on what happened during their favorite characters' times, possibly leading to a lifelong love of history and the inclination to explore the world through reading."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"Marvellous!In a word, that's my feeling aboutPuck of Pook's Hill (Dover Value Editions). I'll get into the actual story in just a moment but I first wanted to make some general observations about this terrific work of fantasy.Kipling harbored a kid's imagination for fantasy stories and a sociology professor's knowledge of history, especially concerning 19th Century England and its colonies. Kipling lived from 1865-1936 and, of course, he generated a plethora of superb period literature includingThe Jungle Books (Oxford World's Classics),The Man Who Would Be King (Dodo Press), andKim. The thread so common to the bulk of Kipling's work seems to be ADVENTURE, a theme in which he excelled beyond most other authors, either then or now.In \\"Puck\\" he achieved a level of historical imperative and nostalgic fantasy that was only ever paralleled by Lewis Carroll and J.R.R. Tolkien. This book is (for reasons unknown to me) a real sleeper -- you don't hear much about it either in academia or in bookstores, which is a tremendous shame given its refreshing effervescence and rainy-day appeal. I feel compelled to say that it would be infinitely helpful in digesting \\"Puck\\" if you're already somewhat tutored in the history of England and, if you're accustomed to reading the vernacular of other works of Kipling's era. I luckily have the 1987 Penguin softcover edition of this book (Goodwill Store, 50 cents) which is heavily footnoted and which also includes a lengthy, informative introduction to the book written by Sarah Wintle. There even a nice little \\"Map of the Weald\\" (Kipling's Sussex) which provides added perspective.The ten \\"stories\\" from this book first appeared in \\"The Strand\\" in 1906 which were then illustrated by Claude A. Shepperson. Additionally, some of these entries were published in \\"Ladies Home Journal\\" and in \\"McClure's Magazine\\". The lion's share of the book is prose but most stories either begin or end with a poem such as \\"The Runes on Weyland's Sword,\\" a title which reveals much of the flavour of the overall work.THE STORY: On Midsummer Eve in a secluded meadow just below \\"Pook's Hill,\\" a boy and his sister (Dan and Una, respectively) acted out their children's version of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" coincidentally, inside a fairy ring (of mushrooms). Such an act on the part of these two kids was surely bound to give rise to something very magical (although they never anticipated this possibility) and, in fact, it did. Shortly after their little theater, Puck appeared to them!Puck is enigmatic, for human adults at least. While he's referred to at one point as a \\"faun,\\" he seems to be part Leprechaun, part fairy, and part sorcerer. He purposefully engages in shrewd indirect speech which he knows will give rise to endless questions from Dan and Una, thus allowing him to spin his yarns and to bring forth historic figures of The Weald, one after another, over a period of days. He's also capable of conjuring a little spell which has the net effect of eliminating his actuality from the minds of the children after each day's storytelling.Puck brings on a Roman Centurion (who guarded England), a Norman Knight, a Renaissance artisan, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen (Vikings), a Chinese slave-master and many others, each of whom imparts his respective piece of England's history. There's even a dark adventure tale about a maritime journey along the African coast in search of gold where, of course, devilish monsters were encountered and a horrific battle ensued. Dan and Una are shrewdly drawn into each of these sojourns by Puck as if they had themselves been there.In summary, if you have so far missed this most excellent proto-Hobbitish legend of ancient England and beyond, my personal opinion is that you cannot order this book fast enough. I give it my highest recommendation, especially for fans of eitherAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Signet Classics)orThe Lord of the Rings. 3 Vol. Set."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"Having trouble getting into English history? Can't stand &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream?&quot; This book is for you! Una and Dan, two young British children, are playing scenes from &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; on an old hill in their farm one midsummer evening, when they have a guest- Puck himself! They are playing their scenes on Pook's Hill- Pook=Puck, Puck tells them. He soon tells them other things, they are swept back to the early days of England, where they encounter Phoenician gods, Norman invaders, Vikings and other such adventures. If you know someone who is having trouble buckling down and actually _enjoying_ English history, this could be a the key to their gaining pleasure from it. History is actually brought *alive* with this, it's not just a march of dates- it's a gathering of people."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQTYWK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgI could review Puck of Pook's Hill in my sleep. After all, I first read it--eeek--62 years ago. I've read it at least once a year ever since. I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said you need to know British history to understand the book. I certainly didn't know English history when I was five years old. What I did know was that these were delightful yarns, and I haven't changed my opinion. I did ultimately learn enough British history to know what was going on, and I know now where the playlet the children put on came from (Shakespeare, greatly abridgged), but you don't have to know anything except how to read to enjoy this book. I tried, also at the age of five, to read its sequel, Rewards and Fairies, and found myself totally lost. For that one, you need to have a grounding in English, Continental European, and American history. But I struggled through it as a five-year-old, and whenever my future reading led me into something that reminded me of the book, I suddenly understood more.These two books really should be reviewed together, but they are not aimed at the same audience. Puck is a children's book, whereas Rewards and Fairies is more for adults or at last older and more mature children.But back to Puck, I loved the book when I was five and I love it now. Anything that can command 62 years worth of love and loyalty has something going for it."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"With all the renewed interest in fantasy over the past decade, the 102 year old historical fantasy, Puck of Pook's Hill, deserves consideration. Two early 20th century children, living in Pevensey, England, have a chance encounter with the legendary Puck, who undertakes to bring them a series of first hand accounts of the history of their region. Puck introduces them to eye witnesses to such events as the Norman Conquest, the waning of the Roman occupation, and the dissolution of the monasteries. As the historic individuals relate their tales, they are suitable impressed with the children's abilities to resolve some of the mysteries that were not understood in their times. The selections of Kipling's poetry that accompany each chapter are related thematically, and pleasingly rhythmic. Recommended for grade level 4 and up through adults."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"Puck of Pook's Hill is Rudyard Kipling's attempt to convey British history in a unique way--as a kind of fantasy told to two small children. The children, Dan and Una, participate in a performance of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, and then come across an elf (Puck) who claims to be from a nearby hill (Pook's Hill). Over a series of nine chapters characters appear from British history to relate stories of their experiences to the children. The children, of course are in awe and wonder at these tales. Each chapter also begins and ends with a song.The first series of chapters deals with the adventures of Sir Richard Dalyngridge who came to England with William the Conquerer. In this story we also meet the heroic Saxon Hugh and De Aquilla the Norman warlord. Sir Richard and Hugh go on grand adventures involving being caputred by pirates and get a large quantity of gold. It is the stuff of Peter Pan and such fantasy adventures.The second story returns to Roman times and here we meet Parnesius, a Roman centurion and other figures from that time. The story involves fighting between the Romans and a group called the \\"Winged Hats,\\" as well as the internal intrigues within the Roman ranks.While several other stories provide information on different aspects of British history, these two stories form the main part of the book.It is hard to rate this book as it will have a strong appeal for some people--children interested in fantasy and history and adults with an interest in Great Britain. For others it may not be very interesting."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"I don't know what the previous &quot;reviewer&quot; was injecting but I suggest he (or more probably she) stop while any brain-cells are left.

So I ordered it off Amazon for my Kindle and thouroughly enjoyed the story. It would be good for teens and maybe even younger kids to read for themselves, or to be read aloud to youngsters, a chapter at a time, as a bedtime story."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"\\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\" is certainly not as famous as Rudyard Kipling's earlier worksThe Jungle Book (Unabridged Classics),Captains Courageous, or evenThe Complete Stalky and Co. (Oxford World's Classics). First published in 1906, it was his final novel (only an anthology of short stories came after it) and it is certainly an odd specimen of a book.Siblings Una and Dan are in the right place at the right time when they perform their abridged version of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and find that they have unknowingly called up the very cheerful, very *English* spirit of Puck. Puck (also known as Robin Goodfellow) introduces Dan and Una to a variety of figures that he plucks out of time in order to tell tales of England's history to the children. These include a Norman knight, a Roman legionary and a Jewish money-lender, all of whom lived and participated in turning-points of English history, such as the Norman Conquest, the defense of Hadrian's Wall and the signing of the Magna Carter.It is not an adventure story, as one might expect from Kipling's previous works of fiction, rather it is made up of episodic stories told by the visitors from England's past. Framed by the fairytale-esque meeting with Puck, the bulk of the novel concerns the stories told in first-person narrative to the children. Dan and Una are passive listeners, though we do get some glimpses of the world through their eyes, as we discover that they've given nicknames to most of the landmarks around their home. This links into the general theme of the book as a whole: that of the consistency and changefulness of England itself. One can sense Kipling's great love of the country in the way with which he describes it: full of mystery and beauty.The most interesting fragments are Puck's abridged history on his own people, the fairies or \\"People of the Hills\\" as he prefers. As someone who dislikes the sweet and precious portrayal of fairies that became so prevalent during and after the Victorian Era, I got a kick out of Puck's opinion on the matter: \\"the People of the Hills don't care to be confused with that painty-winged, wand-waving, sugar-and-shake-your-head set of imposters!\\"Also interesting are several recognizable elements that pop up later in the works of C.S. Lewis. Lewis, the author of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" once cited Rudyard Kipling as an inspiration to him, and there are several passages that have a familiar echo of his later books. Puck calls the children \\"Son of Adam and Daughter of Eve,\\" for example, and particular emphasis is put on the village of Pevensey, where most of the historical action takes place. Perhaps the surname of \\"Pevensie\\" for Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy was derived from this - it seems a rather large coincidence otherwise!But by today's standards, it's difficult to tell whether it still has appeal and relevance for a general reading audience. The language has certainly dated, and it's undeniable that the story itself is unusual, with none of the timelessness ofThe Jungle Book (Unabridged Classics). It's almost as if Kipling had a range of unconnected stories concerning English history that he wanted told, and so used the conceit of Puck as a vehicle in presenting them (along with a series of poems interspersed between chapters, many of which are lovely, and yet still rather piecemeal). However, as a classic book of early children's literature it is very valuable, and open-minded children may find it intriguing, particularly those who are showing the early signs of being future history-buffs."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"Most of this book is worth reading as fantasy fiction, and all of it is worth studying as an example of late Victorian attitudes. Kipling didn't handle the transitions between \\"fantasy\\" and \\"reality\\" as well as modern writers who specialize in this sort of thing, but he did pretty well. However ... every time I read this to enjoy the adventures of Dan and Una, I trip up on the character of the medieval Jew who has an inborn, racial \\"talent for gold.\\" While I don't usually think books should be updated or abridged for modern readers, I would consider excising just a few sentences of this one before letting a child read it.I recall the comments of a Chinese-American reader who discovered that the beloved Louisa May Alcott used some demeaning stereotypes of Chinese people: Suddenly, one is cast out of the category of \\"reader\\" into the category of \\"other,\\" and one never quite comes back."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"I will not recommend this book to people who are not familiar with English history. I found myself stopping in the middle to research the characters because you cannot truly appreciate the book otherwise. This took away from the book's appeal. Someone who doesn't have an idea of who the characters are and what role they played during the period will undoubtedly be completely lost, because you cannot really glean all this from the book alone. Otherwise the book was well written, as Kipling always is. It is, however not a book everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Puck of Pook's Hill","review":"This is Kipling &quot;tripling&quot; through British historyand concocting a visually elaborate fantasy forthe imaginatiion.

But flowery, exaggerated, or downright laughable phrases like \\"she had legs so long that they seemed to reach her armpits\\" stuck to my mind for sheer awfulness.The plot includes a villain that, though not exactly a stereotype, is in some ways completely unbelievable. I just had a hard time believing that Adrian's husband was capable of abandoning his wife of so many years and unborn baby without looking back. If it had been a casual romance-- all right. But abandoning a woman he loves-- I realize that this IS a romance novel, but still. I was almost wishing for some great and sensational secret behind his decision to enliven the plot a little.Bill Thingpen, the protagnoist, is engaging enough, but Adrian has almost nothing in her to interest the reader. The plot, too, is dull. I thought that romance novels are full of sensational events, as they must be. But this one was almost too \\"life like\\" to be interesting.In summary, this novel fails on both counts. As a romance, it's not particularly exciting. As a realistic novel, the existence of an implausible villain makes it not realistic enough. It tries to go both ways, and fails on both counts. I found myself skimming some parts out of sheer boredom.I give this novel 2 stars instead of 1 only because it wasn't precisely horrible...

Bangalore: WIGtake Resources, 2004. 362 pages. Paperback, $12.\\"In 2001 a newly emerging Church Planting Movement yields 48,000 new believers and 1,700 new churches in one year\\" (p. 49). How can you start a church planting movement that sweeps through an entire people group? You can't! But God can. And God can use you to facilitate His purposes.David Garrison's Church Planting Movements invites the reader to view God's blueprints for reaching all people groups- quickly! But before delving into missiological theory on how these movements work, Garrison takes the reader on a trip to eight major sectors of the world to view already existing church planting movements (CPMs). Each of these episodes narrates the events that catalyzed a full-fledged movement resulting in unreached peoples turning to Christ. He visits India, China, Africa, Latin America, Europe, North America, and the Muslim world. Next he distills the common elements from each movement into comprehensive lists of: 1.) What occurred in every CPM and 2.) What occurred in most CPMs. Some of these elements are: house churches, rapid reproduction, and lay leadership (p. 172). With the good, Garrison includes the bad. He lists the \\"seven deadly sins\\" of a CPM. These include: sequentialism (i.e. adding churches versus multiplying them), developing dependency on foreign funds, and not contextualizing the Gospel to the culture (p. 239). These elements choke a budding movement.The last section of the book challenges the reader to assess his own standing in the scheme of God's church planting movements. Then, it equips him with tools to works towards getting on mission with God. Garrison's appendix includes: a step-by-step guide for planting and reproducing a house church model (p.307-315), an apologetic to reach Muslims (p. 319), and reference materials including Scriptures that under gird all aspects of the CPM philosophy (p.331).Garrison does his presentation a service by beginning with stories of CPMs in action. People are drawn to the tales of what can actually happen, which are based in reality. These stories are inspiring, educational, and fun to read. This prepares the reader to be open to the new paradigms presented in the second half of the book, as well as builds anticipation to finally get to that point. \\"How can I start one?!\\"The text is easy to read, put into contemporary terms and concepts that the greater Christian community can digest. Missiologist David Garrison has organized this content into lists, graphs, reference tools, and easy to reference case studies in order to communicate the perhaps intimidating world of church planting and frontier missions to the average North American Christian. His positive attitude remains one that encourages rather than rebukes its Christian audience or the Christian movement in general.The content itself issues a challenge to traditional church planting strategy, not only through its exegesis of the Scriptural text, but through the distilled wisdom gained from case studies. Garrison makes a strong case for unpaid, local, lay leadership, planting rapidly reproducing house churches that exhibit characteristics of evangelism, prayer, and a persistent obedience to the Word of God. With the mention of only a few of these, certain church leaders may balk, saying \\"Is that feasible? Is that Scriptural? ... Is that comfortable?\\" Church Planting Movements fields these questions comprehensively, almost anticipating them at every turn.The section entitled \\"A Call to Action\\" seems to anticipate that its readership will only be able to really absorb a certain degree of the material presented (p. 297). It directs the reader to assess at what stage he is in his personal response to CPM philosophy. With this in mind, he can take the next steps through further awareness, education, and/or experience- jump in! In light of this, Church Planting Movements may be a book worthy of re-read, if not definitely for reference. Its charts, steps, and other helpful tools make it a valuable resource to plumb either as new awareness prompts deeper study or as new stages of a CPM develop.This book is ideal for church planters, world Christians, and pastors looking to amplify their vision to a God-size. It should not be despised by those already involved in church planting ministries, as Garrison showed many examples of principles neglected by current church planters through ignorance. In other instances, he advocates that the removal of bad principles is all it takes to set a dormant movement free (p. 239). David Garrison's book, Church Planting Movements, will be an invaluable addition to a Christian's spiritual and strategic preparation in seeing God's glory spread to the nations."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Because Garrison's book was published in 2004, the stories of church planting movements in all areas of the world, are exciting to read and more importantly, credible. He brings in numbers to support his claim that all over the world, people groups are coming to Christ in ways that parallel \\"the book of Acts\\", planting churches instead of focusing on the traditional missionary strategy of making one church grow larger in size and in population. Garrison focuses on the idea that the Gospel needs to be heard to people groups, taking the focus away from geography (there are Christians in India but there are many Indians.) The first two parts of this book focus on different movements- in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and India, South America, Europe, and North America. It is valuable that even in these last three areas (places that are considered \\"Christianized\\"), there are still groups and even nations that are spiritually poor and in need of missionary activity.Garrison works hard to take a new approach to missionary strategy, even redefining missionaries as \\"strategy coordinators\\". He also works hard to write about Church Planting Movements in places where missionary activity is dangerous, often protecting the anonymity of the people involved in certain countries, even renaming some countries themselves. Garrison uses the last sections of his book to describe essential characteristics of these movements and even points out \\"sins\\" that many missionaries commit in their work. Important tools for bringing the gospel to these people groups include media and translations of the Bible and stories into their own language, a strong emphasis on prayer, and bringing training to the people instead of requiring the people to leaver their people for training. Believers model their faith so that others can learn and grow; Christians are encouraged to worship God in ways that are culturally relevant (with their own songs and strategies for worship).Perhaps one of the most radical but at the same time fantastic points of Garrison's book is in his focus on immediate evangelism and on lay leadership. He writes about how missionaries should begin their work even before learning the language, prepared to pass on leadership and authority immediately to local leaders of authority regardless of their lack of seminary training. It is total dependence on the Holy Spirit and on God but at the same time, Garrison presents the idea of rapid growth and rapid dependence on lay leadership in a way that doesn't read as irresponsible or as a \\"plan-so-far\\" missionary strategy. The goal is to create churches that are reproducible, in their own heart language, empowering them to take on their own responsibility of evangelism to the people around them just as they have received their blessing of salvation.If there is one reason to read this book, it is because it is proof that God is working in places that Westerners are not even aware of. Churches are being created, according to biblical principles that do not even want to depend on foreign aid, worshiping in ways that westerners might even consider barbaric."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"I've one chapter left to read and I am very pleased with this book. The author writes well (though he could use a little help from an editor) and presents a very comprehensive discussion of the Church Planting Movement that is present across the world and some practical action steps that every believer can do.There is just enough coverage on the different case studies that the reader doesn't get bogged down in details but still gets a feel for what God is doing on the different continents. Then, he shifts to summarizing the characteristics of church planting movements, things that hinder them, and suggests that what we see as novel in the 21st century is actually akin to what the 1st century experienced.WARNING: The book is inspiring. If you have any kind of heart for the lost, I can't see how you can read this book without feeling like you should be doing more to unleash God's power in your Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, or the uttermost parts of the world. Get ready to be challenged.Some forgivable problems that wouldn't keep me from recommending the book:* Some of his scripture references are lifted out of context but not in a heretical way, so I kind of forgive him.* The book is pretty cheaply bound. My 9th grade English teacher taught us to flex the spine of paperbacks (for some reason I can't remember), but as soon as I did that, the glue cracked and two chunks of pages came out.Lastly, I recommend that you not buy the book from Amazon. At the time of this review, the going price is close to $50. Visit the author's website (http://churchplantingmovements.com/) to order it for under $20."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"My wife and I have been pursuing joining a church planting team for almost two years now and Garrison's book is among a dozen or so that our sending organization recommended for us before we depart. I got my copy for free through a promotion in a magazine called Mission Frontiers in exchange for writing a review, which I'm very happy to do.First a personal note: my wife and I have had a discouraging time heading towards the mission field. Mental illness, medication withdrawal, financial trouble, sickness, and lots of setbacks. So I haven't exactly picked this book up and read it straight through like a student, as I would have liked. But I really can honestly say that as I've picked it up and put it down over several months I've consistently been moved and felt a stirring towards things of the kingdom of God. Feels like bit by bit God has been restoring these desires in my wife and me..fanning the flame, so to speak..and this book has for sure been a tool in making that happen.I think my fellow reviewers have done a good job describing the general format and content, so I'll boil it down to a couple of \\"take aways\\" I got.I can't overstate how thorough and careful Garrison's research and interviews for this book were. I agree that the copy editing could be better, but it's really not distracting and it does feel like hundreds of hours of information gathering, interviews, number crunching, etc., are distilled down to a pretty cohesive (and fairly brief) read. Such a wealth of information. The scope of the project is global, after all.As I read, I had the tendency to get fascinated by and fixated on the numbers involved. Almost with a greedy, numbers-hungry bent. But I think Garrison is a faithful man of God and my attention was regularly steered back to the real matter at hand: the Gospel of Jesus colliding with human hearts. It's easy to equate numbers with success... a mega church kind of mentality that is dangerous if unchecked. But Garrison keeps returning to the heart of the issue and does a good job reminding readers that CP movements fizzle out when the emphasis is on creating a movement instead of making disciples.I think Garrison nails it on several levels. The scholarship is impressive and the stories are just, well...real. This is really what God is doing to bring a lost, hurting world full of people to Himself and life and peace."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"There were quite a few wisdom nuggets that stuck out to me while reading David Garrison's book:-The Church Planting Movement (CPM) principle holds that \\"smaller is better\\"-CPM's are often launched among the most least likely candidates -- unreached people groups-For a healthy CPM, it is important for outsiders (missionaries) to become less and less dominant-\\"Whenever foreigners linger too long, refusing to turn over the reigns of church leadership, they are depriving the new church of the power to fall the power to rise\\"-\\"Mankind without Jesus Christ may bear God's image, but not his glory\\"-In India, finance is not a problem as most house churches run on 'low' or 'no' budget -- instead of sermonizing on stewardship and tithing, leaders focus on completing the Great Commission-Kui Christians focused on training church members, rather than professional clergy, to become the frontline evangelists and church planters-The prayer of a Chinese missions worker: (1) God, do something so supernatural it can only be explained that You did it (2) Let the work last (3) Let the work not be dependent on me to keep it going-\\"Part of the missionary vocation is working yourself out of a job\\"I enjoyed this book, though some sections (such as portions of Part Two: Around the World) became a little tedious to read. The book really shines in the practical application of its findings. Part Three, Part Four, and the Additional Resources bring the review up to 4 stars.If you're looking for a \\"big picture\\" resource for church planting movement principles, this is an excellent, solid, and inspiring tool."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"In short, a great book for anyone interested in Church Planting Movements (CPMs). Garrison not only gives a great picture of what God is doing all over the world by means of case studies on actual examples taking place among various People Groups, but breaks down the specifics of a CPM, and empowers the reader with the proper understanding & tools to take part wherever they are! I found myself excitedly reading page after page, praising God for each stirring movement, and turning to the next page to find more.Part I simply introduces the reader to CPMs, or \\"a rapid multiplication of indigenous churches planting churches that sweeps through a people group or population segment\\" (p. 20). After describing the importance of these movements, one being the spread of God's glory across the earth, he jumps into examples of where these movements are taking place in Part II. Providing rich examples from all over the globe, from India to Latin America, and yes, even in North America, Garrison describes different groups of people among whom God is creating these movements by means of His obedient laborers. A great diversity of cultures and peoples is represented among these CPMs.Next, in Part III in a very readable manner, Garrison breaks down the common characteristics in all CPMs, one being prayer: \\"the soul's deepest cry of rebellion against the way things are\\" (p. 176). Also covered are factors that show up in many movements, but not all. Garrison includes examples of CPMs found in scripture, which were very helpful for a good picture of how these looked in the New Testament times, and the similarities they retain today. A list of the Seven Deadly Sins for CPMs follows, giving a good picture for things that can kill a movement.Garrison finishes with practical tools for the reader. How can we get involved? What role can we play in God's movements? I think Garrison did a great job of informing the reader of what exactly is going on, and what roles are wide open ready to be filled. This section draws the reader in and challenges what role they might play, and how involved they are willing to become in God's plan to redeem His world.This book is an exciting read, easy for any person no matter how familiar they are with Church Planting Movements, and engaging. I highly recommend reading, thinking through its implications and asking God what part He has for us."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"David Garrison seems to be the current expert on Church Planting. The first part of the book reports on the church planting that has already been done in various areas of the world. It is very exciting to read how God is working in parts of the world that have been very hard to reach for Christ. The rest of the book is the more practical way of how to implement this type of church planting."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Research was well done. Practical insights helpful. Really enjoyed reading it and have done so twice. Will probably end up doing so a third time at some point."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"David Garrison takes a descriptive approach in his book to define the phenomenon called church planting movements whereby churches reproduce rapidly. In his book he outlines a brief history of his personal involvement with the study as well as an overview of the general parameters that define a church planting movement or CPM. A scientific study by no means, Garrison's book is based on observations and reports from International Mission Board field personnel, national conventions and other protestant sources. Throughout these narrative descriptions, he sprinkles CPM teaching points such as the POUCH method typical in CPM churches.In part 2, he tells the geographic story of how church planting movements are breaking out all over the world. In Asia he begins the story with India's billion-strong population as he describes a CPM incidence across several geographic points resulting in 4000 new churches planted within a 7 year period. He then moves to China to describe how a CPM there has resulted in a rate of 30,000 baptisms per day and thousands of house churches being planted each year. He describes other cases of CPM in Southeast Asia and especially highlights the Singapore home-cell mega church movement that has led to the forty-fold explosion of evangelical Christian adherents.Africa is also emphasized for its CPMs among the Muhaber in Ethiopia, the Maasai in Tanzania and the Teso people of Uganda. He then turns his attention to the Islamic world where some CPMs are breaking out in undisclosed locations. Latin America has also experienced CPMs among the Kekchi people of Guatemala. Interestingly, Europe seems to be the least frequent in the CPM phenomena, but there are emerging movements among refugees and gypsies there.In North America, Garrison points back to the nineteenth century for one example of a church planting movement, a phenomenon considered a revival at the time. Other examples of protestant CPM-like phenomena include a cell church model in Pennsylvania and explosive church growth at Saddleback, Willow Creek, and the Bethany World Prayer Center.In part 3, he outlines 10 universal elements present in observed CPMs. Then he lists 10 characteristics of most CPMs. Finally, he lists observed barriers to CPM that must be removed because they are the seven deadly sins against God's movement.In chapter 12, Garrison appears to deal with the theology of a church planting movement by describing the biblical basis for CPM characteristics. Only at the end of the book does he deal with practical or logistical issues like the definition of church, how volunteers can be used even though outsiders must keep a low profile, the role of foreign funding and formal theological education in a CPM environment.Chapter 16 is a practical workbook for identifying and managing the universal elements, characteristics and obstacles.Although he did a good job in describing CPMs occurring throughout the world, there are a few areas where Garrison falls short. He somewhat fails to communicate that these observations are from a descriptive rather than prescriptive approach. In fact the entire book format lends itself to being a self-help document for churches wishing to start their own CPM. Because he is not explicit about these matters, the tone of the book is more of a how-to manual rather than a celebratory documentation. He even includes a whole section entitled \\"Launch Pad\\" as a diagnostic workbook for individual churches to discover their CPM readiness. In an evangelical world full of quick fixes for church growth, this propensity toward prescription weakens the book's overall effect."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"We are very interested in mission work. This is a wonderful book on church planting movements. We were very pleased with the service too."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Church Planting Movements is one of the most exciting books you could ever read. The insights gathered from movements around the world are great and highly useful. However, much of the real value comes from reading how God has moved in a variety of ways and settings to bring about great spiritual awakening and church planting movements."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Church Planting Movements by David Garrison was an eye opening experience for me. As a follower of Christ it is such an encouragement to see the ways God is working all over the world. David does a great job of not only presenting different movements but also analyzing them and pointing out what each one of them has in common.Throughout the book David does his best not to present any method or system. It is refreshing to read a book so lacking in any sort of an agenda, outside of getting caught up in the work that God is doing. If anything it is more of a \\"best practices\\" of church planting movements, comprising examples, commonalities and frequent mistakes with a scriptural basis for all of it.The only reservations I had about the book, and really this is only nitpicking, is that some of the scripture used to support certain points was taken out of context. The points themselves were still biblical, only he could have found better support in other areas of scripture instead of settling the tidbits that weren't really applicable when looking at the larger context.That being said, whether you're looking to see a movement happen in your community, or simply want to learn how to lift up those who are working to see a movement happen where you are or across the seas, Church Planting Movements is a must read.Disclosure: I requested a copy of this book from Mission Frontiers for review."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"I requested a copy of this book to review through a promotion in Mission Frontiers magazine. Which, by the way, has had excellent articles this year with the March-April issue focusing on church planting movements. It can also be accessed online. Just google it.Although laden with facts and figures, this book tells an inspiring story. That story is summed up in the sub-title...How God is Redeeming a Lost World. Garrison's classic survey of church planting movements (CPM's)is simply a must read for anyone interested in the expansion of Christ's kingdom. In passing conversation many of us in the west have heard reports about house churches springing up left and right in China and a few select places. However, this book puts facts, figures, and principles right in front of you in such a way that brings those vague reports to life, and provides an analysis that makes it possible for someone who has never personally witnessed a CPM, to \\"peak\\" into the continuation of the book of Acts. The Holy Spirit is certainly still ACTing in mighty ways and this book lays out objective reports from the field that give us tremendous insight into the common threads by which He is sewing a tapestry for His glory.Along with others I know, I have been influenced by this book in two primary ways. The first being just the sheer inspiration and vision that it imparts knowing that the kingdom is rapidly multiplying all over the earth. The second, equally as influential, are the transferable principles that have been gleaned from thorough observation and examination of multiple case studies across a wide variety of places & contexts. Discovering common factors that consistently slow down movements and those that consistently act as catalysts for movements are pure jewels of wisdom to find. And any wise disciple-making practitioner would do well to observe & put them into effect wherever he or she may be working to fulfill the Great Commission.I hope this book continues to ignite a greater passion for reaching unreached people groups and that this passion would cause many people to DO something about it. I also pray that, as more people read this book and others like it, that church planters in the west would not settle for the same old paradigms of planting churches, but would risk all by implementing the same principles found in CPM's in order to push us closer to the edge of seeing rapidly developing movements locally.The following links are very useful for expanding your understanding of this crucial subject.

I thoroughly appreciated this little book in its simplicity. David did not write more than he needed too. He laid out the need, the vision, and the how-to in a way that is easily grasped. This text is perfect for any person who is stepping outside of Western Christendom trying to figure out how engage the world in a more biblical way.Garrison defines Church Planting Movements (CPM) as \\"A rapid and exponential increase of indigenous churches planting churches within a given people group or population segment (8).\\" The key words being rapid, exponential, indigenous, planting. If one can grasp these things then we are able to replicate this model.I really appreciated the structure of the text and how succinct it is. He lays out the core components of a CPM in chapters 3-5 with a list of ten components each. He also provides the leader with answers to FAQ's and obstacles. The stories from countries around the world paint a clear picture of how CPM's work.I have two criticisms of the text. The first is that in the definition of a healthy church there is no mention of church discipline. This is a key component to keeping a church healthy in the long run. The absence of such has led to the downfall of most of Western Christendom. The second is that there are no stories of this happening in a Western context. While I understand that David works for the International Mission Board, if this is going to be global then it needs to include examples of this working in all contexts. It may be that this is not happening in the West. However, it seems unlikely since I can think of a number of CPM's that are being developed in metro Detroit, MI.All in all, I would strongly recommend this book. It will be especially helpful for leaders who are moving away from the Boomer Generation's \\"If you build it, they will come\\" mentality and the \\"attractional\\" mode of church."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"This book was extremely helpful to me. As a future church planter I found David Garrison's assessments very helpful and encouraging. I was particularly impacted by his section on The Muslim World. My family and I have been called to church plant Among Muslim people coming to the United States. This book was of a great help to me in giving me guidance on what a good church plant looks like and how to begin that process, weighing the successes and failures of others. I found the appendix on the Qur'anic Bridge helpful because it presents the gospel in a contexualized way! I look forward to using this resource on the field and I know that God placed this book in my hands purposefully at the right time! I applaud Garrison for the effort and detail he provided on so many regions. It was uplifting to see how God is redeeming a lost world in so many regions!"},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"\\"Church Planting Movements, How God is Redeeming a Lost World\\", by David Garrison, WIGTake Resources, Arkadelphia, AR, printed in Bangalore India 2004 by David Garrison, 360 pages, Paperback, $18.95.In my opinion this book should be read by all Christian leaders at any level, or anyone concerned about God's pattern for the church in the 21st century and beyond.Dr. Garrison begins this remarkable account of a modern day move of God in the autumn of 1994 when the annual reports from missionaries from locations as diverse and far-flung as India, Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia suddenly began to report a quantum leap in the number of conversions and new churches in their respective mission fields. In the introductory chapter, How It All Began (p. 17) he relates how a missionary strategist working with a North Indian people group reported phenomenal growth from 28 churches in 1989 to more than 4,500 churches with an estimated 300,000 baptized believers by the year 2,000, due to the \\"eruption of a church planting movement.\\"In the second chapter, \\"What are Church Planting Movements?\\" Dr. Garrison describes his approach to writing this remarkable book as well as providing the reader with valuable insights into the unique characteristics he and his colleagues have observed in these modern day miracles. A careful reading of this chapter will provide the reader with a good foundation to grasp the uniqueness and enormity of these modern day works of God. Perhaps more importantly, the advice of this reader/reviewer is to make a decision to ask God for the grace to adopt the author's attitude and spirit regarding how to process the information presented about CPM's. Rather than attempting to summarize the book, I have chosen to use the limited space available for this review to describe the author's treatment of the subject and the methodology behind the writing of the book because I was so impacted by his wisdom and humility regarding this subject. I don't believe his perspective can be improved on, and the best way to convey it to you is to share a few direct quotes from this chapter of the book (p.21-23):\\"A Church Planting Movement (CPM) is a rapid multiplication of indigenous churches planting churches that sweeps through a people group or population segment.....You'll note that this definition describes what is happening in CPM's rather than prescribing what could or should happen. Throughout this book we'll try to remain faithful to what God is actually doing in these movements and avoid the temptation to prescribe or predict how he ought to be working. By clinging to a descriptive approach, we are humbly admitting that the work is not ours; it belongs to God. So rather than trying to squeeze him into our flawed predictions or prescriptions, we'll let him be God and we will alter our understanding and behavior to be on mission with him.\\"Taking five key words from the above definition of CPM's, in less than three pages (p21-23) the author presents five principles that form the heart of CPM's wherever they have occurred.The author's treatment of one of these five words/CPM concepts will serve to illustrate how this book will likely challenge your preconceptions about church and ministry:(p.22) \\"The third word is 'indigenous'. Indigenous literally means \`generated from within', as opposed to started by outsiders. In CPM's the first church or churches may be started by outsiders, but very quickly the momentum shifts from the outsiders to the insiders. Consequently, within a short time, the new believers coming to Christ in CPM's may not even know that a foreigner was ever involved in the work. In their eyes the movement looks, acts, and feels homegrown.\\"Though all five of these key words point to important principles for success in CPM's, the author gives case after case where violation of this particular principle led to hindering or downright stopping of a burgeoning CPM.The author describes a \\"special type of missionary that figures prominently in many CPM's that is called a Strategy Coordinator, who takes responsibility for developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy....to bring an entire people group to faith in Jesus Christ.\\" Dr. Garrison claims, and gives convincing evidence, that \\"this new paradigm of 21st century missionaries is reshaping the world of missions and contributing immeasurably to the spread of Church Planting Movements.\\" He also reports that \\"CPM's are surfacing in all corners of the globe...\\" and that \\"researchers are monitoring more than thirty locations (of CPM's) around the world.\\"I believe that any believer, especially those called to serve the church as one of the \\"gift ministries\\" of Ephesians 4:11, that finds the courage and humility to emulate the author's approach to this subject as they read this book will be deeply impacted, as I was. I urge you to get this book and read it carefully, prayerfully and with humility, consciously posturing your heart to allow yourself and your preconceptions of church ministry and leadership to be challenged. I'll predict you will be very glad you did."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"CHURCH PLANTING MOVEMENTS:How God Is Redeeming a Lost World.By David GarrisonArkadelphia, AR: WIGTake Resources. 2004 (2007 Reprint). 361 pp. $18.95;paper. ISBN 0-9747562-0-2.Reviewed by Roger E. Hedlund, PhD, Director Emeritus, Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies, Chennai, India.Have you ever wondered about Southern Baptist hidden secrets? If so, this is the book for you. The International Mission Board's Regional Leader for South Asia, David Garrison, author of this book, served previously as Associate Vice President for Global Strategy. This book reveals how God is bringing millions to new life in Christ worldwide through Church Planting Movements (CPMs). CPMs are defined as a way God is drawing lost persons into saving community with himself.Garrison takes us on a modern-day journey up the legendary \\"Silk Road\\" from Jerusalem to Mongolia. Along the way we visit Africa, India, China and various points in between on six continents. A virtual tour seeing more than 4,500 new churches with 300,000 baptized believers among one ethnic community in India; growth from less than a million to more than five million Christians in one province of China; 150,000 Muslim Background Believers in one Muslim country, and more.We are exposed to seven deadly sins: blurred vision (having no common goal), improving the Bible (adding tradition), sequentialism (inch-by-inch progress), unsavory salt (corrupt, comatose or contentious Christians), the Devil's candy (e.g. money), alien abduction (foreign forms or foreign dependency), and blaming God (excuses for failed responsibility).Ten Commandments for Church Planting Movements include essential principles such as saturation prayer, training all believers for outreach, and discerning what God is doing--and then join Him. Recommended models include POUCH churches: P: Participative Bible Study and Worship, O: Obedience to God's Word, U: Unpaid multiple church leaders, C: Cell groups of believers meeting in H: Homes or storefronts.Read the book to find out more."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Church Planting Movements is a wonderful book as an inspiration and guidance for those looking to start church planting or already in the thick of it. It is an easy read as well. The book starts with some strategies used and stories from each continent. The story of Sharif's struggles and successes within the Muslim world is very powerful and inspiring. It is the most impactful story of a church planting movement within the book. The second half consists of guidelines to follow, including the elements that every movement contains and the pitfalls to avoid. This doesn't have specific strategies that work every time. It is not that type of book. Each movement should be catered to its target. But it does guide you in basic elements to look for within a church planting movement and practices to avoid. This book is a wonderful tool for anyone interested in church planting and even those just interested in how God has been working throughout the world."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"In this eminently understandable and extremely practical book David Garrison \\"reverse engineers\\" the phenomenon of the explosion of Christian churches occuring across the globe over the past 15 or so years.Garrison defines Church Planting Movements (CPM) as a rapid multiplication of indigenous Christian Churches whose raison d'etre is to plant new churches that sweep through a specific ethnic group or population segment. His interest was spawned by a 1994 report from North India that detailed a sudden explosion of Christian churches after intentionally abandoning traditional missionary practices and adopting what Garrison defines as CPM principles. He says that he wrote this book for \\"any Christian who desires to understand how God is redeeming a lost world...especially for those who want to be on mission with him, sharing in his great salvation story.\\"His work is divided into four major sections beginning with a personal statement of how he first became aware of this phenomenon of CPM, what CPM is and what it is not, and then making a case for the importance of understanding the CPM.In section two he describes the extent of this sudden and extensive embrace of Jesus surveying documentation from India and China, then the rest of Asia followed by the Muslim world, then Latin America, and finally Europe and the U.S. This is almost 1/3 of the book.In section three he seeks to extract the principles that seem to undergird CPM. These are grouped as 10 universal elements found in EVERY CPM, 10 elements found in MOST CPM, and 7 obstacles (\\"Deadly Sins\\") that CPM face. This section constitutes 30% of the book. Each element is described in some detail and the section ends with 9 FAQ's about CPM.The final section is written to give practical tools to the person(s) seeking to develope a CPM within their own community. There are assessment tools, strategies, and a detailed report of an actual CPM in China.The book even includes three appendices that come from CPM practitioners. Appendix one is the detailed training program used by the profiled group in China. Appendix two is a model for participative Bible study within the context of house church worship gatherings. Appendix three is a very detailed apologetic for use by people working among Muslims. Finally the book ends with a Biblical Index which cites Biblical support for each of the 10 universal elements found in every CPM.Garrison holds a PhD from the University of Chicago, has done missionary work in Hong Kong, Egypt, Tunesia, Europe and India, and currently serves as the Southern Baptist Convention's International Mission Board Regional Leader for South Asia. Despite his academic and experiential expertise his book is written such that the newest missionary and the lay person without formal theological training would not only understand but become inspired to practice CPM within their own contexts. And who knows...the book may even undercut the megachurch fascination in the U.S. and lead us back to first century A.D. Christian community and outreach."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"Anyone interested in how Christianity is being spread in this world should read this book. It is an eye opener."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"David Garrison's Church Planting Movements is a dynamic work that is very insightful and motivating at the same time. He describes what God is doing all over the world and gives practical advice on how to co-operate with God developing these movements in any ministry context.For those who are desirous of seeing the gospel spread to all peoples, Garrison clarifies the core components of CPM's and helps his readers understand the significance of each. As he takes the reader from continent to continent, he shares what is similar in each movement.By describing the Universal Elements and giving the biblical foundation for each a strong case is made for giving this information serious consideration. Garrison also identifies ways in which sincere Christians can unintentionally create obstacles to the very movements they want to see develop.The practical ideas given in this book would be valuable coaching for anyone who wanted to be part of a living, growing church planting movement. I highly recommend this book for your consideration. It has had a significant impact on my thinking and is changing my leadership agenda."},{"Title":"Church Planting Movements","review":"David Garrison's book \\"Church Planting Movements: How God is Redeeming a Lost World\\" contains 360 pages divided into 17 chapters plus a number of appendices. The main aim of this book is to document the modern day explosion of cell and house churches that are termed \\"church planting movements\\" or CPMs. These are numerically outstripping more traditional approaches to evangelism and discipleship through typical church structures and mission agencies.There are several strengths to this work. First, Garrison is a seasoned missionary, has a doctorate degree, and is recognized as a pioneer in understanding CPMs. He knows of what he speaks. Second, the stories are inspiring and show the reader that God indeed is active through, often ordinary, individuals and groups around the world. Third, although the book challenges all followers of Christ to rethink what the church is and how it can more effectively function from a strategic and scriptural viewpoint, it does not deliberately make the reader feel guilty if he/she is not seeing God move this way in their own context. Fourth, this is a thorough and intelligent work on CPMs and is not used as an opportunity to emotionally react to or bash the institutional church. Fifth, there are seven chapters spent on drawing out the practical principles and patterns that are common to these CPMs that the reader can prayerfully seek to apply to their own situation. Finally, there are an adequate number of charts and graphs for those of us who appreciate some numerical analysis of what is going on.There are several drawbacks too. As with any work of its kind, it is only a snapshot of what is going on and even now has become out of date. Specifically, some of the CPMs described have either grown far beyond what has been reported, or have reached a plateau in growth, since the time of the original writing. The danger of such a book is that many will probably attempt to mechanistically implement the factors identified as integral to CPMs in order to see church planting and growth in their context. However, if they fail, they could easily become disillusioned or feel guilty, wondering if there was something wrong with them or if they had missed God's moment for them. Although Garrison wisely makes some cautionary remarks here and there in this regard, readers should be reminded that God has his own times and seasons in bringing in the harvest that are outside of our control, regardless of how hard we try to implement all the ingredients that are supposed to lead to a CPM.All in all, this is an absolutely essential book for those interested in knowing about and getting involved in what God is doing in the world today through CPMs. An excellent work!

In \\"The Demon Pope,\\" Sylvester II's love of wisdom and learning allow him to easily best Old Lucifer.Garnett gently pokes fun at humanity at its worst, suggesting that foolishness may be our predominant sin.

Ortega y Gasset,as he does in all his books and essays, captures the historical progression of ideas better than anyone else of his generation. Whether your interested in Modernist art or poetry(European or American), this book will help to elucidate important intellectual currents and better able you to challenge and explore many of the underlying philosophical and aesthetic constructs that influenced Ortega y Gasset's &quot;generation[s]&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature (Princeton Paperbacks, 128)","review":"This book contains five essays. The first is called \\"The Dehumanization of Art.\\" Basically, the author says that art is just art or at least this is what the conclusion modern artists have reached. Art is merely a form of play and magic, having no real connection to the real world. It is a thing apart from reality, an expression of imagination.This point of view surprised me in that I didn't expect Ortega y Gasset to subscribe to it. His view of art does not appeal to man's need psychologically to have his values projected on a large canvas, movie screen or novel. He seems to agree that dehumanization in art is a good if necessary and inevitable. His view is also restricted to painting, so what he says about art, dehumanized or not, is very narrow and is contradicted by his views of the novel as art.This essay gave me a clearer idea of how modern art theorists think about modern painting, although I was not convinced that the paintings by Poussin, for example, or Titian, are therefore merely patrician and false because of the inarticulate theories of modern artists' vision of painting.Ortega y Gasset's essay, \\"Notes on the Novel,\\" I liked very much. For me, this was the outstanding essay in the whole book, largely due to my preference for ideas on the novel. Ortega y Gasset seems here to have an understanding of the novel as it is, as novels have been produced in time and in history, not as a work produced through some theory or as viewed by some particular theoretical model of what the novel ought to be. HIs view of the novel as a prison was the single, most touching insight that this essay provided. How this prison-like effect is created was also a fascinating piece of intellectual importance in the study. He says that this prison-like effect in the novel is produced by \\"an immense agglomeration of detail.\\" (T.C. Boyle anyone?) \\"Or trivia.\\"I think Ortega y Gasset is absolutely correct in this assessment. For what is a novel without its details?I liked the philosopher's evaluation of Dostoevsky's novels as having \\"the form of life,\\" that his characters do not act like his descriptions of them, just as persons in reality do not act in accordance with our impressions of them. I think Ortega y Gasset might have been implicitly referring to the epistemology of the normal or average person here.Too, I felt that the author's emphasis on the daily life in the novel was warmingly accurate of my own experience reading a novel. He says that the treatment of the daily life of its characters is what makes the novel what it is. His examples, given as proof of the daily life in the novel, were Proust's \\"Remembrances of Things Past\\" or \\"Wilhelm Meister\\" by Goethe or novels by Balzac . That the author added that the novel is typically big and sluggish, unlike a poem, for instance, was astonishing to me because of its obviousness and simplicity of truth. I had the feeling while reading this essay of discovering the strange in the familiar.Finally, I was impressed and relieved to learn that Ortega y Gasset claims that a minimum of plot or action is important to the novel. He himself finds that the characters, ensconced in their daily lives, ensconced in the immense agglomeration of trivia, is alone sufficient to keep them imprisoned in the novel and that plot's purpose is to provide the reader some interest by which to contrive to see and to attend to the characters' lives. Thus, too much plot is merely clever and forces one outside of the novel's prison. A novel is thus provincial and sluggish. It favors the inner life for contemplation. Action is necessary but minimal. A novel is full of atmosphere, minuteness, dailiness.The essay \\"On Point of View in the Arts\\" focuses on painting, on the evolution of perspective and vision in painting. His views were refreshing to me. I could \\"see\\" the evolution he depicted from Giotto to Cezanne. This evolution has to do with proximate vision and distant vision, a movement from the external foreground to the internal background. What the author helped me to see astonished me.\\"In Search of Goethe from Within\\" was a prolix essay, disturbing, confusing and desperate. Basically, Ortega y Gasset indicts Goethe for having disavowed his \\"I\\" for Goethe's refusal to see he was a shipwrecked man. What was confusing was the author's equation between vocation or career and self. The point the author wants to make in this essay is that man is shipwrecked and he must make himself in the midst of danger, uncertainty and contingency. But just how Goethe could have become himself and just how man goes about becoming himself was only hinted at in this essay. Ortega y Gasset seems guilty of idle casuistry here with this essay -- for all that is unclear and confusing in the concepts he uses.In the last essay, \\"Self and Other,\\" the author makes a pitch for man withdrawing into himself for purposes of contemplation and greater survival. He sees the modern world as split into two factions: those who seek contemplation for contemplation's sake, apart from action and survival. These are idealists. And the other faction are those who seek action, apart from contemplation. Ortega y Gasset sees the connection between thinking and survival but just what is the nature of that connection, what is the means of its maintenance and continuity, and how to determine whether one has made the connection, Ortega y Gasset does not say or even hint at an answer. He is against ideas as culture, as a value in and of themselves if considered apart from man's survival. He recognizes that ideas are dangerous and many of them are blatantly false. But how to unify thought and action, how to discover what in culture is valuable in man in terms of his survival, Ortega y Gasset does not examine in this essay. Thus, this essay had the effect of sporting an opinion without substantive proof or explanation.204 pages"},{"Title":"The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature (Princeton Paperbacks, 128)","review":"Ortega y Gasset was not just another philosopher. He's a thinker that raised philosophy to the level of art. As such, his analysis of art is a work of art by itself. His insights into aesthetics are overwhelming and inexhaustable. This book is not just a book about art; it's a vast meditation on modern human condition. Before one reads any art criticism one should read this one so that one will taste the truth of the art. Ortega y Gasset writing reminds us that contemporary art critic is so dull and out of touch with its subject. After reading Ortega's book one would have difficulties reading any other art critique."},{"Title":"The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature (Princeton Paperbacks, 128)","review":"Very clearly written, knowledgeable, funny, and written to be pertinent in any time period, today, fifty years ago, or fifty years in the future. A compilation of five essays, the first of which is the titular essay about the 'unpopularity' of 'new art'. The essay describes how, before modern art, viewers of art saw themselves in the characters that the art depicted and empathized with their joy/grief, etc. Since modern art (my copy was published in 1956) usually does not have a relatable human protagonist, it is unpopular in the eyes of the 'masses'. It goes on to describe what this 'new art' is about and how it should be understood.A really lucid read and pertinent read, even fifty plus years later. The ideas about the 'new art' the author refers to apply to any art discipline (theater, poetry, music, etc.) and he means them to work for new ideas in any creative point in history. Highly recommended book for anyone interested in art; an easy read and, in under 200 pages, you can increase your understanding and appreciation of any art form in a day or two."},{"Title":"The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature (Princeton Paperbacks, 128)","review":"I read the original version in Spanish and was so impressed by Ortega y Gasset's analysis of \\"new\\" (= modern) art, that I bought a copy in English for a friend.

I don't mind that the main character was unlikable. I don't mind that her friends and co-workers were the kind of people I tend to avoid. I do mind when authors bash the \\"African American Bourgeoisie\\". Charles Dickens is the master of the \\"noble poor\\" theme. With Monroe, I never felt that her character was noble, just an angry, bitter, self obsessed woman. Ann was her alter ego in the story. Ann, an African American woman with a college degree and could speak several languages. ..was evil? The message I got from this book was \\"you better stay away from college..young black women of America..it can mess you up, it can mess up your kids too.\\" I guess I am not a fan of that brand of thinking.

After she is violated she decides to \\"take control\\" of her life and get a new job and a new outlook on life. Unfortunately, her taking control causes more trouble and she finds herself in another situation that leads to nowhere good. Even though Trudy leads a depressing life, Monroe makes it a very engaging story. I think a lot of women can identify with Trudy at one time in their lives or another. Life sometimes gets routine with waking up, going to a job you hate and coming home watching TV every day. But Trudy manages to spice things up and therefore allows the reader to do so as well."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"This book had me hooked from the first page.

How about taking exotic trips, buying expensive clothes, dinners filled with lobster and champagne all on someone else's tab? That's exactly what Trudy Bell does in the novel In Sheep's Clothing by Mary Monroe. Trudy's life has been pretty mundane living with her dad and in a 10-year relationship with her boyfriend James. After being robbed while working at her father's liquor store, Trudy quits and gets hired as a secretary for a travel agency. As the secretary, Trudy has access to the company credit card in order to pay office expenses. She decides to have a little fun and treats herself to lavish lunches and designer wardrobes at the company's expense. Since using the credit card is so easy, it's time to take it to another level and focus on her boss Ann Oliver. Ann is classy, elegant and stylish, everything Trudy wants to be. But when Ann treats her as a second-class citizen, Trudy plots the ultimate revenge and takes her identity. But Trudy may have more than she bargained for, as becoming Ann Oliver could turn deadly.Mary Monroe does an incredible job of bringing this tale of identity theft to life. In Sheep's Clothing has humor and edge-of-your-seat drama. Mary Monroe always features real characters that always find themselves on the wrong side of the law and drags their friends down with them. Trudy is no different because she drags her best friend into this web of deceit as well. Monroe's characters also cross that very fine line between right and wrong, which makes her novels stand out. She consistently brings novels that are pleasurable reads. While reading this novel, you'll keep wondering if Trudy will ever get caught, and what will happen if her dad and boyfriend find out.

Can you make your protagonist symphathetic enough for us to feel that their actions are justified? Can you make us dislike the antagonist enough, to feel that they are deserving of such treatment? I was interested to see how a story like this would work and where national best-selling author Mary Monroe, would take us in this her sixth novel.If I had to use one word to describe this effort it would be \\"What?\\". It seemed to me that great effort was made to keep the main characters somewhat grey and likeable, instead they were underdeveloped and as a result, completely unsympathetic. I am still trying to figure out what compelling reasons the protagonist had for choosing to steal as she did. The death of her mom sixteen years earlier? Having a boss who acted like a boss and not a sistah girl friend? The antagonist, who was supposed to be an evil woman, was more a mystery than anything else and in my mind, was someone to be ignored, rather than seek revenge on. Freddie (Trudy's best friend and supposed voice of reason) was simply wishy washy. The lesser parts the characters had to play, the more stereotypical they became.Ms. Monroe's writing is plain and painfully convuluted and the story often took off in tangents that neither moved the story along nor provided any insight. The climax was pat and rushed and ultimately there were no lasting reprecussions and no redemption for Trudy.There is so much lost potential here. The opportunity to go deeper and create a compelling tale was lost. I am truly disappointed and frustrated.

They encourage her to drink (Trudy has to, to tolerate Ann) and use Ann's company credit card for her on purposes. It soon gets out of control.

Trudy also has her comical best friend Freddie and her man Lobo, who seem to help Trudy dig an even deeper hole for herself. Trudy eventually steals Ann's identity and starts living the \\"good\\" life(with Lobo's help) of fine dining, nice clothes and mini-vacations that she tells Otto and James are work-related retreats. They also don't know Trudy is gettin' her groove on with exotic men, on the trips and eventually in her secret home! Trudy learns that Ann is into some crazy stuff with a Jamacian named Giles.

Trudy will soon learn that being Ann Oliver isn't all it cracked up to be, and by the time she realizes that, it may be too late!Ms. Monroe did her thing on this one, her writing style is truly unique and refreshing. There are a lot of funny parts that will have you cracking up! This book does not dissapoint!"},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"I enjoyed this book and was happy that I ignorned some of the negative ratings this book received. Ms. Monroe touched a topic that is happening so much at this day in age.She also touched on valuable lessons that everyone should remember - jeaously does not pay and be careful what you wish for.She did an excellent job and I would highly recommend this book, especially to those individuals who are tempted to steal someone's identity. You never know what you are getting yourself into. Good job Mary."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"All I can say is this book was wonderful, thrilling and even heart stopping at times. I won't reveal the details but please, please read this book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"As always, Mary Monroe hit the target with this one. The characters were vivid and well developed. The plot was well designed and enthralling. She keeps you turning pages to see where the next complication will arise. Out of the blue you never guess it is coming. I could not put this one down and can not wait for the next genesis."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"Mary Monroe writes such incredibly good novels. Her latest; In Sheep's Clothing is the story of Trudy a young woman who is at the very edge of being totally dissatisfied with her life, Trudy is equally dissatisfied with her tired long-time fianc&eacute; James. James is a simple man who is satisfied with the ordinary.In the first chapter, she becomes the victim of robbery and sexual assault while working the cash register at her elderly father's liquor store in the hood of South Bay city city, California. South Bay City, a mostly blue-collar city of about 50,000 residents was in desperate need of urban renewal.Ms. Monroe creates a very believable but extraordinary character in Trudy. Monroe's characters are never ordinary people. They are never predictable. Trudy's widowed father with whom she lived was a complaining sickly man who used his illness to hold Trudy hostage to her dissatisfied life. However; after the robbery; she makes some changes.In Sheep's Clothing is a rambunctious tale of identity theft, which is a very serious matter. Yet; Monroe gives you a seriously funny novel about how easy it can be to steal someone's identity in this technical society. Trudy uses the personal information of one of her supervisors at her new job to open credit several credit card accounts. She gets deeper and deeper in debt it becomes a habit for her. She gets so tied up in what she can do and be as her supervisor Ann that she loses all sense of reality and almost loses her life. Ann wasn't who Trudy though she was and Trudy found herself in big trouble.Before the story ends, Trudy has racked up hundreds of thousands in debt but she also had a complete makeover and extensive designer wardrobe. She treated her friends to fine dining and vacation travel. Her life became all she wanted it to be but the moral to this story is that there is no free lunch in America. At some point you have to pay the piper.I really enjoyed this novel. Mary Monroe doesn't disappoint. Fans of her previous best sellers, God Don't Love Ugly, the sequel God Still Don't Love Ugly and the riveting The Upper Room will be pleased to find that she has returned with another winning read.I give it a 4.5 rating because it was almost perfect.

Her character's always make you feel like you know them. Written in true Monroe style. This is the story of Trudy who appears to be living a mundane life. She lives with her dad who doesn't seem to let her breathe without knowing about it. She is engaged to James which is only because that is what her father wants, she starts a new and exciting job at a travel agency where she starts to meet the \\"REAL WORLD\\". Then somehow she steals her supervisor's identity and things get hairy from there. If you are a true fan of real AA fiction you will pick this book up. Well done."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"Interesting but slow, for the first time I am disappointed in Monroe. I have always said that Mary Monroe was my favorite female author (I would say author in general but I love Eric Jerome Dickey) but this one was not her best.

If you are a true Monroe fan than you'll understand my disappointment in her."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"For Trudy Bell, life has become boring and monotonous. She is living with her father, working in his store as a clerk, and dealing with his dependency on her. She has also spent the last ten years involved with a man who is about to marry her. Although James Young is considered a good catch and her father approves of him wholeheartedly, Trudy feels the passion is missing from their relationship. She is in a rut and desires change from the dull humdrum of being plain old Trudy. After being robbed at gunpoint and sexually assaulted while at work, Trudy decides that enough is enough. It is time for some changes. She finds the courage to tell her father and fianc&eacute; that she has decided to take a job with Bon Voyage, an exotic-sounding travel agency.The day Trudy steps into Bon Voyage, her life changes forever. She meets the only other Black employee in the agency, Ann Oliver, and immediately develops a love/hate relationship with her. Ann epitomizes many of the qualities Trudy wants in her own life. Ann's sophistication, lifestyle, and successful business aplomb are all seductive to Trudy. However, Ann is considered the office bitch and treats Trudy horribly. When a situation presents itself for Trudy to get revenge, she does. She starts out by just using the company credit card in Ann's name to purchase lunch for herself and a friend, but the power she yields with a credit card in someone else's name is like a drug addiction. The more she uses it, the more she has to have. Pretty soon Trudy finds herself stepping into Ann's life as well. Trudy's actions have her best friend, the only person she has confided in, fearful that she'll go to jail. Noticing the transformation in her, James is unsure where their relationship is heading and her father is a little on the nervous side.Mary Monroe does it again in IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. She took ordinary, everyday people and circumstances and turned their stories into a captivating page-turner. Ms. Monroe delved into identity theft and gave it a little twist. She showed that entering a life of crime is not necessarily because of the need to be greedy. People living unfulfilled lives can just as easily slip into a life of criminal activity. The characterizations in this book were excellent. I actually experienced Trudy's pain and loneliness, and even identified with her desire for a more stimulating life. The secondary characters were just as memorable, adding just enough vibrancy and humor. Ms. Monroe has a unique gift in her storytelling abilities to draw every reader in, no matter the subject, and IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING is no different.Reviewed by Brenda M.

But when Ann betrays one of those men, Trudy may find that this is one bill that she simply cannot pay.....A rather shallow, predictable story that had potential that was never realized.

I am in a book club and i picked this book for our next meeting. Trudy is nuts! She stole Ann's identity! How could a person do that! Nobody was killed in this book which i found unusual for Mary Monroe but it was still exciting. The book is basically about Trudy who works in a travel agency and she hates her boss Ann. They are the only two African American women in the whole company and Trudy does not have the glamourous life like Ann. Her best friend looks like an extraterrestrial and her father owns a liquor store that is frequently robbed. So what she saw in Ann the nice clothes, and beautiful hair she wanted it all and what better way then to pretend to be her...it was pretty good."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"Mary Monroe is the author of The Upper Room, God Don't Like Ugly, Gonna Lay Down My Burdens, and God Still Don't Like Ugly.Trudy Bell is an ordinary 28-year-old African American living with her widowed father in South Bay, and working in his liquor store. Trudy's mother died when she was 12; and her brother when she was in high school. Her father has depended on her ever since.The book opens with a graphic, scary confrontation with a robber when Trudy is working alone in the store. Her initial terror gives way to a rage that the robber is preying on his own people.She decides to change her life. She is in a rut; same boyfriend for the past ten years and the same job. She begins working in a travel agency in exotic San Jose. She becomes friends with all her colleagues, except for travel representative Ann Oliver, also an African American. Ann treats Trudy rudely, criticizes her constantly, and only occasionally is friendly. Ann is someone Trudy envies.When Trudy is given the responsibility of purchasing supplies and paying the credit card bills, her co-workers suggest she use the company credit cards for her lunches and other expenses. That is the start of a fraudulent lifestyle. Eventually she expands to buying clothing, gifts for her friends, expensive trips, and she even takes on Ann's identity by applying for real credit cards in her name. Occasionally Trudy is bothered by her crimes, but the rush of buying spurs her on. Not completely self-centered, one of her favorite things to do is get money from the ATM and hand it out to the homeless.Unusual things begin to happen to Ann Oliver: she is beaten up, her sister dies: and then she gets threatening phone calls, and disappears. Trudy isn't worried as she has been making payments on her \\"Ann Oliver\\" bills. Just when she decides to end her dangerous charade, her life as \\"Ann Oliver\\" becomes downright hazardous.Armchair Interviews says: Trudy and her co-workers and friends are drawn with a rich colorful brush; they are truly people you care about.

Trudy is robbed and assaulted at her father's small corner store. And instead of being a victim, she picks herself up and launches on the road to have a new life. Unfortunately, Trudy steals her bosses Identity, and trades her boring life in for a new one that is really's Ann's life. Monroe hits it out of the park by teaching us how bad it is to try and be somebody else. On the outside Ann looked happy and rich, beautiful and powerful. But once Trudy assumes Ann's identity she learns that Ann is not the beautiful woman who has it all that Trudy believed she was. I was captivated by this book and the brillian characterizations that only Mary is capable of creating. I look forward to smelling those greens and neckbones Mary always has cooking in her books. And for the most part I loved Trudy's loving relationship with her father, who never gave up on his daughter, good or bad. To tell the truth, I hated when In Sheep's Clothing ended. But I know Trudy learned some great lessons from trying to live somebody else's life, because I learned a lot about identity theft from this book too! Can't wait for the next one Mary.

And worse yet, who says \\"gwine to\\"? OMGness. I felt like if I had seen that \\"word\\" one more time, I would scream. There's nothing I hate more than unrealistic dialogue. Otto Bell seemed to have said \\"gwine\\" in every sentence he uttered -- yet that was pretty much the only slang he spoke. And again, who says that anyway? Most people who speak with typical Black American dialects using slang would say \\"gonna\\" or \\"gon.\\" If she was going for the southern slang, she could've used \\"finna\\" (or a variation like \\"fixin to\\"). That gwine drove me nuts and I don't even know how to pronounce it when she followed it with 'to'! SMH. Horrible. I tried to say it in my head (I'm trying it again now as I type. It just doesn't work unless the person has a West Indian accent).Okay, now that that's out of the way, the book itself was okay. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could. I hate books that end with unresolved questions (unless there's a series, and in this case, I would hate to think there's another book about any of these characters because none of them made me want to read more about them). We never did find out the details of Ann's big secret life, or of her relationship with Mr. Boss (forgot his name), or where she went in the end, and with whom. I would've liked to know. Maybe I'm just nosy.I hated that it took sooooooo long to get to the plot. By the time the girl finally used the credit card, I was ready for the book to be over. It was SO boring up to that point, and it dragged out for so long after that point. The book should've started out with her working at Bon Voyage, and then used a flashback if she just HAD to tell the robbery/rape story. And there were so many other scenes that could've been left out. What was the point of Pam not washing her hands? What was the point of the little meeting with LoBo when Bff was at the bar? What was the point of giving alllll this background history about Spider? It was just way too much fluff.The one thing I liked was the ending (mainly because it was over). I had completely forgotten about the robber/rapist, so finding out that he was Miss Sadie's grandson was a nice twist. That was good. Normally, I put all the pieces of a puzzle together before the book is over, but I definitely missed that piece. That's a good thing.It just wasn't a good book.

Getting therapy to help with her grief was never considered an option by her well-meaning but controlling father, leaving Trudy with unresolved grief issues. When she is robbed and molested at her father's liquor store where she works, Trudy represses her rage and again does not seek therapy. She believes that placing herself in a better working environment will provide the healing she so desperately needs. Additionally, she perceives working for a glamorous travel agency as her last hoorah before settling down with her dull fiance, James.Her employment with Bon Voyage Travel agency, however, is the catalyst for her pent-up anger, resentment, and feelings of unworthiness to manifest into behaviors Trudy would have never believed herself capable of expressing.Ann Oliver, Trudy's boss, is an attractive, educated, self-assured, self-involved woman who is well-traveled and speaks two languages. Feeling dual emotions of envy and admiration toward Ann, Trudy allows the woman to continually disrespect her.Ann is an enigma. Typically, insensitive, shallow, and demanding, she regards Trudy with indifference and often with disdain. On the other hand, she'll turn right around and extend warmth, sensitivity, and even sisterhood. Ann's many mood swings keep Trudy emotionally imbalanced and also resentful.Trudy develops a love/hate relationship with Ann and slowly seeks revenge by running up Ann's credit while smiling in her face. She also starts taking on the woman's persona--changing her drab appearance and developing a fierce craving for the finer things in life. But it doesn't stop there. With access to Ann's credit card for work-related spending, Trudy begins to make personal purchases and her spending quickly sprials out of control.Phony ID in Ann's name provides Trudy with nearly unlimited credit and an addiction to spending. Trudy has become an identity thief who can't get a grip on the extravagant and often senseless spending she's doing in Ann's name.Freddie, Trudy's best friend, warns Trudy of the dire consequences that may befall her, but she and boyfriend, LoBo go along for the free ride.The surprise ending caught me off guard and I wouldn't dare give it away.Mary Monroe has taken a current topic that is a thorn in the side of American society. However, she's made the identity thief a sympathetic character. Although Trudy's morals are a bit skewed, she considers herself an honest person and society would definitely view her as being trustworthy and harmless. In our minds, the identify thief looks sinister and exhibits unscrupulous behaviors...someone of dubious character whom one would never allow to run rampant with a company credit card.Mary Monroe is an extraordinary writer and I'm a fan for life."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"I thought this one would get us back to Mama Ruby and 'em but it didn't.

Very often it is someone who simply has the time, the access and most of all, the opportunity.The character here is the best example of all those characteristics.

I'm not going to get into the plot, it was adequately summarized many times here, but I felt that she wasn't really thorough in some areas (such as a little more about what Trudy's job entailed, other than answering phones and pushing papers). The ending to me was also not quite satisfying. It seemed that more detail could have been given on what happened to Ann, and what happened to the man who was looking for Ann. His character was chased away, and he left, never to return? Also, Trudy getting off scot free after all the bills she ran up in Ann's name seemed wrong. She did have to pay the money back, but what she did was criminal.Contrary to how my review sounds, I really did like the book!"},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"Monroe has done it again. Created a tale with everyday animated characters that allow us to peek into their lives. Trudy, who has lived a hum drum life with James, her man of 10 years, and under the loving care of her sometimes crotchety widowed father finds life a little more interesting than she bargained for after landing a job with Bon Voyage Travel Agency. One of only two Black people at the company Trudy longs for sisterhood with Ann Oliver, the other Black face. But discovers, on her first day, that Ann is your typical wannabe Diva. Quick to make any and everyone feel, look and think themselves a fool. Appalled yet somewhat intrigued by Ann, Trudy stumbles on what she believes is the perfect \`teaching' tool to put Ann in her place: Identity theft.However, what Trudy fails to realize while she's charging expensive dinners, exotic trips and everything not nailed down in the mall is that her teaching isn't effective if there is no student. And although Trudy has spouts of guilt and a best friend, Freddie, who implies every chance she gets that Trudy is just as low as a common criminal (all the while enjoying the fruit of the sneaky deeds) Trudy's greed overrides the guilt. And she pacifies her nagging and paranoid conscious by remembering how much of a [...] Ann remains even as Trudy continuously attempts to be kind and respectful. Of course when the dust settles Trudy learns much more about Ann Oliver than she ever expected.Although this was an interesting read I found the book long winded and too detailed with mundane and over extended verbiage and redundancies. Much of the book is typical and calculated by the reader. And Monroe portrays Trudy as dumb as dirt, needy and plain old unrealistic in many aspects. This book will keep you turning the pages for the first half but at some point in the second half you'll be ready to get to the climatic point already. At least I was."},{"Title":"In Sheep's Clothing","review":"At age 25, Anita Bell aka \\"Trudy\\" has suffered enough loss and loneliness that could fill three lifetimes. Her White mother, a flight attendant, was tragically taken from her in the much publicized airline terrorist attack over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and her older brother was killed in a car accident two years later. Largely abandoned by her mother's family because they disapproved of their daughter's choice of a black man for a husband, Trudy and her father were left on their own to grieve and support each other. Considered a \\"plain Jane,\\" Trudy has since lived a sheltered, conservative life in South Bay, California clerking in the family business when in between jobs. She is engaged to James Long, a hen-pecked, chauvinistic, \\"mama's boy\\" who she has dated exclusively for the past ten years. When her father's store is robbed and Trudy is sexually assaulted during the burglary, she is determined to find and keep a job that will allow her to escape the ever-increasing crime filled neighborhood.She lands a secretarial position at Bon Voyage Travel Agency where she meets a group of eccentric travel representatives and a couple of busybody administrative assistants. Ann Oliver, a headstrong, no nonsense office manager, is the most enigmatic of the group. She routinely praises and demeans Trudy; so much so, that Trudy cannot determine if she is friend or foe, causing her to struggle with feelings of admiration and loathing toward Ann. In an act of retribution, Trudy justifies small charges on Ann's corporate account as compensation for ill treatment. Initially, Trudy has no worries of getting caught despite her best friend's warnings. Knowing her job entails paying the corporate accounts, coupled with a striking physical resemblance to Ann - there is no one to challenge her spending. However, exposure to beautiful people who travel to exotic places with marvelous jobs and wonderful love lives sprouts a bout of depression and second thoughts concerning her passionless relationship with James, listless life, and modest appearance. She taps into a resurrecting cure from childhood to energize herself - elaborate shopping sprees and makeovers - funded on Ann's credit! So begins the lies to cover the expensive dinners, parties, trips, couture clothing, etc. She becomes addicted to the lifestyle and when she finally admits to being \\"the\\" Ann Oliver things quickly spiral out of control.Monroe's latest offering is entertaining enough, albeit a tad predictable. As with her previous novels, the characters are wonderfully imagined \\"everyday\\" people with vibrant personalities. She aptly taps into the modern problem of identity theft and hypothesizes how an innocent like Trudy could easily succumb to the temptation and how simple it is to accomplish in the Information/Digital Age. Monroe weaves a fairly believable tale via Trudy and leaves the reader with two adages to ponder: \\"Be careful for what you wish, you may just get it\\" and \\"Nothing is free, everything costs\\".Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClubNubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking","review":"I saw Jackie Pflug speak at a luncheon and I knew I had to buy her book.

She is an wonderful speaker as well as writer. Until most of the seminar was over, I had not realized Jackie was as vision impaired as she is. She looked around the room, gestured, and looked into the audience and smiled at us as if she could see us(.Unfortunately,afire alarm inadvertently went off at the convention site where the seminar was being held. Jackie was a real trooper and just followed along with the assistance of a few people). IT was not a surprise that her book was so well written. I already had her story memorized yet when I was reading her book as if I didn't know anything about it, I was pleased to see how well she set the scene for the whole climatic event that took place that day. I guarantee this story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and leave you wanting more, not for the lack of information, because Jackie did an exceptional job in putting this horrifyinh event, along with her most remarkable journey into a book that isn't the size of an encyclopedia. She is a n inspiration that will make you thankful for your life and thankful you haven't had to face anything like this in your life time.

I came across this amazing book in the public library in my town and was amazed at the detail. There was so much that I didn't already know, and I knew a lot. I wanted to keep on renewing the book and never give it back but a good friend of mine, who is also very adamant about Phantom, went searching for this book that I wouldn't shut up about and bought me a copy. I love it. It includes info on the opera house, Gaston Leroux(the author of the novel on which Andrew Lloyd Webber's play is based), the story behind the novel, Lon Chaney's film, other versions of the film and other plays, Andrew Lloyd Webber's version, and the Libretto. This is the most complete and well written book on the play I've come across. George Perry reveals the intricacies of the production from make-up to costumes to set to everything. I consider this a valuable part of my Phantom collection and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes this play or theater in general. It rocks!"},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"Amazing, interesting and informative are just a few of the words that discribe this excellent book!It starts out with a history of the Paris Opera House, along with beautiful pictures.

It also is about Gaston Leroux, who wrote the Phantom novel.Part Two is about the Lon Chaney Phantom film and other film versions of the story.And last but not least it how the Andrew Lloyd Webber version came to light, with rare backstage photos and conversations with the production crew and cast.In short, a definite MUST for all Phans, makes an excellent gift."},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"Believe it or not, the first time I read this book was when I was 8 years old, and it has been my favorite book ever since. I've have read many great books that were hard to put down, but this was the only one I actually couldn't put down! Most people are only familiar with the play and the movie; I have seen Phantom of the Opera on broadway twice, but I still prefer the book. The book goes into so much more detail and reveals so many parts of the story that both the play and the movie leave out. If you are planing on seeing the play, I highly recommend that you read this first. If you already have seen it, or are never go to see it, I still highly recommend that you read this; it's great!"},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book is phenomenal!

I have no words on how amazing it is.When I rekindled my love for musicals, and of course, Phantom of the Opera made that happened... I had to get everything and learn everything about Phantom. So I found this book at the library and I went insane over it.Firstly, it gives a clear background history on Gaston Leroux--the writer and the creator of Phantom of the Opera. Then, it goes into another section when talking about the films it inspired. You'll be surprised and amazed when you see it and read about it. Not only that, it tells you some small tidbit facts on the actors and actresses of these movies.And then, my favorite part, it goes into the Lloyd Webber musical. And when I say \\"goes into\\" I mean it!! There are so many pictures of the Original London Cast it's phenominal! There ares ome behind the scenes pictures as well. I never seen so many pictures about Phantom sure in a book, ever.And when you think that's enough, there is a libretto of the stage production--including scrafito'ed pictures of the OLC copied in there as it was when the CD/Cassette first made it's debut.All in all, it's not clearly updated as it is now, there is mention of the movie and who they want in it. But otherwise, if you are a London Cast or simply a Phantom obsessionist, you MUST have this book. If you find it at a house sale, a junk pile, book sale... whatever... BUY IT.

(And I love looking at Phantom pics) It answered quite a few questions that I had about the actors, the play and just The Phantom of the Opera in general. The thing that makes this book good is the fact that it doesn't just focus in on the musical. For instance I didn't know there was more than one movie about the Phantom. Also it talks about why they picked Charles Hart to do the lyrics, Michael Crawford to play Erik, Sarah Brightman to play Christine, and Steve Barton to play Raoul.

Great reading and very interesting."},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book is perfect of the most curious Phantom of the Opera fan. Almost every question about the story and past interpretations of it are answered in this book. Very easy to read, with photos from the countless films, even the Andrew Llyod Webber stage show. A great bonus as well is the complete Libretto to Andrew's musical at the end of the book. The book is divided into the following sections1 The history of the Opera house itself2 About the Author of the novel3 Phantom of the Opera on film ( while it doesn't cover every interpretation it does run through the major ones up to the release of the musical )4. Webber's musical.For the fans of the musical, the section on the play is great. Very good photos. Helps to see details that can not be seen in the back row on the theater. I would caution to open and close this book very carefully. I had a copy of this years ago and one by one each section fell out a bit at a time til the cover was left by itself. It just may have been improperly bound. I've seen other editions and they are held together quite well so don't let this stop you from buying the book, just be careful when using it. The Movie companion book has much of the same info to this version, but it doesn't have the stage script, just the film version. THere are differences between the two. Overall, i'd choose this one over the latter.

When it arrived, I was very pleased with all the information I found in it. There is background on the Palais Garnier, which is the factual basis for Webber's Paris Opera House, with beautiful and rare images of the Acad&eacute;mie Nationale de Musique. There is also a biography of the man who brought us Erik; Gaston Laroux, and his quest for information that \`the Opera Ghost actually existed'.Most of this book is dedicated to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical. It includes many never before seen sketches, paintings, and beautiful photographs of the sets and original cast; which included Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. At the end of the book is a copy of the stage libretto, with full stage direction.A must for theatre aficionados, phans, and lovers of the art of stagecraft."},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"This book contains soo many pictures from the broadway production and past movies of The Phantom of the Opera.

HAHAThis book is deffinately a GREAT buy.*Only thing if anyone's expecting to see Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, or Patrick Wilson (From the 2004 movie) this book was written before that so your going to have to buy the addition, \\"The Phantom of the Opera Film Companion\\"."},{"Title":"The Complete Phantom of the Opera","review":"I've seen Phantom on three continents and love every bit of every show.

Lee bounced from the present to his past in a single line that sometimes sent me backtracking and rereading to catch the wit of his metaphors, but I found that delightful as the writing was not the &quot;same old thing.&quot; It all seemed pretty horrible and his characters were definitely bigger than life with steroids. Jackson Kan found his buddy and I still had a 100 pages to go as his &quot;mission&quot; kept expanding. I found both the mystery of the Tiger's Tail and the succinct humorous phraseology a really good read that was different than all the others."},{"Title":"Tiger's Tail","review":"I served with the U.S. Army a couple of years in Camp Casey, and Gus Lee does a masterful job of describing the bleakness and sadness of Camp Casey and Tongduchon near the Korean DMZ.....also of describing the ever-present threat from North Korea. The \\"speed bump\\" analogy was used a lot by those of us who were stationed in Casey. While in Korea, sure would have been nice to have met someone like Jackson Hu-Chin Kan. Following Jackson's adventures through the Seoul to Tongduchon corrider was a thrilling experience - also brought back a lot of memories. The chilling filth and terrible conditions in the Korean prison was, no doubt, accurately described.....even nightmarish. The storyline was very interesting, and provided some insight regarding the current and ongoing threat to South Korea and our troops in South Korea. Bravo, Gus Lee!"},{"Title":"Count Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV","review":"Well researched and documented, and yet an interesting and pleasant book to read; I learned from this book many things I completely ignored about history of Nouvelle France.

You watch it and you read it.

Suffice it to say that I am very much a &quot;newbie&quot;.I looked at all of the books in this category and chose this one by Matisse Enzer. My instincts were right on -- this is a great book.It is well written, well organized and very easy to follow. It is both a book that you can sit down and read as well as a useful reference. The logical path that Matisse takes the reader through to learn the essential Unix invocations and other mystical Unix-spellcraft makes learning a pleasure!In less than a week, I was able to configure my Apache server and the powerful Sendmail program included with OS X. This goes well beyond the basics that are also inluded in the book (there is a lot of great beginner stuff). Matisse helped me to absord the fundamentals quickly so I was able to move onto more advanced subjects without wasting any time.I am definitely a beginner when it comes to Unix, however, Matisse lays the concepts out so well, I already feel confident taking on more advanced Unix projects.Get this -- when I did run into a snag, I went to the Apple help forums to get an answer.

It actually sparked my interest in learning more about Unix. I know a bunch of the &quot;simple&quot; commands and am comfortable with a shell. I bought Mac OS X Unleashed for 10.1 last year and it had a very good section on Unix. I have browsed the 10.2 Unleashed and it is also good. However, it's one big honkin' book. So, I was on the lookout for a MacOSX Unix only book and happened upon this one. As the author states in her &quot;review&quot; it is the most in depth beginner's guide to Unix in the MacOSX realm; even compared to O'Reilly's MacOSX Unix books. It has PeachPit's expected depth at beginner level yet is a QuickPro book so it's even more powerful than a QuickStart title. It combines the right amounts of understandability, book size, and depth of any I've come across so far. You want to dabble in Unix for OS X or take the first steps to being a Unix King?

I cannot explain how a *Visual* QuickPro guide was so good at providing information about arguably the least visually rich aspect of the new Mac OS. It seems like an absurdly inappropriate format but somehow, it works perfectly - Mr Enzer gets things just right. There's no fluff and no overly chatty silliness to make the book an enormous doorstop. Nor is it ever tough going or unreadable - it's always well spaced, with excellent tips and notes sections and carefully paced.It's probably about time that it was updated for Panther, which was released almost 7 months ago as I write this but the author has already provided the relevant information for bash users (a clean Panther installation uses bash by default) as well as csh and tcsh. (Don't worry if you don't know what these are - all becomes clear in the book.) Yes, there's a good Unix section for beginners in Mac OS X Panther Unleashed, too (Willam &amp; John Ray) but this one easily tops it and provides much more useful information, good as the other book is on Mac OS X in general. There are other books that talk to Unix geeks about the Mac - this one is the best I've come across at doing the opposite.I'm withholding one star only because so many errors made their way past the proof-reading stage. (Easily fixed - go to the Peachpit Press site and save a copy of the online Errors &amp; Corrections page for this book.)If you are new to Unix or have the most basic of skills and you use OS X, this will give you exactly the grounding you need using just the right kind of language.

I am not a qualified UNIX administrator so I have never had to worry about that side of the UNIX environment. With Mac OS X, I just might occasionally need to do that.I bought this book after browsing the chapter on Security. This chapter alone made it worth reading. I was interested to discover that OS X has a native firewall available, and how and what to look for in system log files if I suspect that someone has been trying to gain unauthorized access to my Mac, and then what to do about it. This, coupled to the Mac OS X-specific differences should make the book very useful. Not to mention that the parts that I've read were enjoyable and interesting.

Now don't get stressed out here! I truely mean it, this one is fun. No formulae to memorize, no complicated Krebs Cycles to navigate, no difficult Latin origin and insertion sites to locate, just pure fun. The author has the knack--no let's call it for what it really is, a rare gift--for taking the dry facts of biological functioning and making an amusing but clearly informative tale of it all. Dr Sapolsky has a purpose beyond the mere dissemination of information on anatomy physiology of humans, zebras, lab rats, or baboons to the lay person. His intention is to show that the modern lifestyle, and how the individual reacts to it, can have a major impact on health and even on the economy of the country. I'd recommend the book to anyone with an interest in how the body works as wonderfully as it does, to those who wonder why they get sick when they're stressed out but their neighbor never seems to, to those who want to lead a healthier lifestyle and need a little background information to get started, and to high school or college students who can't quite get into that biology class because the content seems too difficult--or just plain too boring--to manage."},{"Title":"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers : An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping (\\"Scientific American\\" Library)","review":"As a veterinary student, I was searching the shelves of our library looking for a different book when I stumbled onto Sapolsky's work.

Even with a few years of vet school behind me, I still found myself learning something from every page. Not only that, but I was looking forward to reading each page, wondering what hilarious story or anecdote would come next.I wish I had read Dr. Sapolsky's work before I had taken first-year physiology.

Sapolsky is considered the country's foremost authority on stress. I have some background in stress research myself, and once heard the originator of the stress concept and of stress research, the great Hans Selye, speak at a convention many years ago, who Sapolsky mentions in his books.Most of us know we should do a better job of managing stress in our lives, including myself. This is the sort of book I plunge into with a combination of morbid fascination and hypochondriacal paranoia. This is because the book itself was rather stressful to read, since I found out in manifold and gory detail about all the damage I'd been doing to my brain and body with all those high-paying but high-stress jobs I've had all my life. Although I made good money, I found out that I'd probably aged myself about 10 years in the process. However, as I said, the book makes for fascinating if somewhat morbid reading. For those with the adrenal cojones to handle it, this is the best book on the nature of stress and its effects that I've read. It's more a book on the physiology of stress, and so there isn't much on practical coping strategies, so if you're interested in information on that, you'll have to look elsewhere.That having been said, I thought I would mention the best strategy I've ever encountered, of which I'm sure Sapolsky would approve, since it's based on some sound research in the area, and relates to one of his main points. Sapolsky makes a convincing case that we evolved for a very different stress regimen than our current lives and civilization provides. Instead of occasionally facing serious, life-threatening situations as we did thousands or millions of years ago, such as a predator attack, our lives are now much safer but filled with many continual, reoccurring, constant, irritating, but lesser stressors that still build up over time, contributing to such problems as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and even muscular dystrophy. The psychological end result of this is that many people constantly fret and agonize about things until they're worried all the time, or it even generalizes into more serious free-floating anxiety and panic attacks.Hence, it's been found that the best way to deal with one's concerns and anxieties is to attack the issue of them getting out of control to the point where they're weighing on your mind all of the time, using a sort of \\"containment strategy.\\" The best way to deal with this is to set aside some time each day--10, 15, or 20 minutes at most--for worrying. In other words, set aside a dedicated worry period, where if you need to, go ahead and worry yourself sick about it. Then put it out of your mind and enjoy the rest of your day. Another important thing you can do is to not just worry about everything but to put some constructive thought into how to better deal with your problems. Sometimes you won't have a good idea about how to do that for a while, for days, maybe weeks, but don't let that get you down. Persist in your efforts until you succeed. Most of success in life is persistence--not talent or ability--as most successful people will tell you. :-)The other principle I learned that was valuable in reducing stress was actually a Zen idea--the idea of living life in the present. According to this Zen principle, one should strive constantly to live in the present, in the present moment, and to enjoy that to its fullest. Otherwise, your other pressing concerns will weigh you down and you will never truly enjoy life to the fullest. There will always be something else on your mind. Someone who's always worried about their other concerns can't truly live in the present, and therefore will never truly enjoy or make the most of whatever activity they're engaged in. Part of their mind is always somewhere else. Therefore, strive to always live in the now, in the present moment.The final important thing I'd like to pass on is about attitude. Realistically, life is never as bad as it seems to us during our darkest and most depressed moments--nor as wonderful as it seems during our happiest, most ecstatic moments. It's somewhere in between. The point here is that one should also cultivate the proper attitude--since that's often the only thing one has total control over in one's life. If you're the sort of person for whom even little things get you down--which is more of us than we would like to admit--then strive to be more objective. The little things can't really hurt you. They're just annoying psychologically because they bruise our egos a little bit. Save your emotional energy for the really big problems in your life, instead--because there will be more than enough of those. Cultivate a positive, upbeat attitude so that the little things are practically beneath your notice. Let them slide off you like water off a duck's back. This is also another important Zen principle--that too much ego impedes our progress in life.Well, that was all by way of providing some practical advice for coping with stress in addition to all the scientific neurological and endocrinological information Sapolsky provides in his book. Good luck and happy stress-free reading and living!"},{"Title":"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers : An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping (\\"Scientific American\\" Library)","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to the physiology of stress and stress hormones. Although it includes a few suggestions for stress reduction at the end, this is much more of a science book than a self-help book. Starting from the first chapter, Sapolsky describes the hormones that the body produces in stressful conditions, and the effects that the those hormones have on the various systems of the body. Throughout the book, Sapolsky reminds us that he is describing truly stressful situations--such as when an individual is being chased by a lion. In such situations, the stress hormones concentrate energy to the muscles needed for escape, and bring long-term processes such as digestion to a halt. This is great for escaping from lions, but if stressful conditions continue or are frequent, the effects brought about by these hormones can lead to a reduced immune system response, depression or heart disease, among other problems. Sapolsky also describes how the response to stressors differs across individuals, and how certain groups of people are more prone to stress and stress-related diseases than others. The book is quite dense, and can't be read in an afternoon. However, Sapolsky's writing is exceptionally clear and enjoyable. It's one of the best written general science books that I've come across in quite a while."},{"Title":"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers : An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping (\\"Scientific American\\" Library)","review":"I think the reader from Dayton OH missed the whole point of this book.

To understand &quot;how and why stress can kill&quot; and &quot;why some fair better than others&quot;, you need to learn some of the mechanisms that body uses.

Sapolsky is a book about stress cause and effect, stress-related diseases and coping. Now that was a mouthful, but the book is meant, I believe for medical professionals to understand what really happens to people when daily life closes in and takes hold of your life. Saying this, I do NOT want to scare away potential lay readers in that if you read this book not only will you recognize stress, but you'll know why stress is there and the mechanisms that cause and control stress.What happens, physiologically, to people over time as stress builds-up is delt with in this book, as first-rate science shows ways to reduce stress. I found the book to contain a lot of information about hormones that affect you brain and deals with depression and emotional termoil; giving the reader tools to effectively manage stress.The lay reading public might find that this book to be a little over their head with medical terms, but the skills for management of stress and the causal effect are easily understood by everyone. The author has studied patterns of stress-related physiology and diseases among wild baboons in Kenya and has brought this knowledge to effective correlation in this book.As you read this book, you will have the unusual opportunity to learn how to manage stress effectively in your life... thus living longer and more healthy. The author's writing style is easily read and not overbearing, as you understand more about stress in your life.

In addition to the link between the ulcers of the title and stress, he goes over the links between stress and sex, immunity, memory, aging, heart disease and many other physiological processes. I found the chapter on stress dwarfism to be the most interesting, even if I'll never be able to watch Peter Pan again.Sapolsky does provide some common-sense advice on managing stress, but the principal value of \\"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers\\" is not as a pop psychology book but as a work of popular science that goes a long way towards truly convincing people that chronic stress needs to be controlled."},{"Title":"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers : An Updated Guide To Stress, Stress Related Diseases, and Coping (\\"Scientific American\\" Library)","review":"I'll spoil the ending right at the start. Zebras don't get ulcers becausea) when they're stressed (like by a lion), they run like hell, andb) when they're not in danger, they don't worry about the next lion. They relax.But it's still worth reading this book. It's full of fascinating stories and offbeat humor. It's filled with a spirit of compassion for all people and animals who deal with too much stress. And it gives the best explanation I've ever read of how prolonged, chronic stress affects our bodies and minds. I wish I had read it before writing my first book, The Art of Getting Well.Sapolsky explains that stress is not the enemy. Without the stress response, none of us would be alive. But when it goes on too long, and when we aren't able to relieve stress by physical action, it raises our blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, tends to make us fat, damage our memories and derange our immune systems.Unlike most pop science writers, Sapolsky acknowledges the social and economic causes of stress. He doesn't just say, \\"Relax!\\" But he does point to some ways people can cope with stressful environments. Since most of our stresses don't involve hungry lions, we often have a choice in how we interpret threats and how we respond. We can, to a certain extent, use our minds and bodies to reduce the effect of environmental stressors.Stress contributes greatly to Type 2 Diabetes; some would say stress causes it. I talk about this a lot in my upcoming books, \\"The Politics of Diabetes\\" and \\"Diabetes as a Turning Point.\\" Stress is not evenly distributed through our society. Money protects you from stress, as does education, social support, love, and self-confidence. While we can't always do much about the money, my book does explain how we can use the power of other people and positive emotions to manage both stress and diabetes. I will be quoting extensively from Sapolsky's work and am very grateful to him for writing about Zebras and Ulcers.

I checked all of Sapolsky's slams of Siegel's book, &quot;Love, Medicine and Miracles,&quot; and Sapolsky should have had someone do the same before the book went to press. Some of those attributed to Siegel were actually from patients; others were distorted for effect. It's quite clear that the &quot;love&quot; part of Siegel's work is absent from Sapolsky's repertoire. And he seems to have little time for &quot;non-rational&quot; effects.

Contrary to common belief, the span of time between 900 and 1300 saw substantial intellectual and economic growth in Western Europe. During this time, populations largely shifted from scattered manorial clusters to towns and cities. Patterns of trade became more complex and the period witnessed the rise of the merchant class. This is a great guide for casual students of world history by a leading scholar in the field. You may also be interested in Sidney Painter's other book in this series,The Rise of the Feudal Monarchies."},{"Title":"Virgin's Triangle (Caribbean Writers)","review":"I am so glad I read this book, it was so good.

Vishnu, is a construction worker who she's more physically attractive to, and Robert is a guy who she think would be the better choice socially.

This by far is my favorite read of the year."},{"Title":"Virgin's Triangle (Caribbean Writers)","review":"This novel is based in Trinidad and was a fantastic and very entertaining read for me. Giselle Karan is an academic who is working with the Caribbean Media Company where she is a computer ace. Giselle has all that she wants but the only think lacking as far as she could see is a good partner. With her nose in the air she has a choice between Vishnu a construction worker who she physically attracted to, and Robert another man of her ilk who makes good money and will be accepted in the upper class Trinidad society.CARNIVAL SEASON is coming up soon and this is the event of the year for all Trinidadians. Giselle however will make her choice sometime around then......but the ups and downs and her ifs and buts will determine who her suitor will be. She wants what she considers the good parts from both men.........the physical and good looking side from Vishnu and Robert's intellectual brains and money, and obviously the one everyone will expect her to wed. What will she do???It may sound like a simple book.............but it was so full of excitement as Carnival draws near, and you're drawn into real transformation.The reader will have a wonderful time and a tremendous surprise at the end that will encourage you to think again. Simply as it seems you will be spellbound with a capital S. I recommend this for all readers who engage in Caribbean fiction and other similar work. Thanks Mr. Baldeosingh........come again soon.NutfaceMarch 5th,2002"},{"Title":"Virgin's Triangle (Caribbean Writers)","review":"I've read Virgin's Triangle, and somehow i can relate to what Giselle feels, though I am much youger, i know what young people feel and go through when it comes to sex, I've lived in Trinidad and know all about carnival and those other matters, but i still ask myself why in a rush for sex? Otherwise i found these book very descriptive of it's environment, place, and theme, and i think the author Kevin is going on the rigth track to becoming a great writer, and hope to read another interesting book from him, but what i like the most is the change, since most caribbean stories tell the story of a little girl or boy growing up in a small village, and Kevin's story goes a step further into actually portraying what changes and feelings young people encounter not only in Trinidad but all around the world."},{"Title":"Virgin's Triangle (Caribbean Writers)","review":"If you're looking for a good read Virgin's Triangle is it.

This one has a nice painting on the cover. I see in \\"Letters\\" (pg. 24) protests of Jerry Falwell's tyranny. He was a menace to free speech. Pg 40 tells of the Meese Menace to freedom. I recall some of that. Pg. 45 begins the first girlie pictorial with anonymous models in \\"Paper Houses\\". Pg. 64 has an ad for 6 pix of nude Brooke Shields as a child for $2500. I'll pass on that, Garry Gross! (What an appropriate name for a purveyor of nude pix of kids!)Pg. 68 begins an article about \\"Mizushobai\\" that's interesting to me since my current girlfriend and several recent ones are from Japan.

Fasha from Italy gets my 25 years late vote for PoY. Pg. 106 following the Pet candidates is fiction about the Vietnam war that is interesting. \\"Dreams & Diversions\\" (pp. 109-111) has some nutty news, e.g. a $250,000 solid gold, set with jewels, and trimmed with mink -get this- Toilet Seat! Pg 115 has an ad for \\"New Look\\" mag from \\"Penthouse\\". Does anyone remember it? I do vaguely.

Her early cartoons were great, sometimes inspired. Then came The Good Times are Killing Me and Cruddy, two extraordinary novels. With One Hundred Demons, Lynda Barry seems to have grown into a new level of inspired storytelling that ignores conventional boundaries and establishes its own self-contained universe of emotion and thought, image and word. As a result, this is great art -- not fiction, not autobiography, not painting -- this is GREAT ART that reaches inside you and messes with you on many levels. Mundane details illuminate huge ideas and cultural archetypes.

There were things in this book that I could relate to and other things I couldn't but through the use of illustrations and words I was right there with her through those experiences.

And no one, but no one, is able to portray childhood as genuinely as she can. She has every thought, every concern, and every feeling down to a cartoon science. Maybe that's why the adolescent demons, with their obsessive, \\"Cathy\\"-style details of insecurity, are such a letdown. Do funny ladies always have to portray themselves as unattractive, dopey, confused, etc.?

At first, it may seem like it will be light--maybe just surface demons--but the stories take on some really tough stuff in a very honest way without being too relentless.

It is exactly that universality that makes for magical reading. The intense specificity of childhood's horrors made me feel like I was reading my own life, not Barry's. Barry's artistry is in telling and illustrating these stories with incredible humor as well as unlimited heart. Particularly haunting of the eighteen stories are the lost friendship in \\"Magic\\" and \\"Resilience\\" which gives the lie to adult fantsies of childhood innocence. It's increasingly clear that Lynda Barry is our finest writer of the emotional lives of damaged children. She gives voice to kids that few people ever listened to.

Hundred! Demons!&quot; is just another astonishingly wonderful book in a long line of astonishingly wonderful books. Using Japanese inks and brushes, she categorizes the demons of her childhood. We see everything from resilience to hate to common scents, from magic to &quot;girlness&quot; to dogs to cicadas.Among the many pleasures of the book--Barry's extremely simple yet enormously evocative illustrations, the awesome ear she has for the way children speak to each other, the cheerful colors belying much of the sadness inherent in her work--is the section entitled &quot;Magic.&quot; This regards Barry's rejection, at age thirteen, of her two-years-younger best friend. It's easy to tell that even more than thirty years later, Barry feels shame over this episode. She so deftly sketches the psyche of her thirteen-year old self that we are left alternating between complete understanding of her actions and rueful sorrow that she couldn't ignore the age difference.This is a funky, trippy book that's simultaneously a quick read and something you want to linger over the second (and third, and fourth) time you read it.

Who could read \\"Common Scents\\" and NOT remember the smells of their grandmother's house or shuffle uncomfortably at the memory of failed attempts to disguise the smell of cat pee with incense?OK, maybe you never owned a cat, but you still need the book to read about the Aswang!

However, it is a play that emerged early in the Gay rights movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s and to some degree is radical because it demonstrates that gay couples have the same struggles, misunderstandings, and collusion as do heterosexuals. The dialogue is witty, not unlike a mixture of Edward Albee's Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolfe and Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band. Like all couples, sometimes first impressions are deceiving, with the partner that appears to be most outspoken and assertive to later be revealed to be dependent and emotionally fragile whereas the 'pushover' partner is later revealed to be the strength and glue of the relationship.In the end, the message is that when we love someone and are devoted to them, it is best not to strip away the stories they tell themselves to maintain their self worth."},{"Title":"Pocketguide to Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology","review":"This book gives you quick and accurate guidelines for assessment of communication disorders.

So most listen what they find surreptitiously.But the merit of classical music is that all the works are already canonized and there are well established critical mechanics. You don&iexcl;t need to pick up by yourself. The valuables have been culled over generation and generation. All you have to do is registering the list of the established canon in your mind and choose between players.This book is written to help audience with encyclopedic survey of masters in Western classical music. This is not the textbook for the class on the history of music, but the reference for the common audience. Subjects are restricted to well-known masters like Bach, Mozart, Brahms or Prokofiev. The discography-like descriptions are provided for masterpieces of each composer by over 50 critics. With no doubt, words are not that suitable to demonstrate the beauty of the music. So writers seem to assume that readers have already given ear to the music or at least have CDs at hand. It&iexcl;s not that problem for the music can tell itself only with sound in the note not with words in the paper. But the real beauty of this book lies in its comprehensive approach. It offers not only the accounts on music itself, but relates it to the rest of society. Not only they explain each composer&iexcl;s personal life, but also they set them in the context of their times. Music tells itself. But knowing the social settings that the music was played and enjoyed is definitely helpful to the modern audience. For such purpose, this book contains thousands of illustration showing the social and historical background. This book could, in this regard, be read something of a history in the view of music. This heightens the joy of reading.But this book has some weaknesses. First, this book is targeted to somewhat advanced reader. So there is no explanation about some basic terminology like polyphony, cord, or counterpoint. Those should be the basic. And this kind of writing style leads to pedantic and textbook-like reservedness, in some cases. But overall, this book is readable and informative."},{"Title":"Improving the design and selection of evaluation studies","review":"Improving the design and selection of evaluation studies shows the great research methods that Dr. Mandell implements into his everyday research.

The story is a timeless one about childhood fantasies that come true after much hard work and perserverance, but it is much more than that, too. It is set against the backdrop of Russian political upheaval and teaches important lessons about the history of world. Uhlig writes with much love and reverence for Pavlova and the ballet itself.

It is a mediocre history of US economic diplomacy since WWII, but it is episodic in nature and fails to really tie together the ebb and flow of international diplomacy over economic issues. It also entirely fails to discuss the economic theory that governs politics in this area such as rent-seeking, two-level games, and even the Ricardo-Viner or Stophler(sp?)-Samuelson models of international trade. Moreover, in stressing the importance of the US military-industrial complex as a source of economic growth and job creation during this period, she totally ignores concepts basic to economics and economic analysis -- opportunity and transaction costs -- and so wrongly argued that the vast amount of capital spent on the military was GOOD for the US economy. She also, to add to the poor analysis everywhere evident in this book, fails to show any real correlation between military spending and economic growth.BAD BOOK!"},{"Title":"Belly and Its Power","review":"Review of The Belly and Its Power by Allan SaltzmanI rate this book as a emust havef, simply because of its title. The cover illustration is a black &amp; white illustration of the eidealf man with protruding belly. As a coffee table book it will stimulate all sorts of discussion. This book is an introduction to gkinesthesiah, the ginner body senseh that if fine-tuned will lead one to reduce stress, relax more, and heal from the rigors of modern day life. Stretching and being mindful of our muscles, joints, organs and blood vessels helps to develop kinesthesia. The book is divided into eight sections, each about a particular stretching/stimulation technique, or philosophy, and is well illustrated, with clear sketches and several black &amp; white photos to demonstrate the stretching techniques. The author skims the surface of each topic, enough for the reader to decide whether he or she likes what is offered and wants to find out more. If so, the end of each section contains a bibliography and list of references. The book has elements of yoga, qigong, shiatsu and chiropracy among others, but manages to avoid comparing or even naming systems. Instead, the book keeps the focus on developing kinesthesia. A device called a gSpinal Rollerh features in several sections. Preeminent intellectuals from China, India, Japan, and the West and somehow blended together into a coherent picture. Christianity features in one section, which makes this book somewhat of a rarity for the genre. The nervous system is also treated in some detail.

This book in awesome for anyone who is interested in just reading something that isn't Americanized. These poems are true and real, great for children and Adults.Some of the greatest Latin Amertican writers are featured in this book like Sandra Cisneros, Oscar Hijuelos, Ana Castillo, etc. There are many books that I think about and this one is at the TOP of my list for children and adults to read, if you like poetry."},{"Title":"Cool Salsa: Bilingual Poems on Growing Up Hispanic in the United States (Edge Book)","review":"If you like mild, medium, or hot there is something for anyone in Cool Salsa: Bilingual Poems on Growing up Latino in the United States, and just like nachos, there is a whole lot for everyone. This book is a compilation of first, second, and third-generation Latino writers, and it includes a diversity of writing styles and themes. The combination of the poems captures the essences of Latin rhythms and ways of life in America. Students of all races will relate to different aspects of this book, and two examples of poems that all students should be able to identify with are \\"Translating Grandfather's House\\" and \\"The Aquatic Show.\\" \\"Translating Grandfather's House\\" depicts in a semi-sarcastic tone a very common situation. A teacher is looking at a student's sketch, and she tells him that it looks like a house from a Zorro movie instead of a picture of a real house. However, the student says he is drawing the house that his mother was born in and she was born in Mexico. On the finished picture of a Spanish style house in an elaborate natural wild grass setting of his grandfather's town, he titles the picture \\"GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE.\\" The teacher realizes her error, gives the picture an \\"A+,\\" and then displays the picture on the \\"green\\" blackboard. The teacher-student miscommunication battle is timeless, and the irony or confusion over why green chalkboards are called \\"blackboards\\" is classic as well. The \\"Aquatic Show\\" is a very charming and funny poem. A kid is talking about singing and sort of dancing in the shower. He explains how much he enjoys this activity. Also, he assumes that the bathroom fixtures, which are his audience, really enjoy it too. He mentions songs from different Latin countries, which is a nice form of cultural exposure for non-Latin Americans. In addition to the poetry, this book has an excellent glossary and an interesting \\"Biographical Notes\\" section that gives a brief synopsis of accomplishments for each poet.Furthermore, the \\"Editor's Note,\\" provides an outstanding description of what the reader should expect from this book, and it gives a great rationale for the writing of this book. The purpose of this book is to inspire the desire in others to learn other languages. Finally, the introduction, written by Oscar Hijuelos, presents a heartfelt, compelling, and poignant picture of what it was like to live in America over 40 years ago as a Latin American. It relays the trials of a life when people were \\"Hearing one language on the streets, another at home, and a third at school...\\"(p.xxi), and one where there were no books or attitudes of sympathy for anyone dealing with this issue."},{"Title":"Cool Salsa: Bilingual Poems on Growing Up Hispanic in the United States (Edge Book)","review":"Growing up in a country where my parents are also from is something I have always taken for granted. I am from the United States, more specifically New York, and so are my parents. They are English speakers, and so am I. I attended public and catholic school in which both I learned to perfect my native language. I never struggled with learning English and never thought twice about it. Now I am studying to be an elementary teacher with a focus in English. What I have become more and more aware of is the children who do not come from English speaking parents, and the trouble they have when faced with learning the English language in public school. Different then students like myself, these children of immigrant parents do no have a basis of English education going into elementary school. Most were raised to speak their Native language and being immersed in an English taught school proves to be very challenging and frustrating for them. This can have intense negative effects on the progression and success of the students' academic career and it is very important for a teacher to familiarize themselves and understand this. The book Cool Salsa takes an interesting approach in dealing with these issues.Cool Salsa is a compilation of poems written by Latino poets of all different ages, cultures, and walks of life. Each poet does share though, the struggle of growing up Latino in America. Some poems are traditional, others are slang, some are funny and others are serious. Many are written in Spanglish (a mix of English and Spanish) and others have been translated from either Spanish or English. These poems take the reader through the experience of growing up Latino. We learn about speaking two languages, living two cultures, the challenges, the rewards, the memories and the dreams of these poets.I found this book to potentially be extremely helpful in dealing with diversity in the classroom. It truly grabs the essence of what it means to be an immigrant student. As a teacher I would really enjoy being able to read this book to my students or having them read passages from it in both Spanish and English. If my students are able to recognize and appreciate another language and culture I believe they will be more sensitive and accepting of their peers from that culture. If I do have an immigrant student from the Latino heritage I would have them read this book so that they can find familiarity with their struggles and learn a creative way to express their feelings. Even if I do not have an immigrant student I would like to use this book in my classroom to expose my students to culture and language anyway. The translations are easy and fun and the poems are personal and real. The only problem I found with this book is that some of the poems may be too mature for the lower elementary grades. Some of the language used like \\"niggerlips\\" and \\"spic\\" and \\"whitey\\" may be offensive and inappropriate for younger children. The reality of the matter is though that these are the racial slurs that some children have to deal with growing up. I would recommend and use this book for fourth grade and up only."},{"Title":"Caring for Your Collections","review":"This book was assigned reading in the Museum Studies program I completed several years ago.

Although it sometimes is as dry to read as a history text, the anecdotes of the feats of the pilots lead the reader to believe that the advantage of the American pilots in the air was team tactics and using the equipment on hand correctly. For the WWII history buff who generally sees the war in the Picific as a war of carriers, this book gives an additional point of reference to consider. The war in the Pacific is covered chronologically, but events of import of the war at sea are given less space due to the Army perspective (the Battle of Midway only recieved a page and a half, whereas the ambush of Admiral Yamamoto received much more). A bonus of the book is an annex which is a tactics manual written by the second highest scoring ace, Thomas P.

Today casual readers and playgoers are most likely to know his work through two plays written in the early 1940s: the celebrated The Iceman Cometh and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night. But the great bulk of O'Neill's work was done between about 1914 and 1933--and although the power of his later work is undeniable, it was actually his earlier work that led to his 1936 Nobel Prize for Literature.Often experimental in tone, O'Neill's plays of the 1920s and 1930s repeatedly pushed the envelope of what could be done on the stage in terms of both material and presentation, often reaching into unexpected constructions, symbolism, and psychology to jar the audience into a new perception of the possibilities of theatrical art. And then in 1928 O'Neill created a play that at the time was considered his &quot;magnum opus.&quot; That play was STRANGE INTERLUDE.STRANGE INTERLUDE challenged the audience in a host of ways, not the least of which was in length: written in nine acts with a running time of about five hours, the original 1928 production starring Lynn Fontanne began performance at mid-afternoon, paused for a dinner break, and then continued to perform for another two hours more. The structure was also quite extraordinary: from time to time the on-stage action froze, allowing the various characters in the drama to speak their internal thoughts directly to the audience in a way never previously seen on the stage.The story itself is fairly straightforward. The beautiful, popular, and enigmatic Nina Leeds is surrounded by men--but the one man she loves dies in tragedy. Determined to deal the matter &quot;sensibly,&quot; she marries in an effort to forget. It is a decision she will soon regret. But like most O'Neill plays, the bare bones of the story offers little idea of what he does with it. Endowing his drama with an unexpected degree of then-new Freudian theory, O'Neill essentially creates a character who gradually transforms the men around her into a series of archetypical characters: she projects upon them her own needs, transforming them into Father, Husband, Lover, Child. And as the decades roll by, she will fight an endless battle to force these men into the roles she has assigned.STRANGE INTERLUDE is in many ways an extremely problematic play. Even at the time it opened, many critics felt that the play was long for the sake of being long rather than from any actual dramatic need to be long. Quite a few also noted that the sudden pauses that allowed the characters to speak their internal thoughts were awkward--and indeed that the thoughts spoken were seldom as profound as they might have been. Even so, the sheer unexpectedness of the play and the doors it opened led to tremendous critical and commercial success, and even though it continues to face these criticism it is still revived with considerable success to this day.For all its power, I myself do not class STRANGE INTERLUDE with the truly great Eugene O'Neill dramas--titles like DESIRE UNDER THE ELMS, MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA, LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, and THE ICEMAN COMETH. It seems to me it is less important for its art than for the theatrical shackles it threw off; indeed, it is very difficult to imagine 20th Century 'art theatre' without it. Even so, it is a remarkable thing to read and a still more remarkable thing to see on stage, and while I do not generally recommend O'Neill's works for casual readers, STRANGE INTERLUDE is an essential for any one who is serious about theatre.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Strange interlude","review":"O'Neill won his 3rd drama Pulitzer in 1928 for this unwieldy overly long piece of psychological exaggeration. The play was his most successful in the commercial sense, says wiki. It was surely well written. Part of the interest that it aroused came from the systematic and innovative use of monologues, like stream of consciousness in prose. All actors let us hear their thoughts. It works well if it is well done, and is partly responsible for the unusual length of the play.The story of poor neurotic Nina is stretched over a quarter century in 9 acts. It is a veritable gothic marathon. Nina had been left a virgin when the love of her life left for WW1 and crashed as a pilot. She holds it against her father, who had talked hero Gordon into postponing the marriage until after the war. Such mistakes were made, just like the opposite ones, the hasty marriages or the babies out of \`wedlock' ( I have always suspected that word of being unbecomingly sarcastic). You can't easily do it right in this matter.Anyway, Nina becomes a nymphomaniac in memory of her lone star. All kinds of men try to do right by her, but she is a mystery. She lets herself be talked into marrying a clean healthy young man, in the hope of having healthy kids. Problem is that the healthy boy is feared to carry the gene of a family curse, madness. His spooky mother, reminiscent of Anthony Perkins as his own mother, warns Nina not to have the baby that she carries. She aborts and thus has some more reasons to feel guilty. As she wants a baby, but not from her husband, and she does not want divorce, adultery becomes necessary. Guilt is accumulating and gets messier with every act. Not all the madness is plausible, but then, please revert to my headline.The inner monologues serve largely as narrative tool to keep us informed what happens off stage. That is useful for us readers and spectators, but it reduces realism. It reminds me of something that I read about theatre a while ago: you must go often to like it. If you don't go often, the lack of truth hits you.The first movie version, made in the 30s, had Clark Gable in one of the male parts. The 2nd one from the 80s had Glenda Jackson as Nina. I have only watched some bits and pieces of the newer one on YouTube and was not enchanted."},{"Title":"Browning's shorter poems (Macmillan's pocket classics)","review":"Had to study his works for an English Lit course.

Now we have Mahony's From Both Sides Now with its multi-faceted approach and a pretty sharp intro by its editor. A fine text for classroom use since it affords a view of veterans from both sides, as well as other more well-known poets including Sharon Olds and Philip Levine,etc. The anthology is well-organized, and in some cases especially poignant since it presents poems by poets whose work is not known to the American public.

A very delightful read"},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"I loved this mystery by Georgette Heyer. I've read a few of her regency romances so I knew it would be funny. But I was pleasantly surprised how excellent and suspenseful the actual mystery was as well. Set in a sleepy English town in the 1930's, the story is about three siblings and a sibling in law who inherit a rumored to be haunted house and decide to move in. The banter between the four-some is hilarious and the overall story was very Scooby-Doo! I will certainly be reading more of Heyer's mysteries."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Footsteps in the Dark by Georgette HeyerGeorgette Heyer makes me think of my mother. I grew up remembering her read (and utterly love) Georgette Heyer. Especially her regency romances.So, when I had the opportunity to listen to this book I jumped on it!Yes, I listened to it. I spend a fair amount of time in my car so I figured that having an audio recording would get me through the story fairly quickly. :)Three siblings, Peter, Margaret & Celia have inherited a house from their uncle. The house, called \\"The Priory\\" has been unused for some years, so upon news of their inheritance the three (plus Celia's husband, Charles) go to see their new property. Along with their aunt, the absolutely hilarious Mrs. Bosanquet, they plan to refurbish the ancient house and turn it into something livable.But shortly after their arrival, locals begin telling them about the eery things that occur at The Priory, including a tale of The Monk who is said to haunt the place. Though they are urged to leave, the siblings are determined to uncover the true identity of The Monk, after all, he can't be a ghost, can he?Yet, spooky things begin to happen including ghostly moanings for undetermined locations, skeletons, and a series of hidden passages and crypts are discovered leading the three siblings to discover that the mystery of The Monk goes much deeper than anyone could have expected.And when a murder occurs, it becomes apparent that if they do not solve the mystery shortly, any of them could be the next victim of The Monk...Will these amateur sleuths be able to uncover the secret identity of The Monk? Why does he roam The Priory, and how? Or will The Monk get them before they can get him?Read, Footsteps In The Dark to find out!This book was Georgette Heyer's first attempt outside of regency romance into the world of thrillers. While it was never a work she considered one of her major works.But that being said, I really enjoyed this mystery! Georgette Heyer is wonderful at weaving an intricate mystery that is not easy to unravel until the truth is revealed at the end. And the cast of characters was completely entertaining! With witty retorts from Mrs. Bosanquet to keep things hilariously light at times, the book kept me engaged and entertained!Georgette Heyer made the relationships between the characters feel very authentic. The banter between siblings had that air of familiarity and familial closeness that had just a hint of sibling rivalry without overdoing it.And once the mystery is revealed (which I won't give away) it is a very believable story with a believable resolution. While I enjoy a cozy mystery, many are a tad bit unbelievable either when the mystery is resolved, or in that the same amateur sleuth could come across so many murders and solve them all, surviving one death defying experience after another.Yet here we have a jaunty cast of characters who work together to solve the mystery which is unexpected but believable.Bonus, for anyone who wants a clean mystery, this definitely qualifies! While not Christian fiction, the book is definitely appropriate for the clean fiction lover and Christian fiction lover alike.All-in-all, 4 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"I've not read nor listened previously to any work by Heyer. Attracted by the price and the background of the author, I took the plunge with this, the first of her mysteries. Allowing for the customary defects in the robots work (mainly in the pronunciation of words with multiple meanings and, amenable to easy rectification were Amazon ready to do so, the pronunciation of titles such as should be pronounced Misses, for example, as M, R, S) the male robot did a good, clear, easily followed, job. The book, itself, proved to be an enjoyable haunted house mystery, written with a light touch, and worthy of a place with the many similar works which have graced stage, radio and screen from deep into the past. The characters are amusingly drawn, the plot familiar but not hackneyed, the suspense handled adeptly, the humor not belabored, and the romance properly subdued to the central premises of the mystery. All in all, most engaging, and a pretty sure bet for most readers drawn to drawing room, rather than gritty urban back street, crime."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Lots of fun just the same!

I love her Regencies, as well, for her humor, brilliant characters and plotting, and dialogue. \\"Footprints in the Dark\\" had it all, I admit; haunted house, secret passages, questionable characters - but it took a while to get going for me. I felt like this was one of her first attempts at mystery, and I could tell, if you know what I mean; as a mystery buff, you're used to certain plot devices, character types, etc., and it's just a matter of how creatively the author uses them. The writer's level of mastery adds or detracts from my enjoyment accordingly - how much I as the reader \\"saw that coming\\". Anyway, because this was one of her first efforts, before the Inspectors Hemingway and Hannasyde mysteries, it felt more obvious in places; but for all that, Heyer's signature wit and style carried it through the slower bits until it really started hopping in the last quarter or so of the book. So, since Heyer's slowest-going effort is still better than 90% of what's available today for mystery fans, I'd still give this book four stars!"},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"There are many things you can expect from a Georgette Heyer mystery. One is a superb mystery and another is a liberal dose of levity. This particular book is really quite a good ghostly Monk story. Everyone in the village knows that The Priory and it's grounds are haunted by The Monk. Too many people have seen that apparition to leave any doubt about that. Even so, Celia and Charles Malcolm along with her brother and sister, Peter and Margaret Fortescue are determined to stay on and enjoy their holiday. The Priory has no electricity so they only have candles and lamps to light their way but that just adds to the adventure. Except that the adventure begins to turn into one frightening episode after another with The Monk making more and more appearances. Charles and Peter are determined to get to the bottom of what is going on, but there are so many people who keep turning up at odd times on the grounds of The Priory. Then a skull rolls down the dark stairway, a priest hole is found in the upstairs hall and a horrible groaning sound scares everybody witless. Now the men are going to the nearest town to lay all their facts before the police and see if they can't find some answers to these happenings.Written in 1932, this novel is classic Heyer in her presentation of the \\"bright, young things\\" who are the lead characters in the book. There is also an eccentric entomologist who is hunting moths at night, the retired bachelor Colonel, the village doctor who has started drinking too much, the busybody Vicar's wife, the artist who paints really dreadful pictures, and the suspicious man that Margaret Fortescue can't help but be attracted to. In this book Charles Malcolm is the quipster in the crowd, always ready with a joke to get everyone over the frightening or bothersome moment. A Georgette Heyer mystery isn't usually riddled with murdered corpses and this book is no exception. She built her books on character relationships and atmosphere. In this book, she has accomplished a wonderful result in both those areas.This book is just an old fashioned good time. If you enjoy reading Ngaio Marsh, Patricia Wentworth, Josephine Tey, Agatha Christie or Margery Allingham, you will be very glad to add Georgette Heyer to your list of classic mystery fiction writers. She never disappoints."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"I have tried several times to read the other novels that Miss Heyer wrote outside of her Regency novels. I have not been able to get into either her other historical periods or her mysteries. They really lack the charm of the Regency novels."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"The book is set in an old English Abbey complete with skeleton and probable ghost. Have no doubt, it is a murder mystery but there are scenes where the characters will have you laughing out loud and there are many distinct characters to choose from.

My only disappointment was solving the crime long before the end of the book:{"},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"I ordered this book because I had seen somewhere that Georgette Heyer wrote similar stories to Agatha Cristie. And this is true, in that they both wrote English country house murder mysteries. However, Ms. Heyer takes the long road to get to the plot. Very long colorful descriptions regarding dinner parties and what not, that didn't (I feel) enhance the story line. I finally ended up cheating and skipped to the end. Also, having been written long ago, the character's speech and the settings are out-dated (no electricity and the women are &#34;delicate&#34;).

They decide to make a stay there to see if the country life suits them. There is a rumored ghost on the property, \\"The Monk\\", strange sounds in the night and a mysterious stranger who may have darker motives. While the characterization was not particularly strong, the story has some charm, even though the mystery is less difficult to solve with a modern perspective. Some of the character's behavior is sterotypical (the slightly inept country policeman, for example) and some of actions of the characters, while probably fitting with the time period, are a bit jarring to modern sensibilities. It was an enjoyable, if not overly involving story."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Oh, I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It is a highly mannered mystery novel, full of wit and humor.

Although all of her mysteries are good--and witty--Footsteps In The Dark seems to be the only one where Heyer went for outright comedy. There are chills enough in this tale of five people (husband-and-wife, two siblings, and an aunt) who have moved to what seems to be a haunted house, but there are some extremely funny moments as well. (There is one line in the book--which I will not quote--which sent me rolling on the floor for fully five minutes.

Learning to live the peaceful country life brings anything, but repose. Georgette Heyer's, \\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" with its conventional, but welldrawn characters will have you laughing outloud when following her crisp dialogue.Clues and red herrings bounce down hidden staircases and mouldering crypts as Heyer, at her very best, leads the reader through a labyrinth of mystery and suspense interspersed with a light romance. First written in 1932, it still has the power to enthrall. If you've ever dreamed of an old house in the country, this one has all the aspects of reality without electricity or a phone. A great read at any time, but we don't recommend by lamplight.Nash Black, author of \\"Qualifying Laps\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers.\\""},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"It's funny sometimes, how books packed with so much excitement and memorable characters can just sit placidly on your shelf, waiting to be read. Footsteps in the Dark is a thriller mystery of the first order, complete with secret passageways, priest holes, skeletons and a cowled monk. Of all Heyer's historicals, it reminds me most of The Reluctant Widow (one of my absolute favorites!) with its full cast of characters, most of whom are related to each other. The book is full of hilarious one-liners and wonderful character interplay, Heyer's trademark. I find in books like this that I get so wrapped up in the chemistry between characters that the plot becomes secondary. It's unfortunate that character interaction is so hard to review, really, since it is such an integral part of books. In Footsteps in the Dark, the characters (Charles in particular, playing against Peter) all deal splendidly together, and the book is a great romp because of it.I am thoroughly enjoying rediscovering Heyer, this time from the perspective of reading her mysteries set in Britain between the wars (if you haven't read her Regencies, you should!). She is light-hearted and fun, but the plots are all interesting and well planned. I prefer this one to Behold, Here's Poison, mainly because the characters are far more likeable and the plot develops in a more compelling way. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"There seems to be a knee-jerk reaction among Heyer's fans (of which I am one) to praise all her works, regardless of quality, to the skies. I wanted to love \\"Footsteps in the Dark\\", a recently re-printed entry in the \\"old dark house\\" genre of mysteries. I really did. However, this was Ms. Heyer's first foray into the crime novel, and it shows. Every element that her fans love--vibrant characters, witty dialogue, romantic tension--was missing from this book.The plot requires all the characters, up to and including the undercover cop, to behave like complete idiots, and the dialogue--usually Heyer's forte--is cringe-worthy. The characters' ingrained snobbery and xenophobia, while by no means uncommon to works of this period, come off as particularly grating. And the \\"romance\\" between Margaret and Michael is perfunctory and unconvincing--indeed, Margaret has more real chemistry with her own brother Peter than with Michael, the \\"hero\\", who is smug, condescending, and dreadfully dim-witted, especially considering his profession. The only character who feels like a true Heyer creation is Mrs. Bosanquet, an elderly, scatterbrained aunt of the protagonists.The pacing of the novel seems off as well--instead of action scenes and dramatic tension, we get lengthy exposition and page-long monologues to explain what is happening. Important plot points that should have been explored in detail are instead glossed over in a couple of sentences, while trivial details are discussed endlessly. In short, hackneyed story, clumsily executed. Skip this one and read instead \\"A Blunt Instrument\\", one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Georgette Heyer is an often overlooked mystery writer of the latter generations. It's often exciting just to find someone under 30 who knows Agatha Christie...but Heyer was every bit as good, in a more tongue in cheek way.

The characters are very generic, the 2 younger women in particular having no particular traits at all. The police have no method, the officer also seems to have no real personality except an occasional feeling of annoyance. The love interest for the unmarried sister is completely inexplicable, odd considering the author's expertise in romance. I like some of Ms. Heyer's other mysteries, love most of her romances, and enjoy mysteries like the Peter Wimseys, older Agatha Christies and Ngaio Marshes, but I definitely do NOT recommend Footsteps in the Dark."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Has the Priory really been empty all these years?Peter, Celia and Margaret inherit the old house after the death of an absent uncle who was afraid of the resident ghost...the Monk.

The supernatural rather quickly becomes merely suspenseful as the skull rolls out after one of the characters opines that there must be skeletons in the wall.

If you enjoy humor with your mystery, this book has it all. The only thing missing is Heyer's CID detectives but that is a minor issue.I love mysteries! But mostly I love English Cozy mysteries. I can't think of a better way to spend a cold winter evening than tucked into a comfy chair with a hot cup of tea at my side and one of Georgette Heyer's mystery books in my hands. Of course to make it perfect there should also be scones and clotted cream with that tea! I now have all of Heyer's mysteries. Unfortunately she only wrote a dozen of them. Where as she wrote at least three times as many romance books. Of those I have only read about five and out of those \\"The Talisman Ring\\" was my favorite. It is funny and there is a bit of mystery too. But I so enjoy her mysteries. Her Scotland Yard detectives, Superintendent Hannasyde and my favorite Sergeant Hemingway {soon to be Inspector and then Chief Inspector in later books} are right up there with Agatha Christie's Poirot. But with more than a touch of humor in the mix. And you must read \\"They Found Him Dead\\" before \\"Duplicate Death\\" because a few of the major characters are found in both books and one is now all grown up and right in the thick of things. Georgette Heyer was acclaimed as one of the finest mystery writers and I agree. Now that Sourcebooks have reprinted these, I can put away my falling to bits original copies."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"\\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" is a historical mystery set in England. It was first published in 1932 and was set in the late 1920's, so it was written as a contemporary mystery. Of the Heyer mysteries I've read so far, this is my favorite. It's very funny, especially since the group (3 siblings, a spouse, and an aunt) get spooked despite their determination not to believe in ghosts. Though there wasn't a lot of depth to the characters, they were engaging and likable.The whodunit was well done. About halfway through, I predicted who were \\"bad guys\\" and who were \\"good guys.\\" Closer to the end, I was certain who the Monk was. Yet I still felt elated to discover that I'd guessed correctly. I think I was elated because the clues were subtle things that were \\"off\\" more than evidence directly linked to the crime, so I knew my guess about the Monk was not a sure thing even though I felt certain.The suspense was created by wondering what was causing the moans and groans (it does come across as spooky) and by the potential physical danger to the main characters. There was no sex. There was some explicit bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this novel to those who enjoy humorous mysteries."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Dark","review":"Georgette Heyer has a command of the English language which is magnificent.

Keenan does AN EXCELLENT job of balancing Spirit and Truth. He skillfully handles the Word of God on the subject of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and tongues. Rather than trying to prove his own narrow conviction, he helps the reader understand the strong points of both Pentecostals and non-Pentecostals. The credibility of this author is seen in the fact that Keenan is a Baptist Biblical scholar who teaches at Eastern Theological Seminary--yet he boldly shares his personal experience of speaking in tongues and practicing the gifts of the Spirit. His writings and personal experience bring out the best of both worlds--careful scholarship mixed with a hunger for the living God. I was encouraged to want the same thing. Let me say once again that this book is my HANDS DOWN favorite book on the Holy Spirit. We need more people like Keenan who are willing to look honestly at both sides of the issue and then to give honest answers about what both sides have in common."},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"Due to its readability and fairness and faithfulness to the Scriptures, this book made my Top-10 list of Pentecostal/Charismatic works that support the continuation of the gifts of the Spirit and/or the baptism in the Spirit (list may be viewed on The Foundation for Pentecostal Scholarship's Web site, scroll to bottom and click on \\"more\\"). I heartily endorse this book for anyone interested in the Holy Spirit and his gifts.Concerning the gifts of the Spirit, Keener does not arbitrarily divide them into supernatural (\\"sign\\") and non-supernatural gifts and declare that the supernatural gifts have ceased (a belief called \\"cessationism\\"). In fact, he believes that \\"cessationism would not naturally occur to someone reading the biblical text who had not already been taught the position or did not have an experiential bias that demanded it\\" (107).He cogently explains how all of the main scriptures that cessationists use to truncate the gifts of the Spirit for our day are misinterpreted by the cessationists (for example, 1 Cor 13:8-12; Eph 2:20; Heb 2:3-4). He introduces his discussion of 1 Cor 13:8-12, writing, \\"In the course of Paul's argument that the gifts are temporary, we learn when Paul expects them to pass away. The church will no longer need such gifts when we know as we are known . . . , which is when we see Christ face to face (13:12)\\" (105).But this book is not just about the gifts of the Spirit; Keener also discusses the baptism in the Holy Spirit. He correctly argues that \\"the whole sphere of the Spirit's work becomes available at conversion, but believers may experience some aspects of the Spirit's work only subsequent to conversion\\" (151). He's referring to the filling of the Holy Spirit (for empowerment to evangelize), which was considered normative in Luke's day, as he illustrates with Acts 8 and the Samaritan Christians who were lacking this empowerment but which Peter and John quickly remedied. Although this incident of Spirit reception (Luke uses various names for it) and the others (see Acts 2, 9, 10, 19) are often deemed \\"exceptions\\" by non-Pentecostals, Keener observes that \\"When four of our five biblical examples are \\"exceptions,\\" . . . , one is tempted to question the validity of the \\"rule\\" (162).Furthermore, Keener argues, \\"To be sure, most of the events Luke reports are exceptional in some sense, narrating the carrying forth of the gospel (with the attendant Christian baptism and the gift of the Spirit) to different groups of people. But this hardly means that Luke wants us to think that patterns he establishes among different groups ceased in his own day. Rather, he wants us to recognize that this pattern follows all Christians regardless of their background. Being filled with the Spirit should be a normal part of all Christians' lives\\" (162).He includes a helpful discussion of the Acts-as-history argument, concluding that \\"We dare not underestimate the significance of Luke's testimony, because Acts is the only New Testament book that directly depicts early Christianity . . .\\" (158). He devotes an appendix to this discussion and in it states, \\"The fact that our traditional method of extracting doctrine from Scripture does not work well on narrative does not mean that Bible stories do not send clear messages. Instead, it suggests that the way we apply our traditional method of interpretation is inadequate because we are ignoring too much of God's Word. . . . The \\"narrative\\" way of interpreting Bible stories, in fact, shows us how to read the Epistles properly\\" (212).Although Keener intersperses life experiences with his exegesis, this is no reason to accuse him of basing his conclusions on subjectivity. He is simply illustrating exegesis with narrative. In fact, he states, \\"I must conform my experience to the Bible rather than the Bible to my experience\\" (111) and that \\"Scripture is the 'canon,' the 'measuring stick,' hence, the final arbiter of revelation\\" (123). For Pentecostals and Charismatics, we have no \\"experiential bias\\" that drives us to dispense with the supernatural gifts. Rather, we believe that our experiences are borne out by the Scriptures and by Christ's promise that he would empower us to do our part in evangelizing the world (Acts 1:8).Charismatics, Third Wavers, and Pentecostals can profit a lot from Keener's gentle nudging and chiding throughout. He writes that \\"the Spirit's coming produces gifts, but especially fruit. . . . [T]he work of the Spirit must go deeper than Spirit-led utterances and initial experiences alone\\" (57).Hopefully, what I've highlighted in this review will not give you the wrong impression. This is not a negative, adversarial book, but a balanced book written in an irenic spirit about--as its subtitle says--the Holy Spirit today. So if you're interested in what the Holy Spirit can do in your life TODAY and how he can use you as his instrument TODAY, this is the book for you.--Robert W. Graves, President, The Foundation for Pentecostal Scholarship"},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"I put a 5 star rating because Keener is so well rounded with his various experiences with different denominations that his wisdom is very evident, and so everyone should read this book! One quibble though, Keener says Luke never mentions anywhere in Acts that the Spirit is concerned with salvation, but that is simply not true. Acts 15 describes how the baptism of the Spirit on Cornelius' house and Peter's seeing it was evidence that God accepted the Gentiles. This of course is a great definition of salvation, the acceptance of us, adoption, if you will, of us as His children. So it muddies the water a bit as to how Luke viewed the baptism of the Spirit. Acts 15 leans closer to what Paul was saying about it in Ephesians 1:13 - a seal, a promise. I agree with Keener that the baptism of the Spirit is technically separate from actual conversion, but it is the experential counterpart and confirmation of salvation"},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"Dr. Keener has written a great book for anyone interested in learning more about the present day ministry of the Holy Spirit. If you're looking for a near exhaustive bibliography and comprehensive cross references, then purchase a copy of Gordon Fee's \\"God's Empowering Presence\\". However, if you want a scholar's look at the Spirit from a more personal and practical standpoint, i.e. something more appropriate for a layperson, then this book is a good start. Keener covers almost every major subject concisely and intelligently. That being said, there are places, especially in the first few chapters of the book, that have choppy transitions and don't really make sense in terms of the overall flow of the book. If you really dislike that kind of writing, then I suggest \\"I Believe in the Holy Spirit\\" by Michael Green, which is longer, but more fluid. Regardless, \\"Gift & Giver\\" is one of a handful of books that I recommend to laypersons for gaining greater insight into the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer."},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"As other reviewers have indicated, this book is thoroughly biblical and Craig Keener uses Scripture accurately and comprehensively throughout the book.

An excellent buy!!!!"},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"I haven't read this book fully and carefully, but I have read its previous edition, 3 CRUCIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT. Primarily I want to address the other reviewer's comments about cessationists being cautious about subjective or personal testimony in this area. While I don't want to belittle the need for adherence to the Scriptures in these matters and the need to check these things out by the Scriptures, and to study what the Scriptures teach about these things, much of the Bible IS personal experience. It's what men and women experienced of God. And though &quot;these things have been written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have Life in His name&quot; (John 20:31), New Testament faith is also based on subjective and personal testimony to these things in our lives (Galatians 3:5). As one who does NOT believe that God stopped doing these things with the passing of the apostles or the close of the canon, nor that the Scriptures teach such a doctrine, I expect believers to be able to give subjective and personal testimony to these things as a sign that &quot;God is among [them]&quot; (I Corinthians 14:25). As Philip said to Nathanael: &quot;Come and see&quot; (John 1:46). Keener provides both Scriptural arguments and personal testimony to the validity and reality of this theology."},{"Title":"Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today","review":"\\"The Bible's message does not simply confirm my own experience of miracles; it summons me to be more open to appropriate signs and wonders than I already am,\\" (111).Keener chooses to balance personal testimony with scriptural study in this discussion concerning the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers today. I understand that it is difficult for most scholars to move from an academic examination to personal witness of an issue, but Gift Giver is an attempt in this direction. Keener has experienced, firsthand, the work of the Holy Spirit in private tongues, proclamation, and wisdom. He also claims to have experienced the work of the Spirit in the lives of others through prophecy, miracles, and spiritual understanding. \\"I have done my best to write a book that is fair to various views, but I have especially tried to be faithful to what I believe I find in the Bible,\\" (13). This subjective approach is used, along with exegesis of some texts, to suggest that the Holy Spirit is actively working in the lives of Christians today.Keener explains the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christians both personally and theologically. The first four chapters of this book are an explanation of how the Holy Spirit teaches us the mind and heart of God. The Spirit calls us and teaches us God's will and plan for our lives. The Spirit works with the Word of God, to change us into the image of God.Although a convinced atheist by age nine, I was converted through the witness of some Baptist street evangelists at the age of fifteen, the first day I heard the gospel. I argued with them for forty-five minutes, but the Spirit worked me over for the next hour or so until, on the floor of my bedroom, I acquiesced and surrendered my life to him (45).The Spirit also shows us God's character and forms us in His image to walk according to His divine purpose. Keener's exegesis of Hebrew and Greek scriptures illustrated the formative power of God's Spirit.Chapters five through nine were discussions of how the Spirit works in Christians lives and the church today. Keeners' exegesis of texts in John, Acts, 1 Cor. 12-14; and Eph. 4 were used to suggest that the Spirit was working and guiding the early church through powers such as tongues, miracles, baptism, and other gifts. Keener also used his personal testimony of the Spirit in his life, and the lives of others, to support his belief that the Spirit is continuing to work today. Keener cautions those who believe that the spiritual gifts have ceased, from drawing their conclusions without accepting personal testimonies.I feel that Keener has given valuable personal testimony in the discussion concerning the work of the Spirit in the modern church. I do feel that his critique of skeptics or cessasionists is made with little caution or understanding of where they/we stand on this issue. His suggestion that the \\"Enlightenment\\" has soured modern scholarship on the miraculous gifts of the Spirit is insensitive to those who honestly and cautiously resist subjective or personal testimony in this area. I believe both sides should continue to approach exegesis from an objective view and then seek application through their lives and views of Scripture."},{"Title":"The Gardners' habitats.(author John Gardner and his family): An article from: The Antioch Review","review":"The article is interesting, giving some insight into the personality and habits of John Gardner and his family.

A variety of editors speak openly and candidly about the publishing world -- what makes a best seller, what makes a winning nonfiction proposal, what they want (and don't want) from authors. From small university presses to powerful New York publishing houses, Judy Mandell conducts over 40 interviews and asks editors the questions I've always wanted to ask. How are advances determined? Which books get &quot;the big push&quot; in promotions? When I finished the book I understood a little better how editors think and what they need from writers. That's invaluable information."},{"Title":"Book Editors Talk to Writers","review":"This is one of my two favorite books on the publishing business. Read it cover to cover and you will come away with ammunition most writers don't have when they try to sell their books.

It's like having a friend in the publishing business.Buy this and the only other book you will need is &quot;Write a Book Without a Finger&quot;, by Mahesh Grossman, which shows several actual proposals by first time authors, two of whom sold their first books for over $100,000 dollars."},{"Title":"Book Editors Talk to Writers","review":"Writers often send in a manuscript without reading the publisher's writing guidelines, properly formatting their work, extensive proofreading, etc. Book editors talk about these topics and more in order to enlighten writer's about what is expected of them before they put their manuscript in the mail.

The last stories return to the old neighborhood and again, the perfectly noted details and highly individualized characters drew me back into the lives of that time and place. Highly recommended for those who enjoy short fiction and anyone who appreciates excellent writing."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"Stuart Dybek's I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN arrives more than a decade after his previous book, a short story collection titled THE COAST OF CHICAGO. While it's neither a blockbuster nor a doorstop tome like Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited MIDDLESEX or Donna Tartt's years-in-the-making THE LITTLE FRIEND, I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN is definitely worth the wait, serving as a reintroduction to a writer who captures his old Chicago neighborhood with documentary detail and raconteur flourish.Despite its billing as a novel, I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN is actually a series of short stories that have locales and characters in common. All feature a teenage narrator named Perry and all are set in the Little Village community of Chicago during the early 1960s. Dybek lovingly and often humorously evokes this time and place through telling observations.Poor families use old bed sheets for curtains and veterans order shots for friends who didn't come back from the war. It's a dangerous, often discouraging neighborhood, and in strong, unfussy prose Dybek describes \\"the daily round of life where bag ladies combed alleys and the homeless, sleeping in junked cars, were found frozen to death in winter. Laid-off workmen became wife beaters in their newfound spare time; welfare mothers in the projects turned tricks to supplement the family budget; and it seemed that every day someone lost teeth at one or another of the corner bars.\\"Fortunately, Dybek lets his lively characters --- including a junior high writing prodigy named Camille Estrada and a slob hitman named Joe Ditto --- run wild in this setting. Rather than engineering plots and scenes for them, Dybek simply lets them tell their own stories, a rare talent that gives the book a personal, unrehearsed quality. Plus, it makes for some truly weird goings-on. As a coming-of-age story, I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN eschews any predictability in favor of a dreamlike flow of events and characters, many of which are supersaturated with local color.There is, for instance, the Chickenman, who walks around town with a chicken perching on his head and pecking corn off his tongue. And there's Little Village's unofficial child saint, Ralphie Poskozim, who was born with blue skin: \\"The blue was plainly visible beneath his blue-green eyes, smudges darker than shadows, as if he'd been in a fistfight or gotten into his mother's mascara. Even his lips looked cold.\\"All of these strange characters are filtered through Perry's perspective, and as the novel progresses, he grows up and his concerns become more adult. Fortunately, as Perry gains more freedom, the stories don't lose their charm or their sense of wonder.Memory works in flashes, not in fluid narratives, and it allows for exaggeration of facts. In the end these chapters cohere into something larger than a short-story collection, but the book is not like a proper novel. This is certainly not a criticism: the form of I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN may be unclassifiable, but its inventiveness and spirit are undeniable.--- Reviewed by Stephen M. Deusner"},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"I will start with the conclusion: READ THIS BOOK. It is exhilarating and poignant, funny and wise. It consists of eleven interlaced stories about Perry Katzek, the son of an immigrant from Poland, growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the 1950s. The Chicago setting, the kaleidoscopic episodes, the sweaty grittiness of urban, immigrant life, and the rather picaresque nature of the narrative all remind me of Saul Bellow's \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\", though, to my mind, I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN turns out to be an even better book.No doubt much of it is based on the personal experiences of author Stuart Dybek, who was born in 1942 and grew up in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. Indeed, much of the book may well be personal memoir draped with but the thinnest of fictional garb. Still, it reads more like a novel (or a collection of inter-related stories) than like a memoir.Those who are from Chicago and are now between the ages of 55 and 75 might treasure the book just a tad more than the rest of us, inasmuch as it features such places as Twelfth Street Beach, Sportsman's Park, the Rocks, Meigs Field, Douglas Park, the outdoor market on Maxwell Street, the Sanitary Canal, and the Baha'i Temple. (I certainly would treasure any novel half as good about Philadelphia - my hometown - during the same years.) But one need not be from Chicago to find the book special. What it has to say about memory, childhood and youth, and the human condition should speak to most, and especially to males who grew up in an urban, working-class setting.The book abounds with lovable characters and with sparkling anecdotes. Among the former are Perry's father (whom he and his brother call \\"Sir\\" because one night while watching \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" he had said how nice it was that Wally and Beaver called their father \\"Sir\\"), his uncle Lefty who played the sax and the horses, his best friend Stosh, and his erstwhile girlfriend Laurel Elaine Levanto who left Perry stranded in the Fire Truck Graveyard after the high school prom. Among the anecdotes is this one about Denny \\"the Fish\\" Mihala: when the fourth-grade teacher Sister Philomena asked the class, \\"If birds come in flocks, and fish in schools, what other kinds of groupings can you name?\\", Denny eagerly answered, \\"A dozen donuts!\\"The motif that struck home with me the most had to do with memory and nostalgia. Here is one such excerpt: \\"Who knows why certain humble objects - a bike, a sweater, a sled - are salvaged by memory or dream to become emblems of childhood? Childhood, an alternative universe expanding into forgetfulness, where memory rather than matter is the stuff of creation.\\"I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN is also noteworthy for its writing and craftsmanship. The stories are skillfully interwoven, and there are moments when Dybek's writing is brilliant, such as when he refers to a character gazing up at the nighttime sky, \\"aware that he was just another speck adrift in stardust on the absolute zero breath of God.\\"I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN (the title comes from a song Perry's brother Mick sang when they were kids) was published in 2004, which to my way of thinking still makes it contemporary fiction. I don't read a lot of contemporary fiction. Maybe I should make a point of reading more, because I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN is first-rate literature. It easily is one of the ten best books I read in 2012."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"First of all, let me say that I absolutely love Stuart Dybek and everything he has written. Although my favorite of Dybek's books are \\"The Coast of Chicago\\" and \\"Streets in Their Own Ink,\\" I must also praise \\"I Sailed with Magellan,\\" for including the magnificent story, \\"We Didn't.\\"I stumbled across \\"We Didn't\\" in my university's Short Story class, and loved it so much that I invested in all of his works.\\"We Didn't\\" begins with the following prose:\\"We didn't in the light; we didn't in darkness. We didn't in the fresh-cut summer grass or in the mounds of autumn leaves or on the snow where moonlight threw down our shadows. We didn't in your room on the canopy bed you slept in, the bed you'd slept in as a child, or in the backseat of my father's rusted Rambler, which smelled of the smoked chubs and kielbasa he delivered on weekends from my uncle Vincent's meat market. We didn't in your mother's Buick Eight, where a rosary twined the rearview mirror like a beaded, black snake with silver, cruciform fangs.\\"and ends with:\\"But we didn't, not in the moonlight, or by the phosphorescent lanterns of lightning bugs in your back yard, not beneath the constellations we couldn't see, let alone decipher, or in the dark glow that replaced the real darkness of night, a darkness already stolen from us, not with the skyline rising behind us while a city gradually decayed, not in the heat of summer while a Cold War raged, despite the freedom of youth and the license of first love - because of fate, karma, luck, what does it matter? - we made not doing it a wonder, and yet we didn't, we didn't, we never did.\\"I mean, does it really get any better than that?I could go on and on, quite literally, about Dybek's prose, but I won't. I will, instead, encourage you to buy this book. Buy it, read it, then buy and read his other works, especially \\"Coast\\" and \\"Streets.\\" If you love his prose as much as I do, share them with your friends. I find it a great shame that he isn't better known, that more people aren't reading Dybek, because they really should be."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"This is timeless fiction of the highest order, on a level with the finest contemporary writers from Stephen Dixon to Philip Roth to Bliss Broyard. Dybek writes with depth, precision and deep feeling; this is the work of a lifetime sketching out a milieu (the Chicago Polish workingclass community) with loving, compassionate and haunting details. James T. Farrell and Nelson Algren were the pioneers of Chicago fiction, but Dybek digs deeper. This is unforgettable work, sketching out the turf he knows so well and making it as universal as Sherwood Anderson, Chekhov and Dostoyevsky."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"I suppose I would love this book even if I weren't a Chicagoan. The characters are so richly crafted, and the action poignant yet well paced. Perhaps the most heartbreaking story is \\"Blue Boy,\\" with its message in the final paragraph so lushly written I took a sharp intake of breath before reading it again--aloud. An interconnected series of short stories, not everything meshes, especially \\"Breasts,\\" which takes a side trip into the life of a hit man. But for the most part this is a special, nostalgic look at a Second City that really doesn't exist anymore, but lives on in gorgeous detail in Dybek's prose."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"Reading Stuart Dybek's writing is like being lulled along by an improvised vocalization. It dips and weaves and soars and hums, and at the end you're not really sure what to make of all you have experienced, but you know you are better off for it and that you do not witness such beauty often. This is art of the highest caliber.Each story in this collection is a work of art. They are linked more by feeling and emotion and the musical quality of language than by themes or plot or even character.\\"Breasts\\" is often criticized as being out of place in the collection, but for me it is the anchor of the entire piece. Consisting of two diverging storylines, one involving a former Mexican Wrestler, the other a mafia hitman. It is the impossibility of each storyline's compatibility with the other that holds them together. Like the heart breaking lullaby of a saxophone rising from an El platform in the dead of night (an image taken from one of the passages in the middle of the story . . . some of the most graceful writing I've ever read.)Then there is \\"Blue Boy,\\" a story with such depth and compassion for its characters that you are moved enough to accept the direct revelation of the narrator at the end.\\"Orchids\\" is the ultimate story of teenagehood. All the angst, frustration, adventure, romance, and heartbreak of adolescence, particularly an adolescence growing up poor, is captured in these meandering pages. This is my favorite story in the collection. I cannot explain why.\\"We Didn't,\\" taught in every reputable university creative writing class, is very near to being a perfect short story, and also one with the clearest independent themes and plot in the collection.And so on.This is that rare kind of book that only comes around once in a decade (think _Angela's Ashes_ or _The Things They Carried_). The book might not change your life or the way you look at the world, but it will remind you why we read stories and why language is so precious."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"stuart dybek is a gifted writer who truly understands the shortstory. His characters are full of life and wonderfully human.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys great writing."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"The review below posted by Reggieroy captures my thoughts on this book exactly. The writing was beautiful, the characters so real I felt I knew them. I especially liked the stories of young Perry with his brother and his friends. I think my favorites were of the prom date he took to the junkyard and the one near the end about Perry and his Babushka."},{"Title":"I Sailed with Magellan","review":"A fan of Dybek's work for years, I looked forward to the publication of his third book. As I sit at my computer to write this bit, my new kitten, Gus aka Pooky, follows with deftness and alertness each letter as it appears on the screen. Right now she's affixed upon the little AOL symbol in the upper right hand corner that rotates and fades and reappears while I'm online. Gus/Pooky notices with enthusiasm the nuances in life and language, and honors them. She is smart and charming and not only does not disappoint, she makes living all the better. Same with Dybek and his stories. He's crafty as a magician, and has the heart of a lover of words, of the world. His writing is at once a gift and a friend, and I'm always happy to have it around."},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"This is a fine chess book about the Dragon, a variation of the Sicilian defence in which Black puts his King Bishop (the glorious \\"Dragon Bishop\\") on g7, where it exerts pressure on White's Queenside. The opening moves are 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 g6, after which White has several choices.One idea is 6 Be3 Bg7 7 f3 Nc6 8 Qd2 0-0. This is the well-known and highly analyzed Yugoslav Attack. As Martin explains, White then castles long with the intention of playing h4 and h5, to open the rook file. White may also play Bc4. White generally wants to get rid of that Dragon Bishop (say, with Bh6) and to get the Queen into the attack (say, with Qh6), get rid of Black's defending Knight on f6 (usually via Nd5) and mate Black on h7. Martin starts us right out with a very famous Dragon game, in which then fifteen year old Bobby Fischer (with White) defeated Bent Larsen in the 1958 Portoroz Interzonal. That game reached the Yugoslav Attack position after eight moves and continued 9 Bc4 Nxd4 10 Bxd4 Be6 11 Bb3 Qa5 12 0-0-0 b5 13 Kb1 b4 14 Nd5 (as Martin mentions, the Knight was heading here anyway) 14...Bxd5 15 Bxd5 Rac8 16 Bb3At this point, Fischer, in his \\"60 Memorable Games\\" commented that Larsen was not going to get another chance to grab the Bishop! Martin agrees that Larsen ought to have taken it. It is clear that White has a big advantage now. And Fischer says here that he \\"felt the game was in the bag if I didn't botch it. I'd won dozens of skittles games in analogous positions and had it down to a science: pry open the KR file, sac, sac, mate!\\" I certainly can understand why Fischer said that!However, Martin makes a mistake here that costs him a star from me. He puts Fischer's quote not after White's 16th move, but after Black's 5th move, as if Fischer thought the entire Dragon were busted! And he tosses in the absurd comment that \\"today, even Fischer would find life a great deal more complicated against a Dragon specialist.\\" I suspect Martin is wrong about that! Would he really like to defend Black's position at move 16 against someone of Fischer's strength?Anyway, Martin shows us how Fischer then won this very instructive game.The author has some good chapters on the Yugoslav. He thinks 9 0-0-0 is the most dangerous move for White (I agree), and advises Black to avoid it (with 7 f3 Nc6 8 Qd2 Bd7). We also see Karpov's favorite, 9 g4. Black needs to defend very accurately here, but Martin gives some good advice on how to do so. Of course, if you take Martin's earlier advice and play 8...Bd7, you won't get into this position in the first place. Martin then has over 50 pages on 9 Bc4. His recommendation for Black is to try the \\"Chinese Dragon\\" (9 Bc4 Bd7 10 0-0-0 Rb8). The idea of this rook move is to support ...b5.After that, there is a chapter on the Classical Variation, with 6 Be2, and then an excellent one on 6 Bc4. Martin also gives some other tries for White at move 6, including 6 g3. There is also an entire chapter on 6 f4. This is the Levenfish, and it's what I play, both because I like it and because I do not like to put my Bishop on e3. While Black ought to be fine in this line, Martin shows that White's threat of e5 gives her some excellent practical chances, especially against the right opponent at the right time.Here is a game I played with White against the Dragon against a Candidate Master when I was a very weak player myself.1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 g6 6 f4 Nc6 7 Bb5 (as Martin says, this is Botvinnik's move) 7...Bd7 (this is all Martin gives for Black, but this line is trappy and I think he should have given more advice here) 8 Bxc6 bxc6 9 e5 dxe5 (9...Nd5 makes more sense) 10 fxe5 Nd5? (this move loses; 10...Ng4 is the right move, and Black should stand a little better after 11 e6 Bxe6) 11 Qf3 Bg7 12 Nxd5 cxd5 13 0-0 0-0 14 Qxd5 (White's attack has played itself so far. I didn't play the rest of the game all that well, but as you will see, I didn't need to.) 14...e6 15 Qe4 Rb8 16 b3 Qa5 17 Re1 Rfc8 18 Bg5 Qc5 19 Bf6 (trying to get rid of that Dragon Bishop) 19...Bc6 20 Qh4 Bf8 21 Kh1 Ba8 22 Qg4 (22 c4 is better.) 22...h5 23 Qf4 Qd5 24 Re2 Rc3 25 Rf1 Qb7 26 Rf3 Rbc8 27 Rxc3 Rxc3 28 Rf2 Qe4 29 Qxe4 Bxe4 30 Re2 Bf5?! 31 Nxf5 exf5? (now it's really over) 32 e6 Rc6 33 e7 Bxe7 34 Bxe7 Re6 35 Rxe6 fxe6 36 Bf6 Black ResignsI like this book, but let's just say I'd much rather have White than Black in the Dragon!"},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"This was a very good book covering all white responces to the dragon in good amounts. One criticism of this book was made by a reveiwer who said that it should cover the Accelerated Dragon. But, that is a different opening (and, if you'd like to study that, there is a different 'Starting Out Book on it). The book gives very honest opinions; unlike other dragon books I've read, it isn't trying to convince the reader to play the dragon, and so won't hesitate to say a certain line of the dragon is bad. This book doesn't give huge detail, but it's a 'starting out' book, so it's certainly enough. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"As an introduction to the Dragon with 2. ... d6 this book does very well, presenting material in the form of complete games with analysis. This is very important to us class level players so we can see what kind of middle game positions arise and how they are played.The book covers variations of the Yugoslav Attack quite nicely, giving ideas for both sides, again with full games to illustrate the principles. The Levenfish Attack is also covered sufficiently.So what's missing? While it might be asking too much, there is nothing at all on the Accelerated Dragon. Remember, this is a \\"Starting Out\\" book --- and at the class level starting out with the \\"normal\\" Dragon (with 2. ... d6) is anything but easy --- many teachers suggest the Accelerated Dragon as an option to avoid all the complex theory of the Yugoslav.I realize the book can only be a certain length. But it leaves out an important option. One star off for that, but the full four stars for the quality and understandability of the material presented."},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"This may be a good book for an class A or above player looking for the most recent research into sicilian dragon variations. It is not a good \\"starting out\\" book for a club level player who is looking for basic information on how to play the Sicilian Dragon well, like, as white, how do I think about the difference between pushing the g- and h-pawn first, and when I have the opportunity to take the dragon bishop with my queen/bishop battery, when is it worth doing so? Also, the average player, I'd guess, reading a first book on the sicilian needs to know not primarily if a variation is busted or sound on grandmaster level, but whether it has good winning chess among average players.Sometimes the \\"idea\\" behind a variation is explained, sometimes not really. For example, he is very excited about delaying castling with 8... Bd7 but doesn't explain well what black is waiting for or how black would know if the delay was successful.The pluses of this book are a lot of well-annotated top-level games to play through, and attention to the current state of research. The minuses are muddly writing, and, for average players, too much of a focus on chances at grandmaster level."},{"Title":"Starting Out:The Sicilian Dragon (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)","review":"A good book to begin your exporation toward Master play in the Sicilian Dragon.

The meticulous research is evident on each page as Stevenson surrounds her characters with authenticity.Balthasar Stuart is the son of the secret marriage of his father, Pelagius, an educated black man in Holland and Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, living there in exile. She is the sister of the deposed King of England who is later restored to the throne. Pelagius and Elizabeth fall in love and wed clandestinely, the only written record of the union saved by a family friend for their son. Balthasar receives the marriage certificate after the friend's death, along wih his father's diary and book on indigenous plants.Balthasar is in a difficult position in 1660's Holland, a practicing physician, but unable to avoid the issue of his race. While caring for patients, Balthasar makes the acquaintance of Aphra Behn, married into a local printing family, hoping to improve her prospects whenever possible. Aphra's self-serving curiosity settles on Balthasar and she seeks to befriend the secretive physician. However, Balthsar is warned to exercise caution around this woman, advice he heeds, unfortunately after the damage is done. Given the opportunity, Aphra steals Pelagiou's books, secreted under Balthsar's bed, substituting her own books. Aphra plays a pivotal role in the story, as she is the only possible witness to Balthasar's true parentage. Aphra becomes, in fact, his nemesis.Escaping the scourge of the plague in Holland, Balthasar flees to London, a city he finds unwelcoming and harsh to a man in his position. Once again race constricts his ability to establish a successful practice. However, his fortunes change for the better when he marries a young woman with a small dowry and some land bequeathed in Barbados. Sibella doesn't consider Balthasar's race a hindrance to the marriage, but that is because of her naivet&eacute;. When they go to Barbados to take possession of her property, it becomes immediately clear that Balthasar will never be accepted as part of the planter society. After a few years of struggles, the couple returns to London, relieved to be away from the heat and burdensome life of the tropics.Balthasar's most endearing quality, especially in Barbados, is his curiosity and his unwillingness to accept conditions on face value. While much of his behavior is conducted to fit withing the strictures of European society, Balthasar allows himself more freedom when among the slaves and various societal strata in Barbados. Still, he is a man of his times, a Christian who believes that all men will benefit from his religion. Even when dealing with slaves, Balthasar is haunted by his inclination to Christian ize them, although such instruction is forbidden, lest the slaves become emboldened and rise against their masters.Although Balthsar's years are spent performing his duties to humankind and raising his family's prospects, he makes a conscious choice to live a noble and purposeful life, if not one with the trappings of royalty. Balthasar accepts his own reality: he may be the son of a king and a queen, but he is a simple man of color in a structured society that refuses him a place of his own, with out the restraints of color. It sometimes appears that there is not enough cohesion in this second novel to warrant the third and I am unsure how well this tale stands on its own. Balthsar's standing as the son of a king and queen almost acts as a deterrent to the simple story of a mixed-race doctor in European society. Then Aphra's actions regarding her own knowledge add more possibilities, promising yet another layer of interest in this generational saga, more of the tale yet to unfold. I am certainly curious enough to want to read the final chapter of this unusual triliogy. Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"The Shadow King: A Novel","review":"After &#65533;The Winter Queen&#65533; this middle volume of a trilogy, set in 17th century Holland, London and Barbados, follows the life of earnest, principled Balthasar, son of Pelagius, an African king sold into slavery, and the exiled Queen of Bohemia, who were secretly married in the first book.A well-trained and conscientious doctor, who strives to live a noble, honest life, Balthasar feels inadequate because of his failure to live up to his father&#65533;s heroic expectations. But it&#65533;s all he can do to be a good doctor in a world where much of medicine is a mystery and his skin color raises suspicion. Then a woman &#65533; the writer Aphra Ben &#65533; makes off with his father&#65533;s papers and all proof of his heritage is gone.After the plague years in 1660s Holland, he decides to try his fortune in his mother&#65533;s land, but finds London &#65533; devastated by the Great Fire as well as plague &#65533; even more hostile to a black Dutchman. He marries an impoverished gentlewoman and they venture to Barbados where her father had property.But being a black man in a plantation slave culture is a rude awakening indeed, and after three years, a slave revolt and a hurricane, they&#65533;ve had enough and return to London.It&#65533;s a simple story, deriving its intimate tension by inner events &#65533; conflicts between Balthasar&#65533;s white and black heritage, his noble birth and his more ordinary aspirations, racism in its subtle as well as overt forms. The relationship between Balthasar and his wife, Sibella, is particularly complex, with its often-unstated racial and sexual tensions, accommodations and compromises. The Barbados section is the most dramatic; its emotions raw and violent. Every aspect of life is tainted with the tension, fear and hate between slave and master, and the white society&#65533;s total rejection of anything local or non-white, even effective medicines.The period detail is colorful and organic, from the political and religious turmoil of the time, to personal details of dress, food and accepted thought on a wide range of issues involving medicine, marriage, birth, slavery (in Barbados Balthasar owns slaves), and a man&#65533;s place in society. An impressive, involving and subtle novel."},{"Title":"Michael Moorcock's Stormbringer: Fantasy Roleplaying in the World of Elric","review":"This book is a complete RPG game published by Chaosium, detailing the world of Michael Moorcock's Elric saga. The players usually take the roles of human explorers in the Young Kingdoms, although other race information is provided. The Elemental Gods (so frequently invoked by Elric) are described and a system for magic spells is also given. The game was revised and republished under the title Elric! some years later, however many people I know consider Stormbringer a better work. Like other Chaosium-produced games (Ringworld, Elfquest, Runequest, and Call of Cthulhu) skills are done on a d100 system and stats usually range from 2d6 to 3d6+6, depending on racial packages. Thus, if you know one game, it is pretty easy to pick up another. Of course, there are some minor differences from system to system, so it is not a truly universal RP system. I did like this game and would recommend it to any Moorcock, Chaosium, or fantasy fan."},{"Title":"Michael Moorcock's Stormbringer: Fantasy Roleplaying in the World of Elric","review":"Well, the book came very quickly, and it is in excellent condition.

Illustrations are mostly black and white photographs but the birds are also depicted in fine colour plates drawn by the author, allowing him to bring to life extinct species such as the black mamo and scarlet kakawahie of Moloka'i.Pratt's career, as revealed in occasional autobiographical comments, renders him uniquely equipped for the task. As a child, he discovered the exotic honeycreepers by chance through a bird book. His 1979 PhD thesis focused on Hawaiian birds, and brilliant insights from it permeate the book: for example, based on the song of the tui of New Zealand, he hypothesises that the songs of the i'iwi and apapane still mimic those of long-extinct Hawaiian honeyeaters such as the o'o. Puzzling features such as the strange odour of some species and the tendency of young apanane to jump out of the nest when disturbed are interpreted as adaptive defenses against extinct predators (notably a harrier and a stilt owl).Pratt was privileged to be among the last to see, for example, the once ubiquitous o'u (a grainy photograph from 1975 appears in black and white here, and in colour in some of his other books) and record its song. Having lived through a crucial period of decline, he has already witnessed the extinction of numerous species, largely through habitat loss and mosquito-borne disease which leave the remaining honeycreepers confined to high-elevation forests. Despite glimmers of hope such as emerging resistance to malaria in the amakihi and apapane, the author wonders how many of the honeycreepers will outlive him. As a postscript, the po'uli, first discovered on Maui in 1973, became extinct following attempts to introduce the last three individuals to each other, and eventually to capture them for captive breeding. Perhaps the crimson apapane, featured on the cover along with the sacred 'ohi'a lehua tree, will live on as testament to the honeycreepers that once were."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Honeycreepers: Drepanidinae","review":"This is an wonderful reference for everyone with an interest in this amazing family of birds. The information is exhaustive and the color plates are lovely. My only disappointment are the photos in the text (of plants, landscapes, natural areas). They are in black and white and are of the most wretched quality. Really, for a book of this price to print such substandard photos is unacceptable. If those are the only photos the author had to offer, then he should get someone else to take his pictures. Really poor. Overall a good book in any case."},{"Title":"Faces at the Window","review":"I've been reading ghost stories for maybe 40 years or so, and have experienced a whole lot of paranormal phenomena personally. I don't think I'm that hard to please as a reader, either; if it's a good story, I'll probably enjoy it. And yes, some of the five stories were good. The \\"pick of the lot\\" so to speak was definitely the Bridgeport Poltergeist incident. Fascinating account, well documented.But here's the thing. First of all, the entire book comprises reprinted stories. There's nothing new! OK, if they were all great accounts, then it would be worth it, but at least in my opinion a couple of the accounts were very cursorily covered. The account of Connecticut's Village of Voices for example, didn't impress me at all as solid research. If the photos reprinted are as high quality as the originals I have to say that the \\"faces\\" and \\"dagger\\" Eno points out are dubious at best. Old stories, not many of them, and some are less than substantial. Here's the thing that really gets me, though. On top of everything else, the total page count is 100, and that's including what I feel to be \\"padding\\"; an index, a section on \\"disappearing ships of New England\\" (sorry, ships hit by rogue waves aren't ghosts, and even reading the author's review of the occurrences, only one of the disappearances even seemed that mysterious), and a two-page \\"glossary\\" containing a grand total of ten words. You get less than 78 pages of actual ghost stories!Not to be overly denigrating, but I have a very strong feeling I just bought something the author threw together from old research to get a little more publicity and another \\"book\\" under his belt. Seriously, there's a reason why larger publishers won't touch a manuscript under 80,000 words, and this has to be barely half that. I'm really not at all happy with this book, and I'd recommend you pass on this one.

Alex Delillo, of the L.A. police department homicide squad, is investigating the killing of an owner of a local Los Angeles florist. She and her partner arrive at the home of one of the florist shop's employees, to question him. However, the door is rigged with explosives. Alex's partner is hospitalized but is expected to recover.Just prior to the report of the murder, Alex's teenage daughter, Lacy, created a near riot at a beauty pagent when she removed two cyllinders from beneath her gown and informed the audience that they were poisonioning the planet just for a parade.Believing that the cyllinders contained poison, the crowd panicked. Alex and other police calmed the drown and Lacy admitted that the cyllinders only contained insecticide. Alex is furious and wonders how her daughter has changed so quickly from the daughter she knew six months ago, who was most comfortable in jeans and T-shirts.With Alex's partner injured, she begins working with Detective Dylon Harrison who was in the bomb squad. Maybe it's a needed quality to have in the unit he's in but Harrison has a calming influence on Alex, and, as we will later see, he also has this beneficial quality with victims.Soon after a body is found in a remote area and identification shows him to be a member of the Mexican army. Los Angeles officials speculate that he may have brought bomb making material to the area.Lacy goes missing and Alex and Harrison search the home of a part time employee at the florist. Here, they find a man strapped to a chair with bombs set to explode. Harrison disarms the bomb and the man admits that Lacy has been kidnapped by the man who set the explosives.All of the exciting action is described realistically and the author, Scott Frost, draws the reader into the investigation and we become deeply concerned with the killer's plan to set off the explosives and Lt. Dilillo's attempt to stop him and save her daughter.Readers will enjoy this thrilling book which was nominated for an Edgar Award.3 1/2 stars moved up to 4 based on sympathetic characters, dealing with environmental issues and parent teenage child relationships."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"A gripping, fantastic debut from the former X-Files and Twin Peaks script writer. This book is everything a suspense novel ought to be. The characters are wonderful, vivid, and realistic and the mystery is taut and suspenseful and leaves the reader with some serious moral questions at its conclusion. I give this one high, high praise and look forward to reading the author's next novel."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"This novel was nominated for the Edgar Award for Best First Mystery/Crime novel of 2005, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was somewhat disappointed with it.Los Angeles homicide detective Alex Delillo's daughter is kidnapped by a serial killer who likes to murder people with explosive devices. The novel basically deals with Delillo's race against time to save her daughter and catch the mad killer.This book is fast-paced and decently written, but at the expense of character development. In many ways, this book resembles a non-stop action movie. The characters literally run from one implausable action scene (often involving a ticking bomb and an explosion) to another. The book never slows down and allows us to get to know these people. Many of the characters therefore end up rather sketchy and bland.I also found the daughter character in this novel to be highly annoying, which is unfortunate since we are supposed to fear for her life. There are also many loose ends in RUN THE RISK that are not wrapped up in the ending.Overall, I give this book a very mild recommendation. I would only recommend this novel to people looking for a good action read."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"The main character is an emotional cripple, a crummy mom, a stupid cop, and physically unable to sit, stand, or lay down without the aid of some male underling's arms. Plot never really came together. Big disappointment."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"The reason I rate this book so low is because it started off okay, but then it became boring because the lead character is a wimpy idiot cop and the story started to just drag on and on. I don't know if the author became bored while writing and just decided to ramble on and on.The ending? Terrible and extremely disappointing.Thankfully I got the book at the library and didn't waste money on it."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"The author's first book is reasonably standard serial killer fare. Female lieutenant Delillo is having some problems with her daughter which deepen when she discovers that there is a link between her daughter, some recent murders and a serial killer that has plans for both daughter and mother....So we have a traditional race against time, as the cops investigate the links between a number of murders until the race becomes very personal...I think for these things to work you need engaging characters, clever plotting, the odd twist or two and a dash of style. This is okay but doesn't quite tick any of those boxes well enough, although overall the book is acceptable without having that missing wow factor. This may bode well for the next books in the series as the author develops confidence and becomes mor familiar with his characters.So, in summary, 'okay' but don't rush out for this one."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"I'll skip the book description, you can find it elsewhere. So, my reaction as a reader.I was caught up in the first few pages. The characters were people to me almost immediately, and remained so throughout the book. The mother-daughter tension was real (I don't have a daughter, but I am one.)I sometimes had a bit of trouble with the clues, the actions of the characters, especially in the middle of the book.But, when it came down to the last pages, I wanted to read every word, hoping that I could solve...I wished I was there to help.So...I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre...and I personally will look forward to the author's next book. Until that comes out, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"Scott Frost makes his formal novel debut with a scorchingly fascinating, roller coaster ride of a story set against the background of Pasadena, California during the time in which all eyes are on the sunny and elegant vestige of yesteryear - the New Year's Day Rose Parade. Frost understands the city and its environs and even for those of us who live here, he opens vistas with his word painting that bring into focus the 'city of perpetual New Year's Day sunlight' and makes that atmosphere add to the fine story of this first novel.Frost has established writing credentials: he has been a scriptwriter for \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Life Goes On\\". And perhaps that is why this particular novel feels so cinematic. Few writers can top his conversational tone, written in such distinctive voices that the out-of-quotes 'he said/she said' become obsolete. Every character in this book is so well defined that were they to pass us on the street we would gasp and think 'I know him'.Frost places the narration of RUN THE RISK in his main character Alex Delillo, a divorced/widowed mother of a teenage girl Lacy who just happens to be a Homicide detective on the Pasadena Police Force. Alex and Lacy are in the expected struggle that occurs between mother/daughter in the daughter's high school years. The tone of this story is set when Lacy, a Pasadena Rose Queen princess, jolts the proper Pasadenans by spraying pesticide on the crowd as her name is called in the crowning proceedings. This 'environmentalist' gesture sets into motion a series of incidents that begin with bombs and murders in the florist environs closely associated with the incipient Rose Parade. Lacy disappears and Alex begins her investigation of what becomes an intensive and razor-sharp search for a man thought to be a terrorist bomber bent on gaining world recognition by setting off a bomb on millions of television screens observing the famous Rose Parade. But Alex in tandem with a bomb expert Harrison slowly realize that they are not dealing with a terrorist but a serial killer. Lacy is being held hostage and the one person who can bring this all to a climax is Lacy's terrified but determined mother Alex!How all this weaves into a running series of shocking events, each surprising the reader with gory details and propelling the speed of page turning, is the structure of the novel. But in contrast to other writers of this genre, Frost has created a protagonist in Alex Delillo who holds not only our attention but our complete empathy, a character so real in her emotions that she quashes all previous perceptions of the hard woman cop.And as this weren't sufficient to place Frost in the prominent arena of fine thriller writers, he also generously displays his sensitive observations of a city and environs like few other writers. \\"Driving through the garment and jewelry districts of downtown L.A. is like stepping back into a fifty-year-old Kodachrome home movie of Mexico City. Garish colors of cheap clothes and custom jewelry spill out of storefront onto the sidewalks like a street festival. The sweet smells of corn tortillas and diesel fumes drift in the air. Salsa music competes with mariachi, which competes with sirens and street crime and broken dreams carried from dirt shacks south of the border. It's a place unknown to most inhabitants of the City of Angels, as distant from the gated homes of the Hollywood Hills as a Third World shantytown.\\"In the end Frost sets us up for a sequel but does so in a way that avoids our frustration that we are being milked, replacing that with an intense interest in just what more can Alex Delillo accomplish. This is a well-written, exciting, tense novel that suggests that Scott Frost will be an increasingly vital force in contemporary fiction. Grady Harp, February 2005"},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"PLEASE scroll up this page and purchase this book before you do ANYTHING else!! I am a voracious reader - primarily thrillers and psychological suspense - and this first book from Scott Frost is one of the BEST books I've EVER had the pleasure to read!!While I thrilled to the pacing, style, and content of the book, I also enjoyed the author's observations through the eyes of the book's heroine. Alex is a female cop - the Chief of Homicide - in a modern (still male-driven) Police force in So. California - Pasadina. She is also a mother of a teenager (and I'll leave it to you who also have been parents of teenagers to imagine WHICH job gives her the most problems). From the opening series of events, to the closing phrase, you, the reader, are asked to join in the team's efforts to \\"Run the Risk\\"!!! AND, YOU DO, willingly.Run the Risk, as I take it from the book, is the term used by fire investigators when they have done all that they can in a situation, given the circumstances, their FULL professional expertise and experience, and are left with the time-sensitive need to make a decision: cut A wire; cut THE wire; cut the WIRES; cut the RED wire; cut the BLUE wire; but, still, DO SOMETHING or the bomb will go off!!I found this parable to ring true for most of all that we do in the world today, given the speed of events we are faced with, and the consequences of our decisions. AND, the need we have to ACTUALLY LIVE with the results of that decision!!I LOVED THIS BOOK!! As an \\"expert\\" in \\"serial killers\\", I found this one a new and truly horrifying one - even worse than Hannible Lecter!!!I am running to obtain the next in this series.

Kept my interest and had a different twist from the run-of-the-mill thriller. Can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"Run the Risk is the best mystery/adventure novel I've read. It was fine for the first two pages, captured my attention on page 3, then utterly engulfed my consciousness. Its pace was brisk by mystery standards, and it kept accelerating all the way to the end.As a mystery, the plot has twists and turns to challenge the best minds to sort out at every particular moment what has already happened and what is about to happen. Mysteries traditionally focus on a buildup to \\"whodunnit\\", and there's definitely some of that in Run the Risk. However, it really shines in its portrayal of mind games, sorting out some VERY unconventional situations about what, how, and why. Most of the book is an ongoing mental duel pitting the detectives against a masterful criminal mind.In some ways the feel is a bit like the best of season 1 of Twin Peaks. That might not be surprising given Scott Frost's earlier work on Twin Peaks... whether Twin Peaks influenced Frost or Frost influenced Twin Peaks would be an interesting question to explore. I suspect that the influence was mutual."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"This book is certainly exciting, and certainly well-written.Most of the characters are believable and even engaging.The pacing is (by and large) superb.But it's got some terrible, terrible flaws.First, and worst, it's about a serial killer.This is the hoariest of cliches, on a par with an Evil Twin or \\"It was all only a dream!!!!\\"Clearly, a licensing board should be set up to charge authors a penalty-fee every time they use this immensely tired plot device.Second--related to the first--the plot (though rapid) is just one damn thing after another. It's as though the author hadn't really thought things out to the end before writing. There is an abrupt and pointless shift from Chasing a Terrorist (a cliche, but not half as bad) to Chasing a Serial Killer (yawn).Third--related to the first two--there are lots of loose ends. The romance sputters and stalls. The mother-daughter conflict sputters and stalls. The police turf-conflict (another cliche) sputters and stalls. The serial killer never really develops or (and this is worse) becomes scary.All of this is too bad, because Frost is a good writer.His second book, Never Fear, is miles better."},{"Title":"Run the Risk","review":"Just a note to correct an error.

Icannot help but feel total DISGUST for the writer who has somereal skill and accomplishments (does NOT need to do this). He does NOT help society look at the pros and cons of torture (?46%of us think \\"some\\" torture is OK!!!????) but encourages us to getsome kind of vicarious feeling from the long drawn-out descriptions--feels really \\"sicko\\" to me.

His careful scholarship is matched and energized through his personal engagement with the Biblical message, which demands more than a quick scan; panning through this book is a disservice to the author, and a loss to the reader. The work is one-third education, one-third explication, and one-third meditation.Dr. Moore explores the story of Biblical leaders under various forms of pressure - what was their situation, what was their response? With his own strong insight, and inimicable sense of humor, Dr. Moore draws from a rich background of ministry experience to relate the text \`backward and forward,' to its historical past and to our postmodern present. Faith Under Pressure powerfully countermands the tendency of scholasticism to withdraw from a pastoral care approach.The reader's understanding of the Bible story will be richly enhanced, and they will be directly challenged by Dr. Moore's reflections. This is not a book for beginners. The author assumes that readers will study the Biblical texts for themselves as they engage with his work, and an intentional reader will take the time to struggle with both writings. Faith Under Pressure is a \`must have' for serious students of the Bible. It is also a gift for ministers of a broad range of callings: preachers will find refreshment here; teachers will discover new insights; counselors will experience clarity.Do not expect to finish this book quickly - do expect to return to it. Do expect that the time you invest in reading it will pay off in your own professional and personal growth."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"To look at OT kings, would-be kings, queens, priests, and prophets through Dr. Moore's eyes is to see them as real people, people mired in a system of political succession guaranteed to spawn tragedy after tragedy, people who theoretically follow Yahweh, but who often compromise their faith for political expediency. In 1 and 2 Kings, Israel is surrounded by powerful enemies, and one of the goals of the book is to explore at length why the kings of Israel and Judah make such seemingly unwise alliances with them. It explores the historical and cultural contexts in which these decisions are made, and, by scrutinizing these characters carefully, suggests several new ways of understanding the motivations for their actions. Combining a broad presentation of history with plenty of contemporary application, this is an excellent study for all serious students of Old Testament history."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"A unique contribution by an Old Testament scholar with a pastor's heartwho sincerely believes that the stories in Kings need to be studied aswell as preached because of their contemporary relevance. Readers will appreciate Moore's creative exegesis of the text and the practicalapplication for people living out their faith under pressure. Anextremely valuable book for scholar, pastor and layperson."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"Most books on biblical spirituality usually direct their readers to Proverbs or Psalms. Most of these books are written by pastors whose reflections are driven by their experience of caring for others. Most are directed to the powerless. Faith Under Pressure is a different kind of guide to the spiritual life. Moore takes his readers to the red meat of the Bible: 1-2 Kings. His interpretations are those of a scholar, based on the best solid, and current, biblical scholarship. His audience is decision makers. He wants Christians with responsibility to find in 1-2 Kings practical support for persevering both in ministry and in the marketplace. Faith Under Pressure is an informed, and an inspiring read."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"&quot;In Faith Under Pressure, Michael Moore shows that ancient stories cometo life and address some of the major issues of our day. Moore employsthe best of contemporary Old Testament scholarship to address thepressures that face Christian leaders today. These historical narrativesprovide insight for the issues that continually confront us.&quot;"},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"How refreshing! Here's an exegetical treatment marked by solid researchand careful thought on the one hand, and by readability and relevance onthe other--a rare combination. Mike Moore's creative approach to thetext of 1-2 Kings, with its close attention to the implications of narrativestructure and to inter-(and intra-) textuality, identifies themes whichspeak as stunningly to the contemporary context as they did to theancient. His down-to-earth discussion, with its frequent &quot;return&quot; to theworld we live in, arises from a well-documented and well-informedanalysis of the life and times of the Israelite monarchy and of theskillfully spun stories preserved in these two biblical documents.Reading this book, scholars will find much to be instructed by andpastors will be re-inspired to preach the Old Testament. This is one ofthe few books that successfully span the unfortunate gaps betweenacademy and pulpit and pew."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"\\"When students begin biblical study, they are understandably inclined to reckon that the Books of Kings are among the most boring parts of the Old Testament. It is important that these events happened, but they have nothing to say to us. In this book Dr Moore demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth. With lots of appeal to intertextuality and intratextuality and other approaches to interpretation, he shows that these books represent a series of takes on a number of issues that continue to be of vital importance - matters such as justice, famine, family problems, violence, and international relations. They have lots to say to us\\" (review received from Dr. John Goldingay)."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"\\"Faith Under Pressure\\" is a rare combination of scholarly academics and practical advice to those in leadership. Whether you lead in business or ministry, grade school or a university, the lessons gleaned from the Books of 1 & 2 Kings by Dr. Moore will give you new insight on what it means to lead, and how to be faithful under pressure. You don't need a Masters degree to understand this book, but if you have one, you will not be bored. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"I was very impressed with the book. I found many parts of it to be very profound, especially the depth of insight Moore has for the characters in the Old Testament. Moore's ability to understand the human person is outstanding. The way he explains them is similar to how someone would explain a friend or an aquaintance. He can read 1 and 2 Kings and see the heart of each leader in the two books. I also like how Moore includes the theological significance for each story in Kings. This makes Kings very interesting to read, as we see contemporary application for each chapter of the books. Moore includes discussion of important Hebrew concepts, which is important when studying Scripture. Although Moore's book contains high level Biblical scholarship, it is written in a way that the lay level person could understand it as well. The book could be read by both scholars and lay level readers. I think Moore is anointed by the Lord to reveal important truths of part of the inspired word of God, the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"How can events from the Hebrew Bible possibly have any relevance today with all the education and technology of the 21st century? Dr. Moore's book demonstrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same! Faith is easy when things are going well, but it is only under pressure that faith is grown. The challenges remain the same today as in the time of the kings of Israel. Does one remain faithful even in the midst of injustice? Is it more difficult to keep the faith when things are too good? Faith unchallenged by the pressures of life, the same kind of pressures now as then, may get flabby and flat. It is only under the pressures of life that faith is challenged to grow, and with each challenge is the reward of a higher level, a greater faith. Dr. Moore has made the study of the Old Testament come alive as he shows parallels to the issues and temptations of our current culture. Great reading and even better to discuss with others!"},{"Title":"Faith Under Pressure: A Study of Biblical Leaders in Conflict","review":"Moore's treatment of the Davidic period is like I've never seen. A superb academic, he walks us through the Kings and Chronicles, interweaving the particular treatment of each historian. He makes sense of each as, &quot;Kings focuses on the Mosaic coveneant while Chronicles focuses on the Davidic covenant.&quot; Like seeing the horizon through binoculars, Moore lines up each sight so as to bring the two into focus.For the more precise reader, Moore does his scholarship well. For a preaching pastor wanting help on the text for application, Moore understands. As a scholar/pastor the tensions of leadership he plays out for us to use in the delivery of the message.A great addition to Old Testament understanding of the Davidic period and a rich resource for those of us who week by week are charged with presenting the congregation with a witness of the Word."},{"Title":"What Is Emmaus?

However, this book has done a wonderful job of offering simplified summaries for use in Bible study and for discussion of world religions and how Christians can witness to them. As a Lutheran pastor, I have used this book many times for Bible studies from 8th graders through adults. It gives an easy overview of the history, central teachings, significant people, other teachings, contemporary encounters, and a Christian connection to each of th 12 belief systems covered. Written from a Lutheran perspective, these Bible studies are nonetheless, accurate and helpful for Christians from any denomination. Twelve faiths are covered including: Judaism, Islam, Mormanism, Buddhism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Scientology."},{"Title":"One God, Many Gods: Bible Studies for Postmodern Times","review":"I've used it for years with youth (7th-12th grades) and adults. It not only explains what each system teaches, but how they differ from Christianity and what verses you can use to share the salvation message with them. Helps you to understand AND share.

I can't wait, and hope that it is not the last to feature Annabel and Cody, or Grace and Dawn. The characters are easy to like and care about, and you find yourself unable to put the book down, until you find out how everything ends. Jennifer, can we beg you to write another!?"},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"Characters Cody and Annabelle from the first Moon Island book 'Passion Bay' are back, but play minor roles in a wonderful new story from Jennifer Fulton. In this book, American Grace Ramsey (a former lover of Annabelle and player of the field) is doing covert research about Moon Island for her company. This company is desperate to buy the land and will stop at nothing to make that happen. Also on the island is homophobic and seemingly-straight Australian Dawn Beaumont. Dawn is taking a respite from her world that was shattered when she caused a tragic auto accident.Thirty-something Grace wagers with herself about getting Dawn into bed quickly. Dawn, 22, wrestles with new and confusing feelings. They both do a lot of growing up.Fulton mixes romance in with a little drama and mystery. The reader can't help but fall for the charismatic characters, and feel their pain and confusion. This reader even yelled at the book (\\"kiss the girl, already\\") much like some movie-goers in tense scenes.Highly recommended for an enjoyable summer evening at home on the deck with pina coladas and pretzels."},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the Moon Island series so much that I was ready for this one to be a letdown. Instead it was wonderful. It tells the story of Dawn, a young swimming star whose Olympic hopes and dreams are dashed in a tragic road accident that she caused. Readers of Passion Bay will remember Dawn as the immature, pain in the ass guest who made Cody crazy during the big hurricane. She is on the island taking stock of her life and growing up. She soon meets one of the best characters I've read in a lesbian romance - the sexy and seductive scientist Grace Ramsay. Grace is a player who decides to seduce Dawn, who's only just coming out. Grace is also up to no good, scoping out the island to be turned into a toxic chemicals dump by big business. She is in for a shock when her feelings get involved and she has to confront a secret locked inside herself. There's a lot more to the story than that, but I don't want to spoil it for you.I could not put this book down. It is a very rewarding love story with plenty of adventure and some larger than life minor characters thrown in. I love this author's dry sense of humor and her sharp writing. As for the love scenes, wow. I can hardly wait for the next romance in this series. Keep'em coming Ms. Fulton!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"This is the best book from Jennifer Fulton's 4 part Moon Island series. This book is about and older woman who is very cynical about relationships and loves to sleep around. She meets a young woman who was an Olympic swimmer who is trying to recover from a life-threatening accident. The younger woman is sexually attracted to the older woman but has been raised to be homophobic and tries to fight her growing sexual and emotional attraction to the other woman. The sexual tension in this book is the best thing about it. I also liked this book the best out of the four book in the series because Ms. Fulton spent a lot of time developing the two main characters, unlike her last two books (books 3 and 4 in he Moon Island series.) All the books are entertaining but I found this book the most compelling, romantic and sexy."},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"This book is easy to read and flows well. It proficiently picks up right where Passion Bay left off. I'm anxiously awaiting the next one(s)!!"},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"Another great book in the Moon Island series. Jennifer Fulton writes books you can't put down until you reach the end. Can't wait to see what is in store next for Cody and Annabel."},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"Enjoyed the story... have read the Moon Series and each gets better. Recommend as light reading for those who like romance with a little mystery."},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"This second book of the Moon Island series finds us back with Cody and Annabel. Even though they have a minor subplot in this book, their island brings together woman. It gives the dwellers of the island insight into what really needs to be done in their world/lives. And never leaves a woman dreaming."},{"Title":"Saving Grace -","review":"This is the second in the Moon Island series and features a full cast of characters including geologist Grace Ramsay, a predator who is working for a toxic waste company that wants to turn Moon Island in to a toxic waste dumping ground. Returning from Book I is spoiled, whining, immature twenty-two-year-old Dawn Beaumont, an Olympic hopeful who was seriously injured in a car accident in the intervening years between Book I and this outing. And, as always, a major character is Moon Island itself.Grace is one of those characters you love to hate - she's sexy, intelligent, and a sexual predator who has a secret. Dawn is a character you start out disliking because, as in Book I, all she does is whine (although at least she has good reason to be self-absorbed and miserable in this book). As the author develops the story, you find yourself a bit surprised to be liking both characters more than you thought you would.This is another interesting entry in a projected series revolving around Moon Island and its inhabitants - both permanent and temporary. If you haven't read the first book in this series, Passion Bay, start there. You'll meet and fall for the island's owner, Annabel, and the unexpected love of her life, Cody."},{"Title":"The ape in our house","review":"Cathy Hayes writes in the Introduction to this 1951 book, \\"In the beginning my husband Keith and I were curious about chimpanzees. We wondered, for instance, why apes do not speak, and whether they could be taught to do so by special methods and great effort. Besides language, what distinguishes their behavior from that of people, we wondered? ... To get to the basic problem: how inteligent are apes, in comparison with man?\\"Accordingly, research psychologist Keith Hayes and his wife Cathy took home from the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology a two-day old chimp they called \\"Viki,\\" intending to raise her as if she were simply a child of their own. (Hayes admits early in the book that toilet training was \\"the one area in her education in which we have been eminently unsuccessful.\\")Their attempts to encourage their \\"child\\" to speak were also unsuccessful: \\"we realized that Viki would not learn to speak by herself. She would have to be taught by the same methods used when children for one reason or another do not learn to speak naturally. We would literally have to put words into her mouth by shaping her lips and tongue with our fingers to form the various syllables.\\" She adds, \\"we realized an astonishing fact. Before our coaching Viki had been completely unable to make any sound at all on purpose. She made chimp noises, yes, but these were beyond her control. They were merely reflex expressions of her feelings.... She had lacked the motor skill of vocalization.\\"Ultimately, Viki learned to speak only four words: mama, papa, up, and cup. Hayes concludes, \\"Since apes do not acquire language to any significant extent---not even priviliged apes like Viki, who are coached intensively on it, and who could profit a great deal by it---it seems unlikely that apes ever have or every will develop a civilization.\\"This book was written far before the chimpanzee/American Sign Language experiments of the 1970s, of course. (See books likeSilent Partners: The Legacy of the Ape Language Experiments;NEXT OF KIN: WHAT MY CONVERSATIONS WITH CHIMPANZEES HAVE TAUGHT ME ABOUT INTELLIGENCE, COMPASSION AND BEING HUMAN;Lucy: Growing Up Human : A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family;Nim, A Chimpanzee who Learned Sign Language.)For similar \\"raising an ape in a human family\\" experiments, seeToto and I: A gorilla in the family,The ape and the child;: A study of environmental influence upon early behavior,andLucy - Growing Up Human: Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family."},{"Title":"Profiles, Probabilities, and Stereotypes","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to the concept and application of profiling based on generalizations. The phrase that the author uses repeatedly throughout the book is &quot;nonspurious nonuniversal generalization.&quot; Nonspurious = statistically significant, nonuniveral = not applying to everyone in a group, generalization = self-explanatory. The author uses dog attacks to illustrate this concept. Take the assertion, &quot;Pitbulls are dangerous.&quot; Although a small percentage of pitbulls are responsible for attacks on humans (nonuniversal), this percentage is statistically much greater (nonspurious) than for other dogs. Knowing this factual information, are we justified in labeling pitbulls &quot;dangerous.&quot; These are the kinds of issues that the author discusses in his book. The topics he covers range from the fairness of forced retirement of pilots at age sixty, the debate over a judge's power over sentencing, and of course, racial profiling. The author does an outstanding job for the most part in discussing these issues and proving his point, but I thought he did not defend his views on racial profiling with respect to airport security very well. I don't think he accurately assessed the potential cost to society in arguing against the inclusion of &quot;Middleeasterness&quot; as part of a larger profile. In other words, are we willing to forgo including &quot;Middleeasterness&quot; as part of a larger profile thereby increasing the potential of not identifying a terrorist? The author's discussion of this point is lengthy, but in summary, he opposes this particular kind of profiling in airports, but I don't think his argument was completely justified (and this is coming from me who was stopped repeatedly after 9/11 because of my Middle Eastern appearance). All in all, this is a great book, and it will certainly get you thinking about some of the most important issues facing the US today."},{"Title":"Profiles, Probabilities, and Stereotypes","review":"In parables and aphorisms the author likes to speak. Its title notwithstanding, this book is not an empirical study of statistical probabilities, profiling, or stereotyping. It is a philosophical defense of the use of generalities, painting with broad strokes so to speak, in daily intercourse and social constructs. The defense is of nonspurious, nonuniversal generalizations in lofty, and some not so lofty, decisions all of us make and employ in survival as individuals, as a species, and as a society. But, to appropriate from George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; some generalities are more equal than others. Some generalizations are more pernicious than others; so while quite salient, still they must be considered to be exceptions to the general rule that generalizations are socially acceptable, legal, and indeed, just. These exceptions, of course, are race and gender. First the author builds a strong case justifying the use especially of race/ethnicity in generalizing for purposes of distinguishing airline passengers exhibiting terroristic characteristics from those who do not. Examples include the now hackneyed young, middle eastern male, paying cash for his (and everyone else's) one way ticket to Nirvana. But then, possibly as an implicit (certainly in no way explicit) concession to the politically correct faction of society, the author proceeds to tear down his own argument in favor of using race/ethnicity in this particular case to avoid a repeat of the tragedy of 9/11, in favor of eschewing race/ethnicity, because we can just vet everybody at the airport; the only inconvenience being that everybody must arrive 30 minutes earlier. Excuse me! This is a WAR, not a few pounds of pot, we are talking about - a jihad declared not by Western civilization, but on Western civilization, precisely by a specific group of deviants whose race/ethnicity even the author concedes is highly salient to their early identification for purposes of avoiding another 9/11. To employ another aphorism the author blithely ignores -&quot;all's fair in love and war.&quot; Why then should we, whose very existence our enemy is trying to obliterate, afford the enemy the aid and comfort of turning a blind eye to their common origins, when declining to do so would save our own hides? To borrow another aphorism I recently read, &quot;the Constitution is not a mutual suicide pact.&quot; To blazes with our inconvenience and the enemy's rights; if generalizations are just, as according to the author they are, and if ethnicity is a salient generalization in the case of the profile of middle eastern terrorists, as the author so concedes, let those who meet the profile of the enemy suffer the indignity and inconvenience of being pulled from the passenger line. The author, it must be remembered, is the one who rails in favor of generalization in derrogation of &quot;individuation.&quot; So let it be. To coin a final aphorism, &quot;What's good for the goose is good for the gander.&quot;"},{"Title":"Children of the northlights","review":"Look at those illustrations! They are wonderful, in every way. The content of this book is all about the Sami people of northern Europe. It's a sweet story of a sister and a brother (Lasse & Lise). We follow the two throughout the seasons; first with their nomadic family, then off to school for a portion of the year with many other children and finally reunited with their family. The d'Aulaire's visited Norway in the early 1930's to research this book. I learned SO much about this culture (for that time period). Actually, after reading, it occurred to me that though I have learned about the culture and history of the people who live/lived in the northern most reaches of North America I know little to nothing about the people who have historically inhabited the northern reaches of the rest of the world.

At one point in their history, Sami children were forcibly taken from their families and sent to school where they were punished if they spoke their native language or practiced their beliefs. The book refers to children being hunted down and tied to sleds because they were afraid to go to school.

Shortly after leaving the service, Martin's wife dies from cancer. Martin raises their twelve-year-old daughter by himself even as he serves as Chief of police of Warrenton, Virginia. Occasionally, he performs investigative services for the Air Force, working as a liaison between civilian authorities and the military police.His current case centers on the professional murder of Colonel Margaret Wildman and her two children. Martin soon concludes that the children were murdered to get their mother to talk. Her refusal led to their death, her torture, and ultimately her death too. It appears as if the killers obtained what they sought. On the contrary, the victim worked in the Air Force Safety Office with no access to top-secret information, making the scenario painted by the physical evidence seems unreasonable. This leaves Martin and the other investigators shaking their heads as nothing makes sense.Patrick A. Davis has written an action packed thriller that will keep readers' interest until the final page is turned. THE COLONEL is a terrific novel because besides being well written the events appear plausible, which adds to airplane passengers playing Russian Roulette every time they fly. Martin is a wonderful person who gains reader empathy early and never loses it as his actions turn him into a real American hero. Mr. Davis is deservedly making quite a name for himself within the thriller genre.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Colonel","review":"I read this book and one of the author's other books, &quot;The Passenger.&quot; Davis writes well and obviously intimately knows the kinds of characters, places, scenes, etc, that background his novel. Perhaps it is me and not Davis who is at fault for not awarding this book five stars, but I feel it is missing something. You are whisked along, helter-skelter, through a plot with the requisite twists, turns, and roller coaster plunges... but I want more. I want it to MEAN something. This book is solid entertainment, so maybe I am wrong to want it to snare me at gut level as well as taking me for a damn good carnival ride."},{"Title":"The Colonel","review":"Martin Collins, a retired Air Force investigator who is currently the police chief of Warrentown, a small town in Virginia, is on occasion called upon by the military to help in criminal investigations.

Lieutenent Simon Santos, chief homicide investigator of the Arlington County PD, who requested Collins, is working it from the civilian side. As Collins and Simon work together, they find that the government and the military seem to be covering up a defect in a popular aircraft.Character development and a steady pace with many twists and turns makes this a good read. Secret files, misleading clues and many suspicious characters, will keep you guessing.

Colonel Wildman was a military investigator who had discovered a cover-up involving safety certifications on the G-626, one of the most popular civilian aircrafts flying today. The evidence she had accumulated would have crippled a proposed merger between Boeing and Global, the manufacturer of the G-626.The detective assigned to the case is Simon Santos with a mystery past and a lot of money of his own. His own personal wealth and philosophy enable him to cut a few corners in his investigations. He brings in Martin Collins (Marty) who is a retired Air Force investigator who consults on military related homicides. Martin is still recovering from the death of his wife and trying to cope with a young teenage daughter. He sees the law, the crimes, the cover ups and the investigations in black and white and supposes that they will solve the mystery, expose the coverups and right all the wrongs.The character development adds to the suspense which builds and continues to the final pages of the book. If there is a flaw, it's that there are too many characters to follow. Altogether a good read, however."},{"Title":"The Colonel","review":"I started this book with great trepidation. Any book with the title 'The Colonel' had to be lacking in some department or another. At least thats how my thinking went until I became engrossed in these pages. The plot surrounds the brutal murder of an investigator of air force planes. Her job was to look into air-craft and see if they were sound. As the story progresses, we learn more and more about this situation and it really is both at the same time compelling as far as pushing the story along and ever more outlandish as far as conspiracy wise. I think that this aspect of the story both intrigued me and caused for my review to get notched down to just four stars.The main character is Marty, an investigator who works as a consultant on military homicides. We follow him as he interrogates an ever more elaborate set of characters. You are never sure just who is in the wrong here or where the story is going. A couple of characters that help Marty along are also important. One is Simon Santos who is a character that mightily reminds me of the slick genius from Douglas Preston and Licoln Child's series of books. Simon knows everything, is wealthy, and a mysterious character to say the least. Also, Patrick Davis gives us an assistant to Marty, a young officer who prides herself in her ability and prowess.All in all, this is a very fun book if just to see where it might be leading. Its worth reading."},{"Title":"The Colonel","review":"I enjoyed this book. The characters were likable and well drawn out, the story very interesting.

The grandmas are a trip and they take the reader on a trip through the beautiful desert Southwest as they track a convicted felon to a shopping mall in El Paso. Twila is a conscientious librarian but her housemate, Maudie Mae, doesn't care whether she's politically correct or not -- she tells it like she sees it. This book will make you laugh out loud. Here's the beginning of chapter one:\\"Twila Dewberry had just plumped up the couch pillows, slipped off her loafers, and settled down for a good read when Maudie Mae pranced into the living room in her butterscotch ostrich leather boots. Twila marked the passage she had been reading with her finger.\\"I'm off to the Pine Knot to teach a couple of those old farts how to two-step,\\" Maudie Mae said as she threaded a leather hand-tooled belt through the loops on her jeans. The belt was embellished with embroidered insets in a Navajo design, alternating with rows of small white bones attached with braided strips of leather. The first time Twila had seen the distinctive belt, she had admired the design. Maudie Mae had rubbed her fingers over the smooth little bones and nodded solemnly. \\"These are my ex-husband's teeth,\\" she said, pausing to wait for her words to sink in, then shrieking delightedly at Twila's consternation.Since then, Twila had seen Maudie pull the same trick on several other unsuspecting people. Even when Maudie tried the line on somebody who had already heard the joke and beat her to the punch line, it didn't diminish her delight.

Equipment needed is 1) low-weight dumbbells, 2) ankle weights, and 3) step or weight bench (but I use one of those large exercise balls as my bench, with shoulders on the ball and core muscles used to keep trunk of body in straight, bench-like position). This may seem like a lot to get started, but an efficient, effective program can be built from this foundation. The exercises work every muscle group, the instructions are very easy to follow, and the suggested form protects the back (with many exercise programs, the muscles get nice and strong, but the back gets injured)."},{"Title":"Workouts For Women: Circuit Shaping","review":"Each of the circuits are pictured in condensed form on one page, then in detailed form on following pages for easy access.

As such, I have a basic understanding of kinematics, but approached this book with little knowledge of physics as specifically applied to vehicles.I found this book to be a perfect first step into the field. It picked up essentially where my knowledge left off and provided solid coverage of the topics discussed. Due to the nature of the book--an introductory text--simplifications often had to be made; in these cases the simplifications were pointed out, often with references to publications covering the areas more fully. Furthermore, I felt that all topics were evenly covered--no one got undue attention.Basically, the book was just what I was looking for.My only significant pet peeves are the use of English-system measurements (I am more comfortable with metric), and a few cases of unexplained 'magic numbers' in formulas (it took me a minute to realize that 57.3 is the number of degrees in a radian). And plot and character development were pretty thin (grin)."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics (R114)","review":"This book provides a thorough yet easy to understand overview of vehicle dynamics and how they affect performance. The mathematical basis for all concepts are provided, as are graphs , illustrations, sample problems, and solutions. I highly recommend this text for anyone interested in vehicle dynamics"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics (R114)","review":"I first have to say I am surprised that I am the only one to give this book such a poor rating. From a \\"reading for leisure\\" standpoint, this book explains the basic concepts of vehicle dynamics pretty well; however, as a engineering book (from SAE no less), this is probably one of the worst books I have ever purchased in my entire educational and professional career.As one of the reviews mentioned, the \\"unexplained 'magic numbers' in formulas\\" take time to get used to. I am not one to just accept formulas as is. As a graduate student, I like to know some thought behind the formulas I am using. In addition to the 'magic numbers', the author poorly explains many formulas. As an example, the author does not explain whether the sprung weight or total weight should be used when determining steady-state cornering. In all the formulas, the total weight is used; however, when determining changes due to body roll, only the sprung weight should be taking into account. Since unsprung weight only accounts for 5% of the total weight, maybe the author decided that was \\"close enough\\"; however, he should explain his reasoning in his assumptions. The author does this throughout the book.This brings me to my next point: poor examples and very few examples. The review from the individual who said this book had great examples must have been a review for another book. I can count on one hand the number of examples in this entire book. The few examples that are used are grossly over-simplified and very poor in explaining the steps involved in finding a solution.Additionally, the author rambles on too much. His wordy explainations could easily be condensed into fewer pages. As an engineer, I like conceptual explainations, but I don't like wasting my time either. One particular example that comes to mind is a formula written in paragraph form. Instead of just typing out the formula, the author takes a paragraph to write out the formula. After taking about 30 minutes of reading the paragraph and trying to find out the meaning of it (along with 2 other graduate students), I finally gave up."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics (R114)","review":"Thomas Gillespie is able to explain the fundamental principles of vehicle dynamics in his book. For those new to the subject of vehicle dynamics, this work will lay the foundation for more advanced reading. Those with science, math and engineering degrees, or those familiar with technical literature, will find the reading easy to understand in comparison to some other works. This allows the reader to focus their attention on understanding the \\"big picture,\\" and not getting lost in particular formulae. However, for those doing research in the field or pursuing this as a career, there are more advanced texts available."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics (R114)","review":"Professor Gillispie did an outstanding job with this book.

The author is good at explaining topics and the examples have real world implications.However, there are nowhere near enough examples in this book, nor are there any problem sets for practice.

It now uses the Bedford Handbook. I found Rules for Writers to be very full and useful for every aspect of teaching, not only grammar and punctuation, but for composition and research writing as well. It tends to have fairly exhaustive explanations of most points of grammar. It has an especially good section on ESOL problems. All in all, it is a practical useful book that I keep on my writing desk for my own use, even though it is no longer used in our classes.I was usually able to teach my courses without using any other text other than this book and the required reader. Before we had Rules and currently with the Bedford Handbook (also by Daina Hacker), I had to rely on handouts taken from the internet to emphasize areas like MLA documentation and developing cohesion in paragraphs and essays or to provide remedial materials for students with problems. With Rules for Writers, and also with the Little, Brown Handbook, another good handbook, I found better supplementary materials right in the book than anything I found on the Net.The biggest problem with Rules for Writers is its spiral bound soft cover format. This book does not hold up. Pages fall out, the cover falls off, and the book gets banged up. I would have to replace it every semester, if only not to be embarassed by the wrecked appearance my copy would have when it was time to display the textbook on the first day of class!Now as a professor who gets free textbooks, that is not a big problem. However, for students who are simply robbed blind paying for text books and may be required to use a handbook like this in a series of classes--and should always keep a handbook like this for reference in and out of school--having a book that falls apart and constantly needs replacing can be financial murder.Still, I prefer this book to the Bedford Handbook. The Bedford Handbook is handbook in name only and does not have as many features or as deep coverage as books like Rules for Writers or the Little, Brown Handbook. It is a kind of dumbing down of the information here. Visually the Bedford Handbook is better as a visual object and has nice illustrations, charts and pictures. It is also well integrated with Diana Hacker's maze of web sites. However, if any professor is trying to decide between the Bedford and Rules for Writers, get Rules for Writers."},{"Title":"Rules for Writers 5e & i-claim","review":"When I was a freshman in college (circa 1979), the official reference book for my honors English Comp class was \\"Rules for Writers, 2nd ed.\\" And I still have that book on my bookshelf.

But by the time Bjorn Guthrie has taken your watch he has transformed it as dramtically as a &quot;main spring&quot; to &quot;quartz movement&quot;. The assimilation and integration of knowledge in this book is priceless. There should be four C's in a discussion: courtesy, cooperation, coordination and clash. Without the clash you only have conversation. Guthrie brings the clash with a capital &quot;C&quot;. This book had me talking aloud, challenging my own mind sets. This book will make you think and stretch your thinking. None of us have arrived in understanding where digitization and e-business will take us and Guthire helps confirm the humbling we all need to take this next decade very seriously. Discretionary time is so precious so spend it on this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Tomorrow We are Driving Computers Which Look Like Cars","review":"This is one of the most refreshing business books that I have read in a long time. It breaks from the formulaic approach of many of today's business books, in just about everyway. The book does not try to coin a new acronym or create a business fad, it inspires you to break free of your assumptions and think in new ways about the products and services that you are creating.While aimed at the auto industry, any firm in any industry would find it useful to think in new ways about what is possible. The distinction between digital invention versus digital conversion is particularly powerful as firms contemplate how to cope in the Internet age. I have been thinking about how this distinction applies in my business, and what digital invention would look like.Moreover, this book is fun to read. You find yourself alternating between intellectual stimulation, laughter and appreciation for Guthrie's courage to write what he clearly believes is the truth.The insight, passion and sincerity of this book make it a real standout in this age of Business Books by Numbers."},{"Title":"Tomorrow We are Driving Computers Which Look Like Cars","review":"Guthrie's claim to be &quot;the self-proclaimed auto messiah&quot; may raise an eyebrow or two, but he unquestionably lives up to the self billing with his fact-based prophecies of the future of transportation.Automotive executives should take notice of this incredibly thought-provoking thesis. Guthrie clearly takes the scholarly perspective in reviewing the global auto industry's historical landscape and crafts a very logical roadmap of how information technology will be the increasingly important catalyst that defines an industry prone to collapsing on itself before an inevitable fundamental rebirth. The chapters focused on the Asian players and who will likely emerge as the Superpower is particularly insightful and proves Guthrie has done his homework in examining Japanese and Korean business and manufacturing practices.While at its heart an intellectual exercise, the book is written in a very friendly, humorous tone and those who appreciate an honest, straight-shooting style will find it a very pleasant read. It is not too long or too short to make its points in a poignent and stimulating manner."},{"Title":"A Book of Witches","review":"This volume is one of the earlier sets by the author.

Still guys, solid guys too, will take a leap of fate and try to defy the odds. Why? Well, it beats, shoveling burgers off the rack in some hash joint. It beats getting your hands (and hair) all messed up and smelly in some grease pit gas jockey job. And it sure as hell beats stocking some shelves in some grocery store trying to figure out how high to put the cans of tuna fish. And most of all it beats small dreams, real small dreams of cold water flats, a bunch of kids to feed (or not, when times are tough), and waiting in the cold for the city bus to come by. Ya, take the leap, no questions asked.Of course the above is quite a mouthful just to introduce a second tier 1950s (1957 to be exact) crime noir, The Brothers Rico, even if it was an adaptation from one of the great crime novel writers, Georges Simenon.I will get to the reason for the big built up in a moment after I give you the \\"skinny\\" on the plot line. See, back in the bad back streets New York City day, Mama Rico stopped a bullet, and has the limp to prove it, to save one king hell king crime boss, thereafter known as Uncle Sid. In appreciation, no questions asked, as each of her three sons came of age he employed them in one or another of his \\"businesses,\\" starting with Eddie. Eddie did his time and got out of the rackets somehow. The other two boys were still plugging away for Uncle Sid.And therein lays the crux of the problem. As the younger boys stepped up they got involved in gangland executions and something went awry. Very awry (sic, maybe). The youngest brother flew the coop and had not been heard from since. And the middle son will not squeal. This action makes crime bosses, especially middle level crime bosses like Uncle Sid, very nervous. Reason? The old time \\"stoolie\\" factor. So Uncle Sid enlisted comfortably retired Eddie to bring younger brother back. Of course times had changed for the Ricos and Sid simply used Eddie as a bloodhound to get that damn younger brother. Well he does. And in the end the earth is short two formerly high-flying Rico Brothers. Also, after Eddie wised up to Sid's role, one less middle level crime boss.Now to the cautionary tale that I have drawn, and maybe only me alone have drawn, out of this crime noir. Hard back alley New York Rico Brothers streets produced only one survivor. Hard back alley North Adamsville (that's in Massachusetts, okay) streets produced only one survivor out of three brothers (my old friend Peter Paul Markin), the other two fell to some low-rent criminal stuff. And hard back alley Olde Saco (that' s up in Maine) produced only one survivor out of three brothers (me), the other two fell to high end criminal stuff. I could probably give other examples from other back alleys as well. Real or fiction that is a hell of a price for society to impose just for being born on the wrong side of the tracks, or wrong something. End of sermon,"},{"Title":"The Brothers Rico","review":"Did anyone doubt that a Belgian could write a gripping novel about life in the U.S. Mafia? Simenon's Eddie Rico is a cog in the organization, but he's done well, as have his two younger brothers--or so he thinks. When he receives a simple request from his mentor and family friend, how can he say no? By the time Eddie figures out the real reason his help was needed, he can only sit back and watch the train wreck happen. (Fans of Phil Karlson's marvellous film of the novel will be especially surprised by the novel. It ends exactly where the film should have ended--only 1957 audiences wouldn't have liked it.)

Boston TV critic and newspaper commentator Daniel M. Kimmel is in the perfect position to present the story of FOX's rise to power, what with his background as a TV and film critic and his law degree and film teacher experience. Chapters are lively as The Fourth Network explains how a risky launch turned into a billion-dollar creation."},{"Title":"The Fourth Network: How FOX Broke the Rules and Reinvented Television","review":"What a great book this is! It's a good read and successfully balances business concepts and strategies, with lively descriptions of the personalities involved. Kimmel quotes many of the participants in this venture and provides a fast pace that entertains and educates at the same time. For the business school student or anyone with an interest in business, this makes an excellent case study. It should be required reading, especially for those who know odds are against creating a new thing in established territory. The people at Fox were smart, creative and gutsy; they defied the odds, gamed the system and won. And the author, Daniel Kimmel, really conveys the fast pace and atmosphere in which the Fox team must have operated. I am not an industry insider, so I feel like I really learned a lot about how networks are run, what the regulatory environment is like and the culture that developed at Fox. Great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fourth Network: How FOX Broke the Rules and Reinvented Television","review":"Wow! For anyone interested in the modern television landscape or anyone of my generation who grew up watching FOX (the broadcast network, mind you -- not the cable news channel) this book offers an incredibly well-researched history as well as tasteful commentaries on the network that \\"broke the rules and reinvented television.\\"The pleasure in reading comes from Kimmel's apparent respect for the network and what it has accomplished, but even so, he is not quick to shy away from the controversies and scandals that threatened to thwart FOX's climb.The only disappointment of this book (as noted by the author in the acknowledgements) is that the FOX network itself did not help with Kimmel's research. Regardless, his many interviews with previous FOX employees and associates as well as drawing from countless newspapers and trade magazines offer more than enough information to make the book informative and consistently interesting."},{"Title":"The Fourth Network: How FOX Broke the Rules and Reinvented Television","review":"The story of how the big three networks were broken to allow a fourth to develop is a great one. The stagnation of the big three combined with the drive at fox was amazing. Particularly instructive is at the start of each chapter there is a sheet that tells you how many programs they had on during primetime. You really get a sense for how important the match ups and programming are in order to get a network off the ground. This is just an all around good business book."},{"Title":"The Fourth Network: How FOX Broke the Rules and Reinvented Television","review":"An expose of the network that replaced News with lies and deception? Not at all. Everything suggests Faux News paid for this book to draw readers away from in depth inquiries.Kimmel must have been working from clippings, because you won't find any personalities here. The people who made Fox are characterless names. Fox may not have news but at least they are entertaining. This text provides neither one."},{"Title":"The Saint in Europe","review":"I should mention that the Saint (a.k.a. Simon Templar) began his career by boldly seeking out adventure, and after awhile, it began coming to him. Templar mentions from time to time (e.g. in \\"The Elusive Ellshaw\\" in _The Saint Goes On_) that he also attracts women looking for lost dogs, con men looking for a mark, and a public who generally see him as \\"something between a benevolent if weak-minded uncle and a miracle-working odd job man.\\" He's adept at sorting the wheat from the chaff to find profitable adventures.\\"The Covetous Headsman\\" (Paris) - The headless body of a shipping office clerk was found in Paris - but the decapitation took place after death. Templar uses some of his old Resistance connections to solve the mystery. Note that this isn't a mystery story as such; Templar's problems generally have only 1 suspect, and aren't arranged to ensure that the reader necessarily has a fair chance at guessing things. Incidentally, the fictional story mentioned in passing is G.K. Chesterton's \\"The Secret Garden\\", from _The Innocence of Father Brown_.\\"The Angel's Eye\\" (Amsterdam) - A respectable-looking middle-aged couple approach Templar in a restaurant with a problem. The diamond cutter to whom they just delivered the Angel's Eye for recutting (on behalf of a firm of jewelers) now denies that he ever heard of it or them.\\"The Rhine Maiden\\" (The Rhine) - This is Templar's private label for a girl met on a (train) journey along the Rhine - a girl with an aura of enchantment about her, traveling with her newly retired grandfather. (His ideal of a Rhine maiden is closer to the original myth than the popular image fostered by opera singers.)\\"The Golden Journey\\" (The Tirol) - The Saint, meeting a spoiled, beautiful girl, decides to try to salvage her, by arranging matters so that she must hike overland with him to Innsbruck. While this is an unusual tack for him to take, there are precedents - \\"The Sleepless Knight\\" and \\"The Man Who Was Clever\\", for instance. Oddly enough, it also reminds me of George MacDonald's _The Wise Woman_, although stylistically they are quite different.\\"The Loaded Tourist\\" (Lucerne) - While walking up to his hotel by the lake on a dark night, Templar fails to stop two thugs from fatally stabbing a shoe manufacturer and stealing the victim's briefcase. Following the usual investigator's tack (looking for breaks in established patterns) nets an interesting collection of observations, starting with the victim: a businessman (and looking like it) in a tourist's paradise, on the eve of his immigration to the U.S.\\"The Spanish Cow\\" (Juan-les-Pins) - Templar doesn't rate the title of Saint here. The lady mentioned in the title is an aging, rich widow who hasn't done any harm. Templar's plan to steal her diamonds has no justification. What good he does is more accidental than intentional, at least initially. Not a bad story, but not consistent with the Saint's original swashbuckling philosophy.\\"The Latin Touch\\" (Rome) - Back to the old Saint, fortunately. Templar casually makes the acquaintance of Sue Inverest while sightseeing in the Colosseum - only to be knocked cold when Mafia kidnappers ambush her. (The daughter of the U.S. Secretary of State, she had eluded her escort as a lark.) Fortunately, upon Templar's awakening in jail, the Secretary has not only checked his war record with the O.S.S., but is prepared to trust him rather than risk his daughter's life to cops who may be in the Mafia's pay."},{"Title":"The Saint in Europe","review":"This is easily the best of the post-war collections of short stories, of which there are seven: they are set in Paris, Amsterdam, The Rhine, The Tyrol, Lucerne, Juan-les-Pins and Rome.Of these stories, my favourite is the fourth, \\"The Golden Journey\\". But \\"The Spanish Cow\\" is sheer entertainment, even though the Saint comes perilously close to becoming a gigolo. And \\"The Rhine Maiden\\" at least is a return to the old, pre-war Saint.P.S.

The story is great; its the telling that is terrible. She uses too much description. It does not seem realistic, not even close. In the beginning she writes that Kathy can't gain weight, and eats whatever she wants, in huge quantities. Two chapters later Kathy is buying a dress saying she is either a size 10 or 12 depending on whether she ate a danish or not.Usually I can read a book in a day, if its a great book and I have the time. So far I have been reading this book for 2 weeks! It is very easy to put down. I find myself watching tv commercials instead of reading. Save yourself the agony of reading this and choose a book by Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"The description on the back of this book does not do justice to what this story really is. It wsa more of a mystery than I expected, but still a romance. I never would have guessed who the driver of the car was. (Chapter 1 - a car runs Tom's car off the road.) The entire book is filled with interesting characters whose lives intertwine in bizarre ways. There are lots of nut cases, which keeps it interesting.Overall, a good story that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"In 1952 someone nudges architect Tom Marcus' car over the edge of the road. His wife and two children die in the crash. After recovering in the hospital Tom is not the same as he goes through the motion at work and comes home to a lonely London flat. Tom eventually quits his job and relocates far away from London, but stops to say goodbye at the cemetery. After he leaves someone tosses Tom's bouquet away and replaces them with flowers.Kathy Wilson also leaves London when she learns her beloved dad had an affair in Dorset that included a house that has been deeded to her. Just leaving behind her hateful mother and sister is a winner for Kathy. In her new home Kathy meets a hurting Tom still mourning his loss. As they fall in love, Tom knows he cannot fully move on until he uncovers the stranger that ran him off the road and killed his family members, as he owes Kathy his total loyalty.This is an engaging second chance at love with a bit of intrigue and a historical feel to the tale. The plot is at its best when two individuals with divergent reasons for not starting a relationship are attracted to one another. When Tom turns amateur sleuth and tries to track down the villain it feels as if the author tried for a shocking twist that takes away from a deep character study that fans will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"THE BEACHCOMBER by Josephine CoxFebruary 19, 2005THE BEACHCOMBER by Josephine Cox is the second book I've read by this author, and so far I am enjoying her books. Her books are rather deceiving, however. She tends to take her time in developing characters and settings but once you get past that, her stories become somewhat intense and often times it is hard to put down her novels. She comes up with interesting plot twists that border on the soap-operaish, but with that said, I still feel her books are worth reading. If you want to be entertained and sink your teeth into a book, this could be it.Kathy Wilson and Tom Marcus meet when the two of them move to West Bay for the same reasons - to start a new life and contemplate the old. Kathy is mourning the death of her father, and her mother and sister do everything they can to make her life miserable. Tom is mourning the deaths of his wife and two children, who he thinks were murdered. He moves to West Bay to figure out how he can take revenge.When they do eventually meet, neither of them knows the other's history, and they do their best to keep their personal lives out of their relationship, at least in the beginning. In the meantime, Tom has the police back home working on the murder case, while Kathy learns about her father's life in West Bay, where he found happiness with his lover, Liz.The novel continues at a slow but gentle pace but speeds up as the mystery of Tom's family's death begins to unravel, and Kathy begins to deal with her despicable family, her mother and sister, who seem to only care about material things. Other characters also come into play, such as the friends Kathy makes in the village, her neighbor Jasper, who becomes such an important person to both herself and Tom, as well as her evil mother Irene and sister Samantha.This book gets four stars from the Ratmammy. It's not for everyone, but is aimed at romance readers and those who enjoy romantic suspense. It's not as fast paced as some readers may expect, but I think Josephine Cox's books are well worth the time spent reading."},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"This book had it all. It was a romance, a horror story, a family story, and a murder mystery. Somehow, Cox manages to pull all these elements together to make for one fascinating book. The local element of speaking (London 1952) might be difficult for some, but on the whole it's fairly easy to understand the characters. I enjoyed this book throughly and found the style of writing to be very similar to another one of my favorite books &quot;The Shell Seekers&quot;. Definitely pick up this book if you have a chance."},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"What happens when a widower and a divorcee from London get together in a small village? If the plot line of the Beachcomber is to be believed - not much.The novel starts out with a definite bang. Tom Marcus is in the car with his wife and two children when someone starts crashing into them from behind, deliberately trying to send them over the edge of the cliffs. He succeeds, and Tom's wife and children are killed instantly, while he's thrown clear of the wreck and survives. Despite the police's best efforts, the killer is not found, and a year later, Tom still can't get the disturbing scene out of his mind.Fueled by the desire to escape the past, Tom finds himself in the small hamlet of West Bay, where he rents a cottage and tries to cope with his feelings of guilt and loss. There, he meets Kathy, a divorcee who's also running away from something - her mean, spiteful mother and her impossibly perfect sister. Kathy's dad had recently died, and she found out he'd left her the house he'd shared with a woman he'd been having an affair with. As Kathy tries to deal with this new information, she comes to realize that her father had been truly happy in West Bay, and she hopes to find some of that same happiness with Tom.The development of Tom and Kathy's relationship is puzzling at best. They're intrigued by one another, sure, but they go from being relative strangers to proclaiming their love in a few short chapters. I was left wondering whether I'd missed something, but the rest of the plot is just as puzzling. The last third of the novel is dedicated to Tom's search for the person who killed his family, and the \\"shocking twist\\" is neither surprising, nor particularly intriguing. It feels contrived and tacked on.Meanwhile, the secondary characters are extremely stereotypical. Kathy's mother and sisters have no redeeming qualities at all. Jasper, the old man who everyone loves is so sweet, he makes you cringe. A few more realistic personality traits would have done wonders for the characters, the novel, and the reader's state of mind."},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"I forced myself to keep reading and made it to page 106. I had to put it down. The writing is all over the place and the characters are weak. I thought the story had potential, that's why I kept reading. It just never got better. I read alot and I normally don't put a book down but this one was unreadable in my opinion. Thankfully I bought it bargain priced!"},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"book was very good - condition was fair - pages fell apart after reading some of them - haven't had a chance to read any of the others yet"},{"Title":"The Beachcomber","review":"Tom Marcus worked in a business where he designed buildings and worked in construction, until the day he lost his family in a brutal car accident. The accident just made everything harder for him to the point where he couldn't live in his own house, or even work at his job. What he needed was a place to get away, just a little place for himself where no one can track back to him, so he can think about a new life and start something where he could be happy. Just as he's planning his get away, Kate Wilson is desperately searching for an out of the life she's lived. She lost her father a few years back and doesn't get along with her sister or her mother so she feels like she has no one else but her good and trusty friend Maggie. Once her dad had passed way, he left to her his old cottage deeds to her name out in the town just a couple steps from Tom's place. After finding it hard for Tom to fall in love again Kate started coming around and he found himself getting weak in the knees, and finding herself getting the same way around him, just as well. They hit it off right off the bat, but it was hard to get used to something new in Toms life and he was having a hard time opening himself up to Kate. The one thing on his mind was to find out the murderer of his family.This book was the first book that I've read, other than Nicholas Sparks' novels, that I really enjoyed. When I first picked up the novel and read the first page, I knew I would be hooked. Jasper, who was both Kate and Toms best friend while living in Dorset, new about Kate and her fathers life before she knew herself. He was my favorite character because he was so compassionate when it came to Kate and Tom; he cared a lot for them like his own family and watched out for them. Maggie was another character that really caught my attention due to the character she played in the novel. She was hilarious, always had a come back for everything and when I picture her, I picture my co-worker Suzi because of the great times we've had together. I know she means a lot to Kate, just like Suzi means a lot to me.The Beachcomber was a novel that was easy to read, which really topped it of. I'm choosy with my novels, and if I can't sit there and just read through it without having to read everything over again then I'm happy. I liked how she used the different language of how the English would speak. The British have that sarcastic attitude to there language and I was glad Cox picked such a great city for this novel to take place. Cox is another author I could get easily addicted to."},{"Title":"Marketing Management: The Big Picture","review":"After 25 years in the marketing profession as both a practioner and educator, I have completely changed my view of how marketing is done because of the Big Picture. The Big Picture framework will challenge the traditional Kotler school of marketing management and become the dominant approach to marketing. We use it now as our standard framework across all of our various marketing teams.What makes the Big Picture so appealing? The framework makes you determine strategy much earlier in the marketing planning process than traditional approaches. It links strategy better to core competencies, and it links strategy better to the tactical four P's of marketing than traditional approaches.On the surface, the Big Picture looks like other marketing management processes that you find in any marketing text. It has the familiar concepts: segmentation, targeting, and positiong; the 4P's, branding, customer lifetime value...it's all there. It's not until you dig deeply into the book that you begin to appreciate the richness of how things are put together. You begin to realize that \\"something is different here\\" as you begin using the framework and seeing marketing opportunities in a new light. I have used the Big Picture model in working with the most experienced, \\"blue chip\\" marketers as well as brand new marketers. The framework creates a common language between marketers and helps get alignment quicker on where to make marketing investments. Even our engineers want to learn the Big Picture to help them create new products more effectively.Once you've used the Big Picture, it's hard to go back to traditional approaches. I recommend it to business schools and corporate marketing departments as a way to unify teams and strengthen the marketing mindset."},{"Title":"Marketing Management: The Big Picture","review":"Had to go through this book in the Univ of Michigan, Business School as a introductory marketing course.

Highly recommend!!!"},{"Title":"Marketing Management: The Big Picture","review":"Nordhielm's book stands in stark contrast to the many other Marketing Management books out there. Although many of them are quite good, and have been successively refined over many editions, they all share one shortcoming: the emphasis is on broad acquantance via definition. They are more like encyclopedias than gripping novels. That's where The Big Picture shines, by contrast. Although the book manages to convey all the same core information as other texts, it does so through osmosis, with everything in context, viewed as part of a huge landscape or all-encompassing system. If this sounds grandiose, it's not; if it sounds abstract, it isn't. Rather, it is the most enthralling, user-oriented text I've come across in my years in business school and management career. The writing is a model of clarity, tight, jaunty, engaging and ultimately inspiring. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Marketing Management: The Big Picture","review":"This so far has been the best books I've read while studying for my MBA.

The author does a fantastic job of highlighting several key points in traditional marketing concepts and organizes them in a nice easy to follow framework.This book not only helped me in marketing, but in general day to day business life as well.

This book is not inspirational nor is it truthful to what could happen. Noticably, the author lacks the full truth in most of the circumstances and twists words to suit her, which she has had plenty of practice with.

Year after year, despite her best efforts: educational background, excellent job performance record and seniority, Ms. Truax watched as other less qualified officers were promoted over her.

It is both prose and poetry, both revelatory and allusive, elusive and plain by turns. It is a various book that defies category.Taylor is more than one thing himself. Born and raised in the midwest of this country, schooled in the northwest, he has spent most of his adult life in France. He has achieved a notable reputation as a critic and interpreter of French poetry and its tradition. But he has also written short fiction and essays and poems.And now we have this fascinating and often enigmatic exploration. As noted, there are 66 sections, more than 120 pages of text. It is the speaker's intention to collect and organize, to assemble, illuminating moments in his life with the aim/hope of making a coherent whole. Sometimes the speaker remembers a particular hike, a particular view; sometimes he ruminates on art and literature; sometimes he listens to characters who tell him their own stories of quest and daring and redemption. And it becomes the reader's task, too, to assemble and reassemble these details and moments. The reader's work is thus in a way the work of the speaker.It is a daring aesthetic decision.The sequence is not always easy to follow, of course, nor should it be. At times we are given small poems and something like fragments to work with, pieces that recall the Imagistes, and at other times we have prose, sentences and paragraphs of description and at another, a dramatic monologue.Whatever the variety in its technique, this work has the unity of the restless quest itself: the speaker's extensive, intensive journey, which is both physical and metaphorical. The poet-speaker identifies this theme early on, in section VII, when he addresses a weaver, asking him to \\"shuttle the knotted and tangled threads of my life into a harmonious pattern.\\"This work is about pattern and coherence, made with patterns.To work on making such a whole cloth, the speaker goes great distances (poems are set in Samos and Angers and Moscow, ID. and other far-flung places), and covers a great deal of time (about four decades); he talks to or listens to others engaged in comparable pursuits. The speaker invokes a fellow writer named \\"C,\\" speculates on John of the Apocalpyse (it is not meaningless that the speaker's name, too, is John), records the story of a character named \\"Spooky,\\" hears \\"five middle-aged Paiutes/talking about professional baseball,\\" and remembers family life. And more. All in the pursuit of making sense of it all.This is an ambitious undertaking, an effort to make a long, ruminative poem engaging and immediate at the same time that it engages traditional themes. There are not, I think, many works these days that have this scope.The Apocalypse Tapestries is a challenge. It asks the reader to pay attention, perhaps to know things that he/she hasn't learned yet. One may have to look up allusions and try to recall another language or two. In section XV the poet resolves to be \\"attentive.\\" He wants to be make sense of the real world (shards and threads and artifacts) and to bring to bear on this task a myriad of books and stories and languages. He wants to think about redemption and taking chances. He wants a challenge.And I think we should take it up -this book and its challenges-and see what we can learn."},{"Title":"Absolute C++ (2nd Edition)","review":"If you're not a seazoned programmer, and you need to learn C++, I could not recommend a better book. I've read my fair share of programming texts and most of them make fine references but do a sub par job of teaching you the language. Savitch has written a teaching text that will more than make up for your less than inspiring professor. The text is almost fun to read (lets face it, it's C++; only so much joy can be found here) and approaches each part of the language from multiple angles, insuring that you'll learn that part one way or another. There are gobs of examples, fine points, warnings, and projects. If you can't learn C++ with this text, you probably can't learn C++."},{"Title":"Absolute C++ (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a great C++ book. My experience is with the first edition, and I'm sure they've improved even that. The book is so easy to read and follow. The pages, and the code, are in color, so that specific lines of a program are highlighted to indicate the principle that the author is making.We evaluated a number of textbooks for use in an introductory C++ course at our university, and this was the one that we thought was best for our intro C++ courses (1st year engineering, and 1st year computer science). Although we don't have an intro. C++ course for 1st year students anymore, we still use the book as a reference for our other courses."},{"Title":"Absolute C++ (2nd Edition)","review":"Absolute C++ is definitely one of my favourites.

It's the first &quot;Time Warp Trio&quot; book I've read and I really enjoyed it. Joe, Fred and Sam are magically transported into the world of Greek mythology where they run from vicious three-headed dogs, exchange witty insults with Hera, queen of the gods, and outsmart Zeus and the other gods on Mount Olympus, before they find their way back home. If you know a little bit about Greek mythology you will be amused by the characterization of the gods and godesses and you will find yourself wanting to learn even more. The book is easy to read and hard to put down!"},{"Title":"It's All Greek to Me (The Time Warp Trio)","review":"Do you like the movie Hercules but dislike Hercules and the story line?

After twenty years as a journalist, Isabel became an award-winning author of children's fiction, memoirs, short stories, and novels that run the gamut from enchantment to tragedy.A stanch feminist viewpoint and intimate family bond became Allende's inspiration for writing. Tragic events such as the sickness of her adored grandfather and a coma that imprisoned her beloved daughter stirred Isabel to write daily about her life and family. Isabel's boundless enthusiasm is evident in the magic of her writing.With skill and candor, biographer Mary Main portrays Allende as a passionate woman, loving mother, and gifted author. This biography entices the reader to explore the books of Isabel Allende."},{"Title":"Isabel Allende: Award-Winning Latin American Author (Latino Biography Library)","review":"Isabel Allende by Mary Main is a most interesting book. Ms. Allende has lived a fascinating life and triumphed over adversity. What makes this book so special is its balance between talking about Allende's work, and the telling of her life story. The author's tone is informative, interesting and compelling. This book would be an excellent choice for anyone- adult or child- interested in learning more about Isabel Allende.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Isabel Allende: Award-Winning Latin American Author (Latino Biography Library)","review":"Mary Main knows how to tell a story-an especially valuable gift when it comes to writing biography. The author captures the spirit of Isabel Allende, from her early years in Peru and Chile to her life in America. And along the way, she shows us what it is like to create a great novel and how it is possible to overcome suffering and live with grace. This is a compelling and stunning book, one that's guaranteed to intrigue young readers."},{"Title":"Isabel Allende: Award-Winning Latin American Author (Latino Biography Library)","review":"This biography is easy to read and very interesting. Allende has led an unusual life battled by political conflicts, and personal growth. I think anyone would find her life story of interest even if you are not a fan of her books. I read the book in a few hours, it is fast paced and easy. Good for kids and will keep an adult's interest as well."},{"Title":"Chicago People","review":"&quot;You won't see the men and women pictured here on society pages or hobnobbing with the mayor...&quot; (From the introduction.)Photographer Richard Younker has produced an important book, based upon more than 20 years of photographing and interviewing &quot;ordinary people&quot; in the Chicago area. He has given a voice to people rarely heard from, the people whose gaze we avoid in the street, who we often ignore and put out of mind.Yet these people are part of America and my city, and it's good to hear from them, if only for the three or four paragraphs reproduced across from their images.And the photography! Younker is a very subtle, fly on the wall operator, and his images ring true. In some he has confronted his subjects, in others they seem unaware of his presence. All the images &quot;work,&quot; providing a wide ranging look at a variety of people he describes as &quot;living close to the edge.&quot;Chicago People is a fine piece of work.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Billie Morgan","review":"These are my notes for whether or not this would make a decent film adaptation:When a newspaper story on local missing persons dredges up the name of the horrible Terry Skinner, BILLIE MORGAN has to deal with the burden of knowledge of her part in his murder, while continuing to be the concerned family friend to his widow, JASMINE, and son NATHAN. While Billie fears that her crime will be found out, the consequences of her actions haunt her in an entirely different way, playing out in the wrecked lives of Jasmine and Nathan who she has come to love dearly.Boiled down to it's bare essentials, \\"Billie Morgan\\" is a story about consequences - not the accepted consequences that society tries to impose, like Jail, but the true, human fall-out of our actions. There is never more than a suggestion that Billie might end up in jail for her crime, and while Billie has a certain amount of fear at the chance she will, we see her keep her secret for the welfare of those around her, even those who have rejected her, more than for herself. The real issue is actually hit upon by the scandal seeking newspaper the Clarion, when they write about the \`Disappeared' - those who Society, and therefore the authorities, don't care about because they don't fit a certain type - middle class, blonde, white... \\"Billie Morgan\\" is about the underclass who operate outside the System, and for whom the justice imposed by the System isn't justice at all.Billie herself is a great female protagonist - perhaps not the greatest in a long while, as the Kirkus review said, but definitely a compelling and complex heroine. Perhaps her greatest asset is her honesty with herself, thus becoming more human, more relatable, and allowing the reader to admit their own dark secrets to themselves - that maybe, just maybe, they would have done the same thing in Billie's situation and unwittingly murdered a man.As much as Billie is a character who jumps off the page and brings the story alive, the dialogue is so specific and well written; it does a lot to give flavor and character to the story in its own right. Joolz Denby writes the dialect of the lower-class North-Eastern Brit with ease - and while such efforts - for example the Scottish brogue of Irvine Welsh - can often be confusing to the reader, there didn't seem to be any such complications here. For a movie adaptation, maintaining the dialect would be as essential to the characters and place as a Southern U.S. accent would be to a film set in rural Mississippi.The film version would probably have to start somewhere about the middle of the book, and work the two time periods together, using the frame of the newspaper's research to bring out the back story.The film version of this book would have a lot of the important ingredients necessary for a successful film - murder intrigue (although we know who did it, the why and the how of it is withheld until the end), sex, drugs, danger, family skeletons - and social commentary. There will be difficulties in translating much of the novel's internal world in to a cinematic medium, but not so much as to be insurmountable. The real downside may be that a film set among the urban poor in the U.K. may be a world that does not have a large appeal to American audiences without glamorizing certain aspects of that world, and thus compromising some of the thematic elements of the book."},{"Title":"Billie Morgan","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this book - turns out it was unlike any other book I have read. The story is gripping, keeping your interest until the last page, having quite a few unexpected twists and turns.Joolz Denby is quite the master at setting just the right mood, even small details are superbly described, pulling you into the story as if you are an invisible spectator in the room.As for the characters - well, I just could not identify with them at all - not a single one of them. That kept me in the above mentioned spectator role and stopped me from feeling, loving, hating, laughing and crying with them.The social criticism, sometimes subtle, hinted at, sometimes in your face, screaming at you, is superbly brought across.As a last note - the editing for the Kindle edition is appalling. This can be kindly overlooked, as the novel as a whole was really a treat."},{"Title":"Billie Morgan","review":"I LOVED this fascinating book . It kept me glued to the page and every twist and turn pulled me further into the story.It features a wonderful cast of solid characters, all real as flesh and blood. I was moved by their stories and circumstances and the impact fate has on each of them. A wonderful, enjoyable, dark, emotional and moving book which made me both laugh and cry. One of THE best books I have read.Joolz Denby is in my opinion an very underrated writer and I would highly recommend this book as an introduction to her work."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Like so many others, I discovered this slim volume of poetry as a teenager -- which may be the very best time to do so, as it invariably opens a lot of new doors at a crucial period of development. It certainly did just that for me!Ferlinghetti brings an easy erudition, a delightful sense of humor, and an expansive humanity to his work. While he recognizes & deplores the human capacity for ignorance, fear & oppression, he never loses hope in our ability to rise above that, to transcend the drab everyday & find something more to life. Indeed, his work calls to us, asks us to do more than merely settle -- but it's always a call, not a command. His beliefs are strong & clear, but he's never hectoring or dogmatic.Frankly, this volume is worth getting just for the poems \\"Constantly Risking Absurdity,\\" \\"Christ Climbed Down,\\" and especially \\"I Am Waiting\\" -- but there's so much more here as well! There's genuine wonder & joy in these poems ... and they'll also make you think. Ferlinghetti remains underrated to this day, which is a a pity; but if you sample this classic volume, you'll definitely want to read more of his work. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"articulate modern poetry, a bit disjointed for me, but the person i got it for will love it."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I wish those who praise Ferlinghetti and his work (or even those who disparage them) would LEARN from HIM that he, by his own repeated statement, is NOT a \\"Beat\\".Such guilt by association is an insult to him: unlike so-called \\"Beats,\\" including vapid wind-bag Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti REWRITES.He has expressly said that the \\"Beat\\" ethos -- \\"First thought, best thought\\" -- is instead \\"First thought, WORST thought.\\"Regardless whether you respect him or not, at least give him his due and respect his word: he is NOT a \\"Beat\\".As for this book: wonderful. It is one of the few best-selling books of poetry, and deserves to be, with its fresh style and imagery -- and energy. A lovely follow-up to the equally magical \\"Pictures of the Gone World\\" -- also a continuing seller, and recommended. Open the book and marvel at the exploding fireworks."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I first read Coney Island when I was in high school, when I fancied myself a poet. Ferlinghetti's work in this slim volume is much simpler and much more accessible than that of his contemporaries, especially Ginsberg. Part I of the collection, titled \\"A Coney Island of the Mind,\\" is more deliberate in its stylings and in a slight need of an editor, but expressive nonetheless. The real power of this collection is with Part II, spoken word poetry that Ferlinghetti had performed with a jazz accompanyment. His natural style becomes fluid, moving effortlessly across the page in deep rhythms that bring you directly to the moment of vision."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"At his best, this poet is one of the best of his generation. Certainly more bookish than Kerouac or Bukowski (and perhaps even moreso than Ginsberg and Burroughs) this poet in this book is allowed to be more relevant because... well... he's still alive....Some of the poems in here are wonderful and could stand beside the best of any other poet. As in most anthologies, though, some are forgettable and would be best exised and forgotten. Those are few in number but they keep me from giving the whole book a five star review...If you like the 'beat generation' but are full with the more well-known writers (not that this poet is in any way unknown) this might be a good book to check out...."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"One of my all time favorite rainy-day-in-a-hammock classics,is Lawrence Ferlinghetti's &quot;A Coney Island of the Mind.&quot;Ferlinghetti's mystical street wisdom makes him my favoriteof the beat poets.

And it is so cool."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Ferlinghetti published Howl abroad. Customs confiscated it which led to the Supreme Court case which made Ginsberg rich and famous for his Whitmanesque knock-off.

Instead, they deliver powerful emotions and create moody atmosphere through great simplicity. If you're interested in the Beat literatures, you shouldn't pass on the Ferlinghetti's superb collection."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Lawrence Ferlinghetti is a unique poet. He doesn't follow the whole rhyme scheme of average poems but speaks in a casual, conversational manner - a very jazzy type of persona. I enjoyed reading his poems so much that I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I smirked, I felt sad and disgruntled - it was a fantastic collection of poems. As a graphic designer I really appreciated the text layout. The layout helped to emphasize the meaning of the poem and allows the reader to take the poem in. One of the poems that I really enjoyed was in the third section, poem 11. Ferlinghetti is witty and humorous yet deals with heavy issues of the world and of the human condition. These poems will give you insight into the tragic potential of post/modern life."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I personally am not a fan of poetry, but since I had recently become interested in Beat literature, I felt I must read this collection of poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. The book is comprised of three sets of poems. In the first set is a rant against the absurdities of American culture. While I wouldn't consider myself an angry young man, I found this section to be quite refreshing.The second set of poems, an Oral Message, is meant to be read aloud with jazz accompaniment. These were written in the 50's so it's sort of like a precursor to rap. I think I would have enjoyed this much more if I had seen it performed live.The final 13 poems are from his first book and deal mostly with death.Like I said I am not a huge fan of poetry, and most of these poems were case of hit or miss. Most enjoyed a great deal, some I didn't understand at all. Sometimes it was just a case of line or phrase that I found inspiring, but over all I really did enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Ferlinghetti's work is still being read by aspiring poets and artists at poetry readings all across America. I am still impressed no matter how many times I hear different poets read \\"I Am Waiting.\\" For this poem alone the book is required reading, however the work ripples with great poems. If you love the spoken word or just reading poetry in a book, this work is an icon of modern American literature. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I love Lawrence Ferlinghetti and I always have ever since a friend first read number 5 to me in college. It happens to be a wonderful allegory to Jesus and one of my favorite lines from it is \\"they stretch him on the Tree to cool.\\" The author's language is exquisite although sometimes his wordsmithing manages to out-resonate his message. This is poetry at its best as it is both challenging and accessible. Practically every entry in \\"A Coney Island of the Mind\\" captures one's interest. Even the introductory phrase from this collection, \\"In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see,\\" is highly memorable. Some of the later poems are excellent such as the anti-materialistic \\"Christ Climbed Down\\" and \\"2\\" from Pictures of the Gone World. What Ferlinghetti offers up is life lessons along with a treasure trove of human feeling and description. I read poetry rarely but still savor the works of this twentieth century master."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"... I first read those words oh so many years ago, in the poem \\"Autobiography,\\" and through the proverbial twists of fate, I've come to live in the Land thereof. There were those initial attractions when this book first came out, the black and white covers of New Directions paperbacks, the visceral title for one who had been to that \\"down market\\" fantasy land, Coney Island. Both announced a \\"path less traveled\\" from an industry of much hyped \\"best-sellers\\" of the big publishing houses. And on the first reading there were the appealing cadences and the tugs to the inchoate feelings that the path more traveled wasn't going to be just right, as in the poems \\"I Am Waiting\\" and \\"Christ Climbed Down.\\" Imagine being outraged about the commercialization of Christmas so far back; Today we'd be nostalgic for those days we'd consider authentic. Prescient Ferlinghetti was also, in \\"Autobiography,\\" when he said: \\"I see another war is coming...\\" for my own autobiography, and the war I was in, and later still, for the war my children were invited to.But re-reading it some 40 years on, and there is a much deeper appreciation. I've read many of the books and seen the paintings that he makes allusions to, sometimes subtly, sometimes more straightforwardly. There is Hieronymous Bosch, Goya, Robin in Djuana Barnes' \\"Nightwood,\\" the ending to Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" Thomas Wolfe's \\"a leaf, a stone, an unfound door,\\" Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and Kafka's \\"Castle.\\" Did he really make it to the Vaucluse to see the summer of sauterelles? Learning French helps in understanding also. What he was trying to say just makes so much more SENSE the second time around, now that you can \\"get\\" the analogies without footnotes.Some lines hit the bull's eye for what we would become: \\"...on a concrete continent spaced with bland billboards illustrating imbecile illusions of happiness...\\" and \\"...from Lost Angeles to Heaven and promising Free Elections...\\" Also there is a most fitting rebuke, in the best New Directions' traditions, to the high priests of culture: \\"'Truth is not the secret of a few' yet you would maybe think so the way some librarians and cultural ambassadors and especially museum directors act, you'd think they had a corner on it the way they walk around shaking their high heads and looking as if they never went to the bath room or anything.\\"Lawrence Ferlinghetti will turn 90 this month, and congratulations are being accepted at the book store he founded, City Lights Books in San Francisco.

An incredible wordsmith, he takes the inane and makes it art."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I'll begin by saying I'm not a big fan of beat poetry. I'm even less of a fan of mediocre beat poetry. While I'm not entirely comfortable calling Ferlinghetti's work &quot;beat&quot; in the strictest sense of the term (as if &quot;beat&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; should turn up in the same sentence), it is a sort of proto-beat which shows the promise (if you like beat poetry, &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;spectre&quot; if you don't) of later poets.Nothing to scream about, but not the worse book of verse I've ever read."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"After purchasing this book on recommendation of a good friend I was highly expectant - almost excited. I expected a labyrinth of capturing poems and prose. I am highly surprised at what I did receive however. Compared to Emily Dickinson, Wilfred Owen and other such greats, this poetry did not strike me at all.I recognise that it is popular with many but for people who expect poetry to be colourful, captivating, evoking and grasping, what is delivered here are consistently unrecognisable words and phrases (my interpretation - yours may be different), not related to personal experiences that hurt, entertain or allow poetry to be written effectively.Whilst the poet is well recognised and I have no problem with people who are fans of Lawrence, I am not impressed at his inability to make be breathe sharply and say &quot;Goodness. This poem has affected me in an emotional way&quot;. Sorry about these comments, but it is what I feel."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"This was the first Ferlinghetti I ever got my hands on, and it swept me away into a world from which I have yet to return.

It made me fall in love with poetry...and the passion of the heart."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Let me start off by saying that, in the run of things, this type poetry is not my favorite. I'm more of a formalist myself, but I couldn't help but be impressed by much of this collection, which, along with Ginsberg's HOWL, kicked off the Beat Movement in American poetry in the 1950's.This is largely a verbal collage, a compendium of memories, impressions, chants, lists, and lyric fragments. The influence of Whitman is apparent in the freeform meditations on the human body and the populist tone of much of the book. This is a cry for people to throw off the constraints of materialism and return to a simpler way of living. It exalts the earth over industry, art over commerce, individualism over uniformity. In other places the shadows of Eliot and Yeats can be seen; indeed in a couple of poems Ferlinghetti freely borrows from those masters - see &quot;The Junkman'Obbligato&quot;, for instance, which echoes Eliot's &quot;The Waste Land&quot; with the repeated refrain &quot;Hurry please it's time.&quot;The book is divided into three sections. There is the title section then a series of seven pieces (including &quot;Junkman&quot;) originally written for musical accompaniment and finally some selections from Ferlinghetti's first book PICTURES OF THE GONE WORLD.Not for all tastes but seminal nevertheless and eye-opening as well."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"AAAHHHHH! No one has ever topped Ferlinghetti for his exciting rhythm and electric presentation. Read this collection and discover how much FUN poetry can be. I first discovered these poems in the late '60s, an amazing time to be alive, and I felt that these poems captured some of that spirit uniquely and forever. What I didn't realize was that they also fit in perfectly with the '50s, and later in the '70s, the '80s, and the '90s, as well. And here we are in yet another century and the work holds up better than ever! Whatever you do, READ THEM ALOUD!"},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I first read Lawrence Ferlinghetti's poem, \\"Constantly Risking Absurdity\\" when I was 26 years young. I am now 41 and I still read that poem to remind me that even though my body may be taking on the appearances of getting older, my mind, my spirit, and my soul are just as young as ever.I believe we grow old not because of time, but what we do or don't do with our time. We let our beliefs become rigid, we let our attitudes harden, we forget what it was like to be flexible and youthful and optimistic about life.This book opens the mind. It expands the heart. It flows through the soul like honey and lets the \\"imprisoned splendor\\" escape through the cracks of the entire psyche. I would suggest reading this book by candlelight with maybe some Lee Morgan or John Coltrane in the background.It's a book of prayers written by a Beat Priest and every day I thank God that I came across that poem I mentioned earlier in this review it changed my life in a million ways known as well as unknown.If you are looking for something to bring you to a place of youthful vigor, give this book a try.

More in-line with the literary tradition of the English language, Lawrence Ferlinghetti thankfully lacks Ginsberg's heavy-handedness and Kerouac's understated moodiness -- there is something buoyant even in Ferlinghetti's most wrenching laments; we always seem to learn something from him (and if we don't, he's willing to laugh it all away with us). Ferlinghetti's knowledge of art and history (and his ability to tie them into his themes), as well as an unusual matter-of-fact (often in medias res) presentation lends an aura of significance to what could otherwise be random musings. Lawrence is the master...if you don't have this book, it's worth the seven bucks (and its weight in gold).--Justin Laird Weaver &lt;uweavj02@umail.ucsb.edu&gt;"},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I'm very serious about the title of my review: \\"This book changed my life.\\" It did. My father gave me a copy when I was sixteen (32 now) and from that point I've been an *avid* Ferlinghetti fan. His poems delicately point out the subtle joys, heartaches, and beauty which can be easily overlooked every day.I cannot recommend this book any more highly. Buy this right now. Buy a few copies and give them to friends and family. I certainly have."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Ferlinghetti is strange in that he considers himself a man of the people, yet works in a field in which the common man wouldn't normally participate. He writes so that academics won't like him, and fans of bukowski or ginsberg won't necessarily like him. The only poet REMOTELY like him could possibly be Bob Hicok.Ferlinghetti developed his own style of poetry that's (to paraphrase) not constrained by the limits of the poetic line. It's all over the place, in form and in content. This is his seminal work, and the modern version even contains the best from his previous: Pictures of the Gone World.He has a sensibility for the turn of a phrase, as we see with \\"The poet's eye obscenely seeing\\" and \\"cast up / the heart flops over / gasping 'Love'. He is in tune with the alienation of the modern age, and although he's far from a \\"people person\\", his quiet insights have proven inspiring and invaluable.His next-best work is probably \\"starting from san francisco\\", which contains my favorite poem, \\"overpopulation\\" (an oft-overlooked, but great piece of poetry to read aloud). This one, however, is a must-read if you're into a populist aesthetic for poetry. If you like poetry that you can read on fifteen different levels, and isn't really saying anything, this is NOT the book for you."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"Ferlinghetti has an uncanny ability to capture the essence of life in words. The title of his book, for instance: brilliant. Then there's phrases like &quot;drugged store cowboy&quot; (as opposed to drug store cowboy) and plenty of others! My favorite line is when a girl walks up to him at a club of some kind and says, &quot;You and me could really exist.&quot; Little details like that are what makes Coney Island of the Mind a real treat. It's easy to read, but it's by no means simplistic."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"I first read this book of poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti while in college in the early 1960's, and Ferlinghetti immediately became my favorite beat poet. \\"Johnny Nolan has a patch on his ass.

I am so pleased to own this small book again and will take care to keep it safe this time."},{"Title":"Coney Island of the Mind","review":"A Coney Island of the Mind is one of the definitive works of the beatnik generation. Ferlinghetti has managed to combine unique phrasing to the beat of certain jazz to create a world of images, beautiful and strange. The ideas he conveys are that of the art of travel; finding the true artistic voices of the time and allowing them to ring out; and ridding ourselves of the empty thought that has penetrated, not only our minds, but our souls. I believe that the beautiful and creative way he presents his art will keep A Coney Island of the Mind a must-read for years to come."},{"Title":"The Occult Sciences: How to Get What You Want Through Your Occult Powers","review":"This book is awesome.

It was fascinating and well done, fully immersed in the historical context out of which it developed with interesting characters, some real and some fictional.For those who enjoy the historical fiction genre, the author takes the reader into a little known segment of history and brings it vividly to life.

Thomas Yannios, M.D. makes it easier to decide which products to purchase in The Food Report Card. Dr. Yannios has analyzed the labels of thousands of foods, and compiled his results in a simple grade of A, B, C, or D.&quot;You can make an enormous impact on your long-term health, and even on your appearance,&quot; Dr. Yannios writes, &quot;if you do nothing else during your normal food shopping but select the A- and B-rated foods, and leave the C's and D's on the shelves back at the store.&quot;Dr. Yannios believes that atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is the number one health problem for many Americans. He says that &quot;food significantly impacts&quot; atherosclerosis, and that we can reduce the negative impact by carefully choosing what we eat. &quot;People are confused,&quot; Dr. Yannios says, explaining that he wrote The Food Report Card to help eliminate confusion and enable people to choose foods that are good for them.He has grouped foods into categories, such as beverages, cereals and grains, milk and dairy products, and meats. Each food within a category is then listed in alphabetical order, such as chocolate milk and vegetable juice in the beverage section. Foods are then evaluated by brand name. For example, five brands of vegetable juice are analyzed and graded. He maintains that pattern for each food category, analyzing 12,000 foods altogether. All you have to do is look up a specific food to quickly determine whether it is an &quot;A&quot; food that you want to consume or a &quot;D&quot; food you want to avoid.People who want to choose the healthiest processed foods, but don't want to spend a lot of time calculating nutritional values from confusing labels, will find The Food Report Card informative and helpful."},{"Title":"The Food Report Card: 12,000 Favorite Foods Including Brand-Name Products, Graded A,B,C, or d Fornutritional Value","review":"Good Amazon.com seller, and product.

As a reader, I gained insight into parental loss, and with the addition of her own poetry there's a personal journey that takes us beyond sheer intellect (which is very evident in this book, well written, intelligent). I'm left with the feeling that Ms. Herring is a woman of heart and mind, and with this balance a healing takes place. It's the kind of book you want to mark up, bend the page, read the poetry out loud, share with a friend, a group. Read it more than once, enjoy the process of heart and mind."},{"Title":"Lost Fathers: How Women Can Heal from Adolescent Father Loss","review":"I feel the title of the book is misleading. Most of the book seems to concentrate on womens adolescent loss from fathers who have died, and not much on abandonment issues. Much of the book is the author's personal experience from her father's death. I would not recommend this book to women who have lost their father through abandonment/divorce. Yes, loss is loss, but there are different issues surrounding a father who leaves the family vs. the finality of death."},{"Title":"Lost Fathers: How Women Can Heal from Adolescent Father Loss","review":"I'm a writer, too, and have been working on dealing with the loss of my father in some way since he died some 20 (plus!) years ago.

An hour or so later I had almost finished a first read and was in line to buy it. It's among the most useful books I've ever read.It helps a lot that Ms. herring is a fellow writer, pretty much exactly my age, lost her father at a similar point, with a sister of similar relative age.With all due respect to the previous poster, this is NOT about mother loss. I've found no shortage of books there. It's very specifically about losing your father when you're female and not a child or an adult but somewhere between girl and woman. The specificity is what makes it a find for me.It also had very concrete writing assignments and wonderful insights.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book goes deep into the human mind. It poses questions to long taught knowledge. Makes you re-think everything you've ever learned. It also makes you queston human nature and human drives. Whether humans have instincts or not? I suggest reading the Tao before the first chapter."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"During the past few centuries within discussions of philosophy there has been what might be called a revitalization of skepticism. This skepticism, what many deem free inquiry or free thought, has come to question everything, such that during the early Twentieth Century G.K Chesterton wrote that: \\"It is vain for eloquent atheists to talk of the great truths that will be revealed if once we see free thought begin. We have seen it end. It has no more questions to ask; it has questioned itself.\\"The Abolition of Man is C.S. Lewis' answer to this same thought, his answer to the skepticism which has once again begun to run rampant throughout all philosophy and all society since the beginning of modernity. Despite being a well-known Christian writer, in this particular text Lewis is not arguing distinctively for a religious system, but is simply addressing the question of objectivity and first principles.In short, Lewis' argument is in favor of what he terms the \`Tao\`, that is, the \\"practical principles known to all men by Reason\\" or in other words \\"the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false.\\" In rejecting this Tao Lewis argues that mankind has created \\"men without chests.\\" They have done away with basic axioms of morality and virtue in attempt to create their own system.Yet for Lewis this is impossible, stating that \\"neither in any operation with factual propositions nor in any appeal to instinct can the Innovator find the basis for a system of values.\\" In short, in rejecting objective values the \`Innovator' has placed themselves in position in which they can have no values at all, and which any attempt to create values is simply a contradiction in which they draw upon the objectivity which they reject. This phenomena, combined with man's attempts at conquering nature (first through doing away with old moralities and then through more physical means) paradoxically results in the state which the title describes, the abolition of man. Through skepticism they have done away with value and all obligation, leaving only the impulse of nature: \\"They are not men at all: they are artifacts. Mans' final conquest has proved to be the abolition of Man.\\"Perhaps the summation of Lewis' argument can be found here:\\"If you will not obey the Tao, or else commit suicide, obedience to impulse (and therefore, in the long run, to mere \`nature') is the only course left open. At the moment, then, of Man's victory over Nature, we find the whole human race subjected to some individual men, and those individuals subjected to that in themselves which is purely \`natural' - to their irrational impulses. Nature, untrammeled by values, rules the Conditioners and, through them, all humanity. Man's conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its consummation, to be Nature's conquest of Man.\\"In the final analysis The Abolition of Man is a powerful argument for first principles, those basic and universal values which are shared by mankind, standing as self-evident and thereby forming the only foundation upon which anything - even any argument - can be based, for without axioms no progress can be made and nothing can be proven. Finishing out at a nice 81 pages the book can easily be read in one sitting and serves as wonderful food for thought while pondering the basic questions of morality and values.Memorable Quotes:-\\"No emotion is, in itself, a judgment; in that sense all emotions and sentiments are alogical. But they can be reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to Reason or fail to conform. The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it.\\"-\\"It is no use trying to \`see through' first principles. If you see through everything, then everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible world. To \`see through' all things is the same as not to see.\\"-\\"If the pursuit of scientific knowledge is of real value, then so is conjugal fidelity. The rebellion of new ideologies against the Tao is a rebellion of the branches against the tree: if the rebels could succeed they would find that they had destroyed themselves. The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imagining a new primary color...\\"-\\"We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.\\"Specific CriticismsPerhaps my only criticism of this text is that I think Lewis sets out on a futile task by denying himself the argument for theism, specifically Christianity. Granted, he does state that \\"In order to avoid misunderstanding, I may add that though I myself am a Theist, and indeed a Christian, I am not here attempting any indirect argument for Theism. I am simply arguing that if we are to have values at all we must accept the ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason as having absolute validity... Whether this position implies a supernatural origin for the Tao is a question I am not here concerned with.\\"Personally, I don't believe that it is possible to address whether there are \\"ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason\\" without discussing (directly or indirectly) whether or not these have a supernatural origin; not only this, but sufficing to refer to these as simply the results of \`Practical Reason' is to do somewhat of a disservice to the creator who put them in place. There is no basis for Practical Reason outside theism. Perhaps one might dismiss this as attempt to gain a neutral ground with his audience, designating these axioms as natural reason and using a third party term (Tao) when speaking of them. This may be a valid case, though it still encourages the autonomy of man in such cases (where it is the this rebellious autonomy which is the true issue).More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

This is simply a terrible format for what is a serious piece of reading. I am not a fan of the frayed edges that I guess are supposed to give a book some sort of feel of 'authenticity' or whatever. It looks nice, but books are for reading first, not looks. Another gripe is the folds or sleeves inside the (soft)cover. Just inconvenient and unnecessary. I will probably tear mine off at some point soon. So this product is a bit of a disappointment.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"The Abolition of Man (or) Reflections on Education with Special Reference to the Teaching of Englihs in the Upper Forms of School\\" stands as one of the single most eloquent and trustworthy defense of the Tao, the term Lewis uses to describe a universal moral code, as has been written in the twentieth century. He takes to task Alec King and Martin Ketley's \\"The Control of Language\\" (1940) and E. G. Biaggini's \\"The Reading and Writing of English\\" (1936), both of which suppose values, etc, relative and of no real consequence to the world.Although the full title sounds more like a little read doctrinal desertation or limited only to education, thsi book is [more beyond] not limited to education matters. \\"The Abolition of Man\\", while using educational matters as its springboard, goes far beyond that topic, and focuses on universal morality.Because they had only recently been published when Lewis was writing this, he concealed their names under ficticous ones, but he does not allow them to, as he says it, build men without chests in the school system. Lewis's terminology is that the chest, the mediator between the head, which houses reason, and the belly, which houses instinct, is vitally important for humanity to have, and by making values relative, essentially we are taking out this important element in humanity.Lewis describes with great indignation that much of this process is unconscious to the school children who are reading these texts, and, when a few years have passed and this argument comes to his conscious, he will side with those who want to say morality is subjective simply because they have been trained to believe so, even though they do not remember the source from whence this belief came.Lewis continues in the next to lectures to argue very convincingly against this type of thought, and shows us the great civilization have, strikingly I might add, the same moral ethical concerns, and when they have not become to fallen these civilizations generally agree on the fundamental basis of ethical structure. To any who wish to learn more about the natural law or why morality is not subjective as many of the world would have us believe, this is one of the best written defenses people who champion morality has to offer.For those looking for additional reading by C. S. Lewis on this matter, you would do well to read \\"A Case for Christianity\\", the first part of \\"Mere Christianity\\", as well as the novel \\"That Hideous Strength\\". \\"Mere Christanity\\" sets into a Christian context what Lewis was writing about in \\"The Abolition of Man\\", and \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is an excellent fictional portrayal of the type of people who were pushing the \\"all morality is subjective\\" and why that is so damning.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

I definately suggest that you first read some background on this book to get a historical perspective on it. Final Grade - C"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This is a short book, but it has a lot of substance, and though C.S. Lewis is a renowned Christian author, The Aboliton of Man is not about Christianity or even Theism. Instead, Lewis makes a case for teaching moral character values, such as integrity, diligence, caring for the elderly and the sick, that are universal throughout various cultures. He calls this set of univeral laws the Tao.Lewis takes issue with changes in public education, a particular textbook really, which he refers to as the Green Book. He charges that the proposed changes to the use of the English language is really a matter of philosophy and not education. If education removes sentiment from reason, ironically in the guise of reason, humans lose what makes them human and reduces their ability to reason effectively. Under this educational system, when pupils are taught moral concepts it is a product of education and not the motive, and thus creates in the mind's door a vulnerability to controllers and conditioners (of thoughts, feelings, and what is considered acceptable) who will continue to shape, or manipulate, the individuals to the outcome they desire. This is a marked change from old birds teaching the young to fly on their own.If you take issue with political correctness and question outcome based education and the impact it has on modern society, I think you would find this book interesting. Lewis understands where this train is going as soon as it leaves the station and we are much further down the line now than when he wrote this book decades ago. His insight is astonishing as he spells out the consequences of using this philosphy in education. Lewis is also concerned over man's use of nature to conquer nature, particularly in the area of eugenics. He intelligently expounds that utopia for a few means a dead end for many others."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book is small - about 113 pages in length, and that includes the notes and comments. But it is rich in thought and insight. It takes concentration to read it, but is well worth the effort.The book consists of three essays entitled MEN WITHOUT CHESTS, THE WAY, and THE ABOLITION OF MAN. The work was written in response to a book Lewis read about public education, and Lewis takes the book to task. He doesn't mention the real title (he calls it THE GREEN BOOK and names the authors as \\"Gaius and Titius\\"). Based on some assertions made by these two authors, he feels that, if followed to their logical conclusions, their views could lead - intentionally or unintentionally - to the idea that there are no true objective standards for our world view, although he doesn't actually accuse them of doing it on purpose.Then Lewis gives his reasons for believing that there is a basic world view which he calls the TAO (not to be confused with the Tao Te Ching, although that could be a part of it) and he gives what I believe to be a convincing case for seeing a common ground in all faiths.After these three essays, there is a collection of quotes and statements from philosophers and thinkers from diverse sources - from the ancient Chinese and Egyptians to the Babylonians, Old Norse and Hindu thinkers, among others. He presents these to show that there is more unity than we might have originally thought. By the way - in this book he does not try to present a case for Christianity in particular, but rather that we see a commonality in human beliefs, cultural and detail differences notwithstanding.Although the book is excellent in its insights and I highly recommend it, it must be read carefully, and it takes a lot of thought and pauses to absorb it completely. I found it to similar to \\"Book One\\" in MERE CHRISTIANITY, entitled \\"Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe.\\" It also is similar to his essay \\"The Poison of Subjectivism\\" from his collection CHRISTIAN REFLECTIONS. In my opinion, these two are easier to understand at first reading.But having said that, I think this book is worth reading and re-reading. It can be read with value by Christian and non-Christian alike."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Starting with a deceptively simple observation - that modern (now postmodern) philosophy tends to reduce all statements of value to mere statements of subjective feeling - Lewis goes on to demonstrate the corrosive and ultimately fatal effect of this line of thinking on any civilized culture.Lewis accurately predicts the parallel development of two trends: (1) the loss of any objective transcendent moral standards; and (2) the ability of a scientific or political elite, through social conditioning and/or genetic manipulation, to affect the thinking of successive generations of the rest of us - the great unwashed. The ascendancy, during the last decade, of moral relativism and the political correctness movement demonstrate how far down these parallel tracks we have come (i.e., Rorty: truth is what gets us what we want; truth is what my peers will let be get by with saying; Christians are &quot;the natural constituency of Hitler&quot;).While he's at it, Lewis refutes the postmodern, and generally unexamined, truism that the historic moral principles of Western Civilization are fundamentally different from other cultures' norms, and thus are arbitrary and nonbinding. In a lengthy appendix, Lewis shows that the great moral principles are timeless and have been generally accepted by all civilized societies, at all times (until ours).So where will it end? In an ironic conclusion, Lewis predicts that what will be hailed an man's ultimate victory over Nature (such as human cloning?) will actually be Nature's ultimate victory over man. This will occur when we can fully control the kind of people the next generation will be (i.e., how they think), but in the absence of moral standards, this choice will be made arbitrarily; that is, according to purely Natural impulses - thus we have the Abolition of Man as man and the ascendancy of man as animal.I must take issue with the reviewer who referred to the book as a &quot;disguised apologetic&quot; for Christianity. While Lewis openly acknowledges his Christian beliefs, he takes great pains to establish that the existence of objective moral standards is transcultural; that it is &quot;trans-&quot; any specific religious or ethical system other than relativism. Those who insist otherwise are simply out of touch; controlled by their own hermeneutic of suspicion, they see closet Christians lurking behind any and all moral absolutes.A final point - I must also disagree with the reviewer who referred to the book too difficult for the average reader. I'm an accountant, I have no training in philosophy, and I'm definitely not a candidate for MENSA membership - but I had no trouble &quot;getting it.&quot; Light reading it's not, but, hey, it's short, the type is large, the book is cheap, and it's written in Lewis' inimitable conversational style. Don't be intimidated, the stakes are too high!"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The Abolition of Man is a stunningly brilliant masterpiece, prophetic in its insight. Several of the other reviewers here who gave the book is plainly deserved five stars have done a fine job of reviewing its contents. Let me respond briefly to the fundamentalist (rousaswgnr) in Campsville, CA and the leftist bigot in Vancouver, WA. Both fail to scratch the surface of the book for opposite reasons.The reviewer in Campsville (rousaswgnr) apparently thinks that any appeal to right and wrong that doesn't simply quote Bible verses is anti-Christian. Obviously, he would be completely incapable of trying to convince nonChristians that there are universal moral laws that are contravened at our peril -- the very thing Lewis was trying to do. At one point this seeming &quot;fundamentalist&quot; wrote that only scripture teaches right and wrong and things about God. That statement is ironically contrary to scripture itself which says &quot;the heavens declare the glory of God&quot; and that God has revealled His ways and parts of His nature in nature itself and in human consciences (Romans 1). The reviewer rousaswgnr contradicts scripture while trying to defend it. That's a pity. For if he really understood scripture or C. S. Lewis he would know that Lewis is saying what scripture says: God has universal moral laws that He has written into nature that all people can see and that have been generally recognized by major civilizations throughout the ages. Lewis also says it with breath-taking beauty.The leftist from Vancouver, WA is even more vacuous than the fundamentalist. (That's typical.) Like the typical leftist, he imagines that he's brilliant while proving that he doesn't have a clue. He thinks he's clever by quoting Lau Tzu on the meaning of &quot;Tao.&quot; But if he'd bothered to have really read Lewis or found out the meaning of the Chinese word &quot;Tao&quot;, he would know that Lewis was not referring to Taoism but to the much more pervasive use of the idea of &quot;Tao&quot; in Chinese culture: that offered by Confucianism. The humanist from Vancouver, WA condemns Lewis for not getting it because he assumes that anyone who disagrees with his leftist ideology is empty-headed. His mindless repitition of Marxist ideology -- that moral systems are the mere fronts for political powers -- shows he's the one who hasn't understood Lewis. The Vancouver, WA leftist's statement that Lewis is merely defending &quot;western&quot; morals is absurd to the point of questioning whether he actually read the book -- or whether he's capable of really reading anything that isn't pre-committed to his Marxist politics. Indeed, the Vancouver leftist demonstrates that he's one of those men without chests about whom Lewis is writing while the fundamentalist from Campsville shows why modern conservative Christianity -- so frigthened of innovative communication -- has been so impotent, even though it holds the solution to the cultural problem Lewis diagnoses if only it could get over its reactionary anti-intellectualism and rigidity of mind that the reviewer exemplifies."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Attack on the idea of universal truth and the values that derive from it is stronger now than in 1944 when this book was written. Yet, despite many rhetorical defenses of universal truth and values launched in the &quot;culture wars,&quot; this remains one of, if not the best, defenses of universal truth and values.Lewis believes in Natural Laws - laws of morality, such as duty to children, parents, elders, the &quot;golden rule,&quot; mercy, magnanimity, justice - which have been accepted both throughout history and by varied cultures. Lewis calls these laws &quot;the Tao.&quot;The problem as Lewis outlines it, is that if nothing is self-evident (i.e., true), then nothing can be proven. And, if nothing is obligatory because it is self-evident, then nothing is obligatory for its own sake, i.e., because it is true. If nothing is obligatory, then rules of conduct are subject to pleasure or whim and are enforced only by power of some over others. Ultimately, this robs of us our humanity. Lewis says, &quot;A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery.&quot;The consequence of rejecting the idea of universal truth, or &quot;the Tao,&quot; is the destruction of the society which rejects it. This is, as Lewis says, tragically comical because &quot;we continue to clamour for those very qualities we are rendering impossible.&quot;"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"In this short book, CS Lewis takes public education for his subject, though the scope of the work goes well into the philosophical and ethical realms. The master Christian apologist is here arguing against what he sees to be the evils of moral relativism. His essay \\"Men Without Chests,\\" reminiscent of TS Eliot, speaks of just what would happen if we were to lose all sense of good and bad, and chose instead to attempt to see everything in a purely \`objective' way, without regard for what has been established as right and wrong.The rest of the book develops and plays upon this idea, and Lewis examines the possibilities of a civilization who abandons \\"The Tao\\" (the name Lewis gives to a widely accepted system of moral values) and tries instead to mold its citizens into whatever form its leaders should decide. Of course, this is exactly what Lewis warns again in his Science Fiction novel That Hideous Strength, and what is also seen in the book 1984.To me, the highlight of this book was the appendix. Superbly compiled, it is Lewis's definition of \\"The Tao,\\" and features a number of moral values (such as one's obligation to society and duty to parents). The best part of this, though, is that Lewis quotes from an enormous range of sources, citing everything from Plato to Beowulf to the Bible to Egyptian writings to show that these are values which have been widely accepted throughout history. This is his basis for calling \\"The Tao\\" the ultimate system of moral values, and his justification through widespread acceptance is very good indeed.I believe this is one of CS Lewis's best works, full of inspirational thoughts on morality and warnings against using Science to make man a part of \`Nature' and losing all respect for man as a Divine Creation. His book God in the Dock goes along well with this one--many of the essays in that book coincide nicely with those in this one. Once again, CS Lewis has proven himself a master of putting things in a way everyone can understand."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The Abolition of Man is a series of lectures wherein C.S. Lewis debunks the debunkers of virtue and values. Pulling no punches, Lewis successfully charts their \\"belief system\\" from beginning to bankruptcy. They suppose that the value of a thing is only what we perceive it to be, thus there is no true good, there is no true bad. Nothing is truly of value. Though written decades ago, we see traces of this in our non-judgemental society, in our lowering of expectations, in the race to dumb everything down, make everything equal, where nothing is inherently bad and nothing, it seems, inherently good.Beyond the fact that, by their own definition, this nihilistic approach has no intrinsic value but what we perceive it to have, we find that the successive devaluation of everything leads to the value of nothing - including ourselves. And this, Lewis has it, is the abolition of Man. We may see evidence of this abolition in many current debates to include euthanasia, abortion, gender selection/eugenics, and embryo farming. When we have no value, but what we perceive, then there may be hell to pay when those perceptions change. Auschwitz is a remarkable example. Bioethicists with the ethics of swine are another.As usual, C.S. Lewis slings well-honed arrows that hit their mark with ease. What Lewis provides best is clarity such as very few writers can. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book shows Lewis at his best and at his worst. At his best, he is a sharp social critic, a lucid expositor, and a man with an uncanny ability to get right down to the heart of the spiritual perplexities and self-deceptions that vex us in our daily lives, and open them up to the light of reason. I'm one of many people who owe a deep debt to this man, and I revere him as much as any one of the 5-star reviewers here.But Lewis, as a writer, had serious faults as well. Though he was a generous reader, he was not a generous arguer: his idea of a good argument was to seize upon some poor schmo who epitomized some (then) current silliness and beat him senseless (with wonderfully powerful, clear, simple prose.) The spectacle is always fun, but it sometimes feels like watching Muhammed Ali boxing Peewee Herman -- you've always wanted to see it, but you have an uneasy feeling that what you're watching is not real boxing.So to read this book properly, you need to understand two things. First, it is not a work of academic philosophy, and it won't stand up as such. That is to say, Lewis did not go out and look for the primary exponents of moral relativism of his time and wrestle them to the ground. He doesn't \\"survey the literature.\\" He doesn't take on the important relativist philosophers. Instead he seizes this poor anonymous English textbook-writer by the collar and thrashes him soundly, and then goes on to pile up a sort of \\"everyone says so, so it must be true\\" defense of traditional moralities. Academic philosophers will no doubt recoil from this book in horror. It is not their sort of book, and it doesn't play by their rules.Lewis is speaking to a different audience, and he has a different goal in mind. He's not speaking to people who have read lots of difficult philosophy: he's speaking to people who have picked up little bits of fashionable modernist dicta and have fashioned a pseudo-philosophy out of them. He wants to demolish -- not serious, reasoned relativism, but popular, stupid relativism. The person who says that \\"Einstein proved all things are relative, so there can't be any such thing as absolute right or wrong\\" -- that's the person Lewis wanted to drop on the mat. And he succeeds in that brilliantly.The second thing you need to understand, to read this book properly, is that it is attempting to recreate some of Lewis's own journey out of relativism. And here we get to another of Lewis's faults: he wrote too fast. His pile of examples of universal morality could be mistaken for an attempt to prove that there are universal moral principles and all thoughtful moral people have always known it and stuck to them. As such, it would stand as one of the shoddiest jobs of argument ever presented. But that's not really what he's up to, though he really ought to have explained what he was doing more carefully. What he is doing is presenting, in a few pages, the experience he himself had of years of voracious reading in various traditions -- the experience of discovering that the surprising thing about the moral principles of various civilizations is not how various they are, but how similar they are. It's not an argument, really: it's just a distillation of experience.Which is why to point out glaring omissions (where is Buddhism? What about Wittgenstein? What about the 19th-Century and the Modern theologians?) is to miss the point of this book. If you want to go find the real arguments, go read the philosophers -- you'll find that many of the serious philosophical questions about the nature of morality were not addressed, let alone settled, in this book. This book is, in fact -- though Lewis would have hated the idea -- an extremely personal one. In it you can see Lewis recreating his own progress out of nihilism and relativism. And for those whose early paths resemble his, this book can be -- as I can testify -- wonderfully illuminating, even liberating.So don't take this book for what it is not -- a philosophical treatise, or a definitive answer to relativism. Instead, take it what it is -- a popular answer to popular \\"philosophy,\\" and a report on how one man worked his way out of some of his own foolishness by clear thinking and wide reading. Lewis chose in this book to engage people where they actually live, rather than where they wish they lived: he knew that the philosophies we actually live by are much cruder than those carefully thought out and argued by professional philosophers."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book will not be easy for everyone, but it will be rewarding to engage with it, even if you disagree with Lewis' thinking. The series of lectures known as _The Abolition of Man_ (TAoM), which are presented here as essays, are not intended to be thorough or in-depth refutations of the positions which Lewis takes issue with. So people who complain that he doesn't successfully refute things like emotivism in this work are right - but he didn't intend to launch into that in depth. These lectures were meant to paint a portrait, to explore a perspective, and to breathe a few whispers of supporting argumentation within the space afforded. Judge his work according to what he intended to accomplish by it, and don't knock it simply because you demand more - or less - from it than what he expected to offer by it.Many people seem to think that Lewis' is arguing, in the first section, against \\"Moral Relativism\\" (MR). While MR is an aspect of what Lewis is here concerned with, it is not what he directly addresses. Morality, popularly used, merely refers to \\"rules for behavior,\\" whereas what Lewis is talking about is not directly behavior, nor rules for it, although there are behavioral implications to what he is talking about.What he _does_ address is the problem evidenced in the grammar textbook he quotes from, that students are being taught to think of their own sentiments/value judgments as 'merely' their own emotions having nothing to do with the objects or events upon which they are passing judgment. Once, he says, you teach a student in one instance to sunder their evaluation of a thing from the thing itself (i.e., to teach that when I say that a waterfall is sublime, I'm not saying anything about the waterfall, but only about my own emotions: I'm really saying \\"I am having sublime feelings,\\" not \\"the waterfall is such that the most proper response from me is to feel that it is sublime\\"), the result is that you train the student to snap any perceived link of the correspondence between their sentiments/value judgments and the world. Lewis is claiming that there are qualities intrinsic to objects and events themselves that ought to call forth proper responses in us. Furthermore, he claims that the correspondence between our sentiments/value judgments are more or less true by virtue of their conformity to an Order that roots reality, and Order which, in relation to proper sentiments/value judgments, we perceive intuitively and kinesthetically, if at all (he calls this Order \\"the Tao\\" for convenience, and demonstrates that ancient civilized cultures were quite familiar with such an experience and understanding of the world). This Tao is what we try to articulate in all of our moral principles (our moral principles, therefore, may be provisional - if we discover that the Tao is better articulated by a competing principle, we are not abandoning the Tao by discarding our old principle to embrace the one we have just come across. We are simply claiming, then, that our older principle was an inferior articulation of the Tao, and thus corresponded less perfectly with it). This is a much subtler point than what I understand many to have in mind when they rail against MR.The final section of the book was an interesting and haunting perspective on where Lewis sees these new habits can lead if left unchecked. For any interesting related reads on education, morality and such, feel free to fire me off suggestions and/or to pick my brain, if you think it's worth picking."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

In doing so Lewis was at least 30 years ahead of his time: his answer to the question of whether ethics could possibly be the product of evolutionary forces, a current hotspot in philosophy, has been reformulated and perhaps improved upon but not yet challenged. And while his book is a tour de force on the necessity of believing in objective truth, his question about whether empirical research is inevitably &quot;a basilisk that kills what it sees and only sees by killing&quot; has been echoed over and over by constructionist philosophers of science in recent years.You may not be persuaded by Lewis's arguments, but you will certainly be intrigued by the questions he raises."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

After reading the book, I don't know if I can honestly agree with many of the other reviewers. I have read two other books by C.S. Lewis, &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; and, &quot;The Screwtape Letters,&quot; so I think I have some idea what his approach is. I can only hope that I am failing to grasp his ideas or that I am misunderstanding him.Definitions: moral relativism: The position that there are no moral absolutes, no moral right and wrongs. The philosophical position that all points of view are equally valid and that all truth is relative to the individual.moral objectivism/absolutism: The position that there are universally binding moral principles that apply to all persons, at all places and at all times.The book discusses the consequences of moral relativism and shows the difficulty of replacing absolute ethics with relative ones. However, I don't come away from the book thinking, &quot;All right. I know how I can show moral relativism is false in a debate. I now know how to defend absolute ethics against objections.&quot; Perhaps this simply was not the objective of the book.The first essay (it was originally a lecture) titled, \\"Men Without Chests,\\" was probably the best in my opinion. Lewis examined a common elementary level school English textbook and looked at the philosophy that it taught. The implication of the wording and the subtle way in which relativism was communicated is prophetic. This same analysis could no doubt be applied to our current trends of political correctness.In his essay titled, \\"The Tao,\\" Lewis provides much argument to show that a moral system cannot be based on instincts. However, much of his argument seems to reduce to: moral objectivism is axiomatic. He argues that there are simply moral first principles, analogous to the three laws of logic, which cannot be denied. However, I think there are many people who would deny that moral objectivism is self-evident. If I were a moral relativist, I would hardly be convinced by Lewis' arguments here.The last section is titled, \\"Illustrations of the Tao.\\" Lewis calls natural law or moral objectivism the Tao. This section simply provides excerpts from different books around the world (e.g. ancient Egyptian, ancient Chinese, Roman and Jewish) to show the universality of certain ethics.I would have liked a book that looked at the founders of moral relativism and their opponents. Then, a point-by-point analysis of their position followed by some examples of how moral relativism fails. I would much prefer the rigorous argumentation of Dr. William Lane Craig to this. I just honestly think that relativism is false but this book does not show that fact. I am going to read and review, &quot;Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air,&quot; by Francis J.

Bearing the subtitle \\"Reflections on Education with Special Reference to the Teaching of English in the Upper Forms of Schools\\", it begins with a rather humorous critique of an English textbook. From there, with Lewis' disagreements with the suppositions set forth, itbecomes an examination of values, with particular emphasis on how these values are learned/taught.This may not be a treatise for everyone. Lewis does not purport to be a historical scholar or even a philosopher, and infuses his message with his belief in Natural Law, or the Tao as he calls it. He arguesthat any supposedly new belief actually stems from an older one; it is merely revised for a new generation. The problem arises when one tries to refute these basic suppositions and go against the Natural Law.\\"The Abolition of Man\\" is a quick sketch of how Natural Law plays a role in every aspect of our lives, and in the various religions that abound in the world. It is an examination of how masking opinion asphilosophy can limit instruction and undermine education."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book has been recently described as not being about general education, but ('rather') about broad politics, religion and philosophy.It is quite true that politics and philosophy (not religion, though) are central topics of the book. However, Lewis' point in these three lectures (delivered to educators and collected for this book) is that general education often _does_ involve tacit and very powerful philosophical presuppositions that have a direct and practical bearing on politics--and religion, for what it's worth. The 'religious' angle can be easily inferred from TAoM, but Lewis specifically avers from hanging any such weight on his argument. A close read of what he does, will show that Lewis doesn't even argue in favor of the existence of an objective moral standard. He does argue (and powerfully, I think) that the belief in such a standard is a necessity for a healthy society (with healthier individuals)--but that is not the same as arguing for the existence of such a standard. (Lewis restricts any argument in that direction to the simple inclusion of an appendix that illustrates some commonality of ethical principles across society. Even here, he doesn't try to hang much philosophical or religious weight on such commonalities, though. Personally, I am sorry that Lewis never devoted full attention to a rigorous examination of the theistic Argument from Morality. Possibly, this was because he believed it wouldn't serve properly as a primary argument (his use of the AfM in _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_ seems to indicate this). However, it would be misleading to market TAoM as the AfM we might wish Lewis to have written. At best, it can only serve as a tantalizing glimpse, perhaps an opening set of chapters, for such a work.)As for what this all has to do with public education: Lewis clearly demonstrates in his first lecture, that _other_ people, who _had been_ writing schoolbooks on literature, had already been advancing the philosophy of ethical relativism (perhaps without quite realizing it, as Lewis allows); indeed, in some cases (as he ironically notes) the ostensible 'lesson' in critical appreciation of English literature consisted really of nothing else than training in philosophical relativism. This was already the situation within the British educational system; Lewis (as a respected professor of English literature) is calling attention to the fact, and (as a philosopher) is calling attention to the logical implications. At many different levels, they are implications still worth considering, today.This, btw, is why Lewis does not report the names of the three authors and two books which he chooses for his examples: he isn't sure whether they consciously intended to make the points he is deriving from them, and doesn't want to vilify them publicly (he says as much on the first pages). Originally he was speaking to other assembled educators who would presumably be familiar with the books in question; thus keeping it 'in the family'. Lewis quite obviously has no problem whatsoever naming names and quoting specific sources, when he believes the scholars he is quoting consciously meant the notions he is attacking. Dr. I. A. Richards (whom he has a healthy respect for in other regards) and Dr. C. H. Waddington are both quoted, and their positions criticized, in this fashion. 'Gaius', 'Titius' and 'Orbilius' are presented as examples of a principle, not as scholars writing with authority (like Richards and Waddington) on the subject in question.It is true that Lewis speculates, on several levels, about what the intentions of the pseudo-3 might be. But this is legitimate insofar as he is presenting examples of a type, not presenting individuals. This, again, is why he chose to present them pseudonymously; he does not speculate similarly about Richards or Waddington (nor does he present them pseudonymously--this shows he is, as he claims, trying to protect the pseudo-3, while still making use of the examples.)...P>Much of the bulk of the book ... is devoted to a response to 'serious emotivism'. Nor is Lewis utterly negative about the subject: he specially emphasizes the necessary value of trained emotions, even over against a merely intellectual grasp of ethics (better, he says, to play cards against an ethical sceptic raised to believe 'a gentleman doesn't cheat',than to play against an irreproachable moral philosopher raised among cardsharps! |g|) What he does stress, however, is that emotions are not ethical justifications, nor a substitute for them. Put more shortly, he argues that a person's emotions should be based upon his ethics, and not his ethics upon his emotions. (And he distinguishes this from arguing that ethics are _not_ only a representation of our emotions.)"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

As moral philosophy (of the realist-objectivist school), via ancient literature, it is unusual and original. It is certainly not a work of theology. Confucius, Hindu 'Laws of Manu', and ancient Babylonians are quoted on a par with the Old and New Testament. (Catholics may sail through; but antinominianists will struggle against a non-theist exposition of the universal Law. In this case take Rom. ch. 1-3, and a bracing meditation on the concept of General Revelation as a tonic.)Although its terseness makes it unsuitable for beginners, it would be possible to work up to it; either via Lewis's 'Mere Christianity', Book I, and Book III, parts 1-5 (a total of about 40 pages); and then the two essays from his book 'Christian Reflections', entitled 'On Ethics' and 'The Poison of Subjectivism' (total 25 pages).

Read the 'Republic', Bks. 1-4 until mastered.The dogs of war are unleashed in the next 6 pages, from the paragraph opening:'Until quite modern times all teachers and even all menbelieved the universe to be such that certain emotional reactionson our part could be either congruous or incongruous to it...'We then race through Coleridge and Shelley's 'just' and 'ordinate' reaction to beauty in Nature; Augustine's on 'virtue as ordo amoris, the ordinate condition of the affections'; Aristotle and Plato on education (beauty and ethics); Rta and satya in early Hinduism; Tao (pronounced \\"Dao\\") in the Analects; and the Law (of the Lord) of the Hebrews. [Compare ancient Egyptian Maat.]. This is the universal 'doctrine of objective value'. To not know it is to invite the separation of fact and value, as all sentiments (emotional habits) are made purely subjective and even non-rational. Plato's tripartite model of Man: the Rational element rules the Appetites via the Sentiments (Spirited Element): 'The head rules the belly through the chest...The Chest--Magnanimity-- Sentiment--these are the indispensable liaison officers between cerebral man and visceral man. It may even be said that by this middle element that man is man: for by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal.' To deny this model is to produce Men Without Chests.Chapter 2: The WayEven Subjectivists have objective values. The fact that they act at all, even to propagate their own point of view, proves that they hold some real values. Calling values 'progressive' is subterfuge: progressing to what, and why? Modern ideologies isolate an element of morality, exaggerate its importance, and suppress others. Eg, communist States supposedly feed everyone fairly-but crush individuality, freedom, truth, and creativity if it helps.We cannot get a moral basis for human action from reasoning with facts alone--no deducing an 'ought' from an 'is'. This does not debunk moral reasoning: it merely proves that there must be Moral Axioms to start from, as there axioms in logic. Plato and the Stoics called this basic morality Natural Law, the other cultures by their synonyms. Lewis chooses the term the 'Tao' for brevity and neutrality. Scientific objections: morality is Instinct--but if two instincts clash how will you know which to obey? There is no Master instinct. The great civilizations all agree in this: so much for sociological relativism. Moral progress within the tradition of the Tao is possible: Paul the Pharisee, 'perfect as touching the Law', yet he saw its limits.Chapter 3: The Abolition of ManThe 'Brave New World' scenario: if we cede final and total socio-psychological control to technocrat master-politicians even the few at the top will have to act according to some moral principles. But they also must be the ultimate Supermen, incapable of making mistakes, and guaranteeing happiness for the brainwashed ant-minions: '...the magician's bargain: to give up our soul, get power in return.' But to give up your soul is to lose yourself. And so losing free will in society results in the Abolition of Man.Appendix: Illustrations of the TaoSelect quotations on the basic morality of ancient Babylon, Egypt, Israel, Greece, Rome, India, Anglo-Saxon, etc.1.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Though best-known as a Christian apologist, Lewis' Abolition of Man has an appeal to an audience outside of Judeo-Christianity as well as within.Lewis takes on those who want to rewrite morality, and for that matter, master and change human nature (hence the title). The various movements for this have changed names and some details, but from David Hume to modern-day sociolobiologists and Peter Singer, we can see a continuity of people who want to proclaim a new moral order (but at the cost of of some aspect of our humanity).Lewis neatly dissects these would-be revolutionaries and show how any attempt to rewrite human nature must occur within the context of Nature and natural law, and that the new morals that these revolutionaries proclaim are in fact distorted, mutilated echoes of what Lewis dubs the Tao, which is a common morality written in human nature and shared by all the great faiths, philosophies and cultures. In the appendix, Lewis has selections from the great sagas, scriptures and philosophers showing how the Taoist, Confucian, Greco-Roman, Old Norse, Hindu, American Indian, and Judeo-Christian cultures all have a common morality, and while Lewis allows that these ways of life are not identical, they do point to some natural set of laws which humans should follow.The end result is a beautiful critique of moral relativism and the more dehumanizing philosophers and pundits of modern times. In the 1-2 hours it took to go through this book (though I look forward to returning to it and pondering some parts of the book further), this has become one of my favorite Lewis books."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Lewis' condemnation of public education's relativism is desperately needed is today's culture. By condemning public education's abandonment of objective truth, Lewis clearly paints a picure of the world we will have as a result, specifically the world in which we live today.Through a series of three essays Lewis shows that when we lose objective truth and force everything into subjectivity we effectively destory any basis for reason. Right and wrong become illusions. Ultimatly, we will destory ourselves from the inside out. This speaks volumes about the current condition of our culture. In a world were disagreement in considered oppression and anything that opposes my personal morality is considered politically incorrect, Lewis is &quot;a voice crying out in the wilderness.&quot; How long will it take before we see that Lewis was right and our politically correct subjectivity will finally make us a people incapable of thinking anything at all?"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

He goes on to explain that values only work if they are expansions of past values, because human values are all traced back to the primordial Tao. Not every example he makes works. For example, he mentions Nietzsche's morality as an innovation without grounds, when, first of all, Nietzsche DID NOT ADVOCATE MASTER MORALITY, but rather encouraged personal morality; and Nietzsche's ideas all have solid ground in ancient Greek philosophy.

In fact he employs his alacrity with the other schools of religious thought to better make his points. Its focus is on subtle turns of phrases employed in school texts that diminish and undermine the the man's unique ability to impute quality of character, nobility, and beauty to objects and events. One chapter called Men Without Chests is a phrase that will haunt you time and again as you think back on this book when discussing why things seem better than ever in the world today... yet people feel more shallow and empty and don't know why. The book discusses how man is teaching away his humanity. It is inspired by a simple line quoted from a school text book about a waterfall. At first it is difficult to see what C.S.

Subtitled \\"Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools\\", Lewis uses an elementary English text to illustrate the insinuation of moral relativism to all levels of modern society. The first essay contemplates our society filling young minds with knowledge but leaving out all sense of objective truth or value - we produce \\"Men Without Chests\\". \\"You can hardly open a periodical without coming across the statement that what our civilization needs is more 'drive', or dynamism, or self-sacrifice, or 'creativity'.

When the last frontier is man's own nature, the successful conquest will be man's abolition.

It begins from a mere germ of an idea, inferred from an unchallenged source, and then slowly balloons until it is a diatribe against eugenics, modern education, moral relativism, egoism, secularism, scientism, Nietzche, Darwin, and Jeremy Bentham.It's a rather audacious trajectory, and would be ludicrous if it weren't so... accurate. As the saying goes: \\"I'm not paranoid if they're really out to get me.\\" Lewis makes some bold statements here, extrapolating from a relatively subtle implication in a textbook to a metaphysical humanist conspiracy. But Lewis understands Natural Law, and understand the penalties of disobedience. Consequently, the picture he paints of the evolutionary abolition of anything recognizably human in man is disturbing and all too believable.Anyone familiar with today's college campus, or today's journalist, will realize the total victory of relativism (unless, of course, he is a relativist). Conditional eugenics, so thoroughly disgraced by the Nazis and the New Deal, is replaced by Genetic eugenics, praised and lauded ala the human genome project.

Lewis here does battle with such lapses in critical thinking, assuming, as did his Greek predecessor, the objective existence of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and offering instances of the recurrent Natural Law drawn from many cultures.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"In this brief but excellent philosophical work, Lewis addresses the issue of moral relativism. He begins by evaluating the ideologies implicit in a few examples of English textbooks used in the schools at his time. He shows how these ideologies do not belong in the textbooks because of their falsity and potential to creep into the thinking of the students who use them. Lewis discusses with convincing logic that there is such a thing as objective truth/values, and that this is universally inherent to humanity. He uses the word \\"Tao\\" to collectively refer to these values, and elaborates on his intended meaning on pg. 28 of the Third Printing. He states,\\"This thing which I have called for convenience the Tao, and which others may call Natural Law or Traditional Morality or the First Principles of Practical Reason or the First Platitudes, is not one among a series of possible systems of value. it is the sole source of all value judgements. If it is rejected, all value is rejected. If any value is retained, it is retained. The effort to refute it and raise a new system of value in its place is self-contradictory.\\"The appendix of the book shows a list of possible examples of this natural law, and how it extends across religion and culture. This agrees with the Christian belief that there is a natural order/law established by God and written on the hearts of all humanity (see Jeremiah 31:33, Romans 2:14-15, Hebrews 10:16).The third chapter of the book offers a startling insight into the progress of science towards \\"conquering nature.\\" Lewis shows how in the abscence of the natural law or a foundational set of morals, humankind will have found that it's supposed power over nature is really nothing but a certain amount of tyranny over other humans. I think a modern illustration of Lewis' point is the inaccesibility of vaccines and simple medical treatments in third world countries. Altogether \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is an excellent work that can be appreciated and enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"C.S. Lewis pulls no punches in this book, \\"The Abolition of Man\\". Since I disagree with Lewis on virtually everything (I'm a feminist, for starters), reading this book was a real guilty pleasure. And why not? Lewis has always been the thinking atheist-agnostic-seeker's favourite Christian apologist. And writer in general, too. My favourite? \\"The Great Divorce\\".Lewis is, of course, right that there is an objectively valid morality, which he for some reason chooses to call Tao. (A Catholic would presumably call it \\"natural law\\".) He believes that the Tao cannot be derived within the narrow confines of a materialist worldview. At least by implication, he also rejects the evolutionary explanation for morality. Instead, the Tao must be based on something transcendental.I believe Jack was on to something here. Evolution might explain why certain behaviours have evolved, but it cannot justify them morally. After all, behaviour we consider immoral is also a product of evolution. Indeed, they seem to go together. As Frank de Waal points out in his books on chimpanzees: only a creature with empathy can be consciously malicious, precisely because it knows exactly how the victim will feel. So what makes empathy \\"moral\\" and malice \\"immoral\\"? The difficulty of justifying morality within a materialist worldview was the primary reason why I eventually abandoned materialism. Another, of course, is the sheer existential impossibility of upholding a consistent nihilist or relativist view (those who claim to do so, are either psychos...or not really being consistent). Today, I'm a seeker.The main problem with \\"The Abolition of Man\\" in the opinion of even sympathetic readers is Lewis' \\"fideist\\" view of the Tao. He believes that the Tao cannot really be justified from a neutral ground. You are either within it or outside it. Only those who have the Tao, can understand the Tao. Is this a subconscious influence from G.E. Moore? Or is it connected to Jack's strong emphasis on obedience and hierarchy within the faith and the Church? It seems the Tao can only be grasped in some intuitive fashion, and those who for whatever reason cannot do so, are beyond the pale from the outset. Something tells me Kantian or Aristotelian philosophers will take strong exception to this. Will Korsgaard and MacIntyre please stand up?I readily admit that I have a certain sympathy for the old man on this question, as well. Perhaps the solution to Eutyphro's dilemma is to simply tell Socrates to shut up! Somewhere, there has to be a first principle, something that cannot be questioned without logical or existential problems and contradictions. Perhaps it's the Tao. Perhaps it's some principle over and above the Tao. However, it's still a first principle, and as such can only be grasped in an intuitive way.Does this solve all our moral conundrums? Obviously not, and even Lewis admits that much, since he agrees that *some* development and progress is possible even within the Tao, although it must somehow be based on the Tao itself. Again, I tend to agree. Why is Lewis' hopelessly patriarchal view of women wrong, immoral even? Because some tribe somewhere is matriarchal, or because some lizards in Texas are, dare I say it, lesbian? Well, no. The real reason is surely that patriarchal hierarchy collides with other principles within the Tao, such as \\"Do unto others\\" etc.\\"The Abolition of Man\\" is not just a treatise on morality. It also deals with other issues: aesthetics, public education, the real or perceived evils of social engineering, etc. I came to think of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" when reading the concluding, title essay. Unfortunately, Lewis was prophetic in the same way as Huxley's seemingly bizarre novel, which was written even earlier. There is also a famous reference to Goethe and Dr. Steiner in this text, a reference no doubt influenced by Owen Barfield, Lewis' friend, solicitor and on-off philosophical adversary, who was an Anthroposophist (although, as a good Englishman, more into Coleridge than Goethe). Barfield loved \\"The Abolition of Man\\", despite the obvious differences between his ideas and those of Lewis, which to me shows that Jack hit the nail squarely on the head with this one.I haven't seen this edition (the one with the dog on the front cover), but my copy of this work contains the following appreciative blurb by Barfield: \\"There may be a piece of contemporary writing in which precision of thought, liveliness of expression and depth of meaning unite with the same felicity, but I have not come across it\\".Indeed, my main objection to the edition of \\"The Abolition of Man\\" with the dog on the front cover, is that it somehow insults dogkind, something not even the anti-pantheist Lewis would have dreamt of doing. What Lewis feared was not really that we would be turned into animals by the despotic social engineering of the World Controllers. What he feared was a world of robots ruled by devils. With AI, cloning of human babies, moral relativism, and an establishment more and more out of control, I share that fear. However, I suspect that what we will really get is not a bizarre version of the Roman Empire, but rather an even bloodier version of the fall of Rome. Even more bizarrely, I somehow prefer that option to a totalitarian world state! It can hardly be denied that \\"science\\" and \\"progress\\", untempered by morality, are evil.With that, I end my reflections on C.S. Lewis for the time being.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"If this work seems unoriginal to some, it is so in the same way that Shakespeare seems trite in his use of English: Lewis could see exactly where modern education, in its abandonment of objective truths and natural law, was heading. Well into the 21st century, we are now living with the results of that abandonment.Viewing everything through the lens of political correctness and equal outcomes, and by chopping those who achieve down to size, our political leaders are governing precisely as they were educated. They will continue to pinch, tuck and mold man so that he is in *their* image, and no longer in the image of the Creator; no longer bound by what Lewis calls the Tao - the law instilled in man from the beginning.The two most telling quotes from this work:\\"We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise.

Out of all Lewis' works, this is probably the most unsettling."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Through addressing two of his contemporaries by means of a reflection on \`education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools', former chair of Renaissance English at the University of Cambridge, C.S. Lewis, moves on to undermine the dehumanizing presuppositions of the intellectuals of his day. By tackling what he nicknames The Green Book (henceforth, TGB, a work purporting to teach English \`theory') Lewis questions and seeks to predict the effects of the debunking of sentiments in the name of a new rationality which castrates emotions a priori.He proposes, instead, that traditional values common across time and cultures should be considered as the definitive reality. Although a Christian, Lewis does not argue for Theism: \\"I am simply arguing that if we are to have values at all we must accept the ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason as having ultimate validity\\" (49). His aim is to expose the futility of not treating the Natural Law, the Tao, as the \\"greatest thing\\" (18). After refusing biological instincts as the final grounds for virtue, Lewis calls his audience to recover the \`doctrine of objective value'. If deconstructed or not taken seriously, a truncate Tao will ultimately lead to the abolition of man: the abandoning of that which uniquely constitutes us as humans.Lewis' work is a collection of three sufficiently interlaced lectures. \`Men Without Chests' starts off with a critical exposure of the consequences of a rationality that downplays predicates of value; \`The Way' picks upon such theme and, in light of the Tao, questions the philosophical foundations of those who regard values as mere sentiments; and \`The Abolition of Man', finally, reveals how man in its rejection of value and its aim to conquer the nature ends up being drained of meaning and becoming a slave of the very thing he sets himself to defeat. The book ends with an Appendix of literature illustrating the Natural Law.Chapter One asserts that predicates of value are meaningful in that they involve both emotions and the external object they refer to. Lewis suggests that TGB is an over-reaction against emotionalist propaganda, leading its authors into a sort of emotional solipsism. He labels the educators as \`Conditioners' and critiques them for removing all sentiments from the chest, and instead insisting to convey virtues like justice and valour upon pupils on the basis of \`rational or biological' grounds. Although less inhuman than the propaganda TGB reacts to, for Lewis this is not less disastrous. Stretching back to Aristotle, Augustine, Plato, the Jews, early Hinduism, and the Chinese Tao, Lewis displays a historical continuum seeking to demonstrate that things have inherent value irrespective of subjective perceptions. Thus he insists that the role of the educator is to train his apprentices to perceive such worth. Emotions, therefore, are reasonable when they are in tune with the Tao. Accordingly, in opposition to TGB's tendency to produce men without chests through affirming that all sentiments are non-rational mirages (e.g. dying for one's country is mere biological instinct), Lewis calls for heads that rule the belly thought the chest. By removing the organ which organizes emotions into \`stable sentiments', one is left either with mere brains, or mere guts. It is the heart which makes us human.Chapter Two expounds on the destructive consequences of such education as a means to outflank the philosophy undergirding TGB. Lewis debunks the debunkers by questioning their basis for affirming anything as \`good'. He takes the example of a man who sacrifices himself for the survival of a community and asks the \`Innovators' on what ground, if sentiments and values are stripped off, do they praise such act? Lewis demonstrates that outside the Tao there is no such ground: both alternatives (sacrificing, or refuting to) are neither rational nor irrational. Thus if not in \`Reason', the Innovators might point to \`Instinct' as the final criterion of what is \`good'. Yet in obeying Instinct the Innovators reason circularly, and thus Lewis asks them \\"why such praise for those who have submitted to the inevitable?\\" (34). There is always a \\"value judgment passed upon the instinct and therefore not derivable from it\\" (37). \`Why and on what basis should one Instinct be obeyed or subordinated to others?' Questions like these reveal an Innovators' ethic made after their own want: outside the axiomatic essence of the Tao such ethic lacks a rule of precedence. In effect, it is blind prejudice and convenience which undergird the Innovator's agenda.However, after arguing that all ideologies have the Tao as their only source, Lewis admits that one might also reject the concept of value all together--and instead of the self-contradiction such as TGB's--decide for oneself what it means to be human and make man into that. Chapter Three develops the implications.The Innovators view eugenics, education, and applied psychology as the roads to the final victory where, exercising its power to emancipate itself from tradition, \\"Human nature will . . . surrender to Man\\" (59). Yet Lewis ends by showing that in submitting to such mastering, the Conditioners (as he also calls them) are unaware of ultimately being governed by \`Nature'--the very thing they set themselves to master. If men become autonomous to produce conscience and decide new values for themselves by seeing traditional ones as mere natural phenomena to be overcome, they will cease to be under the mystery of humanity which over-arches them. In stepping outside the Tao, men step into the void of being subject to the emotional strength of their own (irrational) instincts. Hence they go back to being mere \`trousered apes': \`eunuchs' lacking meaning who arbitrarily choose what is good based on their likes and preferences--and conditioning others to live likewise.Hereafter, Lewis leads his readers into a crossroad: either humans are rational spirit obliged to obey the Tao; or they mere nature to be made into the image of the Conditioners' strongest impulses. Thus he argues that a \\"dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery\\" (73). Additionally, he upholds science without giving it the power to wash off our humanness by suggesting a Natural Philosophy conscious that the \`natural object' produced by analysis is not reality but a view. His proposes an epistemology where \`the explained' is not \`explained away': knowledge should be pursued, yet \\"at a lower cost than that of life\\" (79)--lest man is abolished.Lewis demonstrated his thesis very imaginatively. In a book that seeks to discredit the incongruity of the debunkers, both through his sharp sense of irony and his sarcastic wit Lewis achieved his goal as he outflanked his enemies with the enemies' own weapons. Although the reader is left alone to make some connections between the three lectures (e.g. the relationship between Gaius & Titius, the Innovators, and the Conditioners) the outworking of the Tao motif is the common thread that binds them together.Probably unknown to today's common folk, I found Lewis' referral to particular characters/literary works (e.g. Brer Rabit, Olaf Stapledon, Dr. Steiner) and especially his repeated use of idioms as the only two things that might throw the common reader off. However, he is able to expound what could be an abstract discussion in a lively manner, with the great strength of inviting the reader to acknowledge the unconscious nonsense he most likely finds herself part of.Furthermore, today we witness a society that reflects Lewis' predictions. Written 67 years ago, its prophetic character makes its worth self-evident. Anyone interested in subverting the pervasively dehumanizing \`totalitolerance' of our day should take this book seriously.As a son of a Nietzschean atheist, I found Lewis' thesis very compelling in helping me deal with some objections my father has posed upon me regarding metaphysics and morality. His creative illustrations on the Tao (branches/tree, primary colors, etc.) and his appeal to different traditional moralities seem particularly relevant for my circumstances as I feel called to serve right-brained, pluralistic, Gen-Y individuals at a level of presuppositional apologetics.Nevertheless, being right-brained myself, I felt Lewis erring on the argumentative side, and ignoring circumstantial contexts in which ethical decisions are made. I know atheists that give up universal morality and on a practical level are content to live under relativistic ethics. Thus I wonder how this book can effectively challenge a narcissistic our era of metaphysical skepticism."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Lewis looks at the religons of the past and present and shows that \\"natural law\\" has been known through every known civilization. If one looks at all the faiths that are out there, they all teach this \\"natural law\\" but express some combination of tithing, sacrifice, piligramage, or whatever with little towards atonement. Only Christianity says: \\"It is by grace that we are saved.\\" (Romans 1:17) Salvation is not earned and C.S. Lewis shows the incompletion of the other faiths.Although the first chapter is about a childen's text book and the errors made by english professors of the 1930's, this book is a great look into the oldest three faiths, (Old Norse, Tao, and the Eygptian Book of the Dead) and modern ones like Hindu and Native American.Enjoy"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The Abolition of Man is a series of essays detailing how the deterioration of modern education and communication has led to individuals and communities being uprooted from the moral groundings that have been consistent among cultures for thousands of years. Lewis argues that many men have become \\"men without chests,\\" that is men who have no moral core and act only to the greatest advantage at any one point.With man being \\"abolished\\", or losing his soul, men and mankind are being reduced to creatures lower than animals, with not even consistent laws and instincts. Lewis believes that any society that accepts what contemporary society teaches in its schools and communication outlets will die.Lewis begins the work by critiquing a textbook that would have been common to many in Britain in the educated classes during the mid 20th century. He then builds this specific example to talk about common moral laws among all people throughout the world. Finally, Lewis argues that the pretentious claims of man against the world (and by proxy against God) ultimately do not make claims against God or nature, but do nothing more than allow man to turn on himself.Lewis illustrated the world's common morality by defining all the common moral encouragements and discouragements under the term Tao. While the traditional term has been natural law, Lewis expands his definition of moral laws generally acknowledged to be true because he wishes to expand natural law to its farthest possible point by including all laws from all peoples around the world.After beginning with a simple textbook review, Lewis to takes on one of the largest tasks anyone could possibly take on, that of calling for objective reality in a world that refuses to believe in t and prefers an increasingly narrow set of subjective thoughts and actions. Lewis is convinced that some men, in claim of defeating nature, actually redefine nature for other men (even at the smallest level between friends) and for those that redefine nature, morality becomes \\"I want\\" rather than \\"I should\\".Probably no other book that Lewis wrote had such a direct appeal to the secular world. The Abolition of Man is an early call against post-modernism before it became evident in the popular culture (by use of the textbooks that Lewis read). Totalitarianism, divorce culture, business ethics, bioethics, government entitlements, and much of popular music today are beholden to contemporary thought which has even rejected the claims of the Enlightenment's Modernism. Man, starting from himself, in hopes of finding solutions to the world and how to live within it has collapsed on himself in actions that are manipulative and deceitful to himself and others. Lewis is attempting to get modern man to understand the futility of abject amorality before he even begins to argue for theism or even the redemptive claims of Christ. The Abolition of Man is a work of preevangelism for a postmodern world.For the modern church, these essays speak words of encouragement and warning. The church in the present world is encouraged that they do hold words of ultimate reality that stand beyond instinct or mere knowledge education. As a word of warning, this book tells the modern church that it lives in a culture of subjective truth, and should respond accordingly, when it points towards objectivity."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"As far as I can see, there were two main cornerstones in Lewis' thinking:(1) The ultimate validity of Reason, perhaps best summed up in his essay \\"De Futilitate\\": \\"Unless all that we take to be knowledge is an illusion, we must hold that in thinking we are not reading rationality into an irrational universe but responding to a rationality with which the universe has always been saturated.\\"(2) The ultimately objective nature of morality, also known as Natural Law and in this book called the \\"Tao.\\"The \\"Abolition of Man\\" brings both of these aspects together in the most compact manner of all of Lewis' writings. It is so compact that most readers will likely want to read the (very short) book more than once, so as to really get what Lewis is saying.Readers should be aware that this is not another \\"Mere Christianity,\\" which was first written as a radio broadcast and addressed to the general public; \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is addressed to an academic audience, and without a certain academic level one is likely going to feel pretty lost in the \\"Abolition.\\"The POINT of the \\"Abolition,\\" however, is a similar one as that of the opening chapters of \\"Mere Christianity\\": that there is an overarching moral understanding of humanity, and if you abolish this overarching morality - the \\"Tao\\" - then you abolish humanity itself, because our human identity is inexorably linked to it.In the \\"Abolition,\\" C. S. Lewis does not go as far as to say that Natural Law depends on a Supernatural Lawgiver, but for him, that is clearly the next step in the argument, and is perhaps the direction into which he wants to nudge his academic audience.I have enjoyed this book more than once, and have been particularly grateful for the appendix, in which Lewis lists a whole row of quotes on morality by various cultures, in order to show that there is such a thing as a Moral Absolute. I have used his selection of quotes more than once in my own lectures.Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C. S.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"C. S. Lewis uses logic to emphasis the importance of natural law. He argues for absolute, objective, external morality. He highlights the dangers of relativism. He argues that science, taken to its logical conclusion does not give humans victory over nature, but allows humanity's natural urges to control the species' destiny.I found Lewis' use of logic to be refreshing. Today's discussions are so regulated by law, culture, and political correctness that we have virtually lost the art of no holds barred debates using pure logic. Logic has become associated with intolerance, and without our even realizing it.Having given Lewis kudos for his logic, I question the conclusions at which he arrives. In 1943 it must have seemed like the world was in a pitched battle for survival and science was the key to it. If science continued to rule human culture, his logic might carry more weight. However, I am not sure that Lewis (in this book anyway) foresaw the worldwide decline of atheism (both in percentage and actual numbers), or the rise of New Age Religion and the intermingling of world religions. Many of his ideas still have an eerie truth about them, but Natural Law (Tao as he calls it) has not been neglected. It is as central to people's search for truth as it ever was, perhaps even more so. Tolerance is in vogue today, but relativism is not as strong. They are not the same.Nor can Natural Law lose. IF natural law is not external, but cultural, then it already does not exist. Lewis' progression IS natural. IF, however, natural law (or Tao) descibes an intrinsic understanding of morality that comes from an external source (God) it cannot lose. Humans who fail to recognize the significance lose and the period when morality is temporarily forgotten is nothing more than a momentary blip in time.A word of warning. Logic is difficult for people to digest today.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote this book in 1944, but he could have written it yesterday. In this little gem, C.S. Lewis sees through the modern world view right to the core of where it goes wrong. Most writers would need several hundred pages to explain how modernity differs from the pre-modern world view; and another several hundred pages to explain the dangers of modernity. C.S. Lewis manages it in under one hundred pages. And he even makes it fun.In a nutshell, his book is on the dangers of moral relativism, a concern which we hear much about these days. Less often do we hear the critiques which he brings to bear on the technological mindset that wants to subject nature to our own whims. The punch line is that when all is said and done, our whims can only come from nature (if we refuse to acknowledge some external source of value.) If all there is in the world is nature, then nature must inevitably win.Virtually every page offers a fresh insight into our modern-day foibles.

I feel I must approach the Master with great humility, for his style and thoughts are so much clearer than my own. What right have I to critique him?I'll do it anyway.This would be an excellent introductory book to a class on religions. Lewis displays a convincing argument for the existence of morality, using resources from many different traditions, not just his own Christian one. He is to be commended however for also stating his own tradition, that we might know his biases. (The only flaw is a lack of Islamic sources, perhaps because Lewis tended to know less about that particular religion than others.) It is hard to walk away from the book still convinced that there are no ethics, or that an aethitical system is possible.Those who have read other Lewis works will see echoes here, such as the essay On First Things from God in the Dock, That Hideous Strength, and the Magician's Nephew. Lewis uses his knowledge of literature to show us that morality is necessary if we are to speak realistically at all; that an amoral system of ethics is by nature moral; and that one absent of any morality at all is reduced simply to animal instincts. In this last unit, he preaches of the fear that science will reduce humanity into mere object, rather than into a glorious creation. In no way is this anti-scientific diatribe- but rather cautionary tale of the dangers of excess, if we continue in our current vein of thought.A couple flaws bring the book down. Early on, he takes a swipe at pacifism by implying that there is something wrong with those who argue that men are more righteous if they value peace over war. Happily, this is only momentary. And secondly, he consistently uses the word \\"man\\". Lewis is a product of his times, yes, but he also strongly argued against inclusive language or women in the pulpit, and his language reflects this. And so the book's title. As well as the use of the term \\"redskin\\" when referring to ancient Native American beliefs at the end of the book.Lewis is at his best when demolishing arguments, using the arguments of his opponents. He does this with tact and compassion, not even mentioning the opponents by name, and constantly complimenting on what they have said- but not being afraid to point out the great tragedy that would result if students of a particular \\"Little Green Book\\" were to take the authors seriously. If followed, we would lose something deep within us, the capacity to have passion, and enjoy life, out of which morality springs. For following the guidelines of the Little Green Book, we would no longer be able to say something was good in and of itself, but only that it felt good, as everything is now subjective.But there is an alternative, the Tao, the Way, which we find in all cultures everywhere, and in all religious traditions. The morality, as Lewis has said many times before in many other places, is basically the same in all religious systems; there is only the smallest of differences between them. And this morality is the guiding principle, or can be, or should be, for us all. It is inherent in our . . . very nature."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"If it be in fact true that the Scriptures are the only source of knowledge &amp; truth about all things, why then did the reader from Campbell, California even contemplate reading this book by C S Lewis? You won't find any knowledge or truth in C S Lewis, because C S Lewis is not Scripture.There are some Scriptural admonitions that seem relevant at the moment, most notably Exodus 20:16 and Ecclesiastes 5:3. And if we're thinking of sending any C S Lewis books to persons who are either incapable of understanding them, or eager for whatever reason to misrepresent what is found therein, we may just be in violation of Matthew 7:6.C S Lewis does not claim equality between all religions; he claims, however, that there is sufficient similarity in the various creeds' understanding of the moral law as to make the moral law universally binding. He chose the name of Tao to describe the moral law, because it is (unless we are mistaken) a Chinese word meaning &quot;the Way.&quot; Lewis was fully conscious of Christ's declaration &quot;I am the Way&quot; and never exhibited -- in this work, or in any other -- the slightest sign of disagreeing with that. He was no syncretist; he was no Taoist; he was no secular humanist; and he was no trousered ape incapable of understanding plain English!"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I'm a fan of Lewis, both his fiction and his nonfiction. But I think in this work he was focused too heavily on operating within his secular vocation as an educator. I think he does a good job of explaining what things are NOT the objective source of morals (for example, \\"From the statement about psychological fact 'I have an impulse to do so and so' we cannot by any ingenuity derive the practical principle 'I ought to obey the impulse'.\\") but he doesn't go as far as stating what IS to be our source, which I found puzzling since the existence of such objectivity (referred to throughout as \\"the Tao\\") was so central to his argument. The closest he comes is in the inclusion of an appendix listing prohibitions and commandments from various moral codes (the Code of Hammurabi, the Torah, et al), and displaying commands which the various codes have in common. However, these codes contradict in other commandments, and as he notes, commonality would not prove their objective value anyway. So what IS to be our source? I think he should have made a case for all we know about morality being revealed to us in the Bible. He comes close in places, but I think it's overall a sadly confused and muddled window into the topic."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Unless we teach our children that waterfalls are sublime, civilization is doomed and tyrants will reign. That's the argument in a nutshell. The waterfall's sublimity represents to Professor Lewis the \\"doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false....\\" (29) He maintains that a \\"dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery.\\" (84-85)(Page cites are to an earlier printing of this book.)Lewis calls his collection of objective values the Tao. He finds the Tao in such varied sources as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a hymn to the Babylonian sun-god, the sayings of Confucius, Old Norse poems, Greek philosophy, Roman law, Hindu proverbs, and the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The Tao is \\"the sole source of all value judgments.\\" (56)Lewis' game-plan to save civilization is all offense and no defense. Though he marshals strong arguments against modern subjectivist thought (our postmodernism), he claims that the Tao is beyond questioning. Regarding challenges to traditional morality based on objective values, he writes, \\"The direct frontal attack 'Why?'- 'What good does it do?' - 'Who said so?' is never permissible; not because it is harsh or offensive but because no values at all can justify themselves on that level.\\" (60-61)An open mind is not allowed when it comes to the Tao, and those who question it are demonized. Lewis writes: \\"An open mind about the ultimate foundations ... is idiocy.\\" (60) Those who stand outside the Tao are \\"corrupted\\" men. (59) They have nothing important to say and, in fact, should not be heard at all. According to Lewis: \\"If a man's mind is open on these things let his mouth at least be shut. He can say nothing to the purpose. Outside the Tao there is no ground for criticizing either the Tao or anything else.\\" (60)Lewis' Tao has two serious flaws. First, as a doctrine of objective value it is internally incoherent, that is, it incorporates logical contradictions. Second, the Tao is ultimately derived from subjective experience and, consequently, its claimed objectivity is an illusion.As the Tao is a compilation from conflicting cultures past and present, it contains many contradictions and even absurdities. Lewis admits this and calls for \\"some criticism, some removal of contradictions, even some real development...\\" (57) Remember, this is supposed to be \\"objective truth\\" we are talking about. Evidently, there is a higher truth by which the objective truth of the Tao may be corrected. At this point, Lewis abandons reason altogether and resorts to mysticism. Lewis indicates that higher truth is found in the spirit realm but only by adepts in the Tao: \\"Those who understand the spirit of the Tao and who have been led by that spirit can modify it in directions which that spirit itself demands. Only they can know what those directions are. The outsider knows nothing about the matter.\\" (59)The Tao is not nearly as objective as the 5-star reviews make it out to be. Lewis himself admits that it is filled with contradictions and even absurdities. He is content to have the Tao ultimately determined by a clique of mystics who can not be questioned. A doubtful source for objective truth if ever there was. This book is not the answer to postmodernism as many claim. For a superior response to postmodernism that appeals to reason and does not depend on the mystical intuitions of an inner circle for objective truth, I recommend Francis Schaeffer's trilogy:Escape from Reason (Ivp Classics),The God Who Is There, andHe Is There and He Is Not Silent"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"C.S. Lewis is a very fine writer, but I believe many of his conclusions in this book are wrong. Certainly it would be nice if some absolute scale of values and ethics existed. It would also be nice if human life meant something on a cosmic scale. It would make things a lot simpler. Unfortunately, just because something would be nice doesn't mean that it is true. However, just because these things are not true does NOT mean that human beings can have no ethics and must be miserable, as Lewis believes. I am an atheist myself. I personally find that life is good. I enjoy behaving well and trying to improve the lives of other people. Having to bring in some outside tao or being to decide for me what is good and right strikes me as intellectual laziness. It's like saying that my life would only have meaning if Carl decides that it should have meaning. Why should I should I rely on anyone else to tell me what meaning my life has?As to why human beings generally desire to behave ethically and to help one another, evolution strikes me as a perfectly adequate explanation. Imagine a group of humans in which parents did not care for children, or in which anyone felt free to murder anyone for any reason. Such a group would die out very swiftly. On the other hand, a group of humans whose morality did not include the possibility of killing enemies in battle is equally likely to be eliminated. Ethics is more situational than Lewis would like to believe. Is it wrong to kill a deformed infant? What if that infant would probably die anyway in a few days? What if the costs involved in saving the infant could be used to save thousands of others? What if the community is starving and that infant would put it over the brink and wipe it out entirely? What if the community is not starving now but would starve if the population doubled? The fate of the inhabitants of Easter Island, who destroyed the resources their society depended on and wiped themselves out, is sobering. The complexities of human behavior and society are not easily reduced to a few simple rules.Lewis is of course correct that traditional morality should not be discarded lightly. Traditional morality evolved for a purpose in many cases. We should keep in mind, though, that circumstances change. Many tenets of traditional morality originate in the need to ensure the survival of as many children as possible in a day when keeping any children alive was tough. Today the enormous increase of human population is overshooting the capacity of the earth. This threatens the survival of all people alive today, not to mention our descendants. In my opinion, one of the main problems with traditional morality is not what it includes, but what it fails to include--like a concern for population stability."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

The entire book is reminiscent of the time when Lewis called himself an atheist because he was &quot;mad at God for not existing.&quot; (One cannot be angry at something in which one does not believe-such a thought is illogical. Should I be mad at the Bogeyman for scaring me as a child?) The author tries to lump all philosophies together in one all-encompassing Tao, and then proceeds to remark, with some amount of amazement, that the Tao cannot be rejected. This is yet another example of Lewis's flawed logic. He makes philosophy an all-or-nothing choice. One can either accept all philosophies as being valid by accepting the Tao, or one can reject all of them. There seem to be no in-betweens with Mr. Lewis.Lewis seems to have a fascination with worst case scenarios. He unfortunately failed to realize that his armageddon will in all probability be avoided. He failed to recognize the critical flaws in his theory of the Tao. He saw the worst that man could endure, but he failed to see the best that man could create.

As different as Eastern philosophy (Chinese and Indian) may be from Western philosophy (Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian), all seriously reasoned and internally consistent systems of ethics (i.e., morality) accept the true existence of an absolute Good. In The Abolition of Man, C.S. Lewis, a thinker deeply versed in philosophy, philology, and ancient literature, calls this universal ethical reference system 'the Tao' (borrowing a generalization from Confucius). He exposes the logical self-contradictions and the human negation of modern dogmas of moral relativism.From 'Men without Chests': \\"The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defense against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of [students] we only make them easier prey to the propagandist ... a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.\\"From 'The Way': \\"An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man's mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut.\\"From 'The Abolition of Man': \\"It is not that [propagandists of ethical relativism] are bad men. They are not men at all. Stepping outside of the Tao, they have stepped into the void. Nor are their subjects necessarily unhappy men. They are not men at all: they are artifacts. Man's final conquest has proven to be the abolition of Man.\\"We accept relativism in modern physics because reason has led us to it. But popularized ideas of relativism in ethics, while sometimes transparently parading as 'intellectualism' (this label attempts to discourage critical examination), must take a course which leads far from consistent logic, and which ultimately turns against itself.

His work provides a depth of understanding on the topic that is still unmatched after all these years. And what is truly refreshing is his manner of instruction, not condescending and preachy but as a concerned uncle sharing his observations with the next generation. We can listen, or we can reject, but we cannot ignore his concern that we might be grabbing for what seems attractive now at the expense of something priceless. He asks us to think without giving us the answer - letting us discover that for ourselves. Modern authors attempting to convey this message can learn from that example - that it is the still small voice rather than the clanging cymbals and pounding pulpits that give us pause to think. It is a difficult subject for any writer, and I think it may be impossible for any of us to follow in Mr. Lewis' footsteps.

You see this idea manifested in the varous Varsity and JV Columbine-style shootings that are now en vogue.Chapte Two discusses this set of moral laws or traditional values, which Lewis calls &quot;the Tao.&quot; The Tao is the source of all value judgements and is the source of &quot;traditional morality.&quot; When people try to change this morality, they are destroying all sense of right and wrong. &quot;The human mind hs no more power of inventing an new [moral] value than of imagining a new primary color.&quot; (p. 56) We need this absolute set of moral laws to survive.Chapter Three discusses the result of not having any absolute values: what happens is that rightness and wrongness is reduced to appetites, &quot;the emotional strength of [the] impuse&quot; (p.57). These is no law, just rampant and renegade emotions controlling everything. There is no sense of fairness, just a &quot;might makes right&quot; law of the jungle, a la Korihor.The one appendix contains illustrations of this moral law from differing civilizations. Memebrs of the Church of Jesus Christ would see the Light of Christ behind all of this.This is a pressing book, and should be read with &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World,&quot; &quot;People of the Lie,&quot; and &quot;Slouching Towards Gomorrah&quot; in mind.Three cheers for C. S. Lewis!"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"In this terse discussion about ethics, specifically how education develops man's sense of morality, Lewis argues that there are indeed objective values, denying the relativistic viewpoint of those who postulate that all values are fictional creations from the subjective mind of mankind. He also convincingly demonstrates how those who educate the young inevitably influence students' views on the matter by the very language used in their schoolbooks. Far from being an abstruse topic that has little bearing on our every day lives, subjective relativism has long term adverse consequences for members of society who come under its influence. Given wide enough application, it could ultimately destroy mankind. The appendix to THE ABOLITON OF MAN is quite helpful, listing examples of common values held by people of many different societies and cultures, pointing to an objective law, or &quot;Tao&quot;. It does indeed show that there is a desire for a way of life that is better and more just, for mercy and kindness, which is seen in the different cultures around the globe. If there were not divine law and objective values, then we humans would be - as the animals seem to be - satisfied with any 'ole way of living. This book is just a bit dense in spots (which is why I rate it with a 9 instead of 10), but still readable and quite peritinent to today's western society. For related material in a little less left brained presentation, see Lewis's THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH or MERE CHRISTIANITY."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Lewis' message, laid out with brevity and clarity, is a bold stand which needs to be taken today just as much as it was needed in his day. Primarily, the text is a beginning for considerations against rationalistic, relativistic morality. In particular, he asserts that any attempt at morality without acknowledging intrinsic natures is either a farce or a destructive achievement which ultimately ends in the abolition of man.Lewis first discusses the problem of the supposed \\"intellectuals\\" who desire to strip sentiment from judgments, relegating all sentiments to the realm of subjective, meaningless feeling. Particularly, he assails those who teach such a philosophy under the guise of other subjects. In particular, he uses literary criticism as such an example subject. I will not present the wholeness of the argument in this review. However, the end of the argument is that such a philosophy is not \\"intellectual\\" as much as it is \\"spiritless\\" or \\"heartless\\".Lewis follows this discussion up with an argument on the nature of intrinsic morality. Astutely, he points out that when one attempts to purport a \\"spiritless\\" morality, a given system of values is presupposed on some level. Specifically, he considers the case of instinct-based morality and how it still must presuppose some kind of ordering if it is to have any meaning. Ultimately, he supports the necessity for Practical Reason if there is to be any morality with a foundation.Following this up, he finally reflects on the possible scenario of Man attempting to \\"conquer\\" nature by his own conquest of the future. In the ongoing process of \\"naturalizing\\" all things which are supernatural, man ultimately becomes subject to nature. By submitting only to baseless instincts, man's conquest of nature is actually man's conquest of other men by genetic engineering and social indoctrination. However, this conquest itself is subject to nature, therefore making Man's ultimate conquest an act of being conquered. For Lewis, this is perhaps the ultimate danger of an attempt at baseless morality.Following this all up, he makes a list of Natural Reason as found throughout the thought of the world, East, West, North, and South. While this is only a brief overview, it attests to the fact that there has always been a movement of the human mind toward an ultimate set of values which stands on its own, intrinsically right.I thoroughly suggest this book for all. It is a bit dense but not overly difficult. It is an excellent beginning to reflections on the subject of intrinsic morality and spirited action."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"As with many of C.S. Lewis' works, this one is both accessible and powerful. The fundamental argument of the book is that sloppy thinking about how morality works has left culture in a state of moral relativism. His argument focuses on a kind of emotivist morality in which moral assertions are reduced from truth-bearing propositions to mere reflections of the speaker's feelings. So a statement like, \\"murder is wrong\\" is reduced to \\"I feel murder is wrong\\" and thus its universal applicability is reduced to a single individual. Lewis then proceeds to deftly argue against such subjectivism and list for the reader examples of how human cultures through the ages have agreed on fundamental moral realities.In an age fraught with moral relativism, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

The academic minded reader who has neither the time nor patience for fiction or allegory will find a concise treatment covering most of Lewis' core thinking. Lewis fans of a less intellectual bent may find this an excellent introduction to the academic disciplines. Here are all the same concepts introduced in Lewis' children's books and science fiction but rendered for the Oxford crowd. Being familiar with the concepts you may find the process of translation much more manageable than you have found with other scholarly texts. Of course the basic problems of critical thinking and moral responsibility are as timeless as ever. With a careful reading I believe you will find more challenging questions than pat answers."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"A timely and prophetic defense of the authority of moral absolutes. (Prophetic not in the sense of foreseeing the future -- though a little of that too -- but of boldly speaking unpopular truths to a culture that sorely needs to hear them.) Just a few months ago Francis Fukuyama actually used the phrase &quot;abolition of man&quot; in a positive way to describe the effect of upcoming advances in genetic engineering and computer technology on the human race. God save us from ourselves.The Puget Sound reader who, in an otherwise cogent critique, complained that Lewis' use of the word &quot;Tao&quot; to describe traditional morality is &quot;presumptuous,&quot; couldn't be more wrong. The word's original non-metaphorical meaning (road or path) was first expanded by Confucius (not Lao Zi), who used it in precisely that sense. (&quot;Our Master's Tao is simply this: conscientiousness and consideration.&quot;) In Lao Zi, though some passages can be interpretted as antinomian (if you favor letter over spirit), I think that as with Jesus, it was not goodness Lao Zi meant to rebuke, but people who think they can legislate it. Indeed, the history of Taoism nicely illustrates Lewis' thesis about the universality of the moral code. By the end of the second century, mainstream Daoism was interpreting Lao Zi's attack on moral rules to mean you need to follow the right rules. By the Fifth Century lists of sins appear that could have been written by a Southern Baptist preacher with Sierra Club leanings: &quot;The sin to throw food or drink into fresh water. . . to eat by yourself when among a group. . . to abort children or harm the unborn . . to be nasty to beggars. . . to worship ghosts and spirits.&quot; (!) Yes, there are differences, as Lewis admitted, yet the similiarities are not &quot;superficial,&quot; but show morality is universal truth rather than an arbitrary convention.How great is the danger Lewis writes of? I am not sure. But certainly this remains a timely warning against relativism, a reductionist approach to man and to nature, and all the sordid machinations of realpoliticians and social engineers around the world. My only serious complaint is the book too short. ...."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"If you are a parent, and worry about the decline of the quality of education in today's society, you must read &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;. Written 50 years ago, and eerily prophetic, CS Lewis railed against the dumbing down of education in the British school systems, from an academic standpoint, but more importantly, from the standpoint of morality and values.As is evidenced in his other non-fiction (Mere Christianity, for example) Lewis was a believer in the doctrine of Natural Law (held by Catholics and many Protestants). This doctrine recognizes that since man was created in the image of God, traces of that image still remains. The Fall of Man severely damaged the image of God in man, but did not totally destroy it. Thus, throughout human history, integral values systems still maintain cetain laws, customs, beliefs, etc. which cross beyond religious and philosophical boundaries, and are, for the most part, common to all.This is an example of Natural Law at work -- and this is precisely what the secular education structures, both in Lewis' day, and even more so today, wish to utterly destroy, and replace with the nonsensical notion of a society in which there is no foundational morality; no foundational &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. Lewis saw it happening half a century ago -- and people did not listen. The case is even more grave today.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I just finished reading this book for the fifth time; it is quickly becoming my favorite. Lewis traces how mankind will by means of poor education, faulty logic, and scientific/technological advances ultimately destroy itself, though certainly not in an apocalyptic fashion.Lewis details how an improper education denies mankind that which makes us human, our virtue, our \\"Chests.\\" By our heads we are mere intellect and spirit, and by our bodies we are mere animal and appetite; but where these two meet, the chest, is where we find our humanity.\\"The Tao,\\" which Lewis attributes an entire chapter to, is the undeniable universal laws govern and have always governed the lives of all humans (he offers evidence of the Tao from nearly every ancient religion/moral code at the end of the book). The Tao offers us the transparent window or lens with which we are able to experience this world. Those who try to step outside the Tao to criticize it, like those who accuse morality as being the construct of a power-hungry priestly ascetic caste (sound like Nietzsche?)and insist that the burden of proof lie with the accused (morality), speak utter nonsense. Thinkers like Marx and Nietzsche (whose philosophy was so paradoxical it drove him insane, he renounced all philosophy before him, including the ancient Greeks, and used logic to disprove logic), who reject the Tao, reject humanity. (I do no justice to Lewis's arguments; read the book.)From this point we examine how mankind's conquest of Nature is really only the conquest of some men by other men. We are like the magician who surrenders more and more to Nature in return for power until he surrenders himself. We believe we are progressing, becoming more powerful, but we are not. We fail to factor in time to our equations, and fail to forsee its consequences. For example we are able to control posterity by means of contraceptives and abortion, something man has been unable to do in all of history, until now. We do not understand our own limits. We build too high on too shallow of a foundation, and our own building comes crashing down upon us.Like Marx's notion that elements within bourgeoisie society are responsible for its destruction, Freud's notion that we all have a \\"death drive,\\" Nietzsche's idea of a \\"will to nothingness,\\" Derrida's wish to \\"transcend man and mankind,\\" and Binswanger's observation that the artists who transcend their own captivity are eventually going to experience a lethal fall, Lewis understands that, from his beginnings, Man has sought his own destruction. But before now we had not the means, the leaders, or the ignorance to go through with it."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"First of all, let me follow luminous79 in noting that these are *lectures*, speeches by a master of Socratic reasoning.Mr. Gross's review is so typical of the Left's criticisms. Lewis is condemned for being at once \\"low brow\\" and \\"egotistical.\\" Obviously, Gross notes that Lewis is \\"less\\" \\"egotistical\\" than Bennett or Dobson, but why is it that anyone who espouses traditional moarlity is proclaimed \\"egotistical\\" by the Left?What is more egotistical? To say that there is a transcendent, objective moral code to which we are all equally subject, or to say that one has the right, as an individual, to make up one's own moral standards?Gross also seems to imply duplicity in Lewis's \\"purported\\" focus on public education. However, this is also very typical of Socratic thought. How many of Plato's dialogues begin with some discussion that seems to have little connection ot the main purpose, but follow along a similar pattern?Lewis is primarily a literary scholar, and his study of literature was a major impetus in his conversion to Christianity. Therefore, many of Lewis's arguments begin on a kernel of either literary study or philosophy of education.The classic form for a philosophical system, as with Bacon and DeCartes, is to begin with a study of knowledge itself, then move into metaphysics and theology, and lastly into ethics and aesthetics. My philosophy thesis at the University of South Carolina was on how Lewis turns that process on its head, beginning with aesthetics.Lastly, I take issue with Gross's offhand, biased comments that \\"Men without CHests\\" is the \\"best\\" of the three essays, or that Lewis is \\"cranky\\" or \\"privileged.\\"First, either all three essays are equally good or none are. His statement is based entirely on his revulsion at the content of the second and third essays, when Lewis gets to the real heart of his argument.Secondly, there is nothing \\"crnaky\\" about the book at all; it is quite rational and, if anything, quite jovial. Or is it that Gross finds anyone opposed to artificial contraception to be \\"cranky\\"? Perhaps Mr. Gross should refer to the studies which show that couples using natural family planning are far happier than those who use birth control?Finally, \\"privilege\\" has nothing to do with morality. As the elitists in New York and Los Angeles are quite eager to point out, adherence to traditional values is quite often the province of the provinces, otherwise known as the \\"red states.\\"So, if you are actually open-minded about learning why people adhere to a theory of transcendent morality, please read this book. If you're a closed-minded liberal like Mr. Gross, it won't do you any good."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I am not a huge fan of Lewis' writing style, but he has a habit of dealing with important topics, and he typically does well in the handling of them. Lewis' objective in this book is to diagram a concern that we should all have: the unconscious removal and maligning of fundamental aspect of the human from the world. That is, the dehumanizing of the human. Lewis presents three lectures, in doing so. The first is to illustrate how we are approaching aesthetics in human experience in a way that minimizes value and removes meaning by misplacing it. Ultimately, this entails the embracing of philosophical assumptions that we might not even realize that we are accepting. Lewis' second lecture is on \\"the way,\\" which is intended to provide some sense of moral foundation and principles of practical living, but in a less than structured way. The goal is to push toward an objective foundation for reality. Finally, Lewis presents his thought that Man's control of Nature will ultimately mean the control of Man, in the sense of behavioral conditioning, eugenics, and so forth.I thought this book was intriguing and original, and it would probably be of interest to anyone who is a fan of, say, Sir Ken Robinson, Walker Percy, and Robert Pirsig. Lewis' little book is philosophical, but well within the grasp of the practical mind. However, I should warn potential readers that Lewis makes use of a large number of Greek and Latin terms, none of which does he define in the work.What makes this book exceptionally important is its relevance, today. Nearly every academic philosophical movement either places human perspective in jeopardy of dehumanization, or it is omitted altogether, leaving us with the difficult-to-manage task of figuring out man's place in the world. As Lewis demonstrates, this pops up in all sorts of mundane places, such as an innocent textbook for high school students. The phenomenon is felt by everyone, even if not consciously."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"\\"The Abolition of Man\\" is not a very large book. There are hundreds of other massive volumes one could select in order to defend objective moral values. But C.S. Lewis wrote like no other, and in this book he clearly spells out why objective moral values and traditional morality, or what he refers to as \\"The Tao\\" (The Way\\") must be protected from forces who wish to warp morality to suit their own devious purposes.Lewis begins by criticizing a text he refers to as \\"The Green Book\\" in which its authors have written in such a way that they will muddle the malleable and vulnerable minds of youth. This confusion will leave lasting impressions on the youth as they move into adulthood and it will make them incredibly skeptical about traditional morality.Lewis handily deconstructs the progressive ethicist's logic that one can find suitable grounds for a stable morality outside of the Tao. Using examples from ancient Egypt, China, the Vikings, Judaism and Christianity, among others, Lewis demonstrates how all these cultures maintain a uniform standard - children should be cherished, the old should be respected and cared for, thievery is immoral, etc...Lewis remarks that \\"The Innovator attacks traditional values (the Tao) in defence of what he at first supposes to be (in some special sense) \`rational' or \`biological' values. But as we have seen, all the values which he uses in attacking the Tao, and even claims to be a substituting for it, are themselves derived from the Tao\\" (p. 41). That is, progressives that fight vehemently against traditional morality have no independent grounds to do so because they base all their animosity and attacks against traditional morality on ideas taken from the Tao. Lewis also does well in rejecting the argument that \\"we are just animals so we should follow our impulses\\", noting that this is obviously not the way that the best society is maintained.The book is not theologically heavy, but Lewis insists that bare atheism alone isn't enough to create or justify a transcendental moral code like the Tao.In the closing section, Lewis remarks that science, when it was first used, was employed by \\"those whose love of truth exceeded their love of power\\" (p. 78). Lewis recognized science as a wondrous body of knowledge where humans could invent things to enhance human well-being, such as medicine, transportation and other forms of technology. But Lewis also realized that many progressive scientists attach with their science their own personal biases and dogma. Science itself is a neutral knowledge; water boils at this rate, photosynthesis occurs through this process. But with evolution especially, scientists and skeptics have attached anti-Christian and anti-traditional biases to this theory so that many feel like they must choose between one or the other. You needn't look farther than the Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris' of the world to see that this is plain fact. But as G.K. Chesterton wrote in his timeless classic \\"Orthodoxy\\", \\"If evolution simply means that a positive thing called an ape turned very slowly into a positive thing called a man, then it is stingless for the most orthodox; for a personal God might just as well do things slowly as quickly, especially if, like the Christian God, he was outside time\\" (p. 24). Chesterton, along with Lewis and many other influential Christian intellectuals, know that science is no threat to the faith, but that men who seek to overthrow God and morality manipulate a neutral knowledge to suit their own nefarious ends. Lewis expands upon this in fictional form in the excellent story \\"That Hideous Strength\\". With euthanasia and other issues clawing at the door of public discourse, it's apparent that all of what Lewis said is, sadly, coming true."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The Abolition of Man is a treaty on the importance of Natural law, --an objective truth or a moral code-- that transcends time and culture. Lewis refers to this as the Tao, a system of truth that is embedded in all cultures throughout history. It is not an American or British truth, or even a western one. There are objective truths that all recognize, whether they follow them or not. As he states, he does not like the company of children, but he recognizes that as a default in him, not in children. This is similar to the color-blind man; my inability to see color says something about me, not about the existence of color.When we stop teaching children to look for ideas and truths larger than themselves, \\"we have cut out of his soul, long before he is old enough to choose, the possibility of having certain experiences which thinkers of more authority than they have held to be generous, fruitful, and humane...That is their day's lesson in English, though of English they have learned nothing. Another little portion of the human heritage has been quietly taken from them before they were old enough to understand\\" (9). This vivisection causes society to produce \\"men without chests,\\" and we somehow are surprised when people behave poorly, criminally, or, even worse, immorally. As Lewis states, \\"we remove the organ and demand the function.\\"We avoid feelings and beliefs as contradictory to the mind, to nature, to science. We seek to conquer nature in the name of progress. However, \\"man's conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its consummation, to be Nature's conquest of Man\\" (68). It is interesting that these talks were given during World War II, at the time when Hitler and his cronies were focused on conquering nature via eugenics and other human experimentations. How, Lewis would ask, could you say that he was wrong if there is no overarching moral standard in which torturing humans and killing the innocent are counted as wrong? Conquering nature results in conquering ourselves. The abolition of Man.Lewis states that this book is not an argument for the existence of a theistic God, but I think it is a clear apologetic for one. How can we have moral laws and objective truths without a lawgiver and one who exists above the laws? While it is not a defense for a Christian God per se, it does point to a designer of a coherent and morally good universe.This is a difficult work in spite of its 81 pages, but well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Lewis begins his book with an anecdote from an elementary text-book that he calls The Green Book, written by two authors that he calls \\"Gaius\\" and \\"Titius,\\" who recount the story of Coleridge at the waterfall, where \\"there were two tourists present: ... one called it \`sublime' and the other \`pretty': and ... Coleridge mentally endorsed the first judgement and rejected the second with disgust.\\" Gaius and Titus comment that Coleridge actually was not making a statement about the waterfall, but rather, about his own feelings towards the waterfall. Lewis uses the distinction that this anecdote demonstrates between the inherent, unchanging qualities of a thing, as what Lewis would call the sublimity of the waterfall, and the view that the perception of such qualities by any person is nothing more than the subjective feelings of that person towards the object as a starting point to which he continually returns throughout the book.Lewis writes that \\"Until quite modern times all teachers and even all men believed the universe to be such that certain emotional reactions on our part could be either congruous or incongruous to it--believed, in fact, that objects did not merely receive, but could merit, our approval or disapproval, our reverence, or our contempt. The reason why Coleridge agreed with the tourist who called the cataract sublime and disagreed with the one who called it pretty was of course that he believed inanimate nature to be such that certain responses could be more \`just' or \`ordinate' or \`appropriate' to it than others.\\"It is the role of education to train students in recognizing and appreciating the just, the ordinate, and the appropriate. Lewis quotes Aristotle, who says that \\"the aim of education is to make the pupil like and dislike what he ought.\\" When students are trained in just sentiments, they are easily able to find first principles in ethics. Yet public schools have rejected moral education decades ago. Students will thus be left blind in discerning between ordinate and inordinate affections and between just and false sentiments.The role of the chest in this process of discernment is then discussed. Just as the head is the seat of reason, and the belly is the seat of visceral emotions, the chest is \\"the seat of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiments.\\" The chest is the will that subdues emotion to reason and turns out just sentiments that properly perceive what ought to be loved, appreciated, and admired. The problem of modern education, however, is that it churns out \\"Men without Chests\\" who lack the tools necessary to property discern goodness, truth, and beauty.Lewis discusses the Chinese concept of the Tao, which is the \\"reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar.\\" He dismisses the doctrine that no aesthetic theory can be superior to any other, as expressed in The Green Book. Lewis undermines this doctrine by pointing to a consistent canon of laws of human nature that have existed throughout history and across cultures. He calls this universal law \\"The Way.\\"The final chapter of the book has proven itself to be prophetic in some ways. In somewhat hysterical language, Lewis envisions a world that is run by technocrats and that has in the absence of moral absolutes opened the doors for gene manipulation and other developments in biotechnology. Lewis expresses concern at where moral relativism was going, specifically, that it would open the doors to eugenics by a future generation that would decide who man is and what he should look like. In this way, man will be robbed of his heart and essence.The book concludes with a compilation of texts that serve to illustrate the existence of a universal law common to all cultures. Among the values inherent in this universal law are: (i) the law of general beneficence; (ii) the law of special beneficence; (iii) duties to parents, elders, ancestors; (iv) duties to children and posterity; (iv) the law of justice; (vi) the law of good faith and veracity; (vii) the law of mercy; and (viii) the law of magnanimity."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Like many reviewers, I have seen a prophetic element to Lewis' apologetics in Abolition.He offers a deep insight into the nature of man, his ambitions as they relate to science & technology, the cumulative effect of moral relativism, and argues for the existence of an objective Moral Law. He builds his argument slowly on a seemingly unrelated subject - a children's English Language text - but cleverly uses this analogy to show the objectivity of the Moral Law and the slippery ground of moral relativism.Why the 'Abolition of Man'? Lewis notes that man's 'dominance over nature' is not at all as a species, but is only true for specific groups within the species - these groups define morality according to what is convenient to their purposes, and often to very destructive ends. Lewis envisioned a growing moral relativism that would allow for certain steps to be taken in science - like gene manipulation- and hence some future generation could effectively rob those to follow of their ability to 'be human'. In effect man will become what this 'master' generation decides it should be.One reviewer criticised this work 'as thinly veiled apologetics', I disagree - it is not veiled at all, nor was it meant to be. It quite pointedly, though with careful thought, deconstructs the idea that man is led purely by instinct as a creature of evolution (though he accepts evolution). Somehow Lewis reached forward to counter many of today's arguments against the existence of God, religion as a product of culture and an overarching 'Tao' or 'Natural Law'.He ends the book with a collection of teachings from a variety of cultures and beliefs (Babylonian, Egyptian, Chinese and Jewish amongst others) to illustrate the universality of specific moral standards like fidelity and obligation to the poor, children and parents among others. I only wish Lewis spent more time exploring more specific arguments against Moral Objectivism, but nonetheless he demonstrates why he is the Master Moralist."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Perhaps I will be able to resurrect this blog.Like Mere Christianity, this book is based on things he said orally, in this case a lecture. Lewis argued that the danger we face in society is a reductionistic Scientism which ends up turning Man himself into just another object of Nature and thus totally subsumed by it. Basicallly, the paradox is that as humanity increases in technological and scientific knowledge in order to gain mastery over Nature, it also gives up a little bit of its humanity as well until human beings themselves are considered only products of Nature to be shaped at the will of their Molders. He sees a Brave New World-type situation emerging if things don't turn around.All this stems from reducing objective statements like, \\"This flower is majestically beautiful,\\" to \\"He merely gets a happy feeling when he looks at the flower.\\" In other words, it is taking what is an objective statement about the reality of the flower and turning it to just a subjective feeling. This gets worse when applied to moral statements. The Moral Law or the Tao that all societies have known (but of course none has fully followed) is completely denied by the above debunkers of aesthetic statements. Certainly not compeletely denied since the debunkers have values themselves that they believe are exempt from the debunking process. But if reductionism has its way, it will be more difficult for these debunkers to protect the pieces of the Tao that they do believe in from the onslaught.This is a very short book but a very important one given our current state of conflict between various worldviews."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I've been reading many of Lewis' works lately and most have been related to Christian themes. Though this book could be considered Christian, in reality it is a general philosophical work discussing the fact that there are absolute truths recognized by all people and cultures.This essay starts out as a review of an English grammar book that uses examples of writing to say that illustrate that when a person is claiming something is sublime; that thing is not really sublime, but only the opinion of the speaker. This launches Lewis into his essay on the fact that some things really are good and not subjective. He makes a case that it is our responsibility to teach children that there is a difference between good and bad, beautiful and ugly, etc. He notes that children need to be taught universal truths; they don't necessarily come naturally.He uses the concept of the Tao, which are the universal moralities of almost all cultures. This universal Tao sounds a lot like what some call the conscience, or in LDS usage the Light of Christ.I strongly agree with Lewis that there are absolute truths out there, and one of our goals in life is to learn these truths. Any society that does not embrace these truths is in trouble.I highly recommend this essay. It got me thinking and again made me appreciate Lewis power of expressing profound truths."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Yet, what can we expect from C.S Lewis? sure we may not agree on everything he has to say, but boy, can he write.This book should be read for its insight, the reader then decides the merits of the arguments. But never have I said that Lewis didn't make me think a little more acutely. Just at an angle offset to the norm, its what he does here.You can read the book in one sitting. But to take it all in will require another read, and maybe just one more after that.Others have written much more accurate reviews, I will just use the man himself on my favourite part of the book, aptly titled \\"Men without chests\\".\\"You can hardly open a periodical without coming across the statement that what our civilization needs is more 'drive', or 'dynamism', or self sacrifice, or 'creativity'. In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst...We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful\\" (p.26)."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This fairly short book has three chapters. The first two are a thoughtful philosophical discussion of the fact that the basic facts about what is right and what is wrong are accessible to the reasoning mind---e.g. that honesty and courage are virtues.The third chapter at first struck me as strangely far too pessimistic, bordering on paranoia. But let us remember under what circumstances it was written. It was the early 1940s, and Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini were brutal dictators recognizing no human rights and bent on military conquest and enslavement of the world, and no one could be sure of the outcome. Radio was barely 20 years old and movies with sound had been around for less than 15 years, and both technologies were being used as propaganda tools to get people to worship one or another sort of Great Leader. The eugenics movement in Britain and the U.S.A. had seen some success in getting people considered mentally or otherwise deficient sterilized against their wills, without due process of law, by order of people in political office. Lewis feared that biologists would soon develop technologies of the sort now called \\"genetic engineering\\", but able to make people value what their designers thought they should value. Those designers would be a small number of people able thus to control billions of people.North Korea confirms that some of what Lewis feared is possible. As late as the beginning of 1989 few foresaw the fall of most of the communist totalitarian states.I am somewhat surprised that Lewis thought biology would develop in the way he feared. That one can make designer babies whose values were chosen by the designers seems implausible unless one excises most of their intelligence, so that they're like loyal house pets who can obey when told to \\"fetch\\" or \\"roll over\\". Lewis understood that intelligence enables people to understand values.The role of facebook in the Arab uprisings, and the fact that Wikipedia exists, show how mass communications technology can be liberating. Lewis can't be expected to have foreseen those developments, but because of them, we can be more optimistic than he could be."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"For those unfamiliar with postmodern philosophy, C.S. Lewis treads on interesting territory in showing its possible effects on education. The basis for this essay is an English textbook (\\"The Green Book\\") that is under review before publishing. The authors' (refered to as Gaius and Titius) first offense is the loss of innate value of words. The authors in question argue that one should refer to an object being \\"sublime\\" as a feeling of our choosing and not a description. Lewis takes issue with this, arguing that the words lose their value if we only boil them down to their description, i.e. something sublime is no longer actually sublime in-and-of itself. This might be a bit of an over reaction, as I'm sure most postmodern philosophers would continue to use these words in their original context; they just acknowledge their subjective use.The authors' second offense (and Lewis' second and third chapters) is what he believes is the inevitable: \\"the destruction of the society which accpets [postmodernism].\\" A popular idea of Lewis' is a universal set of values, or \\"Tao\\", which has ordered how we behave since the dawn of time. He argues for the shared values between most premodern societies as proof of real values and how subjectivity will bring about their downfall. The problem here, one might argue, is that this is 1) not provable and 2) the slippery-slope fallacy (which is quite a shock from Lewis for being so brilliant otherwise). The downfall of society fifty years post-publication of this work has not happened and likely will not from changing values. However, the strength of the book is addressing the potential dangers of postmodern thought, not its inevitable outcome. Lewis gives a clear warning to those who wish to change our perception of the world; nothing remains forever sacred in a world where we can create and discard our own meanings."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"\\"The result is not an argument but a harangue,\\" Inklings biographer Humphrey Carpenter avers in his book \\"The Inklings.\\" (222) Perhaps my four-star rating is the first clue that I disagree with the eminent British biographer's assessment of Lewis' \\"Abolition of Man.\\"It wasn't until my second reading that the book really took hold and the light of its conclusions became apparent. In a scant three chapters (81 pages) Lewis has accomplished quite a bit. To be fair to Mr. Carpenter's assessment, Lewis' entry into the discussion of morality does begin with a few remarks from a boys' grammar text. To the average onlooker, the meditations that follow may look like a soapbox, but this is far from true.By way of illustration, imagine that you go to the dentist and in the process of cleaning your teeth he pokes that little metal toothpick into a crack in one of your molars. The twinge of pain nearly blacks you out the first time this happens, and to be sure the crack is what he thought it was he probes it again. No doubt about it. In surmising that this is actually an open cavity, he gives you all of the gory details on what open cavities look like, and the entire experience is colored by the initial stab of pain you felt upon your dentist's discovery of the problem. I submit to you that this is what \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is like to those who read it. Lewis has tapped a nerve in modern society, our tendency to make moral vice and virtue a matter of subjective taste, and having probed a few instances of this assumption, offered a lengthy discourse on the dangers of such moral relativism. For many the result is a new crown that allows them to chew the food of culture more adeptly. For others, all that remains of the experience when the final page is read is the pain with no solution, and their reaction is seen in negative remarks.\\"Either you love it or you hate it,\\" the cliche goes. And it's true. To accept Lewis' conclusion is to accept the possibility that the conspiracy theorists may be closer to the truth than we'd like to believe. To deny it is to resign oneself to the ostrich approach, burying one's head in the sand of naivete.For a more powerful reading of this book, I would recommend reading it with a group, one chapter per week, and undertaking a group viewing of M.

The three chapters are the record of three lectures he delivered toward the end of WWII; there is an undercurrent of distress regarding a society's willingness to sacrifice its sons for its own ironic preservation. These lectures pre-date his more well-known works of 'mere Christianity' and thinly veiled allegory and fantasy, and his tone is scholarly and patient while trying to wade through some very thick philosophy. More than 3 stars for graduate student readers, but 3 stars for anyone hoping to find a clear direction for designing learning expriences that result in noble citizens with altruistic charcter. Screwtape Letters communicate the same theories in much more digestible form. Perhaps his multi-cultural references, finding superficial similarity in the spiritual works of many cultures and historic eras, must be considered very much ahead of the current era's hypersensitivity to eurocentric assumptions, but his use of 'the tao' as a generic term for traditional morality might be considered as presumptuous as the textbook he mercilessly skewers throughout the series.."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"There must be an end to explaining away and \\"seeing through\\" things. What good is a window if the garden and the street are transparent as well? In this short book, C. S. Lewis addresses the problem produced by modern education. Those who are educating the world's youth are stealing the foundation out from under the student in order to build a \\"better\\" structure. By eliminating what Lewis refers to as the \\"Tao,\\" many teachers have replaced the objective for the subjective without realizing it.Lewis, a confessing Theist, attempts to present a case for even those who do not share like convictions. One manner of doing this is by naming the natural law, or preassigned truth, to the \\"Tao.\\" There are parts of this natural law found throughout every civilization and culture, and he demonstrates this by presenting the reader with a selection of sayings from various people groups. This allows the reader to see a representation of the teaching of the \\"Tao\\" without questioning from where it ultimately comes. The purpose of the author is not to convince the reader from whence comes the \\"Tao\\" but rather to express the presence and necessity of it.In order to substantiate his argument for the abolition of man through modern education, Lewis interacts with two authors of his time who had written a popular educational book. He demonstrates to the reader through their example that the modern educators are treating the student as a poultry farmer conditions a bird rather than an adult bird trains a younger how to fly. The former knows not for what or how he is being conditioned therefore disabling him without his recognition. He is then prone to repeat this very procedure on others.Lewis not only criticizes the work of the current educators but he also posits a better way. He states that \\"the task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts\\" (24). His point is that the current trend in education at the time of writing was to disassemble one's belief system instead of fostering it's growth. The goal of the modernist is to educate the mind so that one is able to see the error in their beliefs. The focus of Lewis however is to stress the formation of the heart. He states \\"the head rules the belly through the chest...\\" (34). The ultimate outcome of the modernist movement is the paradox that \\"we laugh at honour and and are shocked to find traitors in our midst\\" (35), In essence, a generation of \\"men with chests.\\"Reading through \\"The Abolition of Man\\" one wonders how exactly Lewis understands the \\"Tao\\". Is the \\"Tao\\" the actually grid by which one must understand the world, or is the \\"Tao\\" the outcome of seeing the world through that grid. It is true that these ethical standards are found through cultures from all ages, however, from whence came these statements of good and evil? Is it simply natural? If there is a natural law then who would be the lawgiver? These are questions which the reader is left with following the presentation of Lewis. Obviously it was not the intent of the author to deal with all the factors concerning one's worldview, however one is left to wonder. Is it possible to understand that there is a higher law and actually leave the conversation there?If the \\"Tao\\" is actually the base from which the ethical statements found throughout the world are derived, one is left to question how one goes about teaching it. If the \\"Tao\\" is found in one's natural law or morality, does the student trust the nature of the teacher over his own nature? How did that teacher refine his own understanding of the natural law by which he has the right to teach it to others?Lewis in the later part of his book deals with those who attempt to reason faith away. He argues that although there is a benefit to the exploration and dissection of nature, it comes at a very high price. He contends that when something has been conquered we lose part of it (84-85). Often times that which is lost is its greatest part for an object is not the sum total of its components. As if we could have a man if we were to obtain all the necessary elements in a laboratory test tube. The whole is much greater than the individual parts.Where does the modernist take man? It takes him to a place where his heart has been torn out in exchange for the enlargement of his head. He has succeeded in providing possible alternatives for faith but has disabled his very soul. Lewis attempts to combat this heartless butchering by appealing to a natural law which much be fostered within the heart of the student by those who have followed it in their own lives.One would do well to couple this book with a reading ofLess Than Words Can Say. Mitchell in his critic on the lack of proper education and use of language postulated that in order for one's worldview to be changed he must change their language. He saw words and language as governing how one views the world. As a culture's language develops so does their ability to understand the world. Lewis however sees a greater law by which a worldview is formed. It is not language which governs one's interpretation of the facts but his understanding of the natural law which is given to each individual."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

This system of objective values, which Lewis calls the Tao, must be granted if there are to be any values whatsoever. In a long appendix at the end of the book, Lewis shows that all (or almost all) cultures, both past and present, have affirmed some basic moral principles that are part of the Tao. Against the relativist claim that all socieities have their own moral codes, Lewis demonstrates that all humans are guided by an underlying system of objective values which they may or may not recognize.In the third and final chapter, Lewis foresees a day when men have complete control over the destinies of the next generation. Should men achieve an take advantage of such power, it would not mean that man had finally dominated nature. Rather, it would mean the abolition of man. Unguided by the Tao, man's decisions about what future generations should be like would by guided only by natural impulses. Thus, by destroying the Tao and attempting to dominate nature, man can only succeed in destroying himself.Like always, Lewis writes with great clarity and intelligence. \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is an enjoyable read and certainly worth checking out."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This is a collection in essay form of three lectures. 80+ pages. A prophetic book if one considers it was first published in 1944. The subtitle, 'Reflections on Education', is more obvious in the first part, which works as an eye-opener to the kind of education we are sponsoring today (today indeed). It is not an easy book, but the more one digs underneath the surface one finds a treasure of wisdom and common-sense, one sees our present culture x-rayed. The warning that this essay gives us is that we have set our society in a very dangerous course. We are set to conquer Nature, and not just Nature but Human Nature, as if one step closer (progressiveness?) to become lords of our own destiny. This conquering of Human Nature takes place by abolishing Natural Law (the Tao), traditional values, and accepting what he calls the 'magician's bargain: give up our soul, get power in return ... but \\"the power thus conferred will not belong to us. We shall in fact be the slaves and puppets of that to which we have given our souls.\\" By conquering Nature we dehumanize ourselves. A very good analogy: \\"We have been trying, like Lear, to have it both ways: to lay down our human prerogative and yet at the same time to retain it. It is impossible.\\"One sees the relevance of Lewis's warning today in the ever growing power of the states through the tentacles of welfare and the media. \\"But the man-moulders of the new age will be armed with the powers of an omnicompetent state and an irresistible scientific technique.\\" These man-moulders are also called the Conditioners. Their function is... \\"to control, not to obey them -the natural phenomena-. They know how to produce conscience and decide what kind of conscience they will produce.\\" In other words, indoctrination.The philosophy of the moulders, or Conditioners, is the following: \\"Let us decide for ourselves -not Nature- what man is to be and make him into that ... because we want him to be such... let us now master ourselves and choose our own destiny.\\" Do you identify this with any political tendency today? Then guess who are the \\"we\\" and \\"him\\" in \\"we want him to be such\\". Sounds like the old saying 'to the people, for the people but without the people'.There are plenty of sentences that reveal the wisdom of this man in just a few words. Take this one: \\"We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.\\" The essay is not religious, is not a apology of Christianity as one would expect of Lewis, but each person can make his own evaluation of the implications this essay may have. But if traditional values and morality are to be abolished in this new society that pretty much removes Christianity, and all monotheistic religions, from the picture. Of course those who live by the motto 'eat and drink for tomorrow we die\\" and those who cry \\"peace, peace, peace!\\" are not to lift a finger to defend freedom.Communists once tried exchanging the human soul for the conquering of human nature and failed. Now others try again and without the mask of communism, they are that daring. They show who they really are: the self-righteous. Like the kid who cries for more cake despite knowing that it's not healthy for him, he now sees the chance to abolish, once and for all, his negative parents. Check the agenda of the Conditioners in your country. In Spain the Socialists have recently implanted in the public schools a new subject: 'Education for Citizenship'. And, of course, they have got rid of traditional family values. So much for separation of church & state when the state is the church."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"As of this writing there are already 70 other reviews of this book by C.S. Lewis. Much has been said, and instead of simply reiterating what others have already pointed out to be some of the strengths of this book, I'm going to briefly describe the general points and then suggest some other ways the book might be interpreted.In \\"Abolition of Man\\", Lewis attempts to show how the skeptic relativist mentality so prevalent in the modern West will, when drawn to its logical conclusions, lead to a loss of humanity. His basic point is that when we begin to question the legitimacy of viewing a waterfall as beautiful, for example, we have already implicitly begun to question the reality of an objective standard of beauty. This can be said also for objective standard for what is good, virtuous, etc. In terms of society, then, what has traditionally been seen as bad is no longer so obviously bad. Our whole standard of relating to one another is lost because we've rejected the existence of a moral code of right and wrong. Lewis concludes by essentially asking what is keeping humanity from pursuing such evils as eugenics, which by itself is the end of mankind insofar as people no longer have the right to be who they would be but are rather constructed to be something of a superman.That is a rough outline of Lewis' argument, and I inserted some words and concepts that he didn't put in the same way. Nevertheless, I'd like to relate \\"Abolition of Man\\" to two other works. First, for a fictional account making the same basic arguments as this work I thinkBrave New Worldis very similar. If I could advise people on reading one before the other I would suggest reading \\"Brave New World\\" first and then \\"Abolition of Man\\" if only because I think having the mental picture of the former in your head while reading the latter helps the reader understand why this is a big issue for Lewis.I would also recommend, for those who enjoy \\"Abolition of Man\\", the works of Eric Voegelin relating to modern gnostism; see especiallyModernity Without Restraint: The Political Religions, The New Science of Politics, and Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 5). Voegelin provides a more comprehensive philosophical and historical framework that illuminates the basic tenants of \\"Abolition of Man\\". In this sense, Lewis' section on human eugenics mimics Voegelin's concern for modern gnostic projects such as Nazism and Communism. In other words, Nazism and Communism are a type of abolition of man.In any case, \\"Abolition of Man\\" is a great short read that provides some basic critiques of modernity. One point I'd like to make in reference to some of the other reviewers is that Lewis is as much a critic of modernity in this work as he is of what some are calling \\"post-modernity\\". I would reject the notion that the two are utterly distinguishable; it seems to me (and I think Lewis would support this statement) that what we call \\"post-modernity\\" is really modernity of a different flavor. Thus, Lewis calls into question the worldview of Western Civilization that predates his own life by at least several generations."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

If there is not some common shared moral or ethical viewpoint in the mass of humanity, then all will be lost and undoing the teaching of the past is undoubtedly a BIG mistake. If we do dismantle the teaching of the past and build something knew, just what foundation will it be built upon if the moral or ethical foundation is as small and individualized as grains of sand? Certainly some will jump all over this essay published as book (actually it reads more like lecture notes than an actual book or essay), but I found little fault with it other than the parenthetical one mentioned above.

His brutal examination of this double standard is the much needed hard word this society needs. While too often we fall into haphazard, sloppy &quot;It just feels good&quot; behavior, we also cannot ignore the role of the heart as a part of the tripartite soul. Lewis calls for an active heart that is in sync with and tethered by the head (the logos). This world is greatly lacking of an understanding of cooperation between the two and Lewis examines the impact this sad phenomenom is having on contemporary culture.

Since reading this book I have been haunted by Lewis's theory that in attemp to control nature we only gain control over our fellow men.Lewis proposes that the philosophy of moral relativism, guised as freedom, is actually an archetype for enslavement for both those controlled, and those controlling. If society is reduced to no values, power becomes the only thing worth attaining. Those in power, unchecked by morals, have the ability and freedom to manipulate the subjects in any way they choose. Lewis is saying that man, in his attempt to make progress, learns to control more and more of nature. However, in his attempt to control nature he only gains control over fellow men. In giving up the Tao and allowing himself to do this, man succumbs to cruel nature which, as is obvious by this pattern, he has no control over at all."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

It may not have been as important read in it's time as it is today (If not for a brief mention in a newspaper article, I never would've discovered this book), but in the present, where objectivism is a dirty word, and relatavism is the default approach to thinking about everything, it's definately worth the hour or two of reading through it.Many people are aware of the problems in throwing objectivism out with the bath water, but most people will not have been able to put that concept into the concise, clear, and convincing fashion that C.S. Lewis has in this book."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The Abolition of Man is a stunningly brilliant masterpiece, prophetic in its insight. [....][...] apparently thinks that any appeal to right and wrong that doesn't simply quote Bible verses is anti-Christian. Obviously, he would be completely incapable of trying to convince nonChristians that there are universal moral laws that are contravened at our peril -- the very thing Lewis was trying to do. At one point this seeming \\"fundamentalist\\" wrote that only scripture teaches right and wrong and things about God. That statement is ironically contrary to scripture itself which says \\"the heavens declare the glory of God\\" and that God has revealled His ways and parts of His nature in nature itself and in human consciences (Romans 1). [He]contradicts scripture while trying to defend it. That's a pity. For if he really understood scripture or C. S. Lewis he would know that Lewis is saying what scripture says: God has universal moral laws that He has written into nature that all people can see and that have been generally recognized by major civilizations throughout the ages. Lewis also says it with breath-taking beauty.[Another person] is even more vacuous than the fundamentalist. (That's typical.) Like the typical leftist, he imagines that he's brilliant while proving that he doesn't have a clue. He thinks he's clever by quoting Lau Tzu on the meaning of \\"Tao.\\" But if he'd bothered to have really read Lewis or found out the meaning of the Chinese word \\"Tao\\", he would know that Lewis was not referring to Taoism but to the much more pervasive use of the idea of \\"Tao\\" in Chinese culture: that offered by Confucianism. [He] condemns Lewis for not getting it because he assumes that anyone who disagrees with his leftist ideology is empty-headed. His mindless repitition of Marxist ideology -- that moral systems are the mere fronts for political powers -- shows he's the one who hasn't understood Lewis. [His] statement that Lewis is merely defending \\"western\\" morals is absurd to the point of questioning whether he actually read the book -- or whether he's capable of really reading anything that isn't pre-committed to his Marxist politics. Indeed, [he] demonstrates that he's one of those men without chests about whom Lewis is writing while [the previous person]shows why modern conservative Christianity -- so frigthened of innovative communication -- has been so impotent, even though it holds the solution to the cultural problem Lewis diagnoses if only it could get over its reactionary anti-intellectualism and rigidity of mind that [he] exemplifies."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I read this on the advice of one friend and was encouraged by another. It starts out in a very surprising way. But of course! Considering this would be written to be published in 1944 a perspective of this sort on values surprises me only to the extent that it has a target at all. I at first thought the real target must be G.E. Moore but he specifically mentions Nietzsche later in the text. (This resulted in a reading of Moore's \\"The Refutation of Idealism\\" leading to a review of some of Berkeley's work...) I found his discussion of the non-dulce character of death (p. 22) interesting in light of what he would later write in \\"A Grief Observed.\\" (Did anyone ever figure out who he meant by Gaius and Titius? (In response to this question I have received two replies both in agreement that \\"they are actually King and Ketley -- the authors of The Control of Language.\\" (Thank you Mark) and \\"the real name of The Green Book is The Control of Language, by Alex King and Martin Ketley (1940). And Orbilius is (again, acc. to my notes) E. G. Biaggini, author of The Reading and Writing of English (1936).\\"(Thank you Kurt))). I also read a BMR review of The Future of Human Nature by Jurgen Habermas, and noticed that the basic form of most of Habermas' argument followed that of C.S. Lewis in this book. While Habermas (in translation) is concerned with the relationship hypothetical \\"programmers\\" would have with the \\"objects\\" of their efforts, Lewis refers to the \\"conditioners\\" but the reasoning is the same. I suppose this reflects the change from using behaviorism as the tool of control to our more contemporary set of computer metaphors. Notice also that Lewis uses the expression \\"post-humanity\\" p. 75. This is revisited in Fukuyama's book \\"Our Posthuman Future\\"."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"There must be an end to explaining away and \\"seeing through\\" things. What good is a window if the garden and the street are transparent as well? In this short book, C. S. Lewis addresses the problem produced by modern education. Those who are educating the world's youth are stealing the foundation out from under the student in order to build a \\"better\\" structure. By eliminating what Lewis refers to as the \\"Tao,\\" many teachers have replaced the objective for the subjective without realizing it.Lewis, a confessing Theist, attempts to present a case for even those who do not share like convictions. One manner of doing this is by naming the natural law, or preassigned truth, to the \\"Tao.\\" There are parts of this natural law found throughout every civilization and culture, and he demonstrates this by presenting the reader with a selection of sayings from various people groups. This allows the reader to see a representation of the teaching of the \\"Tao\\" without questioning from where it ultimately comes. The purpose of the author is not to convince the reader from whence comes the \\"Tao\\" but rather to express the presence and necessity of it.In order to substantiate his argument for the abolition of man through modern education, Lewis interacts with two authors of his time who had written a popular educational book. He demonstrates to the reader through their example that the modern educators are treating the student as a poultry farmer conditions a bird rather than an adult bird trains a younger how to fly. The former knows not for what or how he is being conditioned therefore disabling him without his recognition. He is then prone to repeat this very procedure on others.Lewis not only criticizes the work of the current educators but he also posits a better way. He states that \\"the task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts\\" (24). His point is that the current trend in education at the time of writing was to disassemble one's belief system instead of fostering it's growth. The goal of the modernist is to educate the mind so that one is able to see the error in their beliefs. The focus of Lewis however is to stress the formation of the heart. He states \\"the head rules the belly through the chest...\\" (34). The ultimate outcome of the modernist movement is the paradox that \\"we laugh at honour and and are shocked to find traitors in our midst\\" (35), In essence, a generation of \\"men with chests.\\"Reading through \\"The Abolition of Man\\" one wonders how exactly Lewis understands the \\"Tao\\". Is the \\"Tao\\" the actually grid by which one must understand the world, or is the \\"Tao\\" the outcome of seeing the world through that grid. It is true that these ethical standards are found through cultures from all ages, however, from whence came these statements of good and evil? Is it simply natural? If there is a natural law then who would be the lawgiver? These are questions which the reader is left with following the presentation of Lewis. Obviously it was not the intent of the author to deal with all the factors concerning one's worldview, however one is left to wonder. Is it possible to understand that there is a higher law and actually leave the conversation there?If the \\"Tao\\" is actually the base from which the ethical statements found throughout the world are derived, one is left to question how one goes about teaching it. If the \\"Tao\\" is found in one's natural law or morality, does the student trust the nature of the teacher over his own nature? How did that teacher refine his own understanding of the natural law by which he has the right to teach it to others?Lewis in the later part of his book deals with those who attempt to reason faith away. He argues that although there is a benefit to the exploration and dissection of nature, it comes at a very high price. He contends that when something has been conquered we lose part of it (84-85). Often times that which is lost is its greatest part for an object is not the sum total of its components. As if we could have a man if we were to obtain all the necessary elements in a laboratory test tube. The whole is much greater than the individual parts.Where does the modernist take man? It takes him to a place where his heart has been torn out in exchange for the enlargement of his head. He has succeeded in providing possible alternatives for faith but has disabled his very soul. Lewis attempts to combat this heartless butchering by appealing to a natural law which much be fostered within the heart of the student by those who have followed it in their own lives.One would do well to couple this book with a reading ofLess Than Words Can Say. Mitchell in his critic on the lack of proper education and use of language postulated that in order for one's worldview to be changed he must change their language. He saw words and language as governing how one views the world. As a culture's language develops so does their ability to understand the world. Lewis however sees a greater law by which a worldview is formed. It is not language which governs one's interpretation of the facts but his understanding of the natural law which is given to each individual."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This is a classic essay on the need for values. Though written decades ago, it is still a strong statement worth reading now. Lewis, with his characteristic flair for good writing, demolishes the idea that all ideas have equal worth, and that reflection on one's own core principles is essential. While he notes his own Christian viewpoint, he does not force it on the reader, but convincingly argues that one cannot fairly confront the world without first thinking through one's own values."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"The disappointment was overwhelming after my first reading of THE ABOLITION OF MAN approximately 14 years ago. I thought C.S. Lewis was overreacting to say the least. To say that a simple argument over semantics in an English schoolbook would bring about the downfall of civilization seemed a bit farfetched to me at the time.I recently reread ABOLITION. I suppose having experienced a little more life and a lot more education, my eyes were opened to the realities of what C.S. Lewis was talking about. What he actually does is talk about the slow, steady downfall of education. Later on in the book, he switches gears to discuss the demoralization of society in general and what causes this. The two subjects at first glance may seem unrelated. They are, in fact, close cousins.In the Western Hemisphere, virtually all of Lewis's grim predictions about education have already come true. Most of the predictions about society in general are in the process of coming true. In virtually every area of life, man has promoted himself to far above what he was ever qualified to be. (I am \\"sublime\\" since I used a \\"sublime\\" descriptor.) This self promotion coupled with the utter rejection of absolutes will cause severe damage to societies, as it already has to varying degrees.THE ABOLITION OF MAN is very philosophical compared to most (if not all) of Lewis's other works. Don't let its short length fool you. This little book has the potential to make for a very tough read. But the rewards are well worth it."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"After reading this essay I have been introduced to a new way of thinking. I can see what my responsibility as a Believer is. When I reach heaven I want to hear these words, \\"Well done my good and faithful servant\\". God has things he wants us to learn and through this book I believe many will receive a lot of insight into living as a true believer.The Weight of Glory is a book that is made up of a group of essays. Although they are unrelated, they bring much clarity to the way we think as Christians. These essays will provide encouragement, joy and peace to those who read it. Lewis focuses on what it means to be children of God. He shows that while cultures and nations are all mortal things they will come to an end. It is humans that are truly immortal in that we will live with God long after this world is gone.\\"The Weight of Glory\\" expresses an emotion that is described as \\"our longing to be reunited with something in the universe from which we now feel cut off.\\" Lewis writes this through his many excerpts about different aspects of the church, family and Christian living. In the piece titled \\"Membership,\\" he explains the meaning of the term through biblical texts. One in particular is \\"one body with many parts\\", as opposed to the more modern idea of membership as all people being equal.Overall this book was worth the time to read. It is filled with insights that I had never understood or seen before. \\"The Weight of Glory\\", is a thoughtfully crafted book of essays filled with scripturally based logic. It is the definition of a \\"must read\\" book."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"I was a bit frustrated with this book. Now, according to C.S. Lewis in \\"The Abolition of Man\\", there were some educators in his time who, by an extension of their teachings, would say that because I found this book frustrating, I am actually saying that I am frustrating myself. C.S. Lewis would argue (and does argue in the first lecture in this three lecture book) that that's not the case. It's nice to know.There are some really nice points in this book, particularly in that first lecture, and it helps you understand why some characters in C.S. Lewis' book \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (an Earth-bound sci-fi that feels like George Orwell in some parts) are the way they are.On the other hand, I found it to be a difficult book. They'd argue I'm therefore a difficult person, those educators C.S. Lewis mentions. C.S. Lewis would argue against that as well. That's nice too. It's a short piece, \\"The Abolition of Man\\", but I got through it rather slowly. There's more big words than in any other C.S. Lewis book I've read. But that isn't probably the problem, new words can be fun. No, I felt a lot of fear, and something that could be called duty in C.S. Lewis' arguments, and some of it, some of it felt a little pushy. He also mentions what I believe is a belief in evolution. He speaks of some people he doesn't agree with as \\"trousered apes\\" and when talking about man's struggle against \\"nature\\", he mentions that it has been going on for millions of years. Now, I'm a Christian, and I was a bit shocked at this, even though I kind of figured that C.S. Lewis believed this sort of thing from some comments in \\"Reflections on the Psalms\\". A lot of people, who believe in creation, quote books like \\"Mere Christianity\\" all the time. Who knew, you know?Anyway, I was reading the \\"Tao Te Ching\\", the text close to the heart of Taoists (which C.S. Lewis alludes to in \\"The Abolition of Man\\"), and I came across something interesting in the 11th chapter/poem there.It said:\\"If you hold ever fastTo that most ancient Way,You may govern today.Call truly that knowledgeOf primal beginningsThe clue to the Way.\\"Now, \\"The Abolition of Man\\" is about education, and of the value of things, both morally and of ancient and, for want of a better word, archetypal things. It is also about those who lead, who govern and adminsiter said education.Jesus said, according to at least one of the gospel accounts that he was the Way, the Truth and the Life. This is only a theory, but maybe C.S. Lewis, being familiar with the Tao, was investigating knowledge of \\"primal beginnings\\" as \\"a clue to the Way\\" (i.e. Christ) in his dabbling with the theory of evolution. I mean, to really know you'd have to ask him.If you're interested in C.S. Lewis' views in this book (regarding values and such), \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (which was also written during the second world war, as \\"The Abolition of Man\\" was) is a very vivid and enjoyable revelation of them. If you're after my recommendation, I'd read that before this one. Enjoy this one though."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"Abolition of Man, dealing with a fundamental question as it does, also has suggestions about Lewis's feelings towards Dr. Rudolf Steiner's work -- namely Anthroposophy. In a way this is more fundamental than the question of the Abolition of Man -- in that Lewis's friend, Owen Barfield, spent many years studying and applying Anthroposophy which Lewis in various ways throughout his life contested. (cf. Pilgrim's Regress, by Lewis) Lewis says in the Abolition that Dr. Steiner may indeed have seen what he claims. This is a curious remark of his -- and I would be interested to know if anyone knows more about this apparent change of heart. For Lewis to begin to affirm Anthroposophy goes much further than the argument of the book to point a direction of restoring Man to the world."},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham. Riddell memorial lectures)","review":"This book offers three essays: Men Without Chests, The Way, and The Abolition of Man. The first two form a coherent whole. They should lead logically to the third, which I prefer to consider separately. At their core, these first two 1944 essays address a cultural attitude that had been building at least since the 1920s, and that came to the forefront in the later part of the century. That attitude has many variations and names including post-modernism and post-structuralism, which hold at their core the rejection of any social or esthetic theory as inherently superior to another. I find it easy to dismiss by applying its logic to itself, but Lewis gives a clear and well-developed argument for the vacuity of such nihilism. That foundation lies in Lewis's Way, a kind of law of human nature that can be found across nearly all cultures and all centuries that have left records. Although he borrows from Eastern tradition in using the term 'The Way,' most of his historical support lies within the Western canon. Then within this body of thought, he demonstrates how deconstruction not only collapses through internal inconsistency, it goes against the grain so empirically visible in all of human doings.The third essay, from which the book gets its title, I find less compelling. Although he claims not to be anti-scientific, he seems to find little worth salvage in the intellectual exercise of understanding the physical world, especially the living portions of that world. Lewis appears to lack the scientists' experience of wonder, awe, and underlying unity that come from deeper understanding, experiences that can be profoundly moving and motivating. Based on his own lack, Lewis assumes that there is no such awe, so that understanding must somehow omit or even run counter to the feelings and values that make us human - an error of ignorance that C.P. Snow's essay onThe Two Cultures (Canto)drew into sharp relief.Lewis then observes that any technological advance gives power, in particular power over other people. By way of example, he asserts that contraceptive technology gives absolute power over people who would otherwise have been born, condemning them to nonexistence. This makes sense only in a predestined world where every human that ever will live has already been placed on the future time line, and where technology somehow stands outside this predetermined universe and corrupts it. It also ignores the life-saving technologies that allow more people to survive to reproduction, so that their otherwise-impossible children and grandchildren add to that predestined universe.Then using the language of 1940s eugenics and psychological conditioning, Lewis imagines a world in which technocrats define the bodies and minds of the entire generation after their own, and therefore of all future generations. Since 1940s-style eugenics could only remove alleles from the species genome, and since conditioning can only block choices that would otherwise have been open, Lewis gets away carried envisioning the losses that would necessarily ensue. Although he might be horrified by some ramifications of recent biotechnology, Lewis's argument does not admit the possibility of broadening the definition of humankind or the abilities possible to our species. A genetic increase in intelligence would not eliminate alternatives, as Lewis fears, but increase them. Lewis's concerns about the motivations of those implementing any such change remain valid, and I think changes in popular culture identified as \\"dumbing down\\" bring his fears to life. Short of nuclear annihilation of the species, however, his fears seem like hysteria about hypotheticals.As much as I respect Lewis's reasoning and humanity, I find this book of limited value. It offers some positive suggestions about maintaining a strong, humane culture. Unfortunately, the title chapter undermines any good I found in it.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The abolition of man; or, Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools, (University of Durham.

However, I object to his continual use of human \\"nature\\" as synonymous with selfish desires. Human beings have always been social creatures, and our survival depends not just on satisfying individual drives but also working together and caring for each other. This could be why some form of the Golden Rule is found throughout the world's cultures. Whereas Lewis personally ascribes the origin of morality to God, or at least an abstract Tao, in fact kindness, compassion, truthfulness, etc. may have evolved as a keys to our survival.Even ants are hard-working, cooperative, solicitous of their young, protective of their Queen, defensive of the colony, and self-sacrificing.

This is not the highly technical manual that would turn away the amatuer. At the same time it lacks depth to be a truly serious resource."},{"Title":"The Pacific Islands","review":"This book is a history of all of the Pacific Islands. Oliver was trained as an anthropologist and lived for an extended period in the region. He draws on both his training and personal knowledge to not only describe the different islands and their groupings, but also to analyze the reasons for their cultural, political, and economic differences.The book is divided into three main sections and an epilogue. In the first section, The Islanders, Oliver recounts the prehistory of the islands, noting their geological origin and development. He also discusses the first settlers of the islands, and how and why anthropologists have grouped them into Melanesians, Polynesians, and Micronesians. In the second section, The Aliens, Oliver turns to the subject of contact with Westerners, taking up explorers, whalers, traders, missionaries, planters, blackbirders, merchants, and miners in turn.The third section, Metamorphosis, is the most extensive. In this section, Oliver identifies strong influences on development in the region, and traces how they have affected the history of each particular island group or island. For example, he notes how the development of a coconut economy was primary in islands such as Western Samoa or the Solomons, while sugar dominated the history of Hawaii and Fiji. Other influences were missionaries (Tonga), Mining (Nauru, New Caledonia), and Bases (American Samoa, Guam). This island-by-island analysis is followed by an epilogue, in which Oliver describes some of the ways in which the islanders and cultures have both lost and gained by their being brought into the international community. The events of World War II are also described briefly, but at the time when the book was originally written, the longer-lasting effects of the war had not yet become clear.For a history book, the text is exceptionally clear and engaging. The analytical approach helps tie in details and makes the overall picture of the broad region much more comprehensible. The text is not footnoted, but at the end of the book, there is an extensive list of primary sources and suggested readings, organized topically. There is also an index."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"Great guide for simple legal writing. As my mother tongue is not English, writing according to this book is much easier than according to \\"classics\\". This book is short and straightforward guide with excercises.

Anyone who devotes enough time and thought to tackling the exercises--as opposed to just skimming the examples--will see improvement.As a side note, I devoured this book as a law student and young lawyer, and now I work with lawyers all over the world and have written a book of my own called Point Made.

He focuses a good deal of attention at the outset on how one should \\"frame one's thoughts\\" on a subject, and then proceeds to enhance our understanding of sentence phrasing options and word choices. I especially enjoyed this preferatory work-up. We can all use this - for initial learning or for refreshing and revising our approaches. He includes principles for legal drafting, while also going into the detail of document design, discussing American standards - both those we might keep and those that should be abandoned. The great strengths in Garner's materials are that (1) he takes good firm positions on what is best-usage in legal English, (2) he explains clearly why, and (3) his own prose is fun to read.

I was able to review this book at a Writing Seminar led by the author. He is reforming the way all people should communicate and his lectures are sincerely admirable.The author teaches a, &quot;Can Do Style,&quot; of encouragement. I came away concluding the old method of learning by rote is failing. English Teachers are excellent in explaining the rules of good grammar. But terrible on coaching children in applying the rules for skillful writing. I am not concluding all English Teachers deserve blame here. Teachers simply restate how they learn grammarLikewise, ideal teaching avoids faultfinding personal attacks as much as possible. Human nature prompts one to avoid parents or teachers or practicing embarrassment is the road to success. Instead, the author urges that all writing should make the reader feel smart.The legal profession is a victim of what they read. The most insecure judges, lawyers and law clerks often wrote to display their education. Today, the best lawyer will use plain English to convince others of the merits to his argument. Success and confidence draw near by making anyone feel they are smart because they accept you. Using large words makes one think about the words they do not know above your alluring reasoning.Bryan Garner's primers along with practicing his techniques will change you into a stronger writer, lawyer and person. You will not regret spending the money on Bryan Garner's books and seminars. The goal is to make everyone feel smarter by reading what you write!

I wish the author focused more on giving his own examples as opposed to only offering one. If this were used as a textbook, then the problem sets make sense. But as a reader, I find myself skipping over them. I'd like to see more examples since that is how I learn best. But other than the suggestion of putting citations in footnotes, I can use just about every point made. I thought I was a good legal writer until I read this book.

Garner's advice is easier to apply than Flesch'sArt of Plain Talk, the first book that I read on plain English. I like that Garner focuses on the worst offenders; for example, suggesting we change \\"-ion\\" words rather than declaring a war on all affixes and asking us to check every \\"of\\" for rephrasing rather than every preposition. This is important when, like me, you only have three to four productive hours a day and you just don't have the time to worry about every preposition and affix.I strongly recommend both \\"Legal Writing in Plain English\\" andGarner's Modern American Usage."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"This book will teach you how to write clearly and precisely.

Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose. This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong. He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it. If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge. They'd likely settle. And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were &quot;traditionally drafted.&quot; And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause. That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople. The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language. Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you. There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana. And the writer's praise of &quot;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary&quot; as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement: &quot;DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . .&quot; Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use. We know what happens with legalese: litigation and contention and noncomprehension. Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"The point of Garner's book is to write for the reader. This book would be helpful to any lawyer, if only because it forces us to think about how and why we are writing.Too often, writers treat style manuals as if they were infallible--written on stone tablets by a divine author. Garner's book is not perfect and cannot be applied with a thoughtless rigor. As an appellate lawyer, I generally try to follow Garner's style, but sometimes it doesn't fit.The corporate lawyer who complained about the book did not read it closely enough. Garner opposes thoughtless attachment to legalese, but he acknowledges that sometimes legal writers have to use terms of art. He also urges writers to be concise. I don't know where the corporate lawyer got the idea that Garner advocates \\"two pages of easily accessible prose over two sentences of conventional drafting,\\" but it is not from this book.Accept or reject Garner's advice as you wish, but thinking about clear writing will make you a better lawyer. Most of what Garner writes is common sense, but it's common sense legal writers often lack."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"I strongly agree with five of the six amazon.com reviews, which are highly favorable and award five stars. This book is beautifully written, well organized, and eminently sound. Garner tackles the difficult job of convincing staid, inflexible lawyers to abandon the age-old practice of using incomprehensible legalese and thus ensuring that their contracts will have to be translated for those whose lives are affected by them and later interpreted in costly litigation.Most prestigious lawyers, law firms, and judges strongly favor Garner's plain-language approach to drafting. For example, the late Charles Alan Wright, a brilliant Supreme Court lawyer and noted author, called Garner \\"the world's leading authority on the language of the law.\\" And the Texas Supreme Court enlisted Garner's aid in redrafting the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. So it's hard to believe that judges would generally prefer \\"conventional drafting\\" over the clear, accessible language that Garner advocates.The five five-star reviews of the book on this website came from a law professor, a practicing lawyer, a book reviewer, and two others who appear to be nonlawyers. I wondered if the anonymous New York corporate lawyer who gave the book a meager one star knew something that everyone else didn't. So I checked for reviews from highly respected sources. And I found that Harvard Law Review, the Law Library Journal, and Trial have all published very favorable reviews of this book.The plain-language drafting recommended in this book is widely viewed as beneficial, not only by nonlawyers, but also by highly skilled lawyers who seek to avoid ambiguity and litigation and who strive to improve the tarnished image of lawyers generally. I believe that Garner's approach would be condemned only by a few rich corporate lawyers who thrive by making themselves indispensable in drafting, translating, and later litigating the long, dense form contracts that they produce."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"The problem with the 1-star review is that it has the problem completely reversed. The reviewer suggests that traditional legal drafting is *shorter* than the plain english drafting that Garner proposes. He need only read Garner's books to learn that traditional drafting is *significantly* longer and more difficult to read than plain English.Furthermore, the reviewer needs to realize that Garner is not advocating that all legal writing be poetry. First and foremost, he advocates for clarity and precision. If the writer can also make it interesting to read (or even a joy to read), then more power to the writer.If you're a lawyer and hate seeing &quot;WHEREAS&quot; before each recital and prefer a simple sentence, Garner is the man for you."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"Quit searching -- this is the best book on legal writing that you will find.

Of course legal drafting can be improved, but there are limits, given that ease of understanding isn't the only goal in legal drafting. In short, he lets his stylistic preferences override the need for brevity, clarity and precision, and has taken his case too far. Where a choice has to be made, I vote for conventional legal drafting. Many of his recommendations do not work in the country's most prestigious law firms.Mr. Garner advises that lawyers should draft in plain English, not for a mythical judge who might be called upon to interpret a provision in the worst-case scenario of litigation. While I am all for clarity, legal draftsmen would be well advised to consider the malpractice hazards of not drafting for a judge. By all means, make your drafting unambiguous and eschew sloppy and overly-complicated formulations, but keep in mind that if there is a question of interpretation, it will be a judge or arbitrator with legal training who will have to resolve it and, whether the judge or arbitrator likes it or not, he or she knows what to do with conventional legal drafting. And I don't seriously believe that a judge would prefer to read three pages of easily accessible prose over two sentences of conventional drafting that, given his or her legal training and experience, can be absorbed in a few seconds.Put simply, you'd rather have a patent protect your client than have it be understood by a layman. Similarly, you'd rather have to explain a contractual provision to a client than not have it give her the legal protection she has hired you help provide. Would Mr. Garner advise that mathematicians frame their equations in prose, simply because this makes their conclusions more accessible to the nonmathematician? Or that advertisements be written in full sentences?For example, Mr. Garner begins the book by criticizing the formulation \\"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary.\\" Although it lacks iambic pentameter, there can be little question of its intent: what follows overrides any conflicting provisions, and you, Mr. Judge, should consider this when one party argues that another provision should prevail. And what's wrong with a well-drafted proviso?Mr. Garner also ignores the choice between the precision offered by good, but conventional, legal drafting, and the difficulty of achieving that same precision when drafting in plain English. Given the choice, I'd prefer to draft a short, precise, clear sentence than two pages of nattily formatted plain English. At my hourly rates, I suspect my clients would prefer to pay for the former, too.Finally, Mr. Garner ignores the reality of most legal drafting: it begins with precedent that doesn't conform to his views. Again, given the high cost of quality legal work, it might be worth tinkering with language to make it clearer, but it would prohibitively expensive to completely redraft from scratch a complicated transaction document in the manner he suggests.Perhaps the most telling point: the book jacket has no endorsements from anyone at a prestigious law school or law firm.A noble cause, but Mr. Garner writes like an academic without real-world experience."},{"Title":"Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises","review":"I am pleasantly surprised by the readability of this useful book.

Saul, Fred, and Orrie were overseas and out of the stories for the duration of the war. Archie joined up, but was assigned to Army Intelligence on the home front for the duration. (He tried more than once to get a combat assignment and got nowhere - as it is, he's paid about 1/3 his old salary, has the disadvantages of being in the Army, and Wolfe uses his Army loyalties as an excuse to withhold even more information than usual.)As for Wolfe, Fritz, and Theodore...\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" - March 1942. Archie's now Major Goodwin - very good, since he's been in the Army for only 2 months, and the idea of Army discipline...well, Archie refers to snapping to one's feet and so forth in the presence of a general as 'Rocketteing'. After clearing up 'that mess down in Georgia' (an unrecorded case of his own for Army Intelligence), his superior calls him in to ask why Wolfe hasn't cooperated when asked to work for Army Intelligence. Archie confidently assumes that the Army just mishandled Wolfe, and that he's sunk deep in his normal rut.When he gets home and finds the office dusty, he's sure Fritz or Wolfe must be dead - it's just a question of which; on finding dust in the *kitchen* is dusty and health food in the refrigerator (!), he's sure they're *both* dead. But Theodore says no, they're in training to join the Army. Archie, after attempting to make Wolfe see reason, starts scuffling around for a case to jump-start Wolfe's brain - and when he finds one, deliberately sinks *himself* in it up to the neck.Lily Rowan has a major role; she's much more visibly attached to Archie than in later books. (To fully appreciate all the by-play with Lily, read SOME BURIED CAESAR.) She's been trying to get Wolfe to take on a job for a friend, but he wouldn't see her. Archie takes an interest, but the friend is a good-looking young woman, so Lily isn't quite so keen on Archie getting involved. (The friend lives in an apartment building full of eccentrics - old ladies who feud because one feeds squirrels and the other fancies pigeons; a 4F young man who raises racing pigeons...)\\"Booby Trap\\" - August 1943. Captain Albert Cross was found dead on the pavement beneath his hotel room window - an obvious murder: he was due to make a report to the group of intelligence people Wolfe works with. (Of the local group, only General Fife is regular Army - Colonel Ryder was a Cleveland lawyer, Tinkham a bank security officer - and he has no inclination to sooth feathers ruffled by Wolfe's manner. Fife, in turn, reports to General Carpenter.)Cramer hates the national security crud involved - a reaction consistent with his occasional clashes with the FBI in later years - and with good reason: the Army can't give the police all the facts. Intelligence has been made aware of an anonymous letter alleging that various unpatented, uncopyrighted trade secrets / industrial processes have been made available to the government to support the war, and that somebody's selling them to unscrupulous companies seeking post-war advantage. (Nondisclosure agreements, and lack thereof, are not a new problem under the sun.) It's hard to prove, since the profit motive can't be established until it's too late.Cross had been investigating the theft of some samples of a new type of grenade. Archie and Wolfe, after using Cross' notes to recover the grenades, are working on who killed Cross and why. Wolfe won't let Archie keep one grenade as a trophy - and after Archie returns it, someone employs it to set a booby trap for another member of the group. Wolfe himself lays a trap to catch Ryder's murderer.Most of the intelligence characters were mentioned in the preceding story but did not appear. Shattuck, a Congressional committee chairman, is in on this because when he received an anonymous letter, he brought it to his old friend Colonel Ryder rather than the FBI. (Shattuck was godfather to Ryder's only son, who was killed in action a few weeks before the story opens.) After a pointed remark from one of the G2 types asking where's the media, Shattuck just as pointedly says it would be good if Capitol Hill took over the armed forces for a month - \\"Good God!\\" - and vice versa, since everybody would learn something.Wolfe's patriotism, as usual, is understated but apparent. There's no black market stuff at the brownstone (at least, not until after the war is over, in a story in another collection). He's willing to travel, and even miss orchid sessions if necessary, for the sake of his adopted country. Lastly, during the war, Wolfe takes only Army Intelligence work, not the high-paying private stuff.Both stories, of course, are period pieces, reflecting in various small details that they're contemporary with the setting. We don't just see references to rationing and the black market, but little things: Archie making a crack about politicians trying to imitate Churchill's voice after his address to Congress; General Fife trying to imitate Eisenhower's mannerisms; Wolfe's reaction to meeting a WAC."},{"Title":"Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"But not bad, either. This Nero Wolfe offering consists of two stories. The first story, &#65533;Not Quite Dead Enough,&#65533; finds Archie in the Army while Wolfe and Fritz train for active duty. (Really! No kidding!) While on furlough, Archie is suspected of murdering a young lady he had been out with for the evening. The second story is far superior to the first. &#65533;Booby Trap,&#65533; while keeping the trappings of a military atmosphere (an Army colonel is murdered), provides a &#65533;satisfactory&#65533; outlet for Wolfe&#65533;s genius.You must understand that these stories appeared first in 1944. Stout was obviously painting Wolfe and Archie as patriotic crime fighters, which is admirable, but yields ridiculous results in the first story. The second tale is vintage Wolfe, containing everything Wolfe fans have come to expect (beer, orchids, colorful exchanges between Wolfe and Archie) and love (a woman in the brownstone, Wolfe leaving the house, Wolfe riding in a car, Wolfe attempting to sit in an unsatisfactorily built chair). If you&#65533;re a die-hard fan, you&#65533;ll want to read the first story, but you&#65533;ll savor the second.

The usual humor is there, particularly in Archie's observations about the state of the brownstone in his absence. But the plots are neither as clever nor as convincing as those in the novels, and in many ways this book is an aberration from the other Wolfe novels.

The plot is a great whodunnit, which requires Wolfe to leave his brownstone mansion, unheard-of behavior for the great detective, to solve this mystery.

I love all of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series."},{"Title":"Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" and \\"Booby Trap\\" are the two novellas in this collection. The first is most interesting for the various machinations of the characters involved: Archie is trying to get Wolfe to give up his \\"training\\" and assist the army with his brain rather than his physical prowess (although the picture of Wolfe and Fritz exercising and eating salad is a memorable one.)and Lily Rowan is desperately trying to get army officer Archie back into her life( a departure from the more sophisticated relationship she and Archie have in later novels.)Both of these subplots work better than the rather slight mystery which is as little challenge to the reader as it is to Wolfe.The second story is a bit more interesting. In the investigation of the murder of an army officer via hand grenade, Wolfe is confronted with a number of possibilities and a few characters who are not as they appear on the surface. Although it ends with the suicide of the murderer plot device that is used a bit too often in Stout's work, this one balances out the weaker first novella well."},{"Title":"Not Quite Dead Enough","review":"For some readers, \\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" could be a huge turn off from Wolfe novels. Written during the war, it is understandable that people held a grudge against Germans. But Stout goes much further.To let you fully appreciate the stance surfacing in \\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" I have to cite an interview Stout did with the New York Times Magazine of January 17, 1943. He says: \\"I hate all Germans who, reluctant to join the Nazis, nevertheless failed, through lack of courage or conviction, to prevent the Nazis from seizing power\\" and \\"It is not true that if we hate the Germans now we are helping to fill a reservoir of hate-poison that will infect the future beyond all hope of antisepsis. On the contrary. If we do not hate the Germans now, we shall inevitably fail in our purpose to establish the world on a basis of peace (...) We shall hate or we shall fail.\\"There are numerous more examples like that, but they all have one thing in common: Stout wanted the Germans exterminated as a whole. He even went as far to lead the war propaganda Writer Board.In \\"Note Quite Dead Enough\\" Stout lets Wolfe say: \\"I am going to kill some Germans. I didn't kill enough of them in 1918.\\" Apparently with no regard if those Germans are men, women or children. He even has Wolfe pride himself of killing 200 Germans himself.I am not sure if Stout was aware that his attitude toward Germans was as fascist as the Nazi attitude toward jews.

The idea of characters like the Reverse Flash stem from this type of story and the idea still pops up today.#30- Brainwave makes another appearance, taking our heroes into bizarre fantasy worlds and making them doubt their own existence. With Johnny Thunder actually making sense, this one is a great deal of fun. The art is wild, particularly in the Flash chapter where he's surrounded by funny animals.#31-Is another sci-fi based story that lacks the action of the one in issue #29 and serves as a precursor to the type of stories the series ended with.#32-The Psycho Pirate makes another appearance and the story works pretty well with the exception of the Psycho-Pirate's accomplice, Big Mike, who may be one of the dumbest criminals ever seen in the All Star books.#33- One of the best All Star stories, \\"The Revenge of Solomon Grundy\\" brings the swamp creature into combat with the entire JSA instead of his usual foe, Green Lantern.

The other stories collected here are a mixed blend: the Psycho-Pirate story is enormously disappointing, but the Brain Wave story &quot;The Dreams of Madness!&quot; is particularly surreal and nightmarish, and the Landor story has a nifty gimmick. There's too much dreary Johnny Thunder antics for my own personal taste in these stories, and not enough Wonder Woman (why wouldn't they let her participate in the adventures?), but it's got a great Forties feel to it."},{"Title":"All Star Comics Archives, Vol. 7 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"As others have mentioned, this volume and the one that follows (\\"All-Star Archives\\" v.7 & 8) are pretty much the peak of the series... If you want to try out the \\"All Star\\" books, this is the place to start.The first story in Volume 7 pretty much exemplifies what had been wrong with the title to date -- \\"The Wiles Of The Wizard,\\" from All-Star #34 (May, 1947) is awkward and crude, badly plotted and fairly idiotic, and the segments where various heroes are sent out on their own solo adventures don't really connect up very well. The writing and artwork are blatantly slipshod, with the notable exception being Lee Elias' work on the Flash section, which has a formality and draftsmanlike flair that recalls Milton Canniff's work on the \\"Terry And The Pirates\\" newspaper strip. Otherwise: sheesh!Issue #35 marks a real upswing in quality. The villain is still silly -- Per Degaton, a brutish, red-headed scientific \\"genius\\" who seems like a cross between Jules Verne and Benito Mussolini. Degaton resents the success of other scientists, and steals a time machine so that he can go back in the past and undermine all scientific progress. Although the science fiction-y plot is riddled with logical inconsistencies, it still has a bold imaginative sweep, and is much more ambitious and intriguing than your standard Golden Age fare.The following stories, from issues 36 and 37 are also classics, and mark a high-water point for the \\"All-Star\\" book. This, along with Volume 8, are what made the title memorable, and are certainly worth checking out.

He died in 1037 in Persia. A child prodigy who memorised the Koran by age 10, Ibn Sina also taught himself medicine and treated patients as a teenager.Arguably the greatest mind of Islamic civilisation, his intellectual achievements stand out all the more when you examine the context of his prodigious output. He produced about 450 works on philosophy, medicine, psychology, to name a few areas.Wisnovsky, an accomplished historian of philosophy and classical Arabist, has provided a precise and painstaking study of Avicenna's philosophy in context. The 'contextualism' championed by Wisnovsky, which owes a debt to the pioneering work of the philosopher of science, AI Sabra, seeks to recreate the situation and context in which Avicenna's ideas were generated. Wisnovsky has mastered a difficult topic and rendered the work of a complext mind with aplomb. He eschews reductionism (simplfying stuff)or precursorism (glorifying achievements) to produce a balanced, sympathetic but level-headed study of the work of a great Islamic and world thinker.Wisnovsky writes well, but the subject matter is heavy-going. Not for the lay reader but certainly very useful for students of the subject, whether professional or the garden variety, like myself. I look forward to future works of Wisnovsky."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"The &quot;nation&quot; is of course Panama and this well-written and informative book explains the different roles played by members of an especially interesting group who include Joseph Pulitzer, William Nelson Cromwell, Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan, Phillipe Bunau-Varilla, Senator John Tyler Morgan, Senator Mark (&quot;Dollar&quot;) Hanna, John Hay, and General Esteban Huertas. Espino traces a chronology of events which extends from 1501 when Christopher Columbus arrives in Panama until December 31, 1999, when the United States surrenders its control over the Panama Canal after ninety-six years. With all due respect to the profoundly important social, political, military, and financial implications of various decisions and consequences which Espino examines, I must say that the narrative often seemed to me to be one of a global or at least hemispheric soap opera. There are heroes and villains galore. Plots and sub-plots. Triumphs and failures. Betrayals. Countless opportunities either seized or forfeited.The book's title correctly suggests Wall Street's central influence (both positive and negative) on efforts to finance, design, build, maintain, and control the Panama Canal. To say &quot;Wall Street&quot; is to refer to human beings with resources sufficient to their ambitions. Specifically, Morgan who was involved with a syndicate to purchase the French Canal Company and fund Panama's independence. Hence the importance of Cromwell who founded a pre-eminent Wall Street Law firm and succeeded in defeating the Nicaraguan canal forces in the U.S. Congress led by Senator Morgan. Hence the importance of Pulitzer who (through his newspaper, the New York World) accused President Roosevelt of aiding and abetting the Wall Street syndicate's advocacy of the Panamanian revolution.American military forces were first stationed in Panama in 1857 and remained there to protect and defend the Isthmus until relinquishing authority on December 31, 1999, following a de-Americanization process initiated by President Carter. The &quot;Zonians&quot; will never forgive him for &quot;depriving&quot; them of their tropical paradise, just as so many British &quot;colonials&quot; never forgave Gandhi for leading India to independence. As for Panamanians, Epson reminds them (and the reader) of what Secretary Cass said (in 1855): &quot;sovereignty has its duties as well as its rights.&quot; No country (including the United States) should ever be permitted &quot;to close the gates of intercourse on the great highways of the world.&quot;In his concluding remarks, Epson observes: &quot;Today, the canal is no longer the vital waterway it once was. Panama, however, continues to be the coveted territory imbued with the special mission because of its critical position as the crossroad of the Americas. The challenges facing the canal are no longer only the security of the waterway, but a forty-year-old civil war in Columbia; drug trafficking; corruption; money laundering; authoritarian regimes; and poor social conditions throughout Latin America.&quot; In some respects, the soap opera continues. In other and more significant respects, a global pressure point remains."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"Ovidio Diaz's book is highly recommended as a source of new insights into the Panama Canal Story.The title is very exaggerated, but it helps sell books, and the most important thing for a book, love or hate it, is to be sold.There is big emphasis on alleged corruption by some Panamanian Founding Fathers while in the same book he acknowledges that Panama had intended 57 times in the past to become independent. So, it is evident, that the ideas of our Independence and the Republic of Panama were not invented by Wall Street at all.J.P. Morgan, Cromwell et al, just profited from the situation as good Wall Streeters. The Panamanian patriots, smart and practical, took advantage of their greed in order to accomplish something that otherwise would have been impossible, Panama being a small province of a much bigger , warring country and, worst of all, Colombia having a Treaty with the U.S. were the latter had the obligation to maintain the order.Our Founding Fathers gambled their lives for sure. If the Colombian troops had managed to reach Panama City, they would have been executed.Some Founding Fathers may not have been saints, but the evidence is really not that clear at all. Plenty of hearsay and accusations from people that had their own agendas and that told the story in their own, self serving way. Pulitzer's fight with Teddy Roosevelt being a major source of misinformation. So it seems necessary to dig up more documental facts.It is also clear that Teddy Roosevelt and Hay were no saints either, but this does not diminish their good deeds or their place in history. Politics in those days, were like that !In the end, we Panamanians have a great debt not only to the Founding Fathers, but yes, to Bunau Varilla and to Cromwell and to Roosevelt. If it hadn't been for ALL of them, we would still be, who knows, a forgotten backwoods province of Colombia !.Congratulations to Ovidio Diaz Espino on his personal and important contribution to the history of Panama and the United States.Roberto R.

Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"WAS PANAMA A MERE CREATION OF WALL STREET --O WAS ITS INDEPENDENCE THE EFFECT OF THREE POWERFUL FORCES?by: Roberto N. M&eacute;ndez (*)Panamanian lawyer Ovidio D&iacute;az-Espino's essay, \\"How Wall Street Created a Nation\\", whose Spanish version recently became available, informs us about a few, little-known but important, historical facts related to Panama's independence from Colombia, which happened on November 3, 1903. Un-fortunately, the essay's argument is simplistic, aside from the fact that it turns out to be contradictory and unoriginal.The book's title, its Preface, its first chapter, and the author's own public statements, all align themselves with the \\"black legend\\" which surrounds Panama's independence.According to it, Panama's independence from Colombia was conceived, promoted, financed and led by a group of New York bankers, headed by cunning lawyer William N. Cromwell, who acted in liaison with President Theodore Roosevelt.Also according to the legend, Panama's founding fathers were little more than corrupt puppets, who merely followed Cromwell's instructions word for word, all in exchange for the classic handful of silver coins.Such viewpoint is not only simplistic -it contradicts several historical sources and evidences, some of which, paradoxically, are mentioned by D&iacute;az-Espino himself.For one thing, it is well known that Jos&eacute; A. Arango and other Panamanians started the conspiracy between June and July of 1903, at great personal risk. In other words, the separatist plot began spontaneously in Panama, and much before the Colombian Congress rejected the Herran-Hay Treaty, which occurred on August 12, 1903.Only after the treaty was rejected did President Theodore Roosevelt began to lean in favour, not of Panama's independence, but of the odd thesis of American jurist John Basset Moore. According to Moore, the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty of 1846 allowed to US to build a Canal through Panama, regardless of the wishes of the Colombian government.Well-known historical documents testify to this fact. French investor Phil-lipe Bunau-Varilla provided one of them, in his book \\"From Panama to Verdun\\". Bunau-Varilla describes there how he met, in early October of 1903, with Roosevelt, and how he convinced the American President to abandon Moore's thesis, and to lend support to the separatist plot.Surprisingly, D&iacute;az-Espino mentions the meeting in his book, but he never realizes that it contradicts his essay's central thesis.The essay's ending is no less of a surprise. On chapter 11, D&iacute;az-Espino asserts that Panama's independence from Colombia was the joint result not of one, or two, but of three \\"powerful forces\\"; the first, Roosevelt's \\"ambi-tions\\" relative to the Canal; the second, Wall Street's \\"greed\\"; the third, Panamanians' \\"century-old aspiration to independence\\".\\"Does not such a statement imply a contradiction vis a vis the essay's cen-tral argument?\\", D&iacute;az-Espino was asked publicly in mid 2003, while visit-ing Panama on occasion of Panama's yearly Book Fair. As expected, the author was unable to offer a coherent answer.In addition to that incongruence between central thesis and historical evi-dence, D&iacute;az-Espino's essays suffers from a lack of originality, derived, ap-parently, from the author's unawareness about previous works on the sub-ject.Indeed, Colombian journalist and historian Eduardo Lemaitre, whose work \\"Panama and its separation from Colombia\\", was published already in 1972, described the role that Cromwell and his group played in detail. And before Lemaitre, Colombian intellectual Oscar Teran, in his voluminous essay \\"From the Herran-Hay to the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty\\" (published in the thirties of last century) also divulged a large amount of information on the subject. What is more, Teran used the same sources that D&iacute;az-Espino uses. It is therefore amazing that neither of these two previous and well-known works is even mentioned in D&iacute;az-Espino's essay.Yes, Ovidio D&iacute;az-Espino's essay informs us of a few interesting and little known historical facts; unfortunately, his viewpoint is simplistic, contradic-tory, and lacking of originality. His purpose seems to be convincing us that Panama's independence was an episode characterized solely by the selfish-ness, corruption and cowardice of its participants. But in doing so Ovidio-D&iacute;az contradicts himself, and seems to forget that all historical events are the result of interactions between positive and negative elements, which in one way or another contribute to the material and spiritual advancement of the people.-------------(*) Roberto N M&eacute;ndez (www.rnmendez.com) is a professor of economics at Panama's National University."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"With greater-than-life characters such as J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, William Nelson Cromwell, and Joseph Pulitzer, Ovidio Diaz recreates the exhuberance that turned America into the 20th century superpower. The book is a fast, easy to read narrative that has the touch of fiction. It is sometimes hard to believe that the events actually happened, but Mr. Diaz provides substantial evidence to back his assertions. I think this is a major contribution and should be read by anyone interested in regional foreign policy and the influence of Wall Street on American politics. My only criticism is that I wished Mr. Diaz had covered the 20th century in greater depth, since the events that he describes continue to impact the world today. We will have to wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"Ovidio D&iacute;az Espino's \\"How Wall Street Created a Nation\\" is not a very reliable source if you are seriously researching \\"life in the tropics\\" -though D&iacute;az claims in the foreword that he wanted to disclose the \\"mystery\\" behind the creation of the republic of Panam&aacute;. It cannot be denied that the author did quite a thorough research on the library of J.P. Morgan, but it appears as if this part of the story were the most important in the creation of a nation. And I believe that D&iacute;az is dead wrong: people with strong links to a land create nations, not foreign money. The inclusion of Morgan's (his then employer) and (\\"Teddy\\") Roosevelt's names in the book's subtitle is an indication of who D&iacute;az thought as his target audience. As for us, here in Panam&aacute;, who have made a little research - in situ - on the genesis of our country, we associate the creation of Panam&aacute; with persons like Jos&eacute; Domingo Espinar (who was the first to separate the Panamanian province from Colombia), Justo Arosemena (who created the Federal State of Panam&aacute;) and rebel lawyer Pedro Prest&aacute;n - who, in D&iacute;az' book, appears as a pyromaniac mulatto, when Prest&aacute;n was actually sentenced to death after two Americans and an Italian testified against him, when he was accused of burning the city of Col&oacute;n, on the Caribbean coast of Panam&aacute;. This side of the story is largely omitted in the financial saga D&iacute;az has concocted (sometimes performed by ugly Latino stereotypes and narration \\"a la Hollywood\\" - perhaps for selling movie rights?), which affects the book seriously. All the information D&iacute;az found about how the Panam&aacute; Railroad Company's employees planned a sort of \\"coup d'&eacute;tat\\" in Panam&aacute;, in 1903, is valuable, but it needs the counterpart that he mentions here and there, when he admits that Panamanians tried to separate from Colombia more than 50 times. If this had not happened, surely a Chinese and a mule would not have been the only dead on November 3, 1903, the date of the separation. Many loyal patriots would have died for Colombia, but this was not the case. So the heroics of the Wall Street personnel and their colleagues in Washington and Paris only represent the economic machination that fueled an old aspiration. As it is, you may find it interesting, but please be aware that this is only part of history. It is not strange that D&iacute;az ends his book citing a \\"Zonian\\" (Americans born and raised in the Canal Zone), reinforcing my impression of this book's submissive point of view."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"This book is not without error and at least one of them is significant because it involves a major player, Senator John Tyler Morgan.In the verion I read, the author has Morgan as being from Louisiana. Tyler moved to Alabama from Tennessee as a very young child and was involved in that state's politics for more than 50 years, 30 of them as a Senator. Louisiana never sent anyone named Morgan to the Senate (and only one to the House).The book reads well, but a sloppy error like that makes you want to backtrack a lot of other information."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P.

In the case of Panama a similar situation occurs. The local Panamanian explanations exude heroic figures, intense fighting, tremendous leadership and planning skills, etc which are grossly exaggerated but appeal to local consumption. That is why this book allows for a small peek into some real history of how foreign decisions were made to build the canal, and how the locals played the cards that were dealt to them."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P.

But these shares represent only 4,662 out of a grand total of 650,000, which is less than 0.7%! The reader will decide if this is enough to justify the title of the book: Wall Street was there but for so little!The whole book is like this, based on \\"personal\\" interpretion of facts by the author to serve his goal.It is nevertheless spectacular for its title. A well thought marketing gimmick."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"Previous reviewers have demonstrated the spectrum of opinion about the events portrayed in D&iacute;az's narrative, based it seems on his own reading of the evidence. Whatever the historical significance of the Canal itself, one has to admit tha possibility that Panam&aacute;s 1903 separation was not quite the most glorious uprising against tyranny at great risk to a mass of patriots ever witnessed in the pageant of human history. Similar revisionist tales of courageous resistance, in the face of tremendous personal risk, leading to the eventual overthrow of the Noriega r&eacute;gime, by the thin upperclass of Panamanians and the very large lower middle- and poverty-ridden lower classes, are often exaggerated. I think D&iacute;az on balance got it about right: $40 million was a lot of money in those days, but neither Roosevelt nor the French nor the few Panamanians who got their pieces of the pie thought the price excessive or cared very much about the French \\"little people\\" investors who were treated like the investors in Enron, or about any trickle-down to the Panamanian poor. Nobody cares about them even now, and as for laissez-faire Wall Street policies, the less said the better at this juncture.But what is maddening about D&iacute;az's book are the typos, mistakes in basic English (\\"X stopped on the house of Y\\", but groups labor \\"in the balconies.\\") We read \\"let them on the secret\\" There are misplaced apostrophes (\\"the Chiriqui's province initial hestitation,\\" \\"the troop's salary\\") misspelling of most French terms (\\"Interoceanic for Interoc&eacute;anique\\", \\"enterprise\\" for \\"entreprise\\",) annoyingly inconsistent formations for money amounts ($40,000,000 alternates with $40 million but there are also double whammies such as the peculiar (\\"$40 million dollars\\" and ambiguous \\"$35,000 pesos\\"); and peculiar decisions about accent marks in French and Spanish both: \\"Credit\\" for \\"Cr&eacute;dit,\\" \\"charge d'affairs\\" (without the e) for \\"charg&eacute; d'affaires,\\" Col&oacute;n, s&iacute;; Panama, no; Herr&aacute;n and Agust&iacute;n, s&iacute;; Maria, Chiriqui and Gutierrez, no; Mel&eacute;ndez, s&iacute;, Nu&ntilde;ez, Diaz, Bogota, Frances and Bovedas, no; and sometimes totally consistent but weird spellings: again and again we find, \\"Obaldi&aacute;,\\" unpronounceable and just plain wrong! A tug-boat is called a \\"tug-of-war\\".D&iacute;az tells us the Canal Zone was \\"thirty miles long,\\" when it was about 56 miles long (the length of the Canal); he calls the statute on contempt of Congress \\"a congressional law\\" (is there any other kind?); Lafayette Square should be Lafayette Square, and the Catedral square in Panama City becomes Cathedral \\"Park\\". A \\"caja fuerte\\" becomes a \\"safe box\\" in English, not a \\"safe\\", an expert shot is called an \\"expert shooter.\\" Gen. Huertas married the \\"daughter of a local merchant who bore him a son,\\" though I should think the General would have preferred his father in law take a less active role in the process. He tells us TR's $40 million in 1903 dollars, was a price far greater than the $15 million Jefferson paid the French for the Louisiana territory a hundred years earlier, together with the $7 million Lincold paid for Alaska, without accounting for a century's inflation of Jefferson' dollar and 50 years of Lincoln's. So it goes.Perhaps later editions--I read the first--were corrected. An admirable book that could have used an editor, the publisher's fault, not that of the author, who is obviously fluent in at least two and probably three languages, but nobody can write a book in his second language without making a few mistakes. I presume even Jozef Conrad, a Pole who wrote in English, had a proofreader for \\"Heart of Darkness\\". A good book deserves a better presentation and for readers with an eye for precision, the many minor errors are distracting."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"I wish to thank Ovidio Diaz Espino for a well-written book that is definitely a valuable contribution to the better understanding of Panama's history and its relations with the United States.This book touches historical accounts and serves to straighten facts that are virtually unknown to many Panamanians.&quot;How Wall Street Created a Nation&quot; helps to understand Panama's social and political struggles since becoming a nation, almost one century ago.It also helps explain Panama's continuous struggle for political, economic and social stability in present times."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"As a Panamaphile, I loved this intriguing book. Perhaps the most important revelation in this book, for those who already know a lot about Panama, is that, when Washington helped the isthmus to separate from Colombia, it did so not just to build the canal but also to help US investors make huge profits. This second motive has never clearly been revealed. Much of the $20 million that Uncle Sam paid to the French Company to purchase the rights to build the canal did not go to France but right back to wallstreet."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"As the previous reviewer noted about Senator Morgan from Lousiana, I also found a error in this book. It states some of the elections from Indiana and how Roosevelt and the Democrats suffered losses in this state. We are talking of the first Roosevelt and he was a Republican, and not a Democrat. Perhaps the author or one of the proof readers made a mistake, but it gets you thinking that if they do a poor job in the basics, perhaps the author made other errors. I don't think Diaz is stretching too far when he states the Administration, certain financial interests on Wall Street, and the French banks conspired to help Panamanians get their independence in exchange for making a favorable treaty with the American government.This is a nice little book and the author makes some reasonable assertions about how Panama got its independence. Colombia had already lost Ecuador and Venezuela in the mid 1800s. Panama was not an intregal part of Colombia and the civil strife in Bogota was great. All it took was a little money (which the banks loaned) and the will of the Panamanian people, and Panama became independent. Diaz may think this clouds the reputation of Panama's founders, but I think it was inevitable what would happen to Panama."},{"Title":"How Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal","review":"There are few history books that will make history. This is one of those rare books. In only 300 pages, the author, a New York lawyer and a Panamanian, has shaken 100 years of history about how the United States gained the rights to build the Panama Canal and how his country gained its independence from Colombian on November 3, 1903 with a complex, eye-popping account that has caused a stir in his native country.To introduce a fresh view at the beginnings of the U.S. presence in Panama is no small feat considering that there are several dozens books on the library shelves about it, including a National Book Award by famed writer David McCullough. What makes Diaz-Espino's book so compelling and a must read is the fact that its conclusions are entirely logical; every event that occurred during and after the revolution can be explained through the prism of the author's main thesis, something that previous books failed to do.The author's main argument is that the secession of the republic of Panama from Colombia was planned, financed and executed under the direction of a group of Wall Street and French promoters, which included J.P. Morgan, lawyer William Nelson Cromwell, as well the heads of Citibank, Banker's Trust, and Credit Lyonnais, all of who had a lot to gain from ensuring that a Canal was built through Panama instead of Nicaragua. That is, money, and not President Theodore Roosevelt's \\"manifest destiny\\" to expand in Central America or Panamanian's desire for independence as people in Panama want to believe, led to the independence of the country 100 years ago.To someone who functions in the modern world and studies how policy is made, it seems entirely plausible that a powerful lobby well connected with the Republican Party, a trans-continental economic elite, an impetuous American President, and an expanding superpower have the right credentials to liberate this tiny Central American country whose greatest asset has always been its strategic Isthmus in which to build a canal. However, the book has caused a violent debate in Panama, where traditions die hard.Having been present at Panama's centennial celebration on November 3, 2003, I realized that the country is polarized between those who accept and those who reject the book's main argument. The former include young professionals who are suspicious of the \\"official version\\" which glorifies the founding fathers and leave no role for Americans, and who are hungry for a fact-based history made up of people with fear, greed, honor, and cowardice - people like us- which Diaz-Espino's book provides to them. The latter and more vociferous group include an unusual alliance between descendants and friends of the aristocratic founding fathers who want to cling to their past honors, and left-leaning university professors who find it hard to swallow after a century of Yankee bashing that they owe their independence to greedy American businessmen and Washington's geo-political agenda.Not since the 1977 Panama Canal treaty was debated have Panamanians so fiercely re-examined their own history vis-&agrave;-vis the American occupation which lasted one century, all thanks to the convincing evidence presented in Diaz-Espino's book. Indeed, it is a sign of a great book to stir such a debate.But Diaz-Espino's account is not only of value to Panamanians and the few Americans academics. By revealing the inner workings of how business elites gain influence and set the course of American foreign and military policy, the book is a must read for anyone interested in U.S. -Latin American relations and world politics today.Christopher CarnoyIndependent Columnist"},{"Title":"Dad To The Bone, Baby Blues Scrapbook #16","review":"I thought this was one of the best comic books I've ever read.

Very funny and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; by Oscar Wilde is a very funny play on British society in the late 1800?s and early 1900?s. The verbal barbs and jabs thrown by friends Jack and Algernon are quite amusing and quick-witted throughout the play. The idea that two women would be shallow enough to only want to marry a man named Earnest is just mind boggling, since the word earnest is almost 180 opposite the shallowness of the ladies. The mother is an interesting character in that she will not let her daughter marry the son of a &quot;hand bag&quot;, this adds a little break from the gentlemen?s verbal assault on one another and allows the reader to catch their breath. The ending is quite funny but I will not give it away, you must do yourself a favor and read the play."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is one of the funniest plays that I have ever read. It explores the British upper society at the beginning of the 20th Century. It concerns two best friends and their attempt to marry two women. The only reason that the women want to marry these men is if their first name is Earnest. The main character of the play is Jack. He goes under the assumed name of Earnest because he really does not know who his parents are. The situations and banter between Jack and his friend Algernon is the funniest since Shakespeare. This is interesting in the fact that it is very anti tragic play. It is anti tragic in the fact that by the end of the play, Jack finds out that his name is really Earnest and his is upset about it. Extremely funny play for anyone who knows anything about the British sense of royalty and nobility."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde is a wonderful playwright--truly a literary genius. Earnest is probably his best play because he has developed past the Problem Play genre and focuses all his talent on pure wit and the criticism of the frivolity of Victorian England.

In all honesty this is a phenomenal piece of literature. Wilde offers comedy of several sorts. The bickering between Jack and Algernon and the bickering between Gwendolen and Cecily is well drawn. Lady Bracknell is a dominating figure in herself. Miss Prism and the Priest are also memorable supporting characters. Wilde also offers a funny repetition of events when first Jack tries to woo Gwendolen under an alias identity and then Algernon tries to woo Cecily under the same alias identity. This makes the scene where they all meet together hilarious! But Wilde DOES NOT stop here! After the 2 men and 2 women bickered with each other, Jack and Algernon team up to win the love of their lives, and Gwendolen and Cecily team up to determine the integrity of Jack and Algernon. The end of this defines dramatic irony! (I don't want to spoil it.) Perhaps the greatest thing about this book is that Wilde skillfully balances subtle humour and major dramatic irony.

It is produced thousands of times each year all around the world from school productions to professional acting companies. The play premiered at the St. James Theatre in London on Valentine's Day 1895.The three act comedy stars Jack Worthing and (later to be revealed-his younger brother Algernon Moncrieff). Jack is courting Gwendolyn Fairfax. Algernon is in love with the beautiful young Cecily Cardew. Both of these young dandies have invented doubles. Jack acts like his name is Ernest. Algy has invented Bunbury whose ill health always requires a visit when Algy's pestiferious aunt Augustus Bracknell is in London.After countless bon motes and Wildean witticisims it is learned that Jack is really named Ernest. It is revealed that Cecily's governess Miss Prism had lost Jack when he was a baby by leaving him in a handbag at Victoria Station. Jack is, therefore, really named Ernest. Gwendolyn asserts she could never love any man unless he was named Ernest! She and Jack plan on wedding as does Algernon to the fetching Cecily.This play provides Wilde the opportunity to show off his ability to entertain while at the same time poking fun at the class conscious British aristocracy where what your name and genealogy are counts for a lot in high society.Some of this reviewer's favorite quotes from this eminently quotable play are the following:The truth is rarely pure and never simple\\"Only relatives or creditors ring in that Wagnerian mannerAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.Memory... is the diary that we all carry about with usI never travel without my diary.

After reading the first few pages it became evident pretty quickly that this was a comedy, and a pretty good one at that. There is a lot of witty banter and snide remarks throughout that make you laugh out loud. I imagine this is even funnier on the stage with the actors' body language, etc.The play demonstrates how a couple of lies can culminate into a huge quandary. You can see the train wreck coming and the anticipation builds until the train finally comes off it's tracks at the satisfying collision ... I mean culmination.The version of the book I read is full of footnotes that includes changes that have occured in the play over the years and other pertinent information to the play. There is one footnote that I found particularly interesting; it says, Franklin Dyall, who played Merriman (in the play) recalled the effect of one of his lines on the first night, \\"This [announcement] was received with the loudest and most sustained laugh that I have ever experienced, culminating in a round of applause; and as I came off Wilde said to me: 'I'm so glad you got that laugh. It shows they have followed the plot.'\\" Imagine watching your play being acted out for the first time. It must be nerve-wracking to sit there hoping that people will like it and appreciate it. It must also be extremely satisfying to see and hear the positive reactions.My wife noticed what I was reading and told me she had seen the movie and that it starred Rupert Everett as Algernon.

However, The Importance of Being Earnest is by far the best play in this collection. Two men whom are trying to get away with pulling a fast one on their girlfriends and two women who think they know whats going on.

I wasn't sure if I would like it, and I have been talking to a few friends about starting a digital book club myself, so I thought that I would participate and see how it went.The procedure was to read to a certain point by a specific date, and then comment in response to the person in charge, to post your own opinions, and have a conversation with other people who are also reading the book.I did enjoy the experience, aside from the fact that I had to post by Friday, when I think I'd prefer each post to be &#34;due&#34; on Sundays instead. I also think I'd enjoy commenting and communicating with people I know even more than with random strangers who are reading the book at the same time.

If you are looking for a short read (free digitally on Kindle, iPad, Nook, etc.) that is humorous, this is the book for you.The book is about two friends, Algernon and Jack, who have alter egos that love to party and get into trouble. Both friends fall head-over-heels in love with women who demand that their mates have the name of Ernest. As impractical and strange as this sounds, the book is funny and filled with ridiculous quotes such as these:Algernon: &#34;The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to someone else, if she is plain.&#34; (p. 17)Jack: &#34;Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely good friends. I'll bet anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.&#34; Algernon: &#34;Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.&#34; (p. 17)Miss Prism: &#34;No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.&#34; Chasuble: &#34;And often, I've been told, not even to her.&#34; (p. 26)and the last one I will quote so as not to spoil all of them for you. . .Lady Bracknell's opinion of marriage and engagements, which is hilarious: &#34;To speak frankly, I am not in the favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.&#34; (p. 51).*The page numbers are based on my free Kindle edition.It might be silly to say, but I honestly always forget that classic books can be funny, as &#34;The Importance of Being Earnest&#34; so classically is. It's the same with black and white movies. I always seem to think that old, classic movies or books are going to be dull and boring. Then when I read one (or see one) I am surprised at how much I enjoy it and how easy it is to relate to some of the things going on in the books.

If you like to laugh, read it and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" remains one of my favorite comedies of manners. As Wilde takes aim at the superficialities of his time, he captures the universal foibles of human nature. I have shared this play with tennagers from more than 70 countries over more than 10 years, and it is always a hit."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is one of the best plays I've ever read! I had seen the movie, of course, and knew what to expect, but somehow reading it was even better. Having a general idea of what was coming also made some of the smaller jokes more evident. Trust me, this is one you don't want to pass by!"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is a fun and extremely well written readable little play.

Getting it for free made it even more worth it. Love the Kindle !"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I loved it. The wit of the dialogues is something that I rarely find in books or movies. The humor has originality, the irony is catching. It makes me laugh when the characters' remarks, upside down from what one would call desirable or normal, are yet so fitting to how a large part of the society thinks. It could be that Wilde intended to severely criticize society, but I remained with an impression of how funny the world is with its inconsistencies, little vices and flaws. Funny in a lovable way. What trouble would we be in if there were nothing to ironise? Perfect reason, perfect honesty, perfect altruism and other such perfections are deeply flawed, firstly for not having anything amusing about them :)."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Wilde's plays hold up incredibly well and provide some of the most quotable one-liners in literature. A master of satire, in these selections the upper classes and the social conventions they adhered to are skewered through the ingenious use of word play ,mistaken identity and farce. The Importance Of Being Earnest is as fine an example of the genre apart from Shakespeare's comedies that you are likely to come across. Since Wilde's work is of more recent vintage the language is very accessible and the nuance easier to perceive. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The amazing language and simple truths in their world turned up side down made into a delightful story that is just Oscar Wilde at his best"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The book had many wit full sayings and was short but it was memorable. The importance over the name Earnest is quite strange and stupid.Recommended for readers who like plays and Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A pathologically witty play--signaled immediately by the pun lurking in the title--which punctures the trivial bubble of Victorian society. The text reads with the rapidity of Voltaire's Candide, so the comedy's pace must be absolutely white hot in performance. The actors would have to wait for the laughter to die down, a real challenge with this farce. One should, of course, see it on the stage, and I must admit that I've never had that pleasure. I will try to remedy that omission before I die!

And I confirm this feeling with this play I really loved. It's funny to noticethat the play is already 100 years old and still seems like it has been written a few days ago.The style of the dialogues is pitch-perfect. I've never found such a mastery in Wilde's dialoguesin his other plays, maybe except in Salome. It is quite easy to read, and absolutely hilarious fromthe beginning to the end. The author shows with a great sense of humour through a smart use of wordsthe triviality of social conventions during the Victorian period. The irony is often present, as wellas the twists and turns.Maybe can I only regret it was quite short, and I would have appreciated to be immersed a little bit longerin this delightful atmosphere.

I have so many nuggets from my recent indulgence of Oscar Wilde's witty, fun, original, and rhythmical play, \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\".Every phrase and expression is a thought worth enjoying and applying to our life today. The play on words, the glittering conversation, the unexpected turn of phrases, it's deliciously clever and a classic it remains forever. I've made a note of catching the play someday!You must simply just read the play - it's only 3 acts. It is short and sweet and the use of language is pure and unique.

I am being facetious, of course. It is words masking the confused identities of two young men in search of amusements and loves. The names baffle even the chief characters. Wittily it is allowed that it is possible to make an accommodation to the prospect of a considerable fortune. Character is considered, but more in the breach. Wilde wanted the charm to be in the dialogue, and it is."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I have never laughed harder or louder, I have never read more delicious, cynical, intellectual, twisted and poignant book than this. \\"In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.\\" \\" it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me?\\" The painfully sarcastic humor in this play mocking the seriousness about life's triviality is brutally relevant to our culture, and I am sure we can all relate to 'bunburyism'.

Oscar Wilde had a great talent for dialogue and writing, but the real fun comes in the ingenious plotting and the side-splitting comments. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is absolutely filled with insightful, humorous barbs that take jabs at society - you'll literally be laughing out loud every page.Not only is the play brilliantly ironic and witty, it's quite cheerful and good-natured. The characters are likable, the plot never takes itself too seriously, and the ending is happy. It seems that Wilde knew exactly what he wanted: to write a light-hearted, amusing play without serious overtones, and he succeeded wildly. This isn't to say that he sacrificed any literary qualities, as the play is recognized for the marvelous writing, but it is considerably more fun and entertaining than many other literary works.In sum, Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is a classic in every sense of the word, and it's tremendously fun to read.

Great play that's fun in script form, too. Holds up well over time."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"One thing happens when you read Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\"; you are amazed to remember that this play was authored over 100 years ago. For most plays of that era, the average reader tends to lose references and it tends to be stodgy and irrelevant. Not so Earnest, due to the brilliance and imagination of it's playwright.The Importance of Being Earnest is a tour de force of comedy, misidentifications, and farce. Algernon and Jack are friends, and each has invented an imaginary person as an excuse of getting out of engagements. Jack's person is Ernest, a brother with a wild past. The two conspire to woo the ladies that they love, and through a series of happenstances, must gently deceive to get want they want. The end result is a play of uncomperable quality, chock full of witticisms that are highly quotable out of context. In fact, I dare suggest the entire play is quotable, such its brilliance.Wilde pulled no punches when writing Earnest. Often, when a play is filled with memorable quotes, it takes away from the realism of the scenes because the characters then become merely conduits for the writer's intellect. Not so in Earnest. Wilde manages to make the characters say exactly what they would say in each situation, true to their persona. That alone is quite an accomplishment, one not often seen.Misidentities, witty banter, love, all conspire to one of English's most brilliant comedies ever to have seen the stage. We should be so lucky the world had Oscar Wilde in it, and even more so, that he wrote at all."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People&quot; is one of the first plays written in English since the works of Shakespeare that celebrates the language itself. Oscar Wilde's comedy has one advantage over the classic comedies of the Bard in that &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is as funny today as it was when it was first performed at the St. Jame's Theater in London on February 14, 1895. After all, enjoying Shakespeare requires checking the bottom for footnotes explaining the meaning of those dozens of words that Shakespeare makes up in any one of his plays. But Wilde's brilliant wit, his humor and social satire, remain intact even though he was a writer of the Victorian era.Wilde believed in art for art's own sake, which explains why he emphasized beauty while his contemporaries were dealing with the problems of industrial England. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is set among the upper class, making fun of their excesses and absurdities while imbuing them with witty banter providing a constant stream of epigrams. The play's situation is simple in its unraveling complexity. Algernon Moncrieff is an upper-class English bachelor who is visited by his friend Jack Worthing, who is known as &quot;Ernest.&quot; Jack has come to town to propose to Gwendolen Fairfax, the daugher of the imposing Lady Bracknell and Algy's first cousin. Jack has a ward named Cecily who lives in the country while Algernon has an imaginary friend named &quot;Bunbury&quot; whom he uses as an excuse to get out of social engagements.Jack proposes to Gwendolen but has two problems. First, Gwendolen is wiling to agree because his name is Ernest, a name that &quot;seems to inspire absolute confidence,&quot; but which, of course, is not his true Christian name. Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word &quot;earnest,&quot; almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be &quot;Ernest,&quot; by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of &quot;Bunburying&quot; is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., &quot;It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal&quot; and &quot;I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance&quot;). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a fantastic play. It is an easy read, and is not only well thought out, but hilarious.I liked this book of the play especially, because it includes helpful notes in the beginning, but more because it has a glossary of difficult terms in the back.

It appears that people have forgotten how to act comedy. The Importance of Being Earnest has admittedly been cast in the shadow of the famous 1952 movie for all eternity. Edith Evans's lady Bracknell in that movie is a hard act to follow but the eccentric British actress Miriam Margoyles is the only one of the cast in this sorry new recording to understand and be able to play a part in a famous play that is performed in words only.The male characters both whine their words with little understanding of how to make them fall into place and become part of the larger whole in fact it sounds like a recording of a first run through with the scripts.What really kills this recording is the director's decision to have a narrator read the stage directions. As if we are half wits who can't work out what's going on without being told that \\"an electric bell rings\\" when immediately after a character will respond and explain what the noise is and what is signifying - Duh!!!This is not the way to make an audio recording of a play and even though it is the only recording of Earnest on CD this is not the one to have. John Gielgud directed himself and Edith Evans in a classic (but cut) version for EMI in the 1950's which has been occasionally available on cassette and Harper Collins have re-issued the 1960's Caedmon recording on cassette which is also an excellent production. It was a sad event in Caedmon's history when Harper Collins acquired them, the incredible collection of spoken word recordings all but disappeared from sight but now a few have been released on cassette and even a few have seen new life on compact disc. Better wait for the EMI set or look out for the Caedmon, either are better than this pathetic attempt."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I just got finished reading this for class, and it's simply one of the best works I have read in the past year.

However, due to a class that I am enrolled in, not only do I now know who he is but I am blessed to have been introduced to his work.The Importance of Being Earnest, makes a very humorous yet profound commentary on money, marriage, status and image as it pertains to the aristocracy of that time. It seems that Oscar Wilde utilized this medium of artistic expression to cleverly expose the twisted way that those with wealth perceived themselves and the lengths they would go to the preserve that perception. It has been referred to as a \\"comedy of manners\\" because so much of what defined or distinguished the aristocracy from the common man was not necessarily the wealth that they actually had but what men and women did to appear like they had it.Ernest, who is the main character in the play, has done all of what is necessary to appear as though he comes from wealth. He wears the clothing, keeps the company and talks the talk of the aristocrat. However what he soon finds out is that all of those whom he is trying to impress and fit in with, have more unresolved issues in their closet than he does. I believe Wilde addresses this social paradox with impeccable wit and an amazing sense of human psychology. He not only challenged those who belonged to the aristocracy to examine what they placed value in, but continues to challenge each reader today, that these superficial values might not stand as valuable at all."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"In Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", he answers this question in the form of brilliant comedy. The play, full of witty dialogue such as Lady Bracknell's answer to her daughter's suitor saying he does smoke; \\"I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.\\"; says, yes, it is important to be Earnest.One of the more remarkable details of this play is in the title itself. While attending or reading the play, you learn, that the two heroine's of the piece, Gwendolyn and Cecily, are determined to marry men named Earnest; unfortunately, Jack wants to marry Gwendolyn, and Algernon would like to settle down with Cecily. What is the reasonable solution? To tell them that their name's are Earnest. However, Earnest is not only a name, but also a word meaning: an intensely serious state of mind. Why would Oscar Wilde choose the name Earnest for this seemingly ridiculous play anyway?Why ridiculous you may ask. The answer comes in not only the ingenious dialogue, but in the plot itself. Without giving away the entire story, one can say that the two main characters live, however innocent, deceptive lives and still end up with the fair maiden's in the end. One of them even ends up really being Earnest, to which he answers, \\"... it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but truth...\\"Wilde called his piece, \\"A trivial comedy for serious people.\\" If the word earnest means serious and the play itself is joyfully absurd, this writer imagines that the characters in the play although exceptionally serious about themselves and their lives, they are trivial or ridiculous. In conclusion, I would say that this play is not only suited for the serious mind, this play is uproariously fun for all of us who appreciate good humor."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is such a joy.

I did expect a lot from Wilde's plays, but I certainly wasn't prepared for so enthralling a read. I cannot but be amused at those people who continue to rant that Oscar Wilde was a perfect example of style over substance, that he never wrote anything serious, or if he did it will be forgotten at expense of his social comedies, and that he was nothing but tons of epigrams. First of all, it doesn't require a brilliant intelligence to realise that most of Wilde's epigrams are dead serious - indeed, that's where their enduring value lies; on the surface it's all fun of course, but just a little below there is a fierce social satire and just about unparalleled insight into human nature. As Bernard Shaw wisely observed once, ''nothing is more serious than great humour.'' He might well have spoken about Oscar. Unfortunately, there are two major disappointments that detract from the value of the book as a whole. But everything in time.The Penguin Classics edition is an almost complete one. It contains six plays written between 1891 and 1895, at the time when Wilde was growing more and more famous as a dramatist, and it omits only his two early attempts from the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880) and The Duchess of Padua (1883). The six plays in this volume fall into two strikingly different categories: four of them are the classical social comedies Oscar Wilde is most famous for, namely Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, whereas Salome and A Florentine Tragedy can be broadly and ineptly described as historical and rather tragic plays. Before going into some detail about the plays themselves, few words about the editorial work.The introduction of Richard Allen Cave is dull and tedious stuff one may skip without fear of missing anything of any importance. It starts promisingly, with the famous dichotomy between Wilde the brilliant wordsmith and Wilde the subversive homosexual, but than Mr Cave unfortunately switched to, and continued to be concerned with until the end, abominably mundane matters like Wilde's stage directions and the spatial relationships between his characters. The best I can say about this introduction is that Mr Cave is certainly very capable of extracting a good deal of tenuous and ultimately unimportant, not to say preposterous, relationships between the visual side of Wilde's plays and their force as social satire. I confess the first time I read this introduction I skipped half of it. But then I was ashamed and read it again, this time completely and conscientiously. I wish I hadn't. Perfect waste of time.Be warned also that the introduction is rife with spoilers and should be read - if at all - only after the plays.A word about the editor's meticulous notes must be made too. It is of course extremely annoying to constantly consult them when they are in the end of the book, but I daresay the notes could not have been printed otherwise: they are much too copious for that. Well, one doesn't really need to consult them; indeed, one must not do this. The notes are sometimes insightful, but more often than not they are concerned with largely irrelevant matters like publication history, revisions of certain passages or long-winded and pompous speculations about Wilde's apparent allusions. Worst of all, the notes often make explicit crucial details of the plots long before Wilde intended to reveal them. To say that such cases spoil the pleasure of Wilde's meticulous craftsmanship is a spectacular understatement. I imagine the best way is to read the plays once without referring to the notes at all and only then, on second reading when one is already reasonably familiar with the plots, one should peruse the plays more carefully together with constant excursions to the end of the book. For all verbose junk they contain, the notes are occasionally highly revealing in terms of specific meaning of some words in the vastly different social context of those times, or elucidating Wilde's elaborate, yet subtle and subversive, network of hints, allusions and metaphors.Salome was my first major disappointment in the volume. Written originally in French in 1891 and later translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas himself if the dedication is to be believed (actually, scholars now believe, Wilde himself did the job), the play was for many years banned and attacked as immoral, indecent and other such adjectives that are more likely to stimulate audience's interest more than anything else. With its extravagant metaphors, fantastic imagery and verbose repetitions, Salome is more akin to Wilde's second volume of fairy tales, but the play has neither their power nor their affecting quality. The story is the well-known and perfectly gruesome one from the Bible about Salome, the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, and John the Baptist (here named in Hebrew fashion, Jokanaan). The play has some nice satirical touches, mostly in the character of the very practical Herodias, with her memorable line ''I do not believe in miracles. I have seen too many.'', and there are some hints of serious discussions about religion and God, but on the whole it is a lame sruff and makes a tedious read; fortunately it's one-act affair, and rather short at that. Perhaps I have read it in the wrong mood.A Florentine Tragedy is a very singular piece. It is written in blank verse and apparently set in Renaissance Italy; ''apparently'' because nothing is mentioned in the stage directions and one must rely on subtle hints in the text. Scholars have argued that the play is just a fragment from an unfinished work, but it's perfectly sufficient as it is. I can't say that I find reading blank verse easy, but the play is very short (less than 20 pages) and it makes a very absorbing read indeed. There are but three characters - the merchant Simone, his wife Bianca and the Florentine prince Guido - who form a chilling love triangle that leads, predictably considering the title, to a tragic conclusion. The amazing thing is that Wilde has managed to achieve a very neat twist in the end. In combination with the swift exchange of blunt remarks, the play makes a very enjoyable read.The rest four plays in this book are (mostly) Oscar Wilde at his absolute best as a playwright; I call these superb pieces of drama ''social comedies'' only with trepidation, for they are as much concerned with the individual as with society, and they are far more serious than they are comic. The only exception, regrettably, is the most famous of them. Although each of the plays has a special character, all of them share several remarkable similarities.They are all set in the present, 1890s that is, and the action is limited in time to no more than 24 hours during which dark passions and shady secrets from many past years relentlessly surface. They all contain tons of amusing epigrams as only Oscar Wilde, the scintillating wordsmith, can forge but none of them is on the whole a flippant or superficial affair; as for Wilde's pace of action and sense for dramatic climax, they are invariably well-nigh perfect. Perhaps what impresses me most strongly in these plays is the large diversity of characters that each one of them contains. Virtuous and vicious form a sublime counterpoint here, if I am allowed a musical analogy. Both among the male and the female characters the variety is impressive, if repetitive. Usually there are those who talk almost entirely in epigrams and take a decidedly flippant attitude towards life but in fact turn out to have a more secure grip of it than all other characters; and of course there are also prigs and prudes, moralists and cynics, social climbers and social outcasts, people in love and people in lust: you name it, separately or in various combinations. The verbal skirmish is guaranteed and so is the engrossing entertainment. When it comes to hypocrisy, conceit, shallowness, snobbishness, prejudice or stupidity - social or individual - Oscar Wilde is charmingly witty and devastatingly merciless. In both directions.For the most part Wilde's stage directions are very sparse and consist almost entirely of characters' movements and brief descriptions of the surroundings; usually he also gives the reactions of all participants in the most dramatic scenes, but otherwise there is next to nothing about appearance, clothing or the manner in which certain lines are spoken. Yet the characters come to life with astonishing vividness and verisimilitude, entirely through dialogue. Another amazing thing about these plays: no character speaks out of character, ever. Now that is quite an achievement. Considering the severe stringency of drama, Wilde's character are remarkably complex and alive. Last but not least, actually most important of all, there are always several points of view, often conveyed by different characters but sometimes adroitly combined in one. The awesome collision of values, morals, fears and feelings is absolutely never one-sided, no matter whether one agrees with Wilde's conclusions or not. Unfortunately, I repeat, The Importance of Being Earnest is rather an exception from most of the above.Perhaps the most striking, and surprising, overall conclusion to draw about all four of Wilde's ''social comedies'' is that Oscar is unabashed sentimentalist. Now such an attitude is not exactly my cup of tea, but in this particular case it seems that it doesn't matter a bit. I certainly haven't used it to degrade Wilde's plays and have nothing but contempt for those who do. In conclusion of the general part, it might be worth noting that the plays are printed in the order of their writing but in no way need they be read so; from the very beginning of his four years of theatrical success, Oscar Wilde was a supreme master of his craft. Now let's look more carefully into each of these gems.Lady Windermere's Fan is my greatest favourite. It is superb on all fronts. For once, the blend of wit and wisdom, flippancy and profoundness, is brought to utmost perfection. The play is extremely clever in its construction, with all improbabilities masterfully handled and with simply mind-blowing dramatic climaxes. Oscar certainly knew very well how to pace and construct drama in a most gripping manner. In this play he has also surpassed himself as regards to variety of characters. None of the next three works, fine as they are, may offer so vast a range of completely different personalties, all of them brilliantly conveyed by sparkling dialogue. Nor has Wilde ever again succeeded in creating so convincing a bundle of contradictions as Mrs Erlynne. I can certainly say that she is one of the most charming and lovable characters ever put down on paper in drama, fiction or non-fiction; considerable achievement since in the beginning of the play she is definitely despicable. Her transformation in the course of these four acts is unbelievable - from a heartless creature to one with a golden heart - yet absolutely convincing and deeply affecting. Last but not least, the play has an astounding finale which is in itself a masterpiece: it is neither happy nor unhappy, everybody is sincere and at the same time hiding something behind his or her guilty conscience.A Woman of No Importance has a fabulously disappointing conclusion, appallingly melodramatic and sentimental. Sometimes I do hanker for a more seriously cynical attitude in Wilde's plays; it would have made them so much more real and relevant. But no matter how much I may baulk at Oscar's attitude, I can't find any fault with his integrity even here. His characters act thoroughly in character, bizarre whims and all, and he gives - as usual - a great deal of thought-provoking stuff on both sides of a conundrum. On the one side of the baricade are Mrs. Arbuthnot, her son Gerald and above all the american girl Hester Worsley; they are obviously the virtuous characters with high moral principles, and though they may look somewhat one-dimensional, or even ridiculous, they are as alive as it is possible for any character in drama to be. On the other side are the somewhat cynical, but full of common sense, Mrs. Allonby and above all Lord Illingworth, one of those pleasure-seeking whose only aim in life is to get as much fun of it as possible. The clash is tremendously effective and beautifully executed. One of the greatests assets of the play are the remarkably vivid minor characters such the brutally foolish Lady Stutfield, the kindly class-conscious Lady Hunstanton and mercileslly irreverent Lady Caroline are quite a treat to enjoy; Oscar has done a wonderful job with all of them. Despite the nauseating affectation and rhetoric of the finale, the play is stimulating enough to guarantee unforgettable experience. It will be re-read in future with great pleasure.An Ideal Husband constitutes an interesting exception among Wilde's plays, for it has unusually detailed stage directions ranging from the manner of speaking to complete descriptions of the appearance and the character of the characters. As it might be expected these are stupendous fun to read; imagine a woman looking like ''a work of art, on the whole, but showing the influence of too many schools''. Downright brilliant! The only slightly annoying detail in these descriptions is that Wilde cannot resist the temptation to like any of his characters to those of one painter or another; it looks like cheap show-off of ''culture''. Nevertheless, the plays is a very powerful one, perhaps the darkest and most intense of all. It is a little unusual because it is a variation of ''a man with a past'' theme, rather than the more traditional variant where it is woman who has to hide some ignominious secret from her wild youth. At any rate the play raises a number of profoundly important questions. Is blameless life blemished by a single dishonesty? Should one be judged so harshly because of one's wild youth? Should one love to the point of idealisation? Should one be blind for the faults of the the loved ones? What is the nature of true love? Does it make any sense in this world? Is it powerful enough to overcome pity or moral horror? There are many more such questions in this play - and quite a few answers too.By the way, I take issue with reviewers who label this play as ''sexist''. It is nothing of the kind. Lord Goring does have one or two rather sexist lines but neither his character nor the play on the whole have anything to do with sexism. Indeed, since the last word and the noblest act are saved for one of the main heroines, the play is more like a feminist one actually, or a sexist one reversed if you like. Certainly there are in these four acts a great deal more important things than that.The Importance of Being Earnest is generally considered Wilde's best play. I really don't know why. It is significantly inferior to the three previous ones in a number of aspects. To begin with, it is no comedy but pure farce, which is already a severe limitation. It is by far the most flippant, artificial and improbable of them all, and far less convincing too. Nor does it match any of the other three masterpieces in terms of wit and wisdom. The range of characters and the depth of characterisation cannot hold a candle to any other member of the quartet either. The dialogue is vastly amusing, of course, but the pointless banter often continues for a little too long and it gets tedious; and fun for fun's sake hardly makes any more sense than art for art's sake. The play has a pleasant twist in the end which, however, sounds unpleasantly contrived and unnatural, not to say inane and ridiculous. It is hardly a coincidence that it is the only one in three acts for it is certainly the least substantial of all. I daresay it is a riveting spectacle on the stage but a truly great play surely must be great on paper as well. In short, The Importance of Being Earnest, even if it may pass for a comedy, does lack precisely what makes a great comedy: seriousness. It is a very good play but it is very far from a great one. Alone, it might earn five stars for the deliberately light, though wonderful, entertainment which in fact it is; but compared to the three social comedies, pointless yet inevitable as such comparisons are, it deserves no more than three stars. I understand it is supposed to be the zenith of Oscar's masterpieces for the stage. So far as I am concerned, it is definitely the nadir.That said, The Importance of Being Earnest is a riot to read, if one can somehow detach it from Oscar's great plays of course. It has a lot of swift action and, as might be expected, the embarrassing situations of double-identity mischief are brilliantly handled. I suppose the play looks way better on the stage than on paper, which is, perhaps, how it should be for plays are written to be staged, not read. But I remain convinced, perhaps irrationally, that a truly great play must be great on paper as well. Though in that particular case this is certainly not the case, Oscar's sharp wit shines through and makes it a worthwhile read; alas, it is only occasionally allied to anything like wisdom. Wilde's superb characterisation still reigns supreme, even in his slightest efforts. The young ladies are somewhat colourless, but Lady Bracknell is all but unforgettable. The contrast between the two young man - the bohemian Algie and the priggish Jack - is conveyed as only Oscar Wilde could.When all is said and done, taken as a whole body of work, Wilde's plays only convince me once more in his extraordinary genius, literary and not only. Despite two major flaws, one of them appallingly unexpected, this volume of Wilde's plays is a book to be treasured."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Still very vibrant and still amazingly witty for today.

It was a peak that was to be cut short by the sensational trial that sent him to jail for two years because of homosexual actions. While one does not need to know Wilde's background to enjoy the play, some insight into what certain words might have meant in Victorian slang certainly put a different twist on the play. In the \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" Wilde uses humor to turn conventional relationships and staid Victorian morality on its head.The play centers around two men, Jack and Algernon. Jack wants to propose to Algernon's cousin Gwendolen, but her mother does not think him an eligible bachelor. Not to mention the fact that Gwendolen believes Jack to be named Ernest and that there is a whole slew of things he has keep hidden from her. Algernon tells Jack that he is a Bunburyist, for he pretends to have a brother so he can come up to the city (that would be Ernest) while Algernon pretends to have an invalid friend named Bunbury so that he can escape to the country. When Gwendolen asks Jack for his country address, Algernon overhears and heads out to Jack's house, pretending to be his brother Ernest, so that he can meet Jack's ward, Cecily. The two fall in love, for Cecily always wanted to marry someone named Ernest. This is all to Jack's chagrin when he arrives on the scene and finds he must confess the truth to Gwendolen. Yet the convoluted plot has a way of working out for the best of everyone involved.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is an extremely thin plotted play, which allows Wilde's witticisms and humor to shine through. Throughout there is a strand of anti-marriage jokes and unexpected reversals of the expected sayings.

This is Wilde at his irreverent best as he repeatedly skewers as many aspects of late 19th Century English society as he can manage.I've occasionally heard the term \\"joke density\\" applied to comedy writing, and The Importance of Being Ernest certainly has that. Every character in the play is witty, and the jabs, barbs, and puns come fast and furious.The story centers on two somewhat roguish young bachelors who have both created elaborate lies to help them to cover for their mischief. At different points in the play, both gentlemen have assumed the false name of Ernest, which becomes a problem once two women become involved. Two women who are both particularly enamored with the idea of marrying someone named Ernest.The tightly plotted play has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, and the witty dialogue never lets up.The Avon (a HarperCollins imprint) paperback edition that I read contained a short collection of critical essays, the most interesting being a (mostly negative) review by George Bernard Shaw of the original production of the play, which raises some interesting points about the nature of comedy. I found some good insights into the career of Oscar Wilde in the introduction and the other critical pieces, but those familiar with his life and work would not be missing much by skipping these \\"bonus features\\".The play itself was a really enjoyable work to read, and I'll keep an eye out for a chance to catch a performance of it sometime."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"There is just no reason to not like this play!

Every situation, every word, every piece of this dialogue is full of smartness and intelligence. The only aim of the play is to show us how absurd strict social canons are. Life is extremely more fun than the respect of such rules that destroy any kind of pleasure or happy turns of events. Good society is thus turned upside down and the best instance of such humorous antics is the fact that the son of a general was officially born in a handbag deposited in the cloakroom of Victoria Station, the Brighton Line. How ridiculous ! How funny, ah ah and funny, strange ! Oscar Wilde shows how vain all appearances are because appearances may hide deeper things that are of far more important value than these appearances. This play is thus a constant and perfect example of comedy. But in spite of this light appearance of the play, we can feel the deeper suffering of Oscar Wilde who is very serious about the absurdity of keeping up appearances instead of taking only character into account. In other words, this comedy is a sign of the total decay of such higher society that is nothing but a pretty face with nothing behind, nothing in the head or the brain. It is a call for a real society based on human values like love, truthfulness, faithfulness. All twists in the social fabric create unconceivable embroglios that lead to entanglements and other difficulties. Things would be so simple if men and women could just follow their inclinations and their deep sentiments. We also find in this comedy a deep marivaux-ian influence : Marivaux loved in his play to alter identities, but among girls, to test the love of men. Here it is the men who have altered identities and it leads to testing their ability at sacrificing such entangled situations for the love of a girl. There is also a strong recollection of Shakespeare who enjoyed turning his girls into boys in his comedies, but once again to test the love of men, to see without being seen, for women. Oscar Wilde, in the social setting of a Victorian society, is just as witty and funny as Shakespeare in say As you Like It, or say again A Midsummer Night's Dream. And life turns Aunt Augusta, alias Lady Bracknell into the ass of the fable.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is one of the CLASSICS!I remember acting in this at school, I've seen it in professional theater and recently heard the audio book presentation.Very funny, even more so when you consider it is now 100 years old, and was probably the scandal of the day when it came out.

The Importance of Being Earnest was a joy to read and has been on the ap literature test in years past."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This year, I set out to complete a classic book challenge being offered on many book blogs. Among the items I needed to read was a classic play. Wary of Shakespeare, I turned to Oscar Wilde to fulfill that requirement. Boy, am I glad I did! \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is delightful.The story revolves around two friends, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff. Jack lives in the country but is always going to London to deal with his good-for-nothing brother, Ernest. However, his London friends know him as Ernest, and this \\"brother\\" doesn't actually exist. Algernon, meanwhile, is a London dandy who periodically takes off for the country to visit his dying friend, Bunbury (who also does not exist). When Algernon discoveres Jack's secret, he is anxious to visit Jack at home and meet his young ward, Cecily. He arrives at the estate, claiming to be the scandalous Ernest.Naturally, hijinks ensue. Jack is in love with Algernon's cousin Gwendolyn, who insists she could only ever love a man named Ernest. Cecily is also enamoured with a man of that name. Of course, both men cannot be Ernest. And this is where the comedy lies.The play is very short (my copy clocks in at 90 pages) but it is extremely funny. I'd seen the Colin Firth film version a few years ago and was happy to see that it was fairly faithful to the original text. Gwendolyn's mother, Lady Bracknell, is equally as witty in the book as she is in the film, and Oscar Wilde demonstrates his sharp wit at every turn."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book was quite a surprise (and a riot).

GUFFAW. Girl puhleeze. Everybody tripping over this book is on some ish.This is one of the most eye-roll inducing stories I've read in a quick minute. The characters are so implausible as to be unlikable. Aunt Augusta is a complete gold digging witch. Algernon is weird and the women are dolts. The ladies have a bizarre hang up on only marrying guys named Earnest and we have no idea why.**SPOILER ALERT**So let me get this straight, it just so happens that John, who really had no reason whatsoever to tell people that his name was \\"Earnest,\\" just so happened to be left in a purse on a train by Aunt Augusta's maid. Magically, he finds out that he's Algernon's brother and his name actually is \\"Earnest John\\" after his father. This is the same father that he shares with Algernon and yet somehow everybody forgot what the father's name was so Oscar Wilde had to spend about a page describing looking up the name in military records. Totally unnecessary and stupid.Anyway, wow, good for John/Earnest that Deus Ex Machina was employed because now he can get married to Gwendolen because she wasn't going to marry him because him name was John... never mind this new turn of events makes them first cousins. Oscar Wilde... \\"Aw HELL no.\\""},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This play is quite amusing and it is not very difficult to read. I think it does not earn more stars because you already know at the beginning how this play probably will end. Sometimes I had to wonder about the stupidity of the personnages, I mean they act in such a stupid mannor. I do not like the end because the author did not think about a fitting end before writing the book and so I had the impression that he just invented the end. This play is quite amusing to fill up time, but it is not so good that I would read it twice."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty man. The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde's most well-known work, is dripping with sharp humor and clever epigrams. But let's face it, it's fluff. The \\"social satire\\" that most reviewers cite to hold this book up as High Art is as pointed as a teaspoon and as sincere as a used-car salesman. Wilde was a libertine dandy who admired the snobbery and elitism of blue-blooded Britons. The Importance of Being Earnest is, in many ways, like MTV--stylish and entertaining, with some pretensions, but ultimately just a vacuous time-killer. If you need to read it for class, or even better want some literary [bathroom] reading, fine. If not, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I have decided that since so many people are obviously blind to how dumb this play is, I should write a review to enlighten anyone that might read it. The humor is dated and because of that, very boring. The situations are completely inconceivable and it makes no sense! The characters are flat and serve no real purpose. I suggest that no one else ever ever read this play."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A quick and entertaining read, Oscar Wilde's comic portrayal of 19th century upper-class intrigue is filled with witty, bantering dialogue. Two friends, Algernon and Jack, perfect the art of \\"Bunburying,\\" which consists of inventing ill or troublemaking friends and relatives in order to get out of social engagements. Of course, this can only backfire and lead to confusion, particularly as Jack's fictitious brother Ernest shows up unexpectedly at the home of Cecily, Jack's ward and the woman Algernon hopes to marry. As Wilde pokes fun at the upper class and the deceptiveness inherent in its elaborate social protocol, the final irony comes when the hapless deceivers find they may have been inadvertently earnest all along."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I bought this script because I have so enjoyed the movie based on it. The English humor is brilliant and it is delightful to get to read it in probably less than an hour.

Upon reading the work, I find that it doesn't suffer in the reading as well. Wilde is likely the most witty person to have ever lived. He claimed he was at least. His works, of course, reflect that genius. In particular, \\"The Importance of Being Ernest\\" does. If you're going to experience only one of Wilde's plays, this is the one. The plot is delightfully silly and turns on itself several times. And the word-play is hilarious, and still fresh after more than a century. I'm pretty sure that this play will never grow old."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People\\" is one of the first plays written in English since the works of Shakespeare that celebrates the language itself. Oscar Wilde's comedy has one advantage over the classic comedies of the Bard in that \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is as funny today as it was when it was first performed at the St. Jame's Theater in London on February 14, 1895. After all, enjoying Shakespeare requires checking the bottom for footnotes explaining the meaning of those dozens of words that Shakespeare makes up in any one of his plays. But Wilde's brilliant wit, his humor and social satire, remain intact even though he was a writer of the Victorian era.Wilde believed in art for art's own sake, which explains why he emphasized beauty while his contemporaries were dealing with the problems of industrial England. \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is set among the upper class, making fun of their excesses and absurdities while imbuing them with witty banter providing a constant stream of epigrams. The play's situation is simple in its unraveling complexity. Algernon Moncrieff is an upper-class English bachelor who is visited by his friend Jack Worthing, who is known as \\"Ernest.\\" Jack has come to town to propose to Gwendolen Fairfax, the daugher of the imposing Lady Bracknell and Algy's first cousin. Jack has a ward named Cecily who lives in the country while Algernon has an imaginary friend named \\"Bunbury\\" whom he uses as an excuse to get out of social engagements.Jack proposes to Gwendolen but has two problems. First, Gwendolen is wiling to agree because his name is Ernest, a name that \\"seems to inspire absolute confidence,\\" but which, of course, is not his true Christian name. Second, Lady Bracknell objects to Jack as a suitor when she learns he was abandoned by his parents and found in a handbag in Victoria Station by Mr. Thomas Cardew. Meanwhile, Algernon heads off to the country to check out Cecily, to whom he introduces himself as being her guardian Jack's brother Ernest. This meets with Ceclily's approval because in her diary she has been writing about her engagement to a man named Ernest. Then things get really interesting.Wilde proves once and for all time that the pun can indeed be elevated to a high art form. Throughout the entire play we have the double meaning of the word \\"earnest,\\" almost to the level of a conceit, since many of the play's twists and turns deal with the efforts of Jack and Algernon to be \\"Ernest,\\" by lying, only to discover that circumstances makes honest men of them in the end (and of the women for that matter as well). There is every reason to believe that Wilde was making a point about earnestness being a key ideal of Victorian culture and one worthy of being thoroughly and completely mocked. Granted, some of the puns are really bad, and the discussion of \\"Bunburying\\" is so bad it is stands alone in that regard, but there is a sense in which the bad ones only make the good ones so glorious and emphasize that Wilde is at his best while playing games with the English language.But if Wilde's puns are the low road then his epigrams represent the heights of his genius, especially when they are used by the characters in an ironic vein (e.g., \\"It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal\\" and \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance\\"). Jack is the male lead, but it is Algernon who represents the ideal Wilde character, who insists he is a rebel speaking out against the institutions of society, such as marriage, but with attacks that are so flamboyant and humorous that the cleverness of the humor ends up standing apart from the inherent point.In the end, \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is the wittiest play every written, in English or any other language, and I doubt that anything written in the future will come close. Wilde was essentially a stand-up comedian who managed to create a narrative in which he could get off dozens of classic one-liners given a high-class sheen by being labeled epigrams. Like a comedian he touches on several topics, from the aristocracy, marriage, and the literary world to English manners, women, love, religion, and anything else that came to his fertile mind. But because it is done with such a lighthearted tone that the barbs remain as timely today as they were at the end of the 19th-century and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" will always be at the forefront of the plays of that time which will continue to be produced."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Witty, sarcastic, laugh out loud in your chair reading. I loved it!!!!"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde once said that all forms of art are useless. Bearing this in mind, his play \`The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of the most useless pieces ever written. Writing a simple and funny play, the play writer managed to criticize the hypocrisy of the Victorian society in this comedy of manners.The whole story is around the words \`earnest' and \`Ernest'. More than toying with the words and their sound and meaning, Wilde is talking about the \`masks' that people put in their faces by that time. Nobody is really what he/she seems to be. The two main characters Algernon Moncrieff and Algernon Moncrieff create another ego that they pretend to be their brothers-- to such device they call Bunburying hence the name of Algernon's brother.What is very clear with this plot is that Wilde shows how one has to lie in order to succeed. However, in another level, Bunburying is way of describing homosexual liaisons or is a way of escaping from the chains of the marriage. By the way, marriage itself is strongly criticized by the author in this play. The two marriageable girls are interested in men whose names are Ernest, no matter how they look or what they do.All the undertones of the play aside, \`The Importance of Being Ernest' is a quick and funny play, full of great lines that could only come from Oscar Wilde's mind. Just like Lady Braknell says to hurry a marriage: \`I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.' Simply funny, acid and true!"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is probably one of the funniest works I have ever been witness to; it definitely takes the cake when it comes to plays. The witty English humor is practically side splitting when read, so i can imagine how well it works when actually preformed on stage or film. The characters are so perfectly created within their aristocratic society. Lady Bracknell is the epitome of a lady and her humor, though she is not trying to be funny, is classic. The words do all the work. The characters just speak and as long as the lines are taken/given as canversationalthe entire play is nonstop laughs. The satire dealing with issues of class, love, money, and character has probably never been written as subtle or as well as Wilde has done with this play. The plot is humorous in its self. The whole concept of &quot;Burnburying&quot; to get around your obligations as a Gentleman and the problems it causes for Algernon and Jack. The shifty love story that carries the play is at times unbelievable but if you consider the farcicalnature of the play it is easily overlooked. The ending, although I won't give it away, is another classic example of a well written play. The twists and turns along the way that end up confronting the truth make the finish well worth your time. That's not to say that the rest of the play isn't great. If you're a fan of this type of comedy I would highly recommend not only buying this book but seeing it preformed as well."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I loved this! Generally I detest reading plays for some reason, but I enjoyed every minute of this one. The characters were excellent, and the plotline creative. Actually, the plot alone is amusing. The dialogue (ooooh, the dialogue!) is absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this. I found Lady Bracknell to be one of the more entertaining characters, with her stereotypically lopsided priorities. Algernon and Jack's many angry (well, on Jack's part, at least) exchanges were marvelous (the bit with the muffins is an absolute classic, in my opinion).

It is a great companion in times of trouble -- boredom, sadness, Weltschmerz. I saw it first at summer camp in 1968, where we -- a bunch of 15- and 16-year olds -- put it on. I was 13. I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York. Again, it knocked the audience flat, we were laughing so hard. Wilde's silliness, combined with his brilliance and social insight, makes for a kind of humor that is practically inimitable. That he should have suffered in a hard-labor prison is an outrage."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" seems to start as a play about truth, but quickly becomes a play about the false through the classical \`simple misunderstanding.' The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This sparkles with wit that belongs only to Oscar Wilde.

That's his.Is that clever?It's perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilized life should be.\\"This is just one of the many jocular exchanges and epigrams in this short but brilliant social satire. Wilde wryly and cleverly gets his claws into the upper caste and its twisted moral etqieuette, romantic relationships, and self-critically the propensity for sententious moral (and aesthetic) self-guidance.Dispensing with politeness and social convention through his farcical dialogue, Wilde unleashes his comic criticism on all types of hypocrisies and spurious norms.

I was, however, corrected within the first few pages as I encountered the hilarious discussions between Jack and Algernon. The language and wit is so dry its hard not to find something amusing. This line said by Algernon is one worth saving, &quot;The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!&quot; Contrary to popular belief, this play is not one thats difficult to get into. Right from the start there is a conflict that grabs the readers attention and carries them through the mix up of fiances with Cecily and Gwendolen, also a scene that is sure to amuse even the most serious of readers. Lady Bracknell could seemingly be a thorn in the readers side in the beginning, but not to worry, the old woman set in her ways becomes if nothing else a source of comic relief.

From the beginning it is very complex and the relations are mixed up. You never know who is related to whom and figures are very characteristic. You never what will happen next. The play is written for his time very progressive and modern. The women are worried about the name of their engaged men and forget the real worth of human nature.

We liked to read the book and can recommend it to everyone. It is really very funny. The characters talk a lot of paradoxical things. Oscar Wilde plays with the adjective earnest and the name Ernest. The motto of the play is: &quot;In matters of great importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.&quot; Oscar Wilde said once: &quot; We should treat all the trivial things of life very seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality.&quot; At the beginning everything they talk about seems to be nonsense, but if you think about it you see that some things they say are quite rig"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Here is a rare thing -- a comedy that is enough in and of itself. It is funny-- genuinely funny, without being naughty or &quot;sophisticated&quot; or cynical, without being overly goofy, without being sad at the same time, or profound, or stupid. It is light without making you wish it was deeper or think maybe it is and you missed it somehow.I was forced to read a fair number of comedies throughout English lit classes, and my clearest memory was that most jokes, though alive on stage, are dead on the page. Even in Shakespeare, often. Here, though, I really was laughing, enjoying the wordiness and wit. Makes me really wish and hope to see it performed someday.The word that comes to mind is pure. Like if there really are Platonic forms, essences of things, this is the platonic form of comedy. Or at least approaches it more closely than anything else I've ever read.It's simple. It's short.

Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.

According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first performed in London in 1895. More than a century later, &quot;Importance&quot; is still a sparkling delight. Although I suppose the play is best experienced as a theatrical performance, it also makes a wonderful read.In &quot;Importance&quot; Wilde has fun with the customs and attitudes of well-to-do 19th century English people. As the plot of mistaken identity and romance unfolds, Wilde's characters let loose a string of memorable witticisms and sarcastic comments. One of my favorites: &quot;Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.&quot; Another one: &quot;My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.&quot;Along the way, Wilde's characters reveal the benefits and drawbacks of being a &quot;Bunburyist&quot; (don't bother looking it up in a dictionary; you have to read the play!). So pour yourself a cup of tea, stuff yourself silly with cucumber sandwiches, and enjoy &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest.&quot;"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"By looking at the cover I didn't think I would like this book : a dirty brown with an Old English illustration. But once I read the first few pages I was hooked. The book is based on Oscar Wilde's play of the same name, one I only vaguely had heard of. Although the story takes place in 19th century England, the humor transcends time. It starts off when one gentleman meets up with another. Questions arise to the identity of the visiting man, named Ernest, which leads to a mini-mystery. The two men banter humorously throughout the book accompanied by the leading ladies and a very accomodating butler. The reason for the title becomes apparent when the name Ernest is the central cause for the hilarity. I absolutely loved this book! It was a quick read and made me laugh out loud. I was surprised that noone else had written a review for it. I was glad I took a chance with something that, on the surface, didn't look very appealing.

It was my first sampling of Oscar Wilde, and I found it pretty enjoyable. It's also been my only sampling of Oscar Wilde. I've been meaning to get into some more of his work, I really have. It's a tale of mistaken identity, of love, of three volume novels, of \\"Bunburyists\\" and of fashion. Everyone claims to be Earnest, but they're all rather trivial about it.

I thought the recording was a fair representation of this quite hysterical play, but there were a few weaknesses that made it less valuable than I had hoped. The women mumbled a little at low volumes, which didn't work in my large classroom and old tape player. Also, the guys didn't like Algernon's voice, which sounded like a woman's and not at all like the rogue we pictured him to be. It was also necessary to keep the text out to read along, unless you've read it before, because the quick English clip of the actors masks some of the funnier lines.Over all, I would recommend this for Wilde lovers who are already familiar with the play and looking for an amusing car-stereo companion."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I have not listened to this audio CD version.

Over time his fianc&eacute;e's mother started to see that there was more to Jack than what he was letting on to. The only reason that Cecily wants the marry Jack is because she thinks that his name is really Earnest. Jack/ Earnest has a fianc&eacute;e but is in love with another women at the same time.This is a very short book but at the same time it is very easy to get in to because of the conflicts that occur. This book is very funny especially the conversations between Jack and Algernon. The story is a political and social satire and a look at the upper British society. I thought that the story was great because of the humor but at the same time the story was kind of sneaky which drew me into the story even more.

Has a made-up friend, Bunbury, and sometimes tours the country in the guise of this Mr. Bunbury. Falls in love with Jack's ward and decides to meet her as soon as he can - putting aside the fake name of Bunbury and taking on the name of Earnest, stealing Jack's place as Jack's brother.In this wonderful romantic comedy, nothing is what it seems, and Jack and Algernon must dig their way out of the little mess they've made for themselves so they can marry the women they love.I read this play for school, but I would easily read it again...maybe, now. I was super impressed by the hilarity and perfection of this story. I laughed out loud at the quirky statements that make these characters who they are. I couldn't help but fall in love with Jack. I loved the simplicity and lightheartedness. Without a doubt, this is one of my all time favorite plays.Using two words that I've already used, this book is \\"simply hilarious.\\" I highly recommend it to ages fifteen and up. The reason for this is because I tried reading it in 9th grade and didn't get it at all. It makes much more sense now and I laughed so hard at a few statements that I remembered as boring and stupid.

Given the playful plot and the masked serious topics like deception, double lives, hypocrisy and mainly the nature of marriage, I can accept some deviation from reality.The importance of being Earnest is a fun read, and a special sarcastic way of dealing with Victorian morals and values as Wilde perceived them.

This L.A. Theatre Works production is superb. Director Michael Hackett also offers a gender-bending twist by casting Charles Busch as Lady Augusta Bracknell, with hilarious results. Busch is outstanding in the celebrated role.The topsy-turvy plot springs from a case of deliberate, mistaken identity. Leading a \\"double-life,\\" Jack (James Marsters) finds it useful to be \\"Earnest\\" in town and \\"Jack\\" in the country. Whenever he needs to escape country obligations, he is conveniently called away by his \\"brother Earnest.\\" Jack wishes to wed Gwendolyn (Sarah Zimmerman), but first he must pass inspection by her formidable mother, Lady Bracknell, who is described as \\"a monster without being a myth.\\" When Jack tells Lady Bracknell he knows absolutely nothing, she delightedly replies, \\"I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate, exotic fruit. Touch it, and the bloom is gone.\\" When he mentions he has \\"lost\\" both parents, she reproaches, \\"To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\\"Complications ensue as the action moves from the town to the country. Jack's flighty friend Algernon (Matthew Wolf) decides to pose as \\"brother Earnest\\" and promptly falls in love with Jack's ward Cecily (Emily Bergl). Soon, Gwendolyn and Cecily believe they are both engaged to \\"Earnest.\\" Their tea and cake scene is a comedy classic. Similarly, Jack and Algernon often quibble over such things as muffins and bread and butter. The conclusion, involving Cecily's governess Miss Prism (Jill Gascoine), a handbag, and a three-volume romance novel, is simultaneously absurd and dramatically sound. Laughter is abundant throughout and Wilde's wit reigns supreme. The L.A. Theatre works production also includes a rather academic interview with director Michael Hackett and producer Susan Loewenberg."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde made his initial reputation as the master of the epigram: the trenchant and mordant, roughly haiku length flashes of insight into the comic absurdity of the world. No one in English Literature before or since has ever displayed such an effortless mastery of wit. \\"All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest not only flaunts Wilde's most inconsequential plot, it is also crammed with his funniest epigrams and wittiest bon mots. This 1895 three-act comedic tour-de-force was an immediate hit in London. The comic word-play was a sensation amongst audiences who flocked to see this brilliant manifestation of Wilde's epicene witticisms. Here was a glittering example of London's avant-garde in the 1890's. Much like the play Hair in the 1960's, it was a signature of the times that no self-respecting sophisticate could miss. Wilde enjoyed himself immensely during this apex of his fame. Unfortunately, his reputation was quickly eclipsed by the scandal that engulfed him and his work. It took several decades for that reputation to be rehabilitated. The Importance of Being Earnest seemed to float above the scandals, never losing its popularity and acquiring a theatrical life of its own as an absolutely iconic work.This Norton Critical Edition contains an annotated version of the play as well as several brilliantly incisive articles. A few of the analysts engage in some scholarly hand-waving, trying to attribute a social commentary and literary symbolism to the play that may not exist. Some of it is quite funny, in fact. I can't help but think that Wilde would appreciate the irony of one critic portraying his comic depiction of the frequently agitated butler Lane as an assault on the English class system. Other articles are quite helpful, however. The essay by Camille Paglia is especially insightful with her brilliant analysis of Wilde's dramatic projection of an ambiguous sexual persona. It is a rare comic play that merits its own Norton Critical Edition. This is one of the few. If you love this play (and the hilarious 1951 Anthony Asquith film) as much as I do, this is the edition to have. Most strongly recommended.Mike Birman"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is the Theater Guild on the Air condensed version with this great cast, but there is a double LP box set on Angel in America that is perhaps the greatest audio recording of an English comedy, and it should be issued at once.

I fell in love. It was the wittiest thing I had ever seen. More recently (2001) I saw it at the Fleetwood Stage in New Rochelle, New York.

The two male leads, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, use imaginary friends they both invent to avoid the boring and weekly family engagements. These imaginary friends lead to eventual confusion between them and the women they love. This Shakespearean misunderstanding is only half the fun though. Wilde, always witty, mocks the ill portrayed English Aristocracy of the late 19th century - poking constant fun at not only their etiquette, but also their stubborn and unpractical tendencies, their immoral behavior, and their exploitation of the lower classes. Very rarely do comedies strike to the heart of the matter and say something meaningful as Oscar Wilde did with this last great play of his."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is the first play I have ever read just as a book, and I have never burst out laughing reading anything before.

There is a lot of reference to the lifestyle at the time of this plays performance (around the 1800s) and a lot of political and social talk. Throughout the three act play, it shows how funny fooling everyone, then getting caught can be, as well as finding love, and how friends can either help, or hinder your fooling of everyone.

Wilde manages to keep the readers entertained while at the same time keeping their feet on the ground. The use of the &quot;old&quot; language helps the readers identify with the characters. The characters themselves constantly have you laughing at their absurd antics. You never know what lie is going to pop up next and you are continually wondering how the characters are going to get out of the pickle they've gotten themselves into. The constant twisting of the plot keeps the reader happy, excited, and surprised. The different settings keep it interesting and the steady flow of new characters keep a person guessing who really is being &quot;earnest.&quot; The dialogue is truly inspired and the choice to have the words &quot;play&quot; on each other manage to keep the play flowing. Oscar Wilde's play is truly brilliant and I would recommend this play to anyone who enjoys a good laugh."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"'The Importance of Being Earnest' is the greatest piece of literature I have ever read. We were forced to read many books in school, but why this play was never mentioned is something I don't understand. Simply, this play is the most clever, witty, and entertaining thing I have ever read in my life, period. You definitely won't find any great meaning or significance in this work, but so what. You'll simply laugh your butt off for most of the 70 to 75 pages."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Oscar Wilde's terrific comedy, The Importance of Being Earnest, jokes on serious human themes, such as love, religion, and truthfulness. This play uses comedy to joke about real life situations; that realistically would be wrong. In the end, a comedy's main purpose is to take a real life concept that ordinarily can not be made fun of, and make it fiction. The reader will be delighted by the comedy's similarity to today's T.V. sitcoms, which, like The Importance of Being Ernest, make fun of serious, real life problems. Nick at Night's new motto is \\"100% sitcoms, 100% unreality T.V.\\" So is The Importance of Being Ernest.The Importance of Being Ernest shows how reality can be made fun of in context of a comedy. Watch as Algernon and Jack create fictional brothers, so they can enjoy the best out of both worlds, and how the woman they fall in love with view their lies. The two woman's ideas on love will astonish the reader. Jack and Algernon mock religion when they use it as a way to impress women. The best part of this book occurs in the end, when Jack finds out who he really is, and how marriage is used as bribery. Even with all the lies and deceptions, the characters never take a thing seriously, and as a result the end of the book has a happy tone.In the end, I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor, which is basically everybody. It is well written, and there are small parts within the language itself that will make you laugh. It is only 54 pages, so if you're having a rough day, and need a good laugh, pick up a copy of The Importance of Being Ernest, and laugh your head off."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The Importance of Being Ernest is Oscar's finest work that I have ever read. After sitting through a seemingly unbearable adaptation of The Ideal Husband, it was refreshing to once again discover the wit of Oscar Wilde. All of the social criticism and delightful cynicism that is always prevelant in Wilde's work is masterly employeed in this play. The play was compelling in that it always keeps the reader interested. There is never a dull moment in the story of Algernon Moncrief and John Worthing, two members of the English upper class who get entangled in their own lies. Each man assumes the Identity of Ernest Worthing, a fictional creation used to escape the dreariness of everyday life, an act which catches up to them eventually. These two men are then forced to explain their deceptions to their fiances who know them only as Ernest. The story is filled with clever plot twists that make it a real enjoyment to read. The Importance of Being Ernest is a masterpiece of intelligent comedies. To compare it to anything else would be to do it an injustice. This classic is timeless and I would recommend it to anyone. It makes reading pleasurable and leaves you wanting more which is the importance of great literature."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I really enjoyed reading it, because I think it contents a good portion of humour, and also irony. At first I did not know what to expect from the novel, I did not even understand the title at all. One man\`s name is called \\"Ernest\\" and so I got confused by the name and the adjective \\"to be earnest\\". I must also say, that the beginning is difficult to understand because at first you don\`t really know what the idea of \\"bunburry\\" is. And then the different relationships between the persons are not easey to understand. After I have read the novel, I had the chance to watch also the film.

Its humor appeals more to the mind than the slapstick humor of American comedies. It's set in England, in and outside of London, and is a perfect example of a Comedy of Manners play, though written in the mid-1800s. It involves two men who make up a friend or relative that just &quot;happens&quot; to get into a bad situation whenever they want to go to town (or out in the country). Through extenuating circumstances, one comes to be known as Ernest in the town, and the other becomes the very same person out in the country.This is the greatest comedy play ever written, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds Shakespeare too bland at parts, and the farce of the Three Stooges unbearable. It is probably one of the most well-written plays I have read or seen in my life, rising above most Shakespeare plays and such modern plays as &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot;&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; holds a message behind the satire of the 19th century that crosses all time; it is better to be honest than to be caught as Ernest."},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: 'The Importance of Being Earnest' (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A highly entertaining comedy even over a hundred years later.

We have always insisted that it was History that should merit a place on the projected five foot shelf of Southwestern Americana. The new preface, written in retrospect by the author, comes pretty close to vindicating our appraisal of the book. Winners Get Lost might well be dedicated to that vast horde of lost adventurers of at least two generations from North of the Border, each of whom believes that he, individually and personally, discovered Bahia Bachochibampo and all points leading to it and beyond on the old dirt road. None of those who read this narrative can help but feel that he too was along on this expedition, or at least knew intimately all of the characters who were. They should be forever grateful to Al Perry for preserving the memories that they themselves have failed to record about an era that ended in the name of progress.From the Author's Preface to the Second Edition: Some parts of this story are based upon personal experience, others upon recounted details (usually highly embellished) of friends who have visited among our neighbors to the south. Today, of course, there are broad highways throughout Mexico, in places where once there were only single-track rough trails. Air-conditioned, modern hotels and motels, with hot and cold running water, replace the old casas de huespedes, with their wells and immediately adjacent privies in the patio. Hundreds of tourists now throng in spots that once sheltered only a few Indian people. Today diesel powered trains and jet planes arrive and depart on schedule. The old friendly, lazy tren-mixto has been relegated to the junk yard. Radio and television news is broadcast promptly, quite different from the days when the burro carried the weekly periodicals over the desert and mountains. It is my hope I may have described the conditions as they existed in the late twenties and early thirties, realizing, however, absent the song of the memory-bird, those days would be gone forever. Possibly though, the old-timers will recall such days and experiences and it may do the younger folk no great harm to read about them, notwithstanding all the nonsense I have interjected into the recounting of Pete's little journey south of the border - down Mexico way.Chapter titles are: Berwynde on the Sound; Manhattan; Tucson; Nogales; Imuris; Magdalena; Santa Ana; Hermosillo; Tren Mixto; Bahia Bachochibampo; Pez Vela; Guaymas; El Mercado; Al Chabusco; Maria Ilena; Hasta Manana; Los Perdidos; Tiburones; La Paz; Mazatlan; Tia Sara y Juanita; El Pacifico; Los Angeles."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"When I decided to start a pet sitting business, I had absolutely no idea where to begin-- but with the help of this book I had no problem.

The only downside of this book is that it is a bit out of date, but not so much so that you wouldn't be able to relate to it. It is a great tool to have before starting up. I am very pleased with this book and will more than likely buy the next version should one be written.Shame on all of you who are putting down Patti Moran for mentioning her products in this text!

Patti Moran's book is an excellent guide for getting started.Ruth Nighswonger (May 21,2005)Boca Raton, Florida"},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"The content of this book was not very helpful. I don't see how anyone can possibly make a livable profit from this business. It just doesn't add up and the book was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I bought this book with high expectations, since Patti is billed as the &quot;guru&quot; of pet sitting. The information provided in the book is extensive, but it seems to me that the book is actually an advertisement for the products Patti Moran sells on her website. I thought for the price of the book, we should expect at least one business form to start our business! If you want to buy those, the catalog is free! Overall, the book helps you decide if pet sitting is really for you, and how to go about setting up the business (insurance, bonding, office practices, etc). If that's all you expect from this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Patti Moran gives a complete overview of everything a potential pet sitter needs to consider before starting a business. I was particularly impressed with her comments regarding form of business (i.e., sole proprietorship, corporation, etc), tax considerations, and insurance, because other books about starting a pet sitting business gloss over or fail to cover these topics. Given the disasters which could occur if a business isn't properly insured or hasn't complied with tax laws, this advice is invaluable. My only complaint is that there are an awful lot of references to Patti Moran's new business; she is now engaged in supplying pet sitters with a variety of products, and she constantly refers prospective pet sitters to her catalog and excludes other sources of information and supplies. (However, her catalog does have a great variety of items.) By the way, that isn't Patti on the cover of the book -- I would have liked to see her on its jacket. In sum, you must read this book if you want to start a professional pet sitting business; it will eliminate a lot of the headaches and will point you toward valuable resources."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"First, a full disclosure -- I run my own pet-sitting business and I'm a happy, paid member of Patti's organization, Pet Sitters Internaitonal (PSI). She's a good business woman who had the sense to get out of the industry and create alliances to help those in the industry. Second disclosure, I run an organization geared directly toward helping petsitters start and run a successful business so that they can enjoy their life, work with great clients and retire happy.Now, onto the review. I bought this book about 6 months after I started sitting full-time. I had already bought, read and devoured Lori and Scott Mangold's book.This book was a disappointment to me -- it had been touted for so long by so many that I know and respect as THE BIBLE of pet-sitting. So, I guess I was expecting fireworks and drumrolls. None of that is here.It's basic. It's not quite a how-to and definitely not the Complete Manual for Professional Success. But then, a complete manual would need to be much larger and more expensive.There are alot of ambiguities as noted by other reviewers and I really wish there was a more extensive Appendix listing places to get information regarding licensing, insurance, employees vs ICs etc. for each state.But, there's still a good overview of the business here. So it's worth having in your library -- I just wouldn't depend on this as my sole guide to starting and running a successful pet-care business."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I have had some experience with walking/sitting for some time with an established agency and recently branched out on my own. I bought an earlier version of this book, so that was my mistake. I recommend getting the 1997 revised edition, as the 2nd one is not at all geared for today's computer literate individual. No type of e-mail, website or even detailed computer database info is addressed, which is understandable given the date of revised publication (1991). At that time, home computer use was in its infancy, unlike today, where owning a home computer is as common as having a television.On the whole this book provided some very valuable information, even for someone with previous professional experience like me. However, there were some points that were just common sense...such as a rambling paragraph about dealing with a toilet overflowing (due to litter disposal). I enjoyed the business suggestions much more that the home repair tips!I DO think this is a valuble tool for a starting-off sitter. Worthwhile, but a bit &quot;cutsey&quot;. But take some of the filler with a grain of salt- and also, skip the numerous plugs for Moran's product line. I suggest that you call for info from others in your area and obtain their business forms so that you can base your info on real competitors, instead of shelling out for forms you'll use only as a general model."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Good, but the author assumes that you know and seek out other literature on how to start a small business. So if you have no experience with starting a business, and you want to do this type of business, you will need to seek out other books that cover general small business topics like writing a business plan, researching your market, etc. I suggest &quot;How To Start Your Own Business: The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Need&quot; by Rieva Lesonksy. I don't know if her title is absolutely true, but it's definitely a good, comprehensive start."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I felt that Patti Moran spent too much time talking about personnel issues rather than the day to day issues of a sole proprieter business.

I wanted a book that explaines what is it like to be a professional pet sitter, more real life experiences, good and bad. I'm still trying to decide whether this is the right occupation for me. This wasn't helpful."},{"Title":"Pet Sitting for Profit: A Complete Manual for Professional Success (Howell Reference Books)","review":"This is the Third Edition of an excellent book on the business aspects of pet sitting.

It does NOT provide information on pet care - assuming that you are already somewhat competent since you are itnerested in this field.Filled with \\"real life\\" experience, Ms Moran covers office procedures, insurance, advertising and marketing.The chapter on Getting Started will be extremely useful for someone starting up a pet sitting business with a work force of one - namely you :) Much of the rest of the book is geared for the pet sitting business that has expanded to multiple employees.

It's how I learned towrite- on the old Apple IIe...you're looking at a SCREEN.and when you're trying to get clear on a line or a word or a way ofexpressing idea, or you're struggling with the BEST way to communicatewith your reader...you're looking at a SCREEN.Just the mere physical act of looking away from that SCREEN,opening the book, changing your focus, finding the page andseeing a different font style can interrupt your pattern,and open up your mind to a whole new way of seeing andthinking about the subject.It's not just about the words, it's also about the state change.It's a 10-second exercise that gets you OUT of the problem andINTO the solution.The real power is the combination of the two working together,hand in hand.Not everyone needs this level of fanaticism, but there's an unmistakabledifference between the \\"talking at them\\" style of copy that's soprevalent today, and communicating with your reader in a way thattells them that you know them you understand them, and you careabout them in a way that nobody else in your market does.The Synonym Finder can help you get there faster than you wouldany other way."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This was recommended to me as a resource if you're looking to vary your vocabulary in writing, and it's perfect.

As a marketing specialist/writer, it is essential that I am able to constantly be putting a new spin on a not-so-new idea and this book has become an invaluable tool for me to get there."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"you will still need a regular thesaurus. Why? This book does not list any antonyms, which I found to be a huge drawback. If you don't need the antonyms, this book is for you. It is probably the most extensive listing of synonyms you will find."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Once you've used THIS thesaurus, you'll never go back to anything else. It is a valuable tool in any writer's bookshelf, particularly students. Not only do I have one at home and at my office, we also made sure our son has his own copy as he heads off to university. Essential reference tool that will be used again and again!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"When I came across this book;I asked myself,\\"Do I really need another Thesaurus,Word Finder,or as this one is called a Synonym Finder? I bought it anyway. Now, about the only answer I can come up with is that it is a real \\"humdinger\\",and instead of getting rid of others that I already have;I guess I'll keep them all.I have several real good ones,but they are really all different and it's quite impossible to say which is best.Therefore,about all I can say is that this is definitely one of the best around,and you could never be disappointed if you choose this one.First of all it is huge,with 1,500,000 words, and makes the claim that it contains more words than any book of its kind.It has 1361 pages,and has a soft cover.One very important aspect of the book,is that it lays open when placed on a table,and the pages can be turned with one hand.It is important to note that generally hard cover ones have this ability,but most soft covered ones do not.Some references like this,(i.e.Rogert's)are arranged by subject and alphabetically;but this one is completely arranged alphabetically,like a dictionary.This book goes into considerable detail about words and doesn't simply give a exhaustive listing of similar words with the same meaning.It explains how various synonyms carry different meanings and how they are to be used.Before I sat down to write this review,I thought I would compare how several of my Thesauruses dealt with a word and was very surprised that there were big differences;which only goes to prove one thing;that being,that it is impossible to say one is better than another.When you turn to a Thesaurus to find \\"the perfect word\\",you don't always find it;and what you really need is more than one ,because if you don't find it in one,maybe it'll be in another.Summing up;this is an excellent Thesaurus,very easy to use,has an astounding number of listings,is reasonably priced,will give many years of service;and whether it is the only one you have,or one among several,you'll be very satisfied with it---at least I am."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"My wife and I have used The Synonym Finder for nearly 20 years.

Every word I look up in my Synonym Finder references at least twice as many synonyms as the 4 other thesauruses I own, if not more, and I have not yet found one synonym that is inaccurate, or doesn't fit.

When applied to some of the older books in this category, that may be true, but never Rodale's. It's a treasure trove! I work from the 1978 edition in which Laurence Urdang begins his Introduction with the curious statement that &quot;...there is no such thing as a true 'synonym.'&quot; So use the book with caution!No other thesaurus I've seen facilitates that caution. Rodale's enables you to look at the word choices with enough objectivity to see the wealth of nuances of meaning reflected in each one.This book is indispensable, reliable, accessible, and fun reading!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Writing descriptively with creativity and color is necessary because without voice, one needs to suggest tone and passion to communicate the author's perspective. The Synonym Finder is THE resource for engaging writing. Forget about other regular so-called thesauri; their only use is to start a fire on a crisp, cool night or for a barbecue! The Synonym Finder is bound well, made of quality paper, and will lay open flat for easy reference. A couple of times, I've been unable to find a specific word, but then I turn to a more specialized thesaurus or dictionary for slang, foreign expressions, sexuality, etc. This book sits at the top of my list of reference books!

Every time I use it, this reference work seems to offer a dozen excellent, out-of-the way and stimulating choices that other thesauri just don't come close.

A must for any writer."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This book is what a thesaurus should be. Don't buy &quot;Roget's Thesaurus&quot; or any of the others, you're wasting your time. Get this book, and if you can, get it in hardback because you're going to use it a LOT. The Synonym Finder plus Random House's Word Menu plus DK's Ultimate Visual Dictionary are together the Trinity of word references. I do not like to write without them."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Since the start of my writing career, I have relied on this book. It is, without question, the finest, easiest source for those hard-to-find replacements for overworked words. I have given at least a dozen copies to writers just starting their careers. Forget Roget's Thesaurus. This is _the_ book. I cannot imagine attempting to work without the Synonym Finder within hand's reach."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Outstanding! No thesaurus I have ever seen can compare to it. To cite one example, my Roget's provides a single synonym for \\"abjure\\": retract; while Rodale provides 1. renounce, repudiate, disdain, forswear, abandon, desert, forsake, relinquish, give up, reject, discard, disown. 2. renege, take back, go back on, apostatize, depart from, recall, retract, recant, revoke, withdraw. 3. avoid, shun, eschew, , forgo, Inf. swear off, stay away from, have nothing to do with, Inf. have no truck with.

After taking my roommates' copies for granted throughout college, I had to go purchase a hardcover copy for myself.This book is both ingenious and utilitarian. The words included are so much more interesting than any other thesaurus. I like that it also includes related words that aren't really synonyms. It helps you find a word for an idea that you can't quite define or explain, or find a word you're looking for but can't think of, or find words you never would've thought of, or sometimes even find words you didn't know could have that same meaning. Sometimes it gives you words that only artistically or poetically relate to the word you've looked up.Also, the sheer quantity of synonyms allows you to do stupid language tricks: Obviously, one ought to obtain this opus at once, you oaf."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"English is a wonderful language with an amazing number of possible synonyms for every word. But as a practicing lawyer I always believed that there was only one word that could be properly used in each circumstance depending upon the context.

Also, special paper is used for many years of less effort reading.Well, if you have young strong eyes the softbound would be a bargin for $14.95. The hardbound version would be a lifetime choice, especially if you value the crisp print quality.

It is, indeed, really, still the best thesaurus.But, if you work on a computer, thesaurus features built into the operating system or a program, are more convenient and getting better!Which leads me to my big, big criticism of this product that I have had for decades: they need to update it in content and media. It mostly just needs more words added and new words added.But most importantly, it needs to be digital! It is, a good enough product, that I would PAY to have access to it on my Mac. I would use it all the time in email, in InDesign, in web site design work I do, in Pages (word processing), Keynote (presentations), and many other programs that access the built in Mac dictionaries. There are multiple dictionaries on the Mac including an English thesaurus. Products of Oxford (but not that Oxford). So adding it to the already there dictionaries on the Mac seems possible.If the publisher made it cloud based, they could keep it up to date all the time and run it on any device. Most users of thesauri use them with a connection and sitting down.It is a great published product that needs to, finally, enter the digital age!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"For fresh writers who are looking at ways to expand their vocabulary and add a little more character to what your saying, this is the book for you.

However, once students do use it, they find, as many other reviewers have, that \\"The Synonym Finder\\" is quite simply the best thesaurus out there.

Words matter to me, and I take pleasure in revising and polishing until each word delivers the right point and emphasis, and a look for sentences in which the sounds echo the sense. I've tried many resources including \\"What's What,\\" and \\"The Ultimate Visual Dictionary.\\" I've found no one resource fully satisfactory. I want a word finder that is complete and very fast. I don't want to interrupt my thinking with word searches.The strength of this book is its completeness and directness. However, that completeness comes at a cost; the print is small and the paper thin. When I turn from writing at my computer, I need to change glasses to read the print in Synonym Finder, and even then I find myself also reaching for a magnifier. Fumbling with thin paper is also slow. There are no thumb tabs for easy access as on my edition of Roget.There is also no categorizing of meanings as in my old, hardcover Roget Thesausus, so sometimes I need to look up several words before I find what I want. In the end, it takes as long to find the word in Rodale as in Roget. There, all the words I need appear together, though I must start looking at the index. In Synonym Finder there is no index. The search is direct, but I need to look in multiple places.For those who write at a computer as I do, the ideal solution would be an electronic word finder. There is one on my computer, and it is always the first place I turn because it is instant. It distracts less from the thought processes of writing and polishing. However, it is way too small to provide the richness of vocabulary that I seek. I've looked for other electronic word finders without success. This book would be perfect if it were electronic.. How could it be that nobody has filled this need? As it is, I'm still using my Roget and waiting for the electronic version I dream of."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Complaint: Creepy, Spooky. Not in the 'Finder' as primary words? What gives? In fact these were a couple of the words I was HOPING to find synonyms for. I know of Eldritch for creepy, but assume there are other words for it. I wa a bit disappointed that such a common word wasn't used... I of course was inventive and tried looking up less 'standard' words to start from, like 'unnatural' and 'hellish.' Those seemed to work better.Minor foible aside, you can turn to pretty much any page and learn a whole lot of new words! This, I can tell, will be an absolutely indispensable desk reference... Especially since I want to write some esoterica and Lovecraftian purple prose with a pseudo-archaic affect. This should make for an excellent compendium of obscure and half-forgotten lore.Love it! One other minor quibble, I kind of wish it had antonyms too, like your usual thesaurus. But, then the book would probably be twice as long. So, I'm okay with it! It's already a truly massive tome."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"No doubt great but in this day and age, should be on searcheable CD format.

It is unlikely that any other thesaurus will give you more word options than will this one.I have come across a few isolated instances where The Synonym Finder is lacking a useful synonym, such as for the verb \\"teach.\\"Oxford American Writer's Thesaurusoffers about 21 synonyms, among which is \\"illuminate.\\" That's a nice one, and The Synonym Finder doesn't have it. However, The Synonym Finder has a total of *65* synonyms, among them \\"enlighten\\". So you be the judge.Moreover, for \\"teacher\\",Oxford American Writer's Thesaurusoffers about 21 synonyms. The Synonym Finder has about 70. Further, The Synonym Finder has main entries for \\"teachable\\" and \\"teaching\\", which theOxford American Writer's Thesaurusdoes not have at all.

I'm still hunting for dictionaries and various other reference books, but the search is off for THE Thesaurus.It's quick and easy to read and refer to. It cross-references, has antonyms and has words and phrases from the mundane to the highly obscure while remaining easy to read, refer to and comprehend."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Don't waste your time or money on other competitive products.

The invaluable resource not only gives you dozens of alternative words, it also includes archaic and rare usages, too.Simply the best!Although I rarely use these types of books when I'm writing my first draft, The Synonym Finder and it's companion, published by the same author, Word Finder, is never far from my reach during the re-writes. My only complaint would be that I haven't yet found it in software form."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Although this is an older title I still use it quite frequently.

Now I have one for work and one for home."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Whenever you can't quite find the right word, this is the book you need.

I get twitchy if I don't have a copy at hand. When I write, I insert a blah generic place-holder word if I can't come up with the word that is hovering just beyond reach - then I pick up this book and find the word every single time. What a relief!! No other thesaurus even approaches this book. People laugh when they see this thick, yellowed book and ask why I don't just use an online thesaurus. Because they are so sad and pathetic in comparison to this book, that's why!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I am a wannabe writer. This is just what I was looking for.

What a book. The only reason it isn't 5 star is because I didn't realize that it was going to be so big and heavy!

It has quite a lot of material."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"A dictionary style thesaurus, The Synonym Finder an absolute essential for anyone from college student to professional author, who needs a reliable reference for synonyms.

I have multiple copies, one in my office at home and one at work. When I was working on my MBA a number of years ago, I found it to be an invaluable resource while I researched and wrote countless papers. I have given this book as a gift to graduating students moving on to college, and to friends starting advanced degrees. They all love it. My grade school kids love it too since it helps them avoid using the same word over and again.The cover of the paperback version says on it, \\"Over 1 Million Synonyms...The Largest and Most Comprehensive Thesaurus in Print\\". They are absolutely correct. Look for yourself. Open one up. If you do even a minuscule amount of writing, you'll love this resource."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"To begin, I suppose I should mention that I'm a writer. It's not that you have to be a writer to get your money's worth out of this book, but you do have to at least have a need or a wish to play with words. The Synonym Finder was recommended to me by another writer friend whose opinion I greatly value and the day it arrived I found she was absolutely spot on. This is a reference I use, if not on a daily basis, often.I find it easier to use than most thesauri and each word has a wealth (\\"abundance, heap, pile, mass, ton, great deal, profusion, bounty, plenitude, plenteousness, bountifulness, copiousness, amplitude; cornucopia, bottomless well, treasury, gold mind, mine\\") of synonyms. If you like words, you can easily get lost in its pages.I heartily recommend this book as a must-have reference tool to be kept within easy reach."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"&quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; is a thesaurus in dictionary form. There are no word definitions or pronunciation guides. Words are listed alphabetically, as they would be in a dictionary, and an exhaustive list of synonyms is given for each definition of every word. Clarifications such as &quot;informal&quot;, &quot;slang&quot;, &quot;archaic&quot;, etc. are provided where appropriate. There are 1.5 million words in &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot;, including variations on the same root word. That's more than 4 times the number of words in &quot;Roget's International Thesaurus&quot;. If you simply want to find synonyms, this is the book for you. It isn't as versatile as a thesaurus that is organized by subject, but it's more to the point and easier to use if you are simply looking for word alternatives. Roget's is a better research tool, but this is a better and far more efficient synonym finder, and I think that students will prefer it to Roget's. My one pet peeve about the book is that the hardback edition doesn't have a dust jacket. The publisher may have thought a dust jacket would just be a nuisance on a reference book, but I would have preferred one for protection. I only wish &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; were also available as software, as I have limited space for books within arm's reach of my computer. I use &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; more frequently than my dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and Random House Word Menu combined. I think any writer will find it indispensable, and it would make great gift for middle school, high school, and college students."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Until coming across this book, I found thesauri to be more frustrating than trying to chew Captain Crunch cereal without any teeth. Not that I know what that's like, but it's easy enough to imagine.Then I saw this. And found that all of the thesauri collected in my library had become worthless. This is the OED of thesauri, indispensable and perfect beyond comprehension. You will want to order this in hardcover, for you will find yourself using it again, and again, and again, and again.When I bought this book I actually did comparisons between the synonyms in this book and others, and was astounded. I don't remember the word offhand, but this book had over twenty synonyms, while Roget's had seven. An Oxford thesaurus had eleven, but that was as good as it got.The most important thing about this book is that the synonyms are relevant. The author hasn't just packed a bunch of words together here to make it look good."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I've had Rodale's Synonym Finder in my reference library for over ten years, and find that I use it at least ten times a month. There is simply no other book in the English language that is more comprehensive (the number of pages is an obvious give away) nor more helpful. As a lover of language, I frequently examine other such books, and always find that they come up short against this exhaustive resource. What makes this particular reference so valuable is that it recognizes each word usually has more than one meaning, and when it gives a synonym, it is by meaning, not simply by word. Moreover, the reference gives various examples when a word is used as an adjective or adverb, and either as a noun or a verb. It's this breadth and depth that makes this particular synonym finder so extraordinarily superior to the competition. My only lament is that it doesn't include antonymns, but then the book would probably be too large and too cumbersome. As it stands now, the words are clearly displayed, and the synonyms - in all their variety - are abundant."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This review will be short but sweet. This is the BEST Synonym book around. I have bought a look in my search for the best, and this is my second copy of this book. It is a WRITER's MUST...if you don't have it, you are missing out.Everyone I have recommended this to have come back and thanked me for 'saving' them!!Easy to read print, EXTENSIVE listing of Synonym.Worth every penny and a bargin at that!!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"When I bought the 1978 edition twenty years ago or so (am I really that old?), I just needed something to help me with my writing in college. To me it was just a thesaurus, and I needed a thesaurus. Over the years I have bought and used other thesauri and have discovered that none helps me find that elusive word as well as The Synonym Finder. I am not a writer, but I do value the quality of my writing. Frequently I find that I want to say something a certain way. I know there is a word that expresses the subtleties of what I want to say, but I cannot think of the word. I have found that the only book which can lead me to that word nearly every time is The Synonym Finder. No Thesaurus has ever been so consistently helpful to me. Recently I have found a stiff competitor (thesaurus.com) that works very well, but it is not a book. For anyone who wants a source that you can hold in your hand and find that word. This is your book."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I love thesauri. I have two editions of the \\"Original Roget's International Thesaurus\\" (RIT) [http://www.amazon.com/Rogets-International-Thesaurus-Barbara-Kipfer/dp/0060935448/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1259963225&sr;=1-1], and it has been for many years my most cherished book. English is my second language.I recently purchased the Synonym Finder (SF). I am disappointed with the SF, in comparison with the superior and richer RIT.The most helpful review on this site says: \\"There are 1.5 million words in the SF [...]. That's more than 4 times the number of words in the RIT.\\". How misleading! It is not the number of repeated words that is important, but the number of index words and word-assoociations. The organization of the SF is linear (\\"dictionary form\\"): the same word is merely repeated over and over. The RIT is hierarchical and associative, leading the reader systematically and efficiently from perfect synonyms to \\"near\\" and \\"related\\" words, and of course includes antonyms and word-lists as well.The SF has nearly 20,000 index words. The RIT has over 25,000. Check it out!Try to find index words like \\"at first sight\\", \\"bring together\\", \\"consequently\\", \\"downplay\\", \\"easy on the eye\\", or \\"fine-tune\\" in the SF. And these are just a few examples.But the big difference between the linear SF and the by-category RIT is not just the number of index-words, but the natural way one searches for a synonym associately. For each index word, the RIT will recommend perhaps only ten alternatives, but each of these is an entire category, leading to 20, 50 or 200 more. The SF, on the other hand, will just provide a linear list of 5-15 other words - invariably a poorer set of choices.Of all the dictionary-format thesauri, the SF is probably the best. But it consistently pales next to the Original RIT. Three stars, not because it is a bad thesaurus in any way, but because if I were to give it 5 stars, I would have to give the RIT 10 stars!"},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"I love using the exact word...but it doesn't always pop into my brain. So when I read the reviews of this book, I couldn't believe all the hype.So I bought it to put it through my own personal test...ready to return it when I proved that it wasn't all it was advertised to be.Well, it's awesome and clearly the best reference on the market.

And you can't buy IQ or creativity in a book. You learn a lot just browsing it - it's fun to look up the words in a pre-1961 dictionary (when they started dumbing down) - what IS the difference betweeh true/real/honest/factual... or smart/brilliant/intelligent... or funny/witty/comical/jocular/hilarious...you won't need anything else except a pre-1961 dictionary to go along with this on your reference shelf! I find the paperback pages heftier and sturdier than the hardcover and more able to withstand the frequent use this will get. That's my only criticism - I wish Rodale would make a sturdier hardcover, never mind the bulk or cost - I'd pay a pretty penny for a sturdy hardcover, even leatherbound collectible."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"Roget's thesaurus was never real quality.

The response? &quot;This book is great, Dad! Thanks for telling me about it!&quot; Needless to add, it is now a necessary part of our writing. I cannot recommend it too highly.The alphabetical approach makes it extremely easy to use, and removes the step of consulting an index. The [numerous] synonyms are listed alphabetically in categories (e.g., casual/slang); it is difficult to see how Rodale could have made it easier to use--or more useful. I recommend _The Synonym Finder_ most highly it to all of my students, and to anyone who writes."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"One of a kind.

In his discussion of writer tools, Bowerman recommended \\"Rodale's Synonym Finder\\" above all others.Thesauri are a basic tool for writers. Most good writers have a command of the language. What's needed is a quick reference that gives alternative choices to words they have in mind. For examples, if they used a term earlier in a paragraph and wish to avoid repeated use of the same word, Rodale's alphabetical organization is preferable to the organization by subject found in the better-known Roget's Thesaurus.Roget's will always be the gold standard of thesauri, but when time is of the essence, Rodale is the ticket."},{"Title":"The Synonym Finder","review":"This book marched on the scene back in the late '70s with little attention, but it is far and away the best book of its kind.

Roget has declined over the years and its most recent edition is inferior due to its binding, paper (cheaper and thicker feeling), tabs (now every two hundred words instead of one hundred.

I wish that someone could provide an electronic desktop or pocket edition of Rodale's synonym finder in conjunction with a dictionary. The desktop models available by Franklin are antiquated and too limited. Additionally, Microsoft's thesaurus used in its Word program is also too limited and their supplier Alki seems to have no interest in expanding the add-on program that increases the number of synonyms by approximately 140,000 but when comparing a simple word like large, even with the add-on by Alki, there are only 16 synonyms available in comparison to 156 synonyms available for the same word in The Synonym Finder. Additionally, The Synonym Finder was published in 1978 and revised in January 1979, almost twenty years ago. While I realize that firms gravitate towards the areas where they can make the most money, i! ! t is unfortunate that nothing has been done to update this fine work. Look also at the other publications, book or electronic, such as Webster, and see how limited their products are as well. If you have some ideas, I would lend a willing ear. At a time when President Clinton's misguided focus is on classroom size, he and others should be focusing on the real problems of education and increasing rather than decreasing the educational requirements. Don't send our children out into society and expect that society will provide the skills that educators have not taught. Will society correct the problem or will drugs, alcohol, sex, violence, divorce and broken homes, and the power that money can buy lead us to equate our values based on an addiction of material possessions and the death of our true freedom; when is enough, enough? Help renew our focus and save our children from the constraints of materialistic greed and support the expansion of their knowledge, useful skills, ! ! and chance for lifelong happiness and the respect of others! . Thanks for the opportunity to vent my frustration with the publisher, education, and those that administrate in such a meek manner."},{"Title":"Paracelsian Philosophy","review":"There are 5 audio cassettes that will take you roughly 5 hours to listen to. But once you listen to Manly Hall's lectures on Paracelsus you will be moved, inspired and amazed. Paracelsus, whose super long name I will not write here, is considered the father of alchemy. Using his experience and insight of both the medical and chemistry fields of study to understand the nature of the natural universe. This is the universe which exists without filters the mind uses to discriminate between left and right, good and bad, right and wrong. That which is left is between (the word Parzival literally means &quot;between the mountains). This essentially was known at the time as 'ether'. Today we refer to it as astral, or neurotransmitter. These lectures by Manly Hall are well thought out, clearly stated and scholarly in nature. Hall gives a comprehensive look at the world of Paracelsian thought as well as the life of Paracelsus. The only drawback to this collection is the sound quality. While sometimes, as the reviewer for the 'Alchemy' collection noted, you have to &quot;squint your ears&quot; in order to hear some of his words. Some parts were clear with little trouble understanding what Hall says, other times its muffled and gets lost. I know I dont have the best quality tape deck in my car (and listening in the car will limit my hearing as well), but it is a noticable change in quality from one tape to the next. Hall gives you a truck load of information and to absorb it all will not happen in one listening. Many are reqiured if one is out to get a full grasp of this Masters work.

Suffice to say, if you like other Fletch books, you will like Confess, Fletch.

Fletcher and Francis Xavier Flynn together for their only joint appearance on the printed page. The result is a quite satisfying story in which someone attempts to fram Fletch for murder. Fans of either series will love this fine entry into both of them."},{"Title":"Confess, Fletch","review":"Fletch turns up in Boston claiming to be researching for his forthcoming biography of Edgar Arthur Tharp Jnr. the famous artist. He's left his fiancee in Italy while she deals with her dad's kidnapping and apparent death and is a little taken aback when he finds a young dead girl in the apartment he's arranged to stay in. All of the evidence points to Fletch as the culprit and an unusual police detective called Flynn eyes him with suspicion but just can't bring himself to make the arrest.I would have enjoyed Confess, Fletch more had the stakes been higher, but the plot is all about paintings which is too low-key and hardly creates mental images that are likely to stay with you. The procedure of solving the mystery isn't too rewarding either as it seems to be all over the place until the final twenty pages. I ought to be familiar with Fletch's methods by now, but the entire book seems to be Fletch driving around, getting in and out of cars, and having cryptic conversations with mostly bland characters. The only saving grace is Flynn who turns out to much deeper than I first expected.I'd call this the second weakest of the Fletch series (Carioca Fletch has been the poorest so far), but is still worthy of your attention even if your a casual fan. I hope that Fletch's Fortune is better (I'm reading them in chronological order, not publish order)."},{"Title":"Confess, Fletch","review":"Irwin Maurice Fletcher (Fletch) arrives in Boston, and finds himself the prime suspect of a murder of a woman he has never met. Enter Inspector Francis Xavier Flynn, the ONLY inspector of the Boston Police Department. Against his every wish to bring Fletch in for arrest, he bumbles about in his own way until the real killer is caught.This book is extremely entertaining, with lots of one-liners by the dry Flynn to keep one laughing. Fletch is also at his best, mixing a murder investigation with an art-theft investigation of his own.Quite an enticement to read other Fletch books, as well as the three resulting books about Flynn (way too few in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Confess, Fletch","review":"The bar has been set so high by the popular Fletch and Fletch Lives that this installment does struggle to quite get up there. Fletch is in the States to chase after paintings presumably stolen from his fianc&eacute;e's family. His first encounter upon arrival is that of a dead body in the apartment he is renting. Things move slowly and unevenly but he solves both the case of the stolen paintings and of the dead girl."},{"Title":"Confess, Fletch","review":"Good mystery-I like the books better than the movies of course.

After I saw that movie in high school, I read a few of the books on which it was based. Gregory Mcdonald has nine books with Irwin Maurice Fletcher as an investigative reporter sleuthing, disguising, and lying his way through the mystery. The two Fletch movies portray him as more goofy than he is in the novels, but the books are good reads before bedtime.Confess, Fletch is the second in the series, and has Fletch fly in to Boston to find a murdered woman in his rented house. While trying to solve that murder, he is also trying to track down stolen paintings from a family heirloom from a possibly crooked art dealer.Mcdonald's writing style is breezy and quick, with lots of dialogue to move the story along. If you are interested in mystery novels, this could be for you. I'm not a mystery reader usually. I just like spending time with arrogant smart-alecks."},{"Title":"Confess, Fletch","review":"CONFESS, FLETCH by Gregory McDonald pits Fletch against Francis Xavier Flynn.

The one thing I didn't like about the book (and it might just be a function of the genre and not a fault specific to the book) is that the &quot;solution&quot; to the mystery is not one that you really have any stake in finding.

You'll be reciting them in short order."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","review":"William Shakespeare is best known as a playwright. When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","review":"Shakespeare's collection of sonnets is so much a part of the western cultural heritage that reviewing it is kind of like taking coals to Newcastle, but it is worth a few words. First, however, a note about this edition: it is exactly what I wanted, with a few unobstructive footnotes at the bottom of each page, an index of first lines, and two critical introductions, one offering up historical context, the other more interpretative. They enhance your reading, they do not do it for you.Now, why you want to read this collection. Most of us come to the sonnets singly: random reading assignments, in mixed anthologies, or one is quoted provocatively some place. With few exceptions, each is a perfect example of what the sonnet form does and how form itself shapes meaning. But read straight through consecutively, they offer a close-to-the-bone narrative of Shakespeare's preoccupations. This is the source of all that speculation about his sexual preferences. We've all heard lots of opinions on the bard's relationship with the \\"Young Man\\" and the \\"Dark Lady\\" but there is nothing like getting it first hand, and I must say that my ideas changed after sorting through for myself. For one thing, love--platonic or carnal--is not the only thing on his mind. Immortality, beauty, truth and a few other problems get a work out. The most pleasant surprise is how truly readable and accessible it all is."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","review":"I love Shakespeare's sonnets, but that's not what I'm reviewing--I'm reviewing this particular edition of the sonnets. I received it as a gift and, since it was the only copy I had of the sonnets available to me for some time, I looked forward to reading some old favorites.Much to my chagrin, I couldn't locate any of the sonnets I had made it a point to remember. At last, in an act of desperation, I turned to the preface and found that the editor had renumbered the entire collection according to their probable chronological sequence--meaning the order familiar to nearly everyone has been turned on its head.Oh, but for convenience's sake, they did put the traditional numbers of the sonnets in Roman numerals and brackets at the bottom of each, which doesn't really help at all. It became bothersome and tiring to seek out even one of the sonnets I enjoyed so much.The thing that earned this book three stars, though, rather than one or two, is the artwork of Charles Robinson. Even if the numbering of the sonnets is a huge bother, the illustrations are infinitely nice to look at. They have a turn of the century feel which is well-suited to Shakespeare's poems.This is a nice edition to have for the artwork, or if you can't find another edition (such as the excellent Pelican Shakespeare copy from Penguin). Otherwise, find one that sticks to the usual numbering sequence or has an index of first lines, which this lacks."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","review":"The Sonnets--What are they?We're not sure.Oh we know that Shakespeare's 154 sonnets are, with two exceptions, fourteen line poems following a rhyming scheme of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, that most of them are about love, that Shakespeare's collection form something of a whole in two main parts. But we also have many questions about them that will never be solved.Who is the youth to whom most of the sonnets are addressed? Is a fictional character or is he a friend of Shakespeare's? Who is the Dark Lady at the center of the sonnets in the second part of the collection? Is she fictional? Is she Shakespeare's lover? Is she a courtesan? Is she a lover of a friend? Do the male references to love speak of friendship or of homosexual attraction? Does it matter?These questions are unanswerable yet they are continually debated.One of the things I love about Shakepeare's sonnets is that they require no knowledge of the ancient classics. There are no direct references to Greek or Roman mythology, no direct references to other works of literature. To Shakespeare's contemporaries they were, in theory, immediately comprehensible on a first reading.Two things do make the sonnets difficult to understand. First, English isn't spoken quite the same way today as it was then. The good news though is that once you are used to Shakespeare's idiom, this difficulty vanishes. The second problem is more interesting: the ideas he expresses are convoluted and subtle. A first reading, especially if read out loud to yourself, convinces you they are not nonsense, but it's easy to lose track of what the poet means.For instance in sonnet 129 (for me the single greatest poem in the English language, bar none) what could \\"made in pursuit and in possession so\\" possibly mean? The difficulty in understanding this particular line has convinced some professional scholars to correct, without evidence from any source I should add, that it ought to read \\"mad in pursuit, and in possession so\\" which is easier to understand, but adds nothing to the sonnet. Consequently, many editions of the sonnet since the late 18th century have changed the line. To my mind, this reduces the poem; it is less economical, it repeats or reinforces an idea instead of expressing a new one as does the original.The sonnets challenge you to understand them, but they challenge you on your own terms. With them, Shakespeare expects only that you understand English; he doesn't expect you to know history or legends from the past. Read them, and try to understand them both individually and as a collection. Play with the ideas and change your mind. Get together with friends, choose a single sonnet, and read it out loud taking turns and reading them differently, and have fun!Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: Sonnets","review":"The editor belabors his viewpoint in his commentary, detracting from this reader's enjoyment of the poetry.

Eve. Eve encouraged Chad to pursue a career in sports medicine when he was in high school, and that's exactly what he's decided to do. However, he is also in love with Eve, and knows that she is now working as a physical therapist right here at Fable Harbor. However, Chad knows that now that they are both working at the hospital (not together, of course, but in the same place), that maybe he'll get the chance that he's always dreamed of. To declare his love to Eve, and start a relationship with her. However, when a group of people (both hospital workers and patients) are held hostage by a crazy man holding a syringe of HIV-tainted blood, no one knows what exactly could possibly happen next.I have completely loved the first two books in the UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL series titled UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL and CONDITION CRITICAL, but I must admit that this third installment, CRISIS POINT, takes the cake as my absolute favorite. The excitement and suspense of the novel is absolutely exhilirating, and makes it hard for you to put the book down, even for a lunch break, and the suspense of Chad and Eve's relationship makes the reader root for Chad in his quest to somehow, someway tell Eve how he really feels about her.

The photos range from important sports and celebrity moments to symbolic or historical political statements.Since the photos are taken from an agency that shoots primarily photo journalistic photos, some people may not appreciate some of the photos. The true beauties of these images lie in the capture of the moment and emotion and truth. I really enjoyed many of the political and war photos, very in your face. Some of them were shocking, taking me back in realization and touched me at the same time. In a solely artistic sense, the pictures had a great sense of composition and lighting however they are documentary.

The author relates his \\"Stumbling into Koans\\" as well as sharing the experiences of others who have encountered koan practice.

Each chapter is entitled, for example \\"ON AVOIDING BAD ART\\" or \\"LIFE WITH AND WITHOUT YOUR CHERISHED BELIEFS\\" or \\"THE HEAVEN THAT'S ALREADY HERE\\".

There's nothing of the esoteric in Tarrant's writing.

The writings demonstrate the deep intelligence (not cleverness) of koans and how they can stress the mind from three dimensional thinking into four dimensional paradoxical experiencing. The process may take a year or more so don't expect results from reading this book.The only other book I know of that gives such a wonderful experiential example of awakening is Byron Katie's \\"A Thousand Names for Joy\\".

And after a few months, I found myself wanting to explore the book more. So I broke down and bought it.As I read the book, I realized Tarrant is not trying to explain the koans at all.He first presents each as they were originally written (translated into English, of course). Then he explains the history and historical environment around them, which can sometimes be important to their understanding. Finally, he relates a personal experience around working with the koan.And like the koans themselves, Tarrant's words slowly creep into your thinking. And sometimes they contain brief flashes of enlightenment. But the book definitely has expanded my own practice and study of the koans.But don't take my word for it.

Too bad it's out of print."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"Generally koan study to me has been one area I had lost interest in ibut thanks to this excellent book the practice is made tangible and more relevant to someone not just into that discipline and I see how it can be useful in a more general sense.I was very impressed with the presentation."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"i love this book. it has crawled into my heart. tender, loving stories of real life and finding peace in the very midst of all life is. john tarrant writes with grace and beauty and humor. thank you!!!"},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"Koans are gateways for a Zen practitioner to realize Buddha nature. John Tarrant's book is a pleasant introduction to some of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" of Koans, adding one new one of Australian aboriginal origin. (Tarrant is a Tasmanian.)The form of realization that Tarrant focuses on is the one-ness of all things. Over and over he describes the experience of realization as perceiving all things as glowing with presence and meaning, accompanied by the feeling of certainty that you are all things and that all things are you. He makes it seem as if that specific experience - should you ever get there - is the end of suffering, the beginning of the potential for true happiness.The initial Kensho (realization) experience is, in general, a shallow one. If you place too much emphasis on it and get stuck in the initial experience of one-ness there's a \\"zen stink\\" associated with that condition. It takes years to internalize and broaden the initial realization to the point where you can be called \\"realized\\". Even a long-ripened realization can be seriously incomplete. Tarrant and also Yasutani roshi, Eido Shimano roshi, Genpo Merzel roshi (among many others) are cases in point that being realized - even deeply realized - doesn't necessarily make you a good person, a happy person, a smart person, a compassionate person, or someone who does not suffer or cause others significant suffering.John Tarrant broke with Aitken roshi's Diamond Sangha in 1999 due to a well-publicized dispute about unethical behavior. Readers of this book should learn more about that split to understand who Tarrant is in the Zen world. See the link to a PDF on Matthew T. Ciolek's Web page entitled \\"Sanbo-Kyodan: Harada-Yasutani School of Zen Buddhism References & Footnotes number 001-200\\" in footnote 74 ('Diamond Sangha Teachers Circle Open Letter to John Tarrant', dated 16 Dec 1999 and signed by Robert Aitken, Augusto Alcalde, Subhana Barzaghi, Gillian Coote, Jack Duffy, Nelson Foster, Pat Hawk, Danan Henry, Michael Kieran, Leonard Marcel, and Marian Morgan. Reprinted in: 'Sydney Zen Centre Newsletter', Feb-Mar 2000, pp. 4-5).Still, the book is well-written and a good read. It reflects Tarrant's expertise as a psychologist with a Jungian orientation."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"How comfortable I find myself in these pages. John Tarrant brings us intriguing stories and a Rhino, a thick-skinned beast that we can ride into the darkness of the unknown, into the mystery of who we are, why we suffer, and how joy can found on a path that goes beyond what can be conceptually understood. An excellent gift book too."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"John Tarrant is a superb writer and poet.

It contains much ancient wisdom."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"I just want to add my voice to the chorus of people who like this book. I had always thought of zen as cold and austere. I went to a zen meditation with my aunt and was happy to discover delight and color! John Tarrant led the meditation. Afterwards, he gave me this book. I read it a little each night. I found it to be very comforting. There were a few phrases from koans and from John's writing that resonated deeply in my heart. I felt more connected, less alone, and felt hopeful that there is a corner I am just about to see around- a possibility of delight.I want to do more koan work and more meditations. During the week after the meditation, I had a few nice moments of being totally present and grateful- that I don't usually experience. One time in the shower, I felt the warm water on my skin and felt immense gratitude for being in a body, able to experience the sensation of warm water. I've been more conscious of being embodied and very grateful for that. What a nice feeling! To take delight in just being alive. I want more of that. The meditation helped me experience that and the book helped me believe in the possibility that I can experience that even more.A few weeks later, after reading the book, I went to a day long meditation- also with John Tarrant. I never thought I would EVER want to do that. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I guess I am joining the ranks of the meditators! And I appreciate this book for making that seem like something I would want to do. I appreciate John Tarrant's message. I wanted more delight in my life, and I've found it, and I think I've found a way to get even more."},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"You can't help but admire Australians for their total, impervious self-confidence. The koan is a notoriously profound and baffling subject: even renowned Zen Masters hesitated to write about it for fear of misleading people. John Tarrant has never done anything resembling credible koan-study; and on the evidence of this book he has no realisation to speak of. But he speaks of it anyway: he rambles on entertainingly, expanding for pages what was intentionally left sketchy, quoting from his English Studies reading list and delving deep into the bag of \\"sounds nice but what does it mean\\" quasi-Buddhist verbiage.I've awarded this two stars as a readable and more than averagely literate example of the teeming self-help/pop psychology genre. As a book about the koan its value is zero. So you know what you're getting and you can decide whether you need it or not.What other reviewers thought:\\"In reality you don't understand a single word or phrase of these Ancients. The koan is like a vast raging fire, you can't even get close to it or touch it, forget about trying to sit or lie down in the middle of it.\\" (Master Po-shan)\\"Anyone without insight who simply reads the words of the old Masters and then proceeds to teach his own opinions behaves in a most dangerous way.\\" (Mus Kokushi)\\"Those who think verbal explanations and literary accounts are the Way covet fame and profit: they ruin themselves and others.\\" (Early Zen Teacher Gunabhadra)"},{"Title":"Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy","review":"John Tarrant is a prominent western Buddhist (OK, he's an Aussie, so you could technically call him an eastern Buddhist). Be that as it may, he writes charmingly and creatively, expanding on some very old koans, adding vignettes from his own personal history, and making the koans themselves more accessible and understandable for those of us who are baffled by them. That's the good news.The bad news is, and the problem I had with this book, which I just re-read, is that like many modern and Tibetan Buddhists, he liberally interprets The First Precept, you know, the one that forbids killing. At one point he breezily talks about how he and a Buddhist friend of his were eating sausage and cheese on the friend's deathbed. He mentions eating hamburger in another section, and so on. Now, I know that benign acceptance of animal eating is par for the course for Buddhism these days, but it's a real turnoff for those of us who believe that not killing and eating animals is a vital part of that philosophy.There are all kinds of excuses given by Buddhists for this behavior, including that not eating animals is a form of attachment (!); that the Dalai Lama eats meat (every other day, and only because his doctors have unfortunately convinced him that he will die if he doesn't); that if as a begging monk you're offered meat, unless the animal was killed for you, you should eat it; that the Buddha never actually said Buddhists should not eat animals (this depends on what writings you follow in the Buddhist canon); that you're not actually killing anything because existence is illusion anyway (!); that you're somehow helping animals in their karmic progress by supporting their suffering and deaths (!), etc. The fact that nothing the Buddha said was written down until hundreds of years later, and so there are various interpretations of what he meant, as Norm Phelps points out in his excellent book \\"The Great Compassion, doesn't help matters.So if you just take this book at face value as a kind of fun koan romp and ignore the rhinoceros of animal exploitation in the room, you'll enjoy it.

There are also homages from directors like Martin Scorsese and Rainier Werner Fassbinder, as well as essays by Roland Barthes and Alberto Moravia. One might wonder why such famous and accomplished people took the time to write about a French filmmaker whose movies are not known to the general moviegoing public. The answer is that the late Bresson actually was one of the great figures in cinema.

I'd recommend it whoheartedly for undergraduate courses on the topic. Some minor criticisms: first, I would have liked the section on theoretical perspectives to be more extensive, while the chapter on methods seems to me to be superflous, at least for undergraduates. Second, at the bottom of page 232, the information give is confusing. It talks about tons, without specifying whether metric or not. Further, it uses ounces, pounds and kilos, all very unclear. Thirdly, the sections on the socialist system are obsolete, insofar as those systems have practically disappeared. And, yes, although the author claims, at the bottom of p.1 that he has followed an eclectic apporach, &quot;without embracing or advocating a particular position, ideology, or theoretical stance&quot;, the truth is that I feel I detect a very subtle but, nonetheless recognizable, &quot;leftish&quot; leaning.

I felt so lucky when I found this book because I haven't found a book like this on the market for .NET debugging. This isn't just a book you read through once, and set aside, as it will definitely become a permanent part of your reference library. The author did an absolutely exceptional job in comprehensively covering debugging techniques and issues from everything from ASP.NET, SQL Server, Windows Forms, Web Services, to Classic VB, and the depth of knowledge this author shares about such things as debugging tools, approaches to take towards a project, and how to really fully use Visual Studio .NET's debugger are never taught in college courses. There is even a full chapter on debugging multithreaded applications, which the author even mentions that most Visual Basic programmers are unfamiliar with. I got this book initially to study Visual Studio .NET's debugger capabilities, and learn about debugging techniques, but I was amazed at the volumes of information. This book is so versatile that you can match the debugging techniques to the type of project your might be faced with, and that's why I say again \\"It's going to be a great reference book to keep handy by your desk.\\" The detailed information on such things as utilizing Visual Studio. NET's debugger is much better, and easier to understand than information I have seen on Microsoft's Website. So many different debugging scenarios are covered, but just as example, in Visual Studio .NET the author explains how to attach the debugger to a process, or how to debug programs without loading them into the IDE, such as a production component that is currently running, or a Web service running on another machine, and gives a very thorough breakdown on the general debugging options in Visual Studio .NET. This book even offers great insight into why bugs even happen in an application in the first place. What I also enjoyed about this book is that I could jump ahead to any chapter I wanted to read. The writing style is smooth, and easy to follow. The examples given are endless.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about doing .NET development work!"},{"Title":"Comprehensive VB .NET Debugging","review":"Really enjoyed the discussion on traps and pitfalls, and the differences that the VB.NET language has with C#.

In the first issue we meet the mysterious vampire hunter Nicholas Bane and learn about his tragic past. Born of both human and vampire, Bane's sole purpose is to hunt down and kill creatures of the night. This tireless quest brings him to the small town of Santa Anna, Mexcio, a quaint, sleepy town which houses many dark secrets. Bane, an American, is given a harsh welcome by the local toughs who don't want him around but he finds a sympathetic voice in Anna who runs a local inn called the Azul. When one of the local gang members turns up dead, literally torn to pieces by some horrible beast, Bane finds himself the suspect by the suspicious townspeople as well as the gang elements. Bane learns that the men work for a local drug lord named Gino Carlos who controls everything in the town including the mayor. Soon Bane begins to delve into the mysteries of Santa Anna to find out just what or who it is that drew him to the cursed town.Claws of Darkness is a beautifully produced comic/graphic novel series. It's printed on thick, glossy stock paper and the colors in the painted book by Cho are dazzling. The comic-sized book is produced in traditional Manga format to be read from right to left. As a person who reads a lot of black & white Manga titles, it was nice to read one in full-color and a larger format than the more traditional digest-sized books. Nicholas Bane will certainly remind readers of another brooding vampire hunter. A great start to this gritty yet striking series and I cannot wait to see how the story unfolds in future issues.

The work includes some stand out pieces from the early 20th century, including an article from Charlotte Perkin Gillman's physician S. Weir Mitchell \\"When the College is Hurtful to a Girl.\\" Yet the book is uneven. It needed to offer a broader range of voices including those of African American women involved with the black power movement of the 1960s. Many of those women contested white feminist claims of solidarity and male oppression. African American women involved with Marcus Garvey's UNIA in the early 20th century promoted race pride through a manipulation of patriarchal language that sounded antifeminist. Selections from this movement would have nuanced the collection. [On this subject, ULa Taylor's work on Amy Jacques-Garvey would be excellent reading for undergrads or grad students. She offers a nuanced interpretation of Jacques-Garvey's \\"community feminism.\\"}Content gaps aside, the real drawback is that the collection doesn't offer any sort of intellectual guide for the reader. It would be difficult to assign the book as a reader for a class without simultaneously offering careful assessments of time, place, and author of each piece. This might be handled in part, with a very comprehensive textbook. I chose to select a few pieces to assign in conjunction with other materials. Had the collection contained basic introductions or even better article/chapter excerpts from substantial academics to help explain the shifting currents of anti-feminism in the US, I would have gladly assigned the it."},{"Title":"Pocket WW Hndbk 3e-IE Adv Ser","review":"I've used the previous version, The Pocket Holt Handbook,in the past and loved it because it was slim, visual,colorful, and easy to use.All the things I liked about the Holt are missing here.It's thicker and more bloated.

The Cornichons recipe is, quite frankly, the worst pickle I have ever made. Extremely salty and extremely vinegary. I would not make the mustard pickles since they require the use of saccharine. I feel like the author did not test these recipes thoroughly enough and considering how expensive the book is, I was very disappointed overall. With the amount of time and effort we put into home preserving, the authors should make every effort to have perfect recipes that have been tested several times. I may try another pickle recipe from this book, BUT ... if you like fresh pickles, a really nice book is Easy Japanese Pickling in 5 minutes to 1 day by Seiko Ogawa.

However, if you are looking for a comprehensive guide to pickling then you should look elsewhere. This could be considered akin to a small cookbook with some varied basic recipes, many of which are easy enough to do without much prior experience, but it lacks going into any depth into the pickling process and first time picklers and canners may be more comfortable starting out with a more thorough book such asThe Joy of Pickling, Revised Edition: 250 Flavor-Packed Recipes for Vegetables and More from Garden or Market."},{"Title":"Pickled: Vegetables, Fruits, Roots, More--Preserving a World of Tastes and Traditions","review":"A fun book, my daughter and I have tried quite a few of the recipes."},{"Title":"Pickled: Vegetables, Fruits, Roots, More--Preserving a World of Tastes and Traditions","review":"I was aggravated I even paid for this book.

I [God] will bless you [Isreael], and you are to bless the nations. Bob Sjogren explains familiar Old and New Testament passages using the &quot;top line&quot; and &quot;bottom line&quot; blessing formula. For example, after David kills Goliath, in I Samuel 17, the purpose is not just that Israel will be saved from the Philistines (top line) but that the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel (bottom line). The question of why Israel did not lead a truly active missionary role in the Old Testament is also addressed. The book reveals God's plan of salvation and challenges Christians today to put their blessings to work to bless the nations with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I highly recommend this book to all who wonder at the unity between the Old and New Testaments, and who have any level of interest in missions. We are blessed to bless the nations!"},{"Title":"Unveiled at Last: Discover God's Hidden Message from Genesis to Revelation","review":"From my experiences growing up Christian, Missions was never talked about. I heard about Christ's love through the gospel, but this book really puts into perspective the bigger picture. The larger perspective penetrates all of history and culminates at the end of time where people from &quot;every&quot; ethnic group are giving glory to God. The books makes its case by extensively citing the Bible. It opened my eyes to verses and passages that I never quite understood before. It changed my perspective from seeing missions as one part of the Christian life as to driving motivation for all ministries. As I pondered the concepts more and wrote papers on the subject, I realized that fullness of God's love for me to a greater depth. Read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Unveiled at Last: Discover God's Hidden Message from Genesis to Revelation","review":"This book by Bob Sjogren has been an absolute God send for me - it has helped me to clarify the message of the Bible - the continuous message of God's love that goes out to the world - from the beginning through the Book of Revelation. This book has been a real eye opener. I have come to love the heart of Bob Sjogren. He has a gift with words as is evident in this book - with communicating the heart of God for the world that he so loves. I thought I understood this idea of the continuous message of the love of God for the world / nations, but Bob Sjogren has made it apparent that I had much yet to learn! Thanks Bob for great teaching!"},{"Title":"Unveiled at Last: Discover God's Hidden Message from Genesis to Revelation","review":"Every Christian should read this! If you want to do what GOD wants, you'll find the answers in this book!"},{"Title":"Unveiled at Last: Discover God's Hidden Message from Genesis to Revelation","review":"The basic premise of the &quot;Be blessed and pass those blessings to others&quot; is good, and very insightful, but that only goes for about 5 chapters, and then he changes the whole premise for the book to &quot;missionaries are only those who go to unreached people groups&quot;, which is a common theology of missions today. It seemed like he wanted to use the first to prove the latter, and that seemed like a stretch. I wished he would have kept to the original subject, as he could have gone a lot deeper into it. Still, the first half of the book is really good, worthwhile reading.(It's a required text for mission majors at Liberty University, and everyone gets it online because the book supplier for the school is awful, so that's why Lynchburg is #1 for buying this book... :)"},{"Title":"The English Puritans, (The Cambridge manuals of science and literature)","review":"In the preface the author makes clear that his aim is to provide a middle ground to Puritan history. He does not attempt to exhaust the subject nor does he attempt to merely give a cursory reading of the rise and fall of the Puritans. Brown takes us on a journey from the early origins of Puritanism in the 1500s through its rise and downfall in the mid and late 1600's.Brown's main concern in this work is not so much with outlining the theological convictions of the Puritans but in showing how their theological convictions created the Puritan political history. J.I. Packer describes the book well when he says, \\"John Brown's account of the political history of the Puritans up to 1660 has not lost its freshness. It is a heroic, inspiring story and Brown tells it well.\\"What I Liked:Brown writes the story as if he were at every meeting and as if he is giving you the inner workings of the Puritan movement, therefore, it is intriguing and a very easy read. After reading the second chapter on the vestments controversy you come away with a bigger appreciation for how small things can have an effect on great things. Would I sacrifice my family's livelihood for the sake of freedom of attire? Is it really that important of an issue? Brown does an excellent job of showing us the importance as well as consequences of such issues.What I Disliked:While the book is very readable it also leaves the reader in the dark on many things. The author makes clear that his aim is to provide a middle ground and not exhaust the subject. Therefore, such a work would serve well as an introductory book. However, because of the lack of footnotes the reader is forced to make notes and look up these names and events elsewhere. A work that attempts to not be exhaustive should provide footnotes for further research and explanation otherwise the book might find itself abandoned on the bookshelf.Another aspect that is difficult for the typical American is that Brown writes as one familiar to the English political system. Without a thorough knowledge of this it can become difficult to understand the significance of what Brown is saying. This is more a result of my ignorance and not Brown's, however, let the casual American reader be advised to at least familiarize himself with the English government.Should You Buy It?This depends on what you are looking for. If you are already pretty familiar with the Puritans and their movement then this would be an interesting read. If this is your first exposure to the Puritans (both historically and theologically), then perhaps you would be better served elsewhere. However, if you decide to skip this book in favor of studying the Puritans elsewhere I would suggest picking it back up after you are familiarized with the movement. It adds great insight into historical struggles."},{"Title":"American Indian Politics and the American Political System (Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics)","review":"This is an essential text on role of Indians in US political system, designed to be used by undergraduates. The chapters cover just about every issue, including history, demographics, activism, tribal political systems, federal and state policies toward Indians, and the images of Native Americans in national media. The emphasis is on Native Americans within the US political system as a whole, and not on politics within tribes or on reservations.Though the factual material is presented in a balanced way, Wilkins has a clear political position that is evident in every chapter of the text. Among other consequences, this means that he does not take a critical stance toward the tribal governments, political movements, or individual Native Americans that he discusses. In the classroom, this would provide a good foundation for discussion, while the non-classroom reader will simply have to read the book critically.While the bias is a \\"feature,\\" not a \\"flaw,\\" the book also has some minor flaws. For examples, uncertain organization mars the chapter on \\"actors in Indian politics.\\" Rather than focusing narrowly on these actors, Wilkins intersperses his treatment of actors and the history of particular policies. Some of this confusion is inevitable, since the role of the BIA as an actor obviously reflects the legislative history of the agency, but Wilkins does not try to keep these issues analytically distinct.Oddly for a book on politics, Wilkins doesn't discuss tribal political systems all that much. For much better treatment of this issue, albeit one limited to the Montana reservations, see Lopach et al., Tribal Government Today.Despite these weaknesses, this really is the best overall book on American Indian politics that I have been able to find. It would be useful both for the general reader interested in the topic and for undergraduate classroom use."},{"Title":"American Indian Politics and the American Political System (Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics)","review":"Bad service, never even got my book.

The editors selected the most evocative, interesting and amusing reports of Catherine Cole (Martha Field) of her journeys through Louisiana. She can be nearly a poetess in describing the scenes and sights she saw; she's a pragmatic who relates the commercial activities and opportunities of her era Louisiana; she's a \\"rough\\" traveler who can deal, many times unhappily and/or amusingly, with mud, swamps, and heat.

If you are at all familiar with analytical psychology and the themes encountered while doing psychoanalysis, then you will feel \\"right at home\\" soaking up the symbolic meaning of Mr. Birkh&auml;user's images.The book provides an introduction to the painter Peter Birkh&auml;user, the plates and commentaries, and a lecture by Peter Birkh&auml;user on \`Analytical Psychology and the Problems of Art.' The text is in both English and German.The individual plates each have a commentary by Marie-Louise von Franz, one of Carl Jung's \\"inner circle\\" of friends and analysts. The commentaries do not represent the conscious thoughts of the artist, but instead try to achieve a subsequent understanding of the paintings and thus hint at possible interpretations. Even so, her intuitive grasp of dreams, symbols and fairy tales makes it a rich source of commentary and connection to the \`real material' being portrayed in the images.You won't want to loan this book once you find one, so better get two copies so that you have a loaner!"},{"Title":"Rain in the winds,: A story of India","review":"Although multicultural studies are now a fundamental component of education in the United States, many people believe it is a new phenomenon. That is not the case, children in the United States have read stories about children and people in other lands for decades and the only modern difference is in degree. This book is about a boy named Arun that lives in India; his pet elephant Moti and the effect the monsoon rains has on their lives.The village is a small farming one that has been settled by the same families for decades. This year the monsoon rains are late in coming and the river has dried up along with most of the vegetation. Dust blows constantly and if something is not done, the people of the village will begin to starve. An iterant trader comes through and offers Arun food and water if he can rent Moti for a while. With little choice, Arun reluctantly agrees yet when Moti is gone he misses him.Arun accompanies a camel caravan up into the cooler hills where he finds Moti working to build a dam. The dam represents progress for India; it will control the flooding due to the rain and provide a regular supply of water. Arun and Moti work together on the dam and while they are gone the monsoon rains return and their village is green once again when they come back from working on the dam.While young children cannot grasp complex differences in culture, they will understand the simple topics in this book. Arun's village was typical of India in the 1950's and 1960's, although the country has modernized a great deal in the last two decades. Therefore, while this is a snapshot of village life in India a half-century ago, what you see in this book is probably not what you would see if you were to go there."},{"Title":"Anatomy of the Human Body","review":"This is definitely not the book to buy if you are looking for an atlas or general anatomical text.

He pitched for the Pirates from the late 60's to the mid-70's, moving to the Yankees for one last terrific season before a seeming lack of dedication/interest left him wasting away in Texas. He had a less than glorious return to Pittsburgh in 1979 before calling it a career. This is not your usual sports bio. Donald Hall brings his poetic style to the narrative and Dock brings his own strange blend of stubborness,talent &amp; inconsistancy to the table. While the book does hit some sluggish spells, you should be able to overlook its flaws to learn more about a man who pitched a no-hitter following a night of LSD (talk about performance enhancing), was maced by security before a start, made a surreal trip to Vietnam with should-be-Hall of Famer Bobby Bonds &amp; began one game with the sole purpose of trying to drill every Reds batter he faced. There are also clubhouse &amp; field tales involving such greats as Gaylord Perry, Willie McCovey, Willie Stargell, Roberto Clemente, Thurman Munson, Reggie Jackson &amp; Jim &quot;Cy or Cry&quot; Palmer. Dock angered many people during his career, but he was often delivering the truth in an absurdly blunt package. This is not a great book by any stretch of the imagination. It is, however, a very entertaining and revealing look at one of the most colorful players of his generation. Ellis does not pull any punches on personal issues, but, unlike Jim Bouton, he and Donald Hall have gone to great lengths to make certain that their inside stories don't bring harm, in a personal manner, to those who played alongside or against Dock. It is not a reckless tell-all tome, but it does tell quite a bit about the talented enigma that is Dock Ellis, who wore out many a pair of spikes loping from the penthouse to the doghouse and back again...and again...and again- ad nauseum. --R.H.Conner"},{"Title":"Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball","review":"Now that Donald Hall has been named poet laureate of the United States, maybe Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball will get a little of the attention it's long deserved. This is one of those fun books (like David Foster Wallace's A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again, or Nicholson Baker's U and I, or Steve Almond's Candyfreak) that Hall wrote because he had come to a place in his career where he could. It doesn't aspire to art, but by taking seriously baseball's class clown Dock Ellis, it achieves it. Ellis took himself very seriously, and his on-the-field antics and the contemporary newspaper accounts that made light of them did not begin to account for the articulate, interesting, complicated character Hall found while following him around baseball diamond after baseball diamond.Now, these many years removed from the book's immediate post-Civil Rights era setting, the book goes a long way toward helping younguns like me understand what it was like to live and breathe and be in those fragile years.It's amazing that this little gem is still in print, and who knows how long it will be so? I'm grateful to the publishers, and I hope more readers will become acquainted with the pleasures of Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball."},{"Title":"Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball","review":"Donald Hall, one of the country's great poets, writes with passion about Dock Ellis, one of baseball's most colorful figures. If all you know about Dock Ellis is that he once pitched a no-hitter on LSD, then you need to read this book and learn the other 90% of his story. And if you, like me, have never heard of Dock Ellis at all, Hall's engrossing account will acquaint you with a man who deserves wider recognition, as much for his constant support of the black community and his commitment to fighting drug addiction as for his on-field stats. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dock Ellis in the Country of Baseball","review":"I grew up in Pittsburgh when the Pirates were not only good but socially relevant. They were full of star players like Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell and Bill Mazeroski. They always seemed to good young players coming up from the minor leagues. Lastly they also had a lot of characters such as the good doctor, Dock Philip Ellis. Now this book has been out a very long time, but it only recently came to my attention. It brought back a lot of memories from my childhood, but it also gave me a much more nuanced look at Dock Ellis as a man as well as a player. I am very happy to have belatedly discovered this fine book.

Allowing young adults, and adults alike, exposure to these shonen-ai and shojou-ai sources provides hope for a more understanding world.

Gravitation has opened eyes to different ways of life, and gives identifiable characters to real people through the use of humor.

Gravitation is meant for a few laughs, but this volume just pushes it over the edge a bit.There are a few cute scenes with Yuki and such in them, and it opens quite a few new possibilities but some of the less important scenes tend to get in the way.The artwork is changed a little bit if you dig through it and you can tell where the artist changed a few things here and there. I'm quite fond of the artwork still though, compared to the artwork during the first book.The volume is good and I wasn't too disappointed but the earlier books were, in my opinion, better plot-wise. I've been a fan of Gravitation for over five years now, and I can safely say that while its one of the best and one of the classic BL titles, the later volumes of the series have gone downhill in quality and interest. Nevertheless, this volume is still a must-buy for long-time fans."},{"Title":"Gravitation, Vol. 9","review":"Gravitation has always been a bit over the top but I think this volume pushes it a little too far. In my opinion it detracted from the series a bit. The serious aspect of the plot (yuki's traumatic past) and the goofy aspect of the plot (mega panda? wtf) just don't seem to blend. There were some great moments, so it wasn't a total let down, but I think the plot has gone way too wacky.

However, I wish there had been more of a focus on Yuki and Shuichi's relationship and I must admit that I despise Shuichi's blond hair.On the up side, the artwork in this volume surpasses all the previous ones.

Winner (Awards))","review":"Spanning the growing up years of Consuelo and ending when she is sixteen, this novel is a coming of age story about a young girl finding out who she wants to be. She sheds her family's and her culture's attitudes about gender roles. Consuelo grows up in Puerto Rico with a progressive father and traditional mother, the older daughter whose role is to watch over her younger sister, Mili, who is the more beautiful and unfortunately, the more imbalanced. As Mili grows older, she slips into mental illness, and Consuelo struggles to care for her and her eroding family. In the end Consuelo must leave Puerto Rico for New York in order to become her own person. (H) Patient readers will enjoy the novel's complex plots and the story of Consuelo's quest for independence."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"Consuelo resides with her parents and younger sister in a rented house on the periphery of San Juan, Puerto Rico during the 1950's. During this time period Puerto Rico is undergoing dramatic social and economic changes as the island is continually being Americanized. This rift is mirrored in Consuelo's household as her parents and relatives are split between welcoming modern American products and holding on to uniqueness of Puerto Rican history and culture. Her neighborhood, or pueblo, is filled with gossipy older woman who fail to allow anything to pass their gaze. What's worse, Consuelo's mother has an overbearing personality and is a bit nosey in her own rights. Her aunts and grandmother are a continued source of strength, comfort, and guidance to their family.As Consuelo transforms into a senorita she begins to realize that the individuals who are closest to her are becoming a mystery. Her cousin and best friend Patricio all of a sudden reverts into his own world and stops attending school. There are concerning rumors circulating about his relationship with the pueblo's notorious cross-dresser. In addition, Consuelo's younger sister is slowing adopting curious and strange behaviors that include developing a language of her own. There is little solace or comfort with her parents as her mother suspects her father of having an affair with a woman at work. Nothing is at it seems.THE MEANING OF CONSUELO is filled with frank and sorrowful details of how one girl's transformation to become a woman is burdened without being melodramatic or overdramatic. Judith Ortiz Cofer's prose is sprinkled with colorful Spanish words that add texture to this narrative. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others who enjoy multicultural themes or coming-of-age stories."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"The Consuelo of the title is the adolescent daughter of a Puerto Rican family living in a San Juan residential area in the 1950's. The novel is on a small scale about the trials and tribulations of the family as it deals with the vagaries of life in Puerto Rico at this point in time. On a larger scale the novel projects the overarching changes occurring in Puerto Rican society as American influence and cultural encroachment undermine many aspects of traditional Puerto Rican life and culture. All of this is viewed through the prism of Consuelo's turbulent, adolescent world view.Judith Ortiz Cofer uses a variety of literary devices to create parallel aspects of divisiveness and turbulence within the family and Consuelo's family. Her father is very American oriented, her mother very traditionally oriented. The schizoid aspects of the greater society engendered by the breakdown in traditional cultures are mirrored in the family by the appearance and development of obvious mental disease in Consuelo's sister, Mili. And so on. Some of this works well, some of it comes off clumsily.The strength of the book rests in the integrity of Consuelo's character as well as in the author's ability to evoke both the spirit and the instability of 1950's Puerto Rico. Her ability to create a truly empathetic and genuine Latino sense of family within Consuelo's home is also a strength, enough so that the artifice of some of her mechanical device manipulations are rendered, if not moot, at least minimal in terms of affecting the story.On the whole I found this to be an excellent if somewhat disjointed novel. Cofer is a poet as well as a novelist and essayist and the prose has a poetic, well paced quality that adds effectively to the ambience of the story. Her characters generally are well fleshed out and sympathetically presented. The ambiance of the book is good if the mechanics are occasionally irritating.In the end the quality of the story and prose, as well as Cofers ability to genuinely render a sense of the time and place involved, overwhelms the weaknesses of the book. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"The Meaning of Consuelo by Judith Ortiz Cofer is both a stunning tribute to the island of Puerto Rico (and something of an indictment of U.S. development and its negative impact on the island's culture and natural splendor) and a deeply affecting story of one family's heartbreaking misfortune (the mental instability suffered by the family's beautiful younger daughter, Mili). The story is told by Mili's older sister, Consuelo, who is charged with keeping an eye on her sibling from the time they are toddlers. Against the subtle backdrop of Mili's mounting mental illness, Consuelo tries to forge her own identity within her fractured family and the confines of the larger Puerto Rican culture of the 1950's. She does this while trying to make sense of her budding womanhood, her puzzlement over Maria Sereno (the cross-dressing neighborhood outcast), and her attachment to her gay cousin, Patricio (who is something of a pariah in his own family).This is a deeply moving story about the suffering of women and the fragile bonds that hold families together. It is so authentically rendered you will feel as though you are in the kitchen with three generations of Puertorrique&ntilde;as, drinking caf&eacute; con leche served through a stained cloth colander as they share their collective bewilderment over the \\"tragedia\\" befalling their otherwise upstanding, middle-class family. I reeled from the pain experienced by the Signe family. They tried so hard to keep it together and hold on to their faade of being \\"gente decente\\"--decent people, trying to avert a scandal surrounding Mili's mental illness.The gut-wrenching ending was harsh, and I didn't see it coming. But with her unhappy ending, Ortiz underscores the tough choices young adults must sometimes make: You can either drown with the sinking ship out of loyalty to your family, or run away and save yourself.At 185 pages, The Meaning of Consuelo is supposed to be young-adult fiction, but it boasts a strength of character you often don't find in adult offerings. Its combination of exquisite prose and keen human insight makes this otherwise fast and easy read a cultural emblem and literary treasure.I will not soon forget The Meaning of Consuelo. Most books written for a mass audience suffer from a notable lack of depth and emotion. However well-crafted and entertaining they may be, they leave you hungry once you've finished, because all they offer is a sort of literary pabulum--a blandness akin to airline fare. But every now and again, along comes a hidden gem like The Meaning of Consuelo--poignant, quirky, heartfelt, and utterly unselfconscious--just like its protagonist. I would love to see more \\"Consuelos\\" topping the bestseller lists, but authors like Ortiz write from the heart, rather than pander to the masses."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"The book The Meaning of Consuelo, by Judith Ortiz Cofer, is about a 1950's Puerto Rican family. In this time period \\"Americanization\\" comes to the island and changes many people lives. The main character Consuelo is a 14 year old girl and her younger sister Mili is about 11. These two girls live with there parents in Puerto Rico. There father works at the Golden Palms hotel in Puerto Rico and there mother is unemployed. This book is the story of Consuelo, a young girl trying to find her way in life. She has always been referred to as the smart sensible one while her sister is know as the risk taking, wild child. Consuelo is just trying to find her way in life and where she belongs in her family and in society. Consuelo's best friend is her cousin Patricio who is about the same age as Consuelo. They know each other better than anyone else and hoped that nothing would tear them apart. Consuelo has a large family with many aunts, uncles and cousins who she visits very often.Consuelo's life at home seems to be going well until \\"la tragedia\\" as she likes to call it occurs. She can feel that a tragedy will be occurring within her family but she has no idea what. The main themes of this book are family and tragedy which will have a major effect on Consuelo and her actions. Her family goes through its up and down through the entire book. The tragedy hits hard and will force them family to make one of the biggest decisions ever.In this book you learn about Consuelo's family, friends, interests and decisions. You will see the outcome of her choices and what she has to go through for her family. I liked this book because Consuelo and I are similar ages. I can relate to the decisions that someone of that age is forced to make and consequences of the actions that one must deal with. Now is also the time that I am trying to find my way in life and seeing how someone else found there way helps.From reading this book I have learned that all families go through problems big or small. At the end of the day, your family is still your family and will always be there to help you. Without a strong family to support you, you won't be able to make it in life and its as simple as that.I would recommend this book because anyone can relate to Consuelo, male or female, 14 years old or 60 years old. Everyone can find similarities to Consuelo and her struggles. She is such a strong person and anyone can admire that."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"Well the title just about says it all but yes it is a great novel about growing up and maturing in PR. Its different from History books in that it touches real life issues and themes from a first-hand basis such as homosexuality, losing virginity, leaving home, family tragedy, pressures and responsibilities. These are just some of the themes which Consuelo, the main character, deals with; there are plenty more. Very enjoyable and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature.

The bond between the sisters in this story is incredible, as is the universal of growing up, becoming a woman and emotionally moving away from one's parents. Without giving away the story, this is a must read, and is one of the most incredible books I have read in many, many years."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Winner (Awards))","review":"Consuelo has always been the responsible one, the one who takes care of her little sister, Mili. Mili is the pretty one, the vivacious one, but she also tends to wander off or to get lost in her own head. As a child these traits were charming, but as she grows into a young woman they become more worrisome, until the family is forced to confront the fact that Mili is mentally ill.This is a great story of how mental illness in a family affects every member, and how a child who isn't sick is often shuffled to the side. I like that this book acknowledged that fact, while not going too over the top with Consuelo's character. Her rebellions were relatively small and harmless and she never stopped loving her sister throughout her ordeal.I didn't like the ending; I felt as though the author took the easy way out instead of trying to figure out what the next step in this family's saga would be. However, she did give plenty of advance notice that it was coming, so at least I was not caught completely off guard by the end."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Consuelo : A Novel (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature.

The book deals with coming of age for a young girl, a family's attempt to deal with mental illness, the difficulty of modernization, sexual identity both for heterosexuals and homosexuals, how society treats difference, and wrap it all up in the richness of Puerto Rican culture. A great book for students."},{"Title":"Start Your Own Travel Agency","review":"Basically a worthless book. Perhaps one chapter-worth of information padded with lots of blank space (I mean LOTS) and simplistic truisms repeated again and again. Some sections (e.g., how to organize your home office) contained just simple generalizations not reflecting any knowledge of the tourism business. I bought the book online so didn't realize what a rip-off it was. If it took this author more than a day to write the book (beyond putting in the wide margins, extra spacing, etc.), there's something wrong. One decent magazine article would have more useful information than this book. There have got to be better books on the topic. Maybe it was a magazine article put into book form. Save your money."},{"Title":"A paddling of ducks","review":"I ENJOYED THIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK. RAISING WATERFOWL OBVIOUSLY TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND PATIENCE. GREAT READ."},{"Title":"A paddling of ducks","review":"Mr. Dillon Ripley shares his experiences in raising waterfowl, from his first small pond as a teenager, to his collections of rare and unusual birds from around the world and his various travels to see them. I found this book among some other waterfowl books that belonged to my dad and, lacking something else to read at the moment, thought it might be mildly interesting for a day or two. It turned out to be a pleasant and surprisingly charming book. Written about 50 years ago, he relates the various troubles he had with raising ducks, from dealing with predators like weasels, mink, snapping turtles, and owls, to disasters such as floods and hurricanes. It was kind of fun to read about the trips he took with a friend while still in school to gather eggs from Eiders, or the visits he made to various duck collectors (some quite eccentric) while living in India and Sri Lanka during WWII. It reminded me of going with my dad as a kid to help \\"feed the ducks\\" that he and his brother raised just outside of town, and the countless times my friends and I would ride our bikes out there. I remember my dad and uncle having similar problems with weasels and magpies, or even stray dogs or troublesome teenagers. Most of all it reminded me of sitting with my dad and uncle while drinking the tall glass bottles of Coke my uncle would offer us while they sat and watched their ponds and discussed various things, and I could relate to Mr. Ripley's joy's of having a pond full of ducks. I don't know that this book would have much appeal to someone who doesn't know the difference between a wood duck and a mallard, but I found it to be pleasantly entertaining."},{"Title":"Reverse Negative","review":"The author is very competent in his use of grammar and has a good grasp of the English language. If only he had a proper understanding of the art of telling a story, this book might have had a chance of sustaining the reader's attention. This pedestrian attempt at 'spinning a good yarn' was laughable in its cumbersome but predictable plot development. The characters were no more than silhouettes projected on a gossamer screen, so transparent that they simply expired in the overblown prose."},{"Title":"Reverse Negative","review":"Hackneyed and overblown, and lacking any characters of interest, originality or wit.

Do it anyway--they'll thank you for it!"},{"Title":"Jingle the Brass","review":"My three yr old son and I picked up this book thinking it was just a fun ride with lots of pictures of trains. We started reading and it soon became apparent that this is like a nonfiction book on trains and a historical documentation of oldrailroading slang, not just a simple picturebook adventure.Every phrase is an unexpected text treat: \\"Put on the nosebag\\" (have something to eat) \\" wreck on the main line\\" (scrambled eggs) \\"spoon-feed black diamonds\\" (shovel coal into the engine) \\"cornfield meet\\" (head-on train wreck) All this is the dialogue of the main character, a railroad man who is giving a tour to a young boy having a short train ride, dialogue that gives him character like no descriptive adjectives could do!We are also treated to detailed overviews of the railyard, all very accurate with labels integrated into the illustrations: \\"spur track\\" \\"round house\\", and a two page rundown of the different railcars and their cargo. We have a multitude of books on trains, and I think I learned more from this rolicking little tale!The watercolors are lively and expressive. Very clean and gestural and accurately portray the speed of the train (and the lack of it as it sits on a sidetrack waiting for a passenger car to go by... the opposite of how things work here on Canadian railways!)Historically it has a few fascinating features such as a two page spread about hoboes taking a free ride on the train. There is so much detail we can see where the hoboes live, the ones climbing the hil to meet the train, two or three in various stages of boarding, several on the train, and parallel \\"railroad bulls\\" (train cops) hiding in a freight car, sneaking up on them, booting them off, and we see them landing in the water over a bridge and bing saved by someone in a boat. So much for a small boy to take in, both in actions and culturally.And when the passenger train speeds by, we are treated to four sepia inserts showing a period girl in the dining car, sleeper, coach and debarking from the train.Highly highly recommended.
