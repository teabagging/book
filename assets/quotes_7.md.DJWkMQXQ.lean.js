His mother died and he burned his hand with silver, Johnny had a very difficult life. He struggles in his life with only one hand that works. This book gets very interesting how Johnny's life goes later on the book. I liked this book because it has lots of action in it. This book really helps when you are studying the American Revolution. Another reason that this book is great is how he fixes his problem that he has. I really recommend this book if you like action and fighting."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a great book with few defects. It has action, adventure, excitement and drama. Some of the action is all the fighting and warring. Some of the adventure is the retreating under enemy fire and causing the fire. Some of the excitement is the fighting and planning. Some of the drama is the solders dying and being wounded. I liked the book and I hope you do too."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book is very educational and teaches you alot about the Boston Tea Party and other historical facts.

Five stars for Esther Forbes! I hated the ending though. I think Johnny should have stayed with Cilla and Ms. Bessie. One thing I didn't like was that Mrs. Lampham(Cilla's mother) should have gotten Doctor Warren instead of a midwife when Johnny burned his hand. We studied the American Revolutionary in fifth grade (last year) and I felt this book reflected it wonderfully. Thank you, Esther Forbes, for you have the talent of a true writer."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain I thought was a very good book. It was very real life and you can understand how disappointed he was when he had to find a new profession because he had a disability.

I saw through the book how blessed our nation is that we do not have to fight on our own nation's soil, as they did in, &quot;Johnny Tremain.&quot; The characters had distinct personalities and mannerisms, allowing me to picture them in my mind. &quot;Johnny Tremain,&quot; is a book I would recommend to my friends as a informative elaboration on the daily life af an American during the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This was a good book.....not as good as my brother sam is dead.Everything was good except the ending.

Later on Rad is killed in action fighting for the Continental Army. Johnny then has to take up Rad's gun and fight for the cause. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is an histoical fiction book.I think this book is best for someone who is interested in the American Revolutoion and likes books that are adventurous and exiting.I didn't Really like this book. It didn't grab my attention that well."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Well I'm not complaining but Johnny Tremain is not the best book ever (Well for me at least. I like to read about mythology and about wonderful make-believe lands. Also classics like Wuthering Heights.) I think that the author had a great point of view and made the book that much more interesting but it still didn't please me. On the other hand I don't like learning about U.S. History even though that's our heritage. I go for the more adventerous like Greece and Rome. So anyways Johnny Tremain is basically a story about a boy who has a crippled hand after a bad accident where his thumb attaches to his hand. He has to quit his job and find a new one and along the way he meets Rab who is very rebelious to the British. Since the family he worked for kicked him out he decides to work with Rab and he soon finds more of his history. Especially the fact that he is related to a very rich guy in town but he can't seem to get along with him. In the end Rab dies but what's important is that Johnny found the courage to go to war for him and have his hand fixed. And again it was Ok but not the best. I might have enjoyed it more if our teacher didn't force us to read a certain number of chapters a week (I like to read at my own pace. Sometimes I can finish a book in a day other times in a month.) I overal thought it was good and would read it again(but at my own pace.)"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I literally read this book in two hours. I could not put it down.

After only the 5th chapter both me and my students were bored to tears. Although we finished the text, I would NOT recommend it to any teacher for classroom reading. It is boring and far to indepth reading for children in my age group. Their AR scores on the test were so bad we had to delete them. Even my straight A students failed it. I will make better choices throughout the year!In the books defense however, I would say it is full of history and facts that are worth outside classroom reading for those who are history buffs."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Now, I understand that this was indeed a good piece of literature.

This isn't worth the buy unless you're interested in hearing some old lady write a story about the Revolution. This book is mediocre at best. If I were to write a book, I would put the readers interests first."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is about an adolescent boy who becomes apprenticed to an expert silversmith after his mother dies. He becomes very skilled at his work and is expected to do very well once he opens his own silver shop. Tragically one day while he was building a sugar basin for John Hancock he burned his hand because another one of the boys that works for the same master became angry because Johnny kept bossing him around. He was helping Johnny but when Johnny asked for a crucible he intentionally gave him a cracked one so that the silver would spill and Johnny would become embarrassed but the joke went bad and Johnny slipped on something and his hand landed in the hot silver that had spilled out of the cracked crucible and got burned severely. He was no longer a help to the Laphams silver shop so he decided to leave because he was not earning his food and while the others had to work for it. He looked around for another job for several days, sleeping in the cometary and getting any spare food he could find. Eventually he met Rab Silsbee, he worked for the Boston Observer which was a patriot newspaper company, Rab let Johnny stay with him in the attic of the \\"Observer\\" if he would do jobs and help around the house. After Johnny and Rab became pretty good friends and Rab trusted Johnny, Rab let Johnny help set up one of the secret meetings that took place in the attic where they slept of the sons of liberty, the sons of liberty consisted of people like John Hancock, Paul Revere, Sam Adams etc. Johnny soon became a familiar face at the meetings and was trusted by the important group of patriots. Johnny helped during the Boston tea party, delivered messages and news and did lots of jobs like that for the sons of liberty. After many meetings fighting finally broke out at Lexington and Concord, Rab was there and helping fight the British, unfortunately he was badly wounded before he even fired a shot. Johnny did not know any of this and did many different things to find out if Rab was okay after a lot of trouble Johnny finally found Rab wounded, soon after he found him Rab Died."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The book Johnny Tremain took place in the time of the revolutionary War in Boston, and a bit before that. It was about hard times, and an apprentice silver smith caught in the middle of it all. Johnny, the main character, crippled his hand and cannot do what he longs to be... a silver smith. Johnny leaves his master and tries to find work in the hard times. While looking, he becomes friends with a boy named Rab, a patriot. Johnny moves in with Rab and his Uncle, and Johnnie's new life begins there-a boy with a crippled hand in the time of the Revolutionary war. This book was interesting, but it dragged on! I couldn't stand it while reading, because of the fact that most of the chapters made no sense and they went on and on about how they were so mad, but it took too long for them to do something, which made the book drag on! The emotions in the book were good, but not great. If you were reading about a book in the times of the Revolutionary War, you would expect anger, sadness, excitement, but I felt none of that while reading this book! In conclusion I would not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I think that Johnny Tremain is an awful book; it has almost no excitement or suspense. I thought most of the characters were very dull and nondescript, especially the protagonist, Johnny. The plot tells the story of Johnny, who lives in Boston, Massachusetts at the time of the American Revolution. He is a silversmith's apprentice, but when he burns his hand, his dreams of being a master silversmith disappear.Ultimately, he finds work at an important Boston newspaper, and he meets many famous Patriots who are planning to overthrow King George III. Johnny is thrust into the middle of the Revolutionary War. At the end, a tragedy strikes Johnny's life. (I'm not going to say what it is, for those who are unfortunately reading the book.) But it doesn't all end sadly. Doctor Warren, the town doctor, says he can fix Johnny's hand. If you want to know exactly what happens, read the book. (Even though I would advise not to read it at all.)Overall, there was one part, ONE PART, in the entire book that I liked . . . where Johnny's hand gets burnt. To me, it was the only exciting part in the book. Maybe the reason I didn't like the story is because it doesn't make the history seem alive to me. Also, there were four girls in the book, and none of them played a substantial role in the novel. Only Cilla, Johnny's fiance&eacute;, plays a little part. I do not recommend this for anybody who likes American history."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"At the beginning of 7th grade everybody had to read Johnny Tremain.

Half the people in my grade didn't read it because they were hated it and didn't care if they failed the tests, the other half of my grade hated it but read it because they wanted to get good grades on their tests.

Not only is that depressing, but the main character shows absolutely no feeling or connection with what is going on; which is the major downfall of the book.

The book was first published in 1943 (think that was during World WarII!) so it may seem a bit dated to the youngest readers but the well realized setting of Revolutionary War era Boston and Johnny's many adventures stand up to time. Forbes writing style is not difficult to follow once the reader or listener is engaged with the story though the vocabulary she uses is quite advanced for a book purported to be at the fifth grade reading level. And the book can be rather detailed especially in regards to some of the finer points of 18th century silversmithing. Yet I despair of the readers who give this a one star review saying it has no plot! The book is extremely rich in plot, characterization, historical detail, adventure etc. Consider it as a read aloud if you are a teacher or parent whose kids just can not \\"get into it\\". They will be pleasantly surprised once they meet Johnny and the other residents of colonial Boston."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes' award-winning novel of a youth caught up in the turmoil of the American Revolution is a timeless classic that today's parents can enjoy again with their kids. Educational as well as entertaining with its portrayal of colonial \\"job training\\" (apprenticeship), the tragedy of Johnny's injury in an era of primitive medicine, the rise of the Minutemen and patriotic fervor, and the valuable relationships between friends. Highly recommend for any age group"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"In this book, we follow the life of a young man in the middle of turbulent revolution era Boston. As a young apprentice to a silversmith, Johnny thinks he knows exactly what his future holds, but a terrible accident causes him to lose use of his hand. He is then forced to find a new path in life for himself, and finds work with a printing shop. He becomes friends with a boy named Rab, and he becomes involved in the activities leading up to the Revolutionary War. He works with such important people as Paul Revere and Sam Adams, and is involved in the Boston Tea Party. Aside from being a great book about the Revolutionary War, this is also a book about a boy growing into a young man and finding himself along the way.Johnny Tremain is an excellent book for teaching children about the American Revolution. The author uses details that really show the reader what Boston was like during that period in time. Children can relate with Johnny and can understand what it may have been like for a boy his age to make the decision to join in the battle for independence. The author does a wonderful job of taking an adult situation, such as war, and making it so that most children can understand it from their perspective. This book is very deserving of the the 1944 Newbery Award."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes has written a colorful novel, Johnny Tremain, with fictional and genuine characters with interesting personalities, and a historical plot with slightly amusing twists to it. The book draws you to its beautifully crafted and placed words; alongside the way it makes you feel involved.In Johnny Tremain, a young teenage boy named Johnny Tremain serves as an apprentice to an old silversmith with 2 other useless boys. He becomes arrogant, and bosses the other apprentices around, igniting hatred towards him. He then accidentally burns his hand with hot silver while making a sugar basin and his thumb becomes connected to his palm with silver. He searches for new work, as he cannot work as a silversmith with his crippled hand. He then works for the Silsbees as a newspaper delivery boy, and finds himself at home with them. He also finds himself getting involved with the Revolutionary War and its leaders, and tries to help despite his hand.I think Johnny Tremain is a must read book for both young and old. It will grab your attention as it did mine, and keep it until you finish the book. And even then, you will read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain by Esther Forbes is a great American story. The deep plot of this story shows the adventures and troubles of a young orphan silversmith living in newly founded Boston during the beginning of the revolutionary war. Esther Forbes' character Johnny Tremain is one that shows how to deal with problems, and work through many exciting events. He is an arrogant worker, who knows just how good he was, now with his work impairing injury; he has to change the way he acts. Forbes' diction leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat drooling for more. She works to keep your attention, but at the same time gives a very important life lesson about growing up and overcoming troubles. A boy is faced with more problems in the span of a year, than most of us will ever face in our life. This unbelievable book gives you a glance at what the Revolutionary War was like, and some of the scenes draw you into the story, as if your there. The cannons and guns going off, the people around, this exiting tale was well written and will always keep your attention."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a wonderful book to read. It is not a completely true story, but the setting, the lifestyles, and some of the characters were true. The story took place both before and during the beginning of the Revolutionary War.Johnny Tremain is a boy in Boston who is tossed around between lifestyles, as well as friends. He begins as an apprentice for a silversmith, and he meets the girl he is to marry there. Then a burn cripples his hand to the point where he cannot work with silver anymore. So he goes to another lifestyle, and meets another friend there. When that friend turns 18, the war has just begun, so he fights in the fighting that broke out in Lexington. Johnny is left in Boston with the few people who had not fled. He runs errands for Patriots, and he finds himself doing so often, forming his 3rd lifestyle.This book is an exciting, thrilling story, and yet it keeps within historical truth. It keeps to the real ways of life back then, yet it is a fun story to read. The book is a bit slow moving, but it is still a \\"page turner\\". The book is written by a woman of the late 1800's and about half the 1900's. She had written many books, but until her two famous books were released, her books were not well known. The book that got her well known, which was the one just before Johnny Tremain, was a true biography of Paul Revere who was also a very important character in Johnny Tremain). Soon after, she wrote her Newberry Award winning novel Johnny Tremain.Johnny Tremain became popular, for it was one of few books which were successfully written as an exciting story, that stayed within historical fact. It is very difficult to make up an exciting story about something that could quite possibly have happened, keep historical facts correct, and still manage to keep the story as exciting and thrilling as Johnny Tremain. Therefore, Johnny Tremain is a wonderful historical fiction novel."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is one of my favorite historical fiction books. If you like books with very real characters and emotions, (most of the book is Johnny's emotional journey from a childish and arrogant apprentice to a humbled, but mature young man) then you will like this book. The setting feels very real, too... As if you were actually living the events at the beginning of the Revolutionary War. For those (like me) who are looking for really clean books, this is one. There is no questionable content at all, and there are a lot of good common sense lessons to learn, without it being at all like those &#34;goody-two-shoes&#34; books with characters that you can't relate to at all. Johnny is a very ordinary, headstrong, impulsive, likeable kind of guy, who has a way of capturing your sympathy."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I was forced to read this for school, and, for once, I'm glad that my teachers MADE me read something.Johnny Tremain can feel, at times, a bit like wading through a swamp filled with endless, boring details.

It brough tears to my eyes, literally.Reading Johnny does not seem like an ideal way to pass the time for most teenagers, but if you read it (cover to cover!), I know that you will find magic inside its pages! I think it's about time for my generation to discover Johnny!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain by Esther Forbes is a great historical novel about a young orphan boy growing up in pre-Revolutionary Boston. The story opens when Johnny Tremain is a young fourteen-year old boy and his mother has just died. However, before his mother has died, he was given a silver cup. This cup signified that he was a member of the Lyte family, which meant that he was related to the rich and famous merchant Lyte. After his mother's death, he signed up with a silversmith as an apprentice. Johnny as a young apprentice, showed much promise of becoming an accomplished silversmith. Another apprentice, jealous of Johnny's skill, caused him to be terribly burned by molten silver, and as a result, Johnny's right hand became useless. When Johnny was working, he asked another apprentice to get him a silver melting pot. Being jealous, he gave him a broken one, which then spilled molten silver onto Johnny. In time, Johnny becomes a paper delivery boy, becomes a messenger and spy for the Sons of Liberty, and spends some of his time with some of the most famous leaders of the Revolutionary War. Besides covering pre-war historical events and Boston's political climate, this book gives its readers glimpses into 18th century medicine, Boston's legal system, religion, newspaper publishing, literacy, treatment of children working as apprentices and servants, and the broad differences between the upper and lower classes."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Every once in a while, an author publishes a really good book that actually has something to learn from it. Inevitably, teachers seize the oppurtunity and force kids to read it.I just came out of the 8th grade exhausted. My English class had spent over 6 months on Johnny Tremain! My teacher practically ripped the book apart, so that every single one of her students could recite the 47 themes in Chapter 5 (such as a routine to to the well actually being a lifelong journey of hope). This teacher had been using Johnny Tremain so long, she could actually RECITE THE FIRST CHAPTER! And the chapters are not very small at all.Anyway, after school was over, I picked up my copy again. I was hooked. It was actually fun reading the book when I didn't have to note the conflicts between Johnny and Rab in Chapter 9. The story is very well written, and it teaches important lessons about life today as well as in the 18th century. My only gripe is that it seems that Esther Forbes tried to write a book that was pretty much a compilation of every other coming of age story. People don't have &quot;growing up realizations&quot;, girl troubles, freindship disputes, family trouble, a burnt hand, and a national revolution all in the same week!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The book Johnny Tremain takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, in the year 1773.In the beginning, Johnny Tremain was an apprentice for a silversmith, until he burnt his hand and could no longer work as a silversmith.He later ran into Rab, a Son Of Liberty.

It's been rolling around my house for months with my children rejecting it, so I decided to pick it up and give it a try. I was quickly engrossed in the astute and engaging characterization of the promising young silversmith apprentice who has a bit of trouble controlling his tongue, and his relationships with persons both fictional and historical in his circle in Revolutionary War-era Boston. It became apparent that Esther Forbes' details were historically accurate down to the letter. As I continued to read, I became more and more impressed with her accomplishments in this book on many levels--as an account of history, as a great story well-told, and even of her keen insight into human motivation and interaction. It is a book whose main character is a child, but it is quite dense, and I would say more difficult to get through than say a Harry Potter book--I think it would be a shame for a young person to get turned off to it by reading it too young or before they were ready for it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"OK, it's a Newbery Award winner.

When he maims his hand, he is forced to find another profession and home. Slowly, he gets involved with the local patriots who want to free America from Britain. The author does know her history and she brings life to the story. The author, Esther Forbes Hamilton, certainly knows details and writes about life in colonial times.The book has a slow start for me which is one of the reasons that I deducted a star. But the Disney film certainly didn't do the story justice. It was one dimensional film about Johnny Tremain. In this historical fictional account, Johnny Tremain's life and history come alive even slowly. The novel is about 300 pages long and it can help students or young readers identify with Johnny's struggle and his heroics. Johnny becomes a likable character after all.The author deserved the Newbery Medal for the book itself. The author has done a superb job in creating Johnny Tremain's life in colonial times in Boston, Massachusetts. She has captured the life, history, and the world of the time period. This knowledge takes years of research before internet. The author has done a remarkable job in making history exciting and worth reading especially for the younger readers who might resist at first.I highly recommend this historical novel in covering the American literature and the events of the Boston Tea Party, the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and the world of colonial Boston seen through the eyes of teenage Johnny Tremain."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book as part of an 8th grade English/Literature/Reading class assignment. I credit the teacher and this book for giving me my life long passion for reading. It was the first book that I \\"Could not put down\\". It is one book that will change the non-reader's life."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I was familiar with the story, a tale from the American Revolution.A boy, a silversmith apprentice, burns his hand in an accident that occurs while working on a Sunday (illegally) in haste. The boy, Johnny Tremain, is left unable to work as a silversmith apprentice. He is filled with despair. He is befriended by a kind boy, Rab, and together they are able to earn money by caring for horses. The job allows the boys to come into contact with British soldiers and to obtain secret information the boys can then pass on to the revolutionaries.I wasn't as satisfied with the story as I'd thought I'd be. The characters, especially those who were actual people from history, felt flat, one-dimensional. Johnny seemed too prideful, too selfish, too judgmental for a reader to love, to serve as a main character. The words and actions of the characters seemed false, overly heroic, like the words and actions our mighty American forefathers should have used and should have done.Overall, a very strong story of courage."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Even Paul Revere knew that the apprentice Johnny Tremain would grow up to be an excellent silversmith someday. But that was before a terrible accident took that future away from him forever. Too proud to ask for help, Johnny wanders the streets of Boston until he stumbles into the printing offices of the Boston Observer. He soon becomes deeply involved with the Sons of Liberty in the fight for American Independence.Forbes' vivid depiction of the American Revolution creates a perfect backdrop for the story of a proud little boy who becomes a man. Johnny Tremain won a Newbery Medal in 1944."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I love this book for my class. We read it together because of the vocabulary. I wish they would make a written edition for the kindle."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes' novel \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is about a young boy called Johnny Tremain who lives in Boston near to and during the time of the American Revolution. He is apprenticed to a silversmith but as a result of an injury to his hand from a silversmithing accident, he is unable to continue his career as a silversmith and has to look for alternate employment.The main character Johnny Tremain has a disability. His thumb is stuck to his hand and due to this there are many jobs he can't do. He initially has feelings of hopelessness but he overcomes those feelings to eventually get his life back together. While he is looking for alternate employment, he has strong feelings of affection for a girl named Cilla who lives in the same house as him. He can't handle the idea of Cilla marrying another man than himself. The book gives a lesson to young men not to let the fact that they can't have the girl of their dreams get them down.The book eventually enters the time period of the American Revolution and Johnny Tremain meets some famous personages of that time. Boston seems like a charming place to live in based on what I read in the book. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is a delightful read. Esther Forbes writes competently about the time of the American Revolution which is amazing since she didn't live during it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This was required reading for me in the fifth grade. As I first began reading it, I didn't like it at all. But as I grew into it, I couldn't stop reading it. It may not have been best for me to read it at such a young age, but I benefitted from it as fully as I could have. It was a very informative tale about the Revolutionary War. Young mith apprentice, Johnny Tremain, finds the war sparking around him. He has his duty to carry out as an apprentice, however. But when his hand is severely burnt, he is rendured useless. He finds himself caught up in the meshes of the war and the famous patriot Paul Revere.I would reccomend this book to anyone over the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book was good because it has an interesting plot. There is a lot of action and adventure in the story and you should definitely read it if you are interested in the Revolutionary War and the events leading up to it. There was one problem though. I felt it wasn't as well written as it could be. Esther Forbes book had a lot of short, choppy sentences which created a low amount of fluency and a lot of bitter staccato notes."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"In the beginning of Johnny Tremain's life, he burns his right hand silversmithing, so in most of the book he can't really use it anymore except to ride a horse. His friend, Rab, lets him use his horse, Goblin. Goblin is a very rough horse and Johnny learns how to ride him very quickly which is amazing because most excellent horse riders can't even ride him. So even thought he can't be a silversmith anymore, he still is very talented.In the book, you'll read about many famous people you have probably heard about, like Paul Revere, and other famous things that happened like The Boston Tea Party. You'll see who was a part of the Boston Tea Party and the group of boys that dressed up like Indians and used fake tomahawks to break open the boxes of tea.The book is very exciting because you get to see what the revolutionary war was like, even if you were just a young boy. I think you'll like this book very much.(...)"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I assumed it would be boring. Well, I shouldn't assume because this book was excellent! It is the sad, funny, and exciting story of a fourteen year old silversmith in Boston during the Revolutioary War.The characters are so vivid, you feel like you've known them all your life. This book also teaches a lesson about pride, but I won't spoil what happens! Yes, this book is older, but don't judge it by its age. If you're looking for a good book, this is definintely one to read!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremainby Melanie HelmerJohnny Tremain wasn't your everyday silversmith's apprentice. He believed in the Yankees and found himself unable to attain his position because of an accident. Rab is more of the take action for freedom type of character. He meets Johnny because of the newspaper both boooys woek for. They are so different in personality, that you'd never believe either of them could stand each other. The struggle for freedom, most likely, overcomes their differences. Johnny and Rab take on life-threatening mission because they share a belief for freedom.Johnny Tremain basically describes teh fight that the Yankees fought in order t live in peace and to live freely. That story intertwines with these young boys' lives. It tells about the struggles that families had to take on, and the hardships they lived through. Many other boys like Johhny and Rab's age also fought for what they believed in. This wasn't an easy time in the United State's history. People were forced to decide what \\"side\\" they would fight for. Men adn women became blinded to what they really stood for. Despite these select people, others did struggle in the battle for freedom from England. This story describes this event in time and discusses the life of Jonathan Lyte Tremain.Personally, I believe that Esther Forbes did an amazing job developing the character of Johnny Tremain. Rab was a more under-developed character. He didnt' have as much thoughts of ideas as Johnny did. This is a spot where Esther should have put a little more work into. Rab could have been more discussed all over. This is just about the only character development flaw that Esther Forbes created while writing Johnny Tremain. She did an astoundig job in every other aspect of writing this book. So all in all, I would recommend this book to everyone (especially the history lovers).-Melanie Helmer"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is an action packed book mixed with love, sorrow and happiness. The book really gets into the split town of Boston and the suronding country side. The story is based upon a young boy being trained as a silver smith. But when a terrible accident with silver occurs, his life is thrown into a turmoil that gets him close to death. He turns to the Patriots and is caught up in the Revolution and the fight for freedom. There is no way you will be able to put this book down!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I thought this book was a pretty good! Johnny learned a great deal when his hand got hurt. I think that if his hand would have been mutilated that he wouldn't have had all of his new friends, like Rab and Pumpkin. Though some charators died, I would recommend this book yo other readers."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I first read and loved this book when I was eleven years old.(Never mind how long ago that was.) Since then it has remained one of the favorite books of my childhood. Johnny, Rab, Cilla and Dov become very real people due to the author's skill and the story lingers for decades. Even now, when someone mentions the &quot;forgotten&quot; revolutionary, John Otis, or the cantakerous Sam Adams, it is my memories of them in this book that come to mind. Esther Forbes gave a blessing to the whole world when she wrote this book. Read it. Treasure it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain was a fabolous book. I mean considering he burnt his hand he was still able to do work like cooking and carving.It was a shock when I found out what job he indended up with i won't tell you it will give it away. Who would have guessed that? Not me!When the British declared war I couldn't stop reading it i got sucked into it. Of course the words were almost to small to read I managed.The part that I didn't like was that when it got interesting it gave away all of the answers.But overall it was a good book And I think you should read it. Another author you might like is Mark Twain, because whenever I read a book of his I got sucked into it like idid with Johnny Tremain.I truly don't like war books, but I liked Johnny Tremain. That's why I think you should read it.Max Carroll"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"In chapters one through three Johnny has changed dramaticlly. He was the most valuable apprentice in this shop.

This book was one of the best. The idea of historical fiction was new to me then, but I appreciated it quickly. This book brought to life historical characters and made them real. The only caveat would be to ensure that the reader is old enough for the subject (somewhere around 11 or 12)."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain was one of the best books I've ever read, but it's only a good book for people mature enough to read it.

The book puts the reader in very interesting historical events and at the same time gives you some fiction of it's own."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is an amazing book. The begining just reaches out and grabs you, so you continue reading. This main plot is so interesting, you cant put it down, and the end, my only complaint, is that it ends very quickly.

Anyone who doesnt, well, I cant think of anything written better, or more interesting than Johnny Tremain. Thank You :)"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Amazingly, i find people above saying this book is dull. I disagree. Johnny Tremain tells the interesting story of Boston in the 1700s. I read this book for my seventh grade book report, and have never in my life, before that project, or now, after it, found a better book. Johnny Tremain deserves a sequel, because though it starts out wonderfully, and throughout is amazing, the end it quick, and cliffhung. Esther Forbes should continue with this topic. She write very well."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I had to read this book for English for a book report and I didn't know what I was getting into. Johnny Tremain is one of the best books I have ever read. Johnny Tremain shows why it is important not to go against church or authority because God always has a way of coming back at you. My favorite part is when Johnny can use his hand again and riding the horse. I do believe, though, that there should have been a sequel because it ends very aburptly."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago, and it still sticks out in my mind as one of my very favorites.

I think the 8th grade level is just about right."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"My opinion is simple: This book is boring. If it weren't for a school assignment, I wouldn't have read it. It never really got anywhere."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I must admit, this book is EXTREAMLY well written, Esther Forbes portrayed the characters and events really well. But sometimes it doesn't always matter how well-written a book is (I hope you know what I mean by \\"well-written\\"), because there's also a story line that is to be needed. and I must say, this one drags.For some reason I did enjoy the chapter: THE FIDDILERS BILL. That, and the ending chapter A MAN CAN STAND UP, seemed to have captured me. But the rest wasn't so \\"exciting\\", but instead boring to where the paragraphs couldnt be any longer. It was givin to me as a reading test in History class, where we had to read it, and answere questions on what happened in each chapter.Other students agreed that it was extensivly boring so I'm not the only one who belives so. Even when I tried to get interested in it, I just couldn't, so I tried to like it, but the story line doesn't seem to go anywhere; it takes too much time to get exciting. And I personally like diolag, but this book is full of too much explaining about his feelings, and whats going on, instead of talking, which really irritated me (I guess thats why I 'liked' THE FIDDILERS BILL).So basically, I would most definatly recommend this book to Revolutionary War and way way back then History lovers (they will get hooked on it). But as for people who like action, and fun . . . well - No! Maybe the fact that I got forced and stressed to read it (and under a certain amount of time), I didn't like it too much. But again, the 1600's and 1700's don't interest me. And also: its my oppinion.

Johnny is a teenage apprentice, and then he is in war dealing with some of the top revolutionary leaders. Set in revolutionary time, the characters are living in a perfect world and doing ordinary things in the beginning of the book. Then, there is a large leap in the middle of the book and the character's are in war. The book would be much better if the author concentrated on making fictional parts seem more realistic. In that time, people were not as happy-go-lucky.

The novel failed to keep me interested. I was simply not compelled to read on. The several minor conflicts throughout the story were not exciting enough to keep the reader on the edge.

Esther Forbes portrays the characters vividly, maybe even overstating them at times, and logically describes the setting. In her novel, she explains factual events, (e.g. the Boston Tea Party, the Boston Observers' Meetings, and the Battle of Lexington at Concord) that led to the Revolutionary War. The reader follows Johnny's life from his adolescence to adulthood. When Johnny was younger, his mother gave him a family heirloom, a goblet, before she passed away. Johnny's mother belongs to a well-known family and he believes that he belongs to the \\"Merchant Lyte\\" lineage. The reader follows Johnny's journey to become part of this new family and goes through the obstacles he faces, as well.Each chapter is fairly long, but the book is worth the read in the end. I was disappointed at how dull the book is, especially since I find history textbooks more attention-grabbing than Johnny Tremain. Although there are a few scenes that Forbes leaves her readers in suspense, the rest is uninteresting to me. If this book were lying on a bookshelf at my school library, I would not pick it to read at my own leisure. I rate Johnny Tremain 3 out of 5 stars and recommend this book to avid history readers. It is highly possible that my lack of interest in history prompted me to rate the book at an average score."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book was written well, but the plot was just boring.

The book also gives you a better idea on what life was like during colonial times. This book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book's title is Johnny Tremain, written by Esther Forbes, which got a 3 star rating from me.Johnny Tremain is about a poor boy named Johnny Tremain who works for a silversmith. He injures his hand making a special sugar basin. Then while looking for work he meets a boy named Rab. After having no luck finding work, he remembers that his mother had said that he was related to the merchant Mr. Lyte. When he tries to reveal his relation, Mr. Lyte accuses him of stealing the cup from his home and takes him to court. Luckily Johnny had shown his cup to Cilla Lapham before the date of the robbery. So he was found innocent of the crime. But later in his time of need he tries to sell the cup back to Merchant Lyte, but Mr. Lyte steals the cup from him.After this horrible event, Johnny gets a job with his new friend Rab as a horse boy. Getting this job gave him a place to live, people to clothe and feed him. While working for Rab's Uncle Lorne, he starts to get involved with The Sons of Liberty. Although Johnny was too young to be a son himself, he was still allowed to help. Johnny's main job was to blow a whistle to alert the Sons whether to go and dump the tea off the ships or too go home. Then Sam Adams had signaled to go in for the attack on the ships. I don't really want to give away the entire story though, you'll have to see for yourself what happens if you're interested. I gave this book a 3 star score because for me it wasn't all that great to read all the time. But besides that it is a good book to read in your spare time.Some other titles I'd like to recommend would be Number the Stars, The Tale of Desperaux, and Maniac Magee. My name is Marquis and I'm 11 years old. I hope that you'll really enjoy the book Johnny Tremain. I enjoyed it myself and I might look for other books by Esther Forbes, maybe you could too."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Even before his mother died Johnny knew what he wanted to be, a silversmith. The last thing she did for him before she died was to apprentice him to a silver maker. His mother had given him a silver cup the, this cup was the reason he wanted to be a silver maker, he wanted terribly to make things like it. Johnny Tremain is a book full ofThe characters Johnny encounters are all unique and original. Johnny and his dying mother came to Boston so Johnny could fulfill his dream of becoming a silversmith, the master silversmith, Mr. Lapham would teach him everything he needed to know about silver making, along with being a master silversmith Mr. Lapham was also a deacon, and a very pious one at that, he lived with his daughter-in-law and her four daughters, one of them Cilla, a girl of Johnny's age, who is kind and brave. Johnny was a hard working boy before his terrible accident, spilling molten silver on his hand, crippling it.The story is a real page turner. One of the most exciting parts occurred right after Johnny's accident was left with a terrible dilemma, the Laphams are not a rich family and could not afford to have Johnny stay without doing silver work, Mr. Lapham, being the pious man that he is could not bear to put Johnny out on the street, though it was well understood that Johnny was to begin looking for work right away. Johnny is embarrassed by his crippled hand and tries not to show it to anyone, but when the youngest Lapham daughter yelled at Johnny and told him how ugly it was. This was to much for Johnny, who left the house for good. Another suspenseful part happened when Johnny was out on the street, alone. Johnny Tremain's life is full of anticipation goes to Mr. Lyte, who his mother told Johnny he was related to, Mr. Lyte tricks Johnny into his home, he sues Johnny for stealing \\"his\\" silver cup, actually the one that Johnny's mother gave him. Johnny comes out the winner because of a lack of evidence on the part of Mr. Lyte.Historical events filled the pages of Johnny Tremain, although most main characters were fictional Johnny did encounter many real revolutionaries, such as Sam Adams and Paul Revere, Johnny also took part in many historical events, the Boston Tea Party, the Sons of Liberty, and the early battles of the Revolutionary War. When Paul Revere asked for Johnny's help to spread the word that the British were coming, Johnny does so willingly. Another historical part of the book took place because Johnny finally finds work at an anti British newspaper, his friend and coworker Rab later goes off to fight at Lexington, word is slow to travel and Johnny does not know if her friend made it through the battle. Johnny latter meets Rab, he is seriously injured and passes quickly after he sees Johnny. At the very end of the Johnny's story he is preparing for surgery on his crippled hand so that he can fight for freedom.Johnny Tremain was a great book, because it took place in the late seventeen hundreds it was full of historical information, it was also suspenseful and was full of great characters. I would recommend Johnny Tremain to anyone who is looking for a great book, probably on a middle school reading level.C.

This is a great book for all ages."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"In 1943, with America deeply embedded in the worst of World War II, author Esther Forbes wrote a tale that touched on the founding of America itself. Since its publication, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" has remained one of the best known children's books ever written. It won the 1944 Newbery Award and is still read by schoolchildren everywhere. Heck, even Bart Simpson was lured into reading it in a \\"Simpsons\\" episode (Marge tells him that it's about a boy with a deformed hand and he' intrigued). Newbery award winners come and go. Sometimes they're remembered (ala \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\") and sometimes they're rightfully forgotten (ala \\"Daniel Boone\\"). \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is different because even reading it today the book remains readable, thoughtful, and interesting. It deserves its praise.Johnny Tremain is an apprenticed silversmith of one Mr. Lapham. Unusually skilled in the trade, Johnny's the star of the household. The other apprentices envy and hate him and the members of the Lapham family love him. Just the same, Johnny is unaccountably vain. Boastful and overflowing with pride, he lords his superior abilities over everyone he meets, even catching the eye of the greatest silversmith in Boston, Paul Revere. Yet when a broken crucible maims Johnny's hand with silver, the life he had planned for himself can never be. Desperate for work, he finally finds a place with the Boston Observer, a Whig news publication. Soon Johnny finds himself rubbing shoulders with the men of the Revolution. His life becomes enmeshed in the spy networks and fighting words that lead up to the American Revolution. In doing so, he becomes a major player in the creation of a new America.I read this book in elementary school and, sadly, remembered very little of it. What I did remember was Johnny's hand. Honestly, I think this book would sell like hotcakes if it was retitled, \\"Johnny Tremain: The Boy With the Deformed Hand\\". Not that I'm seriously recommending the change. What really struck me, when reading this book again today, was just how well written the little bugger is. First of all, it begins with an unsympathetic protagonist. Up till now, most Newbery protagonists fell somewhere between saints and perfection incarnate. But Johnny is just the kind of little snot who needs to be taken down a peg to become a better person. This isn't one of those books where the hero gets hurt and suddenly makes a miraculous transformation from bad to good either. As you read the story you see Johnny's progress. He grows and learns from his injury, yes, but he also grows and learns from meeting and speaking with other people. Which brings me to the second remarkable aspect of this book. The English, awful as they are sometimes, are not evil cackling villains. Johnny meets and even, to some extent, befriends British officers. He finds himself pitying the English wounded and sympathizing with their pain. Likewise, not all the American Revolutionaries are perfect gods. John Hancock comes off as a bit of a rich fop, and Sam Adams is seen gleefully rubbing his hands together over the prospect of upcoming destruction. So many stories create villains so ridiculously evil that they haven't a single solitary redeeming characteristic and heroes pious to the point of sainthood. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" could easily have fallen into that trap, but it doesn't. Instead, it gives a remarkably thoughtful approach to the nature of enemies, war, and freedom.The book is long, granted. Also, there are numerous spying/battle sections in which I had to continually backtrack through the text to figure out, \\"Now why is Johnny doing that?\\". The best way to lure kids today with this book might be to sell it as a Revolutionary spy book. I mean, Johnny really does become a kind of secret agent for the Yankees. He knows how to get information out of people and how to find out important English secrets. Best of all, the story has a naturalistic writing style that's easy to get through once you get going. If you want to give your kids a Newbery award winner that's as memorable and fascinating today as it was the day it was written, I cannot recommend, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" enough. Ignore the picture of the saintly boy on the cover. This is a book of adventure, pride, and war."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"JOHNNY TREMAIN is a magic book for me. It takes me back to 1966 when I was in fifth grade at Stadium School. We had a student teacher named Miss Greenberg who announced to us that she was going to begin reading aloud to us every day after lunch. We were ten and eleven year olds and highly insulted that the teacher wanted to read to us like babies! Then Miss Greenberg started reading JOHNNY TREMAIN. Within a week none of the kids in class could wait to get back from lunch, even the boys who professed that they \\"hated books.\\" There were two copies of JOHNNY TREMAIN in the school library and after that first week they were reserved for weeks in advance. I begged my mother for a copy for Christmas; she had to go crazy to order one because they were out of print back then. She finally found a teacher's edition that had study questions at the end of the book. I loved the portrait of Boston in the 1770s and although Johnny was a little too arrogant for my taste in the beginning, I grew to like him as he changed in the course of the book. My favorite character has always been Cilla Lapham, but I love Johnny's horse Goblin as well, and Rab and the Lornes and Miss Bessie, the Lytes' cook. They are all welcome friends."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is a wonderful children's book that most adults would also probably enjoy. \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is a classic that tells the story of a young boy caught up in the turmoil of 1773 Boston and the start of the American Revolution.This is the type of book that can get kids interested in history. The book really is brilliantly written for the age group it is intended for."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I must have read this book ten? twenty? times as a teenager, and so when I found it recently in the basement I started reading again to see if it was really as good as I remembered it. Better! \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read, even as an adult. So imagine my surprise when I noticed that Amazon readers rated this only four stars?For starters, this is not a children's book. I see fourth, fifth graders reviewing this book, as part of an assignment - and as a mother myself, this bothers me. This is a great book - but, I think, way over a fifth-graders head. Maybe *your* fifth-grader is brilliant and will absolutely understand everything completely - but for a classroom setting? What are these teachers thinking?But for a teenager - \\"Johnny Tremain\\" brings to life the times of the Revolutionary War era as no other book, or history lesson, possibly can. Couple that with a brilliantly portrayed cast of characters - complex, vivid characters - and exceptionally vivid, emotional and fast paced writing - and you have the ingredients for a really good book. Maybe I am prejudiced - I love historicals, and always did, but perhaps it is the other way around - perhaps \\"Johnny Tremain\\" influenced me in the way that this book showed me how fascinating history can be.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is the story of a boy - fourteen years old - who is apprenticed to a silversmith, whom he calls his \\"master\\". As an exceptionally capable, talented young man - not to mention an exceptional aptitude with silver - he quickly steps into his master's family to find his niche as the head of the household - if not in name, then in actions (beint that his master is elderly). But how easily are the mighty fallen! For Johnny burns his hand on hot silver and, medicine (or midwifery) being what it was, it never healed properly. A future as a silversmith is out. Overnight, Johnny went from being a capable, bright boy with an exceptional future ahead of him to a nobody.While this is an excellent story about Johnny, it is the times that he lived in that makes this book such riveting reading. Not only do we get to meet all the famous people who populate pre-Revolutionary Boston, we also get an excellent, clear picture of the everyday life of the people of that era. The way they lived, the things they ate, the way they operated - almost everything is touched upon in this extra-ordinary novel.Johnny Tremain somehow gets tangled with the Boston patriots - and is right there in the thick of things just as the Revolutionary War has started. This is the only part of the novel that I found a bit too coincidental - but extremely interesting, nevertheless.\\"Johnny Tremain\\" is one of the best books ever written, but would more easily be appreciated and understood by an older student, in my opinion. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes' story of young Boston boy's adventures during the early days of the American Revolution, &quot;Johnny Tremain,&quot; is a classic of children's historical fiction. As such it has been required reading for generations of middle school students, and assigned reading material, regardless of quality, will always raise the hackles of some students. Thus the bad reviews here should be taken with a grain of salt.The strength of this book is how it weaves the fictional story of Johnny Tremain, who had been a promising silversmith apprentice until an accident crippled his hand, with the historical events and people of Revolutionary era Boston. Johnny deals with the loss of his trade, his attempt to reclaim his birthright, a burgeoning romance with the daughter of his former master, and an increasing involvement with the revolutionary activities of the Sons of Liberty. The book brings to life the era of the Revolution and reminds the reader that the simple hope &quot;that a man can stand up&quot; did not come without tragedy. &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; is a true classic, and makes for a great read.

When we meet the title character, he is an indentured apprentice to a master silversmith. The novel follows Johnny as he becomes involved in the revolutionary movement.Forbes skillfully weaves together the story of a boy's journey to manhood with a slice of the story of a new nation's birth. Johnny is an intriguing character. He's an admirable but flawed hero who encounters serious misfortune but keeps striving on his quest towards responsible manhood. The book is filled with fascinating details about life in Johnny's 18th century world--its economics, food, politics, clothing, social structure, and more. Particularly fascinating is the author's exploration of the craft of the silversmith. Forbes seamlessly blends the historical and cultural details into the overall story.The story involves a number of additional interesting characters. Also noteworthy is Forbes' presentation of the military situation, particularly the implications of a clash between Britain's professional army and a force that is seen as consisting of \\"peasants\\" and \\"yokels.\\" The novel looks at the impact of war upon society without sugarcoating the situation. \\"Johnny\\" is both a gripping tale and a significant volume in the canon of American novels about war."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I've read Johnny Tremain several times, and each time I am fascinated by the characters. The town of Boston and the culture of the times also come to life in this story. Characters involved in the Revolutionary War seem like real people in Esther Forbe's portrayal -- such as John Adams; the English deserter \\"Pumpkin\\"; the typical un-famous soldier signified by \\"Rab\\"; and the tories & revolutionaries who harbor a large number of opinions on the English king and the revolt. The book provides a good smattering of men and women, boys and girls, each with their unique problems in that society. I enjoyed that the plot included more than just a reaction to a quickly-forming war, but also a family mystery, class conflict, coming-of-age romance, friendship, loyalty and even loss -- you know, all the good themes :) This story makes the Revolutionary War memorable. It does heroicize certain characters, but life includes heroes and there is enough black, white and gray in the myriad of personalities to learn about human nature. For someone who loves to read about people and ponder why they do what they do to make them who they are, this is a fun read. It is also for those who like the details that bring you into the sounds and smells and history of a place."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"As a 5th grade teacher of gifted &amp; talented social studies students, I found &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; an excellent tool for teaching the American Revolution.

This story is a regular favorite.Johnny is an orphan boy apprenticed to a silver smith. Another apprentice, tired of Johnny's arrogance and continually bested by Johnny's skill, decides to sabotage Johnny's work. That results in a debilitating injury.

The story is set in late colonial America and includes many fictional characters as well as a few factual persons (engaged in both actual and fantastical action). The great value of the book lies equally in its ability to evoke a time period and a context for history, and in its many moral lessons. It is a wonderful preface to studying the colonial period.My 11-year-old son has a much better grasp of the Declaration of Independence, The U.S. Constitution and the reasons behind the founding of the United States than I had after my government class in 11th grade when I was 17!

I would probably reccomend this book to adults and readers of the right age."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The moment I began to read Johnny Tremain, I was hooked. The way the author describes the setting and characters makes you feel like you're really there. In fact, this book felt like a window to the past that I could climb through and experiance Boston during the American Revolution.Throughout the whole book, you love the main character, Johnny Tremain. Being a very bright, slightly arrogant, young silversmith, he is immediantly swept into the action of the Revolutionary War. He plays a large part in events such as the Boston Tea Party, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and secreat meetings going on between the Sons of LIberty.The only part of the book that I found was dissapointing was the fact that the book is too short! If you like books with a bunch of action, a little romance, some suspence, and plenty of American history then you should check out Johnny Tremain!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"A great book to read aloud to one another as a family or just read by yourself. Tells the story of one boy's life in the time of the revolution of our country. He was filled with a pride that was brought low. His character developed into someone who could go on after a tragedy and be a benefit to those around him. Nothing boring in this book and will keep you turning the pages until the end."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This was also required reading for our 5th grade curriculum. Daughter hated it, so about half way through to reinforce it we watched Disney's version of Johnny Tremain on home video. After that, she couldnt read it fast enough. The book filled in all the blanks the movie made for her, and she had faces and personalities to add to the book, along with visual points of reference.In the end, she really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"A book that deffinatly belongs on YOUR shelf.

It seemed very slow and I found myself daydreaming about getting to play with mud later that day in art class through most of the first half. After I stopped following along with the oral reading in the class and jumped ahead I found out this book was quite good indeed. I still haven't finished it since I do not own a copy, and will probably be very sad when I do. I do hate how she makes some characters have no redeemable traits whatsoever ::cough::Dove::cough:: but besides that I find this a good book. Although I probably wouldn've never picked it up on my own, I'm glad we were forced into reading it ^_^"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":". . .which can be used to introduce the study of the American Revolution from a late-elementary/early-junior high perspective.The story, of a tragically injured teen-aged silversmith's apprentice, and his participation in the events in Boston, leading up to the beginning of the American Revolution is, by turn, heartwarming, tragic, insightful and humorous.In the opinion of this homeschooling parent, this book could well be used to introduce moral questions concerning the Revolution and its aftermath. My 7th grader thoroughly enjoyed it (and I just re-read it after 20+ years as well!)Recommended."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I thought Johnny Tremain was a good book. It was about a kid who wants to be a silversmith but he burns his hand, forcing him to work and write with his other hand. The story took place during the American Revolutionary War and the Boston Tea Party. This book made me think of the past and how hard it was to live back then and how much courage the colonists had. I give this book a four; it was a little slow at times, but at the end it sped up. Read this book; it's a good one."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"There is a regular boy who gets burned from a dirty trick a kid named Dove plays on him. Now he is handicapped. He struggles through life working for people and does fine on his own, I think, through the bad times of his life. I like this story because it was fun to read. I also thought it was educational."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Esther Forbes did a great job explaining what life was like back then during the Revolutionary War and Boston Tea Party in JOHNNY TREMAIN. She described Boston Massachusetts through the eyes of 14 year-old Johnny Tremain. The description was so good that I could even picture it in my head. The cobblestone streets, horses everywhere, open-air markets, and the water pump in the middle of the street, etc. I was all very well described.In the story, Johnny Tremain is a silversmith apprentice to Mr. Lapham. He has great skill and promise. He has a great future ahead of him until one day when a silly trick by a fellow apprentice destroys it all. He takes a new job as a newspaper boy.Johnny joins the \\"Sons of Libert\\" and becomes a fellow whig(rebels) along with other famous men such as John Hancock, John Adams, Samuel Adams, etc. In the story, the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" were the ones that attacked the ships and dumped thousands of dollars worth of valuable tea into Boston Harbor. This is known as the Boston Tea Party.Then cames the Revolutionary War. Johhny's friend Rab joined the minutemen. Rab worked with Johnny as a newpaper boy for the \\"Boston Observer.\\" They shared the same attic and became close friends.I think that this was a great book. I learned about what Boston Massachusetts was like during the Revolutionary War. I enjoyed reading it and I also learned some facts of historical importance."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book altered my perception of, and fed my love for, history as a kid. It is a good read -- filled with action, intrigue; and, indeed, it gives you a sense of the sights, sounds, and smells of 18th century Boston. Basically the story is about Johnny -- a hapless, male \\"Cinderella\\" who burns his hand with molten silver (OUCH!!! The story brings the agony of that event painfully to life), likes the smell, but not the taste of coffee; generously gives limes to a whiny, naggy girl whom he fancies; then gets killed at Bunker Hill. So, life sucks, then you die. A very philosophical work. It ends like a French movie."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Unlike most books, this one started out with pizzaz and was interesting from the very beginning. The end (or mostly the second half of this book) was dull, dumb, lifeless, boring, ambigous, and altogether a terrible read. I forced myself to finish it and found myself asleep with the book on the floor next to me quite often. If the beginning of this book wasn't so good I would give this book a one star rating, which it doesn't even deserve. For those looking for historical fiction wrapped in drama and excitement you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"It has a good plot, but the book overal was boring! It could have a little more spice and more entertaining story to it. The charector evolvement was pretty good, but some of it was sort of lame. I wouldn't read it, but my teacher makes me. If you are the type who likes historical fictions, then this is your book. i just dont care for them that much."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"My main thought when reading this book in the eighth grade was, &quot;Why, O why wasn't he a mercurysmith? Might we not have been spared the remainder of the book?&quot; It was excruciating and I would never put my own students through it, regardless of what wonderful lessons they were supposed to learn. Historical fiction is so often a mixed bag - too many lessons at the expense of literature."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book, in 6th grade, and I must say that I fell asleep ALOT reading it. My teacher (who is, like, 100 years old) loved it. But if you are thinking about reading this book and aren't a historical-freak, don't."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Had to order book for my son's 5th grade book report. Item arrived on time and in excellent condition. Although he was slightly disappointed by the ending, he really enjoyed the book and could not put the book down until he finished."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"If you are searching for a work of historical fiction that recreates Boston in the late colonial period, try Johnny Tremain. It is a classic for a reason. The settings and characters are richly described and totally believable.It's an entertaining story, and your children will REMEMBER it. Several moving speeches about mankind's thirst for liberty.It won a Newbery in 1943, just like all Newberys, it seems to push the envelope. I noticed three things:1) The beginning of the book is very heavy on how God's! Punishment! is! Falling! on! Johnny! in! Payment! for! his! Sin! of! Pride! This drum is beaten over and over.2) The Sons of LIberty (Hancock, Revere, Adams and the gang) are shown as deliberately provoking the British into outrageous acts, in order to bring about their desired end: war.3) Plenty of language that we as a family shy away from repeating. Examples: sluts, hell-for-leather, plenty of swearing-to-God, damned Yankee (many times), damned (many times), hell (as an interjection). Anyway, I read aloud to my kids, and I can edit those out.Update ***** The binding of my book (the soft-cover pictured) disintegrated the second time through the book. Too bad."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The book Johny Tremain was a hard book for me to get into simply because the subject matter does not interest me in any way. That doesn't mean I think it is a horrible book though. This book is well written and filled with a great deal of historical information. The book also has a lesson to it and that is, don't be arrogant because you never know what might happen.This book is like caviar. Even though I find caviar to be quite gross, many people find it amazing and are willing to spend a lot of money for it,because it is their acquired taste. That's how I describe Johny Tremain. Even though I don't like it, many people will because historical books is their taste in topics.I recommend Johny Tremain to anyone who likes to read about the times in Boston and revolutionary war, or just anyone who likes to read about historical events."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I really enjoyed this book because Esther Forbes uses great discription when writing about the characters and the scenery. I also liked how Esther made a mind movie. The book also had suspence and the ending was pleasent. I loved Johnny Tremain."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Trumain is a classic that will probably never die. It teaches great lessons within its captivating storyline and wonderful\\"I can relate to that\\" type characters. A young silversmith burns his hand and can't work anymore. But low and behold he falls in with the brothers of liberty and is present for many of there famous doings including the Boston Tea Party. I can't tell the end but this book is definately worth reading and you'll truely be missing out if you don't read it.So save yourself the trouble andlisten to me and READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is an extremely boring book.It starts out in some unsucessful silversmith shop where Johnny is basically the breadwinner. Johnny tells Cilla about how he is related to a rich and powerful family, the Lytes. Johnny has an accident, and his thumb becomes fused to his palm on his right hand. from thereon, johnny is a streetrat until he meets Rab, who is a Son of Liberty. The Lytes are loyalists so they get into quite a bit of trouble. Rab dies in the end. I think this is a good book if you aren't forced to read it like I am. Otherwise, its actually a good book for learning about the revolution. I don't reccomend it to those who like comedy books or fantasy, because there's no comedy, and it's based on actual events."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book, Johnny Tremain, really is a boring book. It has no sense whatsoever. DOn't read it if you don't have to"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I had to read, or tried to read, this book for school and it was terrible! It is one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. It took me ten minutes to read one page that I could normally read in two. In other words, it does not read quickly. I was not the only one of my classmates who couldn't stand it. Six of us read the book, six of us hated it. No DESPISED it. One of my friends said, \\"Who would want to read this worthless piece of pig food?\\" I wholehartedly agree with him."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book was the most boring book on earth. I started to read it, and I didn't even get to the part where Johnny gets molten silver all over his hand. I fell asleep! I know a lot of people like it, but I had a hard time even starting it. My teacher even said it was boring! I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I'm reading this book as an assignment in Language Arts. Last year, we watched the movie, and it was an interesting movie. I thought that this would be a fun book to read, but now that I've really gotten into it, I really don't like it. I'm an advanced reader for my age, and the old English vocabulary is hard for me to tackle. The plot is mostly boring, but there are some exciting parts, such as the Boston Tea Party. There isn't really a plot line, so you never know where Esther Forbes is going next with the story. In other reviews, people have said that its really boring in the beginning, but gets better at the end. This is true in the beginning, but I'm past the middle of the book and this has not changed. If I were feeling generous tonight I might have given this book two stars, because of the few exciting parts, but, because of the main plot, this book only gets one star..."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"While both my parents and my parent's friends are always raving about this book, i find a good many things that bother me. The plot starts out promising, but then rapidly goes downhill as one thing after another goes wrong. Not only is that depressing, but the main character (Johnny Tremain) shows absolutely no feeling or connection with what is going on; which is the major downfall of the book. Even though I can see how it might be deemed worthwhile by some people, I myself feel that the subject matter and wording are innapropriate for the recommended reading age."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This review is a joint effort between me and my younger brother, both of whom were forced to read 'Johnny Tremain' in school. The book is one of that sort of historical fiction that seems sickeningly contrived, attempting against all better literary judgement to pack in extra \\"historical facts\\". In style, it most resembles one of those unhappy nursery stories that we tell to disobedient children in order to make them feel guilty and scared and turn from their wicked ways. In the process, characters are created whom readers have no empathy for, whose sole purpose is to make us vow never to be as stupid as they are. It makes readers wish they would just drop off the face of the planet before we have to hear anything more about them. Not only that, but the story is not even accurate to history or human nature; its unconditional portrayal of Americans as heroic men and women (except, of course, the contemptibly immoral main characters) and villification of every last action of the British create an unbalanced perspective which seems rather wrong to teach to children. I vote to remove this book from every required reading list known to man. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. This concludes our merciless pounding of this dreadful work of literature (if you can call it that with a straight face)."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"No one needs night time medicines anymore! You can just pick up a copy of Johnny Tremain and trust me you'll be asleep in no time! There is no plot, the characters are boring, and the only person i knew who read it in middle school and didn't file for child abuse is my 70 year old english teacher! If you want to learn about the revolutionary war, pick up a history book! Im sure you'll enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"First off, I would like to say that when I started reading this book for a language arts class assignment, I had NOTHING against it. I don't mind books about history; I don't mind reading, and believe me, I WANTED to enjoy it. But by the time I got done the first chapter, I knew this book was horrible, yet I continued to read it. I did not HAVE to read it, I could have just gotten the answers from someone else, but I read it anyway. This book was horrible. It was unrealistic and had almost nothing at all to do with history. The plot line (if you could actually call \\"that\\" a plot line) had nothing to do with anything, the so called adventures this dumb Johnny Tremain kid got himself into were things that would never ever happen EVER. It had nothing to do with anything in history and tried to drift more of your attention to this dumb kid who got some stupid silver cup stolen. It was the most boring book I have ever read.If you are actually considering buying this... PLEASE for the sake of your poor kids or students or whomever, RECONSIDER. If you want to buy them something educational or something that portrayals early American life, DO NOT buy this. I forced myself to be bored with this dumb book about three quarters of the way through, and then I could not take it anymore. There was nothing I found remotely interesting; I would not force my worst enemy to read this book. It would be more fun and interesting watching someone pick the lint of their socks.If one was not the lowest number I would rate this book a zero, it deserves a negative 200, but that would draw too much attention to a book so dumb it does not deserve ANY attention. I feel so strongly about this that I am actually wasting my summer to come and type this to help prevent some poor soul from going through the torture I went through. Why this book won a Newberry metal, I don't know, something seriously went wrong, but look at the other books on that list... SHILOH? I personally think that someone was held at gunpoint to actually PUBLISH this book.Don't waste your time with this waste of paper. Incase you are wondering, I got a 98 on that test without even reading a lot of the book and the other parts I actually did read I was too busy banging my head into the wall or falling asleep, the only thing that stopped me from shredding this book in the Garbage disposal or a cuisinart was that I might break one of them on this useless [book] and that I would not pay the school even 10 cents for this horribly written garbage."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"While both my parents and my parent's friends are always raving about this book, i find a good many things that bother me.

Johnny is starts out as a silver smith apprentice. Later on he becomes the person who delivers the Boston Observer to everybody who is has subscribed to it. He becomes part of famous historical events. I think this book is good because it has action and adventure. The reason I think this book has some bad parts because in the book it has too many characters and not enough plot. At the end it sounds almost as if there is going to be a sequel. It also has some parts where it needs more facts about what is happening. .If you like books with action, adventure and a hint of history than this is the book for you, but if you do not like books that have holes to many names and not much plot than do not waste your time on this."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is about a boy named Johnny Tremain.

Johnny Tremain is a 14-year old boy apprenticed to Mr. Laphem. He has four &quot;sisters&quot; and two fellow apprentices. He is quite skilled, until one day, a crucible breaks and his hand is burned by silver. When his hand heals, the thumb and palm have grown together. Now usless as a silversmith, he looks for work. When he finds none at first, he goes to Mr. Lyte. Johnny Tremain's mother, before she died, had given him a cup. She told him never to show it to anyone, unless even God had turned his face. Mr. Lyte proclaims Johnny a thief and has him put up for trial. He is cleared by Judge after a testemony by his &quot;sister&quot;, Cilla. After the trial, he tries to sell the cup to Mr. Lyte. Mr. Lyte takes the cup from him on threat of arrest again. After this, he becomes a printer with another boy, Rab. He and Rab are caught up in the beginings of the Revolutionary War.

The teen's boss, though once masterly at his trade, is now past his prime and has, along with his family, hung all his hopes on the hard-working young man. Johnny Tremain works alongside two less able boys (one older, one younger) who envy his skill, drive, and the high level of responsibility the elderly silversmith has bestowed upon him. Observing several contentious interactions between the teen and his fellow apprentices, his employer admonishes him for the sin of pride, about which, he warns, God might choose to punish him. Expectedly, He does, in the form of a career-ending injury. The family tries to get by in spite of their star student's disability, but it doesn't take long for the burdensome situation to take a toll on everyone. Johnny, with help from a friend, must find a way to make a living wage and eventually signs on as a messenger, helping out in support of the Whigs. He also becomes embroiled in controversy surrounding his family heritage. Due to his involvement in these situations, Johnny learns a lot about politics, sticking up for what's right, and, the price of war, (p 253) \\"...some of us would die - so other men can stand up on their feet like men.\\" Although Esther Forbes' writing style feels (forgive me, Forbes fans) dated, reading Johnny Tremain, with its excellent character development and descriptiveness, is a great way for young readers to learn about events leading up to the Revolutionary War.

Makes it come alive. Instead, I felt the need to refresh my memory of historical facts. Also read \\"My Brother Sam Is Dead\\"."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is a wonderful novel to learn about the life in Boston during the Revolutionary War. In this historic novel,a young silversmith apprentice,Johnny, gets caught up in the Revolutionary War against the British. After burning his hand as a silversmith's apprentice, Johnny is hired to deliver a popular newspaper at the time. As Johnny delivers newspapers, he meets with the some of the Sons of Liberty and Rab.After the Boston Tea Party that Johnny helped in, the citizens of Boston were to pay taxes. Most people refused to pay and were to be punished.When the governor of Boston had to go back to Britain,a governor chosen by King George III,steps in for the job. With him, the new governor brings many soldiers to Boston. The people of Boston were not very happy about that.Soon after the battles of Lexington and Concord and the midnight ride of Paul Revere, the Sons of Liberty plan and defeat the British after many battles.The American Colonies were then free from the British rule. The thirteen colonies were then called the United States of America.After all the troubles Johnny and the thirteen colonies went through, there was one more trouble Johnny had to face-the death of Rab, his best friend that comforted him throughout the war.This novel is one of the best novels that I have read. I recommend this novel to be read. This exciting tale is brilliantly written. I liked Johnny Tremain very much and I think you'll like it too."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"And therein lies the premise for the colonial revolutionaries of the 1770s, as Forbes has written in her storied historical novel of Johnny Tremain.Decidedly American, this story of the young protagonist Tremain in 1774-1775 colonial Boston could really be enjoyed by any reader who appreciates historical fiction. Though the story's premise is the beginning of the American War for Independence from England, the story has all the elements of a good book, even for those that may not have a stake or interest in the specific elements of American history or independence. There're also the traditional elements of just a good story: love and affection, espionage, conflict, loyalty, tragedy turned to fortune, suspense and a climactic point near the end of the book.Written to a teen audience, Forbes demonstrates great skill (obviously, as this book has stood the test of time, being copyrighted in 1943) in writing a book easily read and understood by her intended audience, but still very enjoyable to the adult audience. I've now read this book three times (I think the only book I've ever read 3 times), and recently for the first time in 26 years. What impresses me most now is how Forbes doesn't display the colonial revolutionaries - the Sons of Liberty - and their renowned characters, men who became the Founding Fathers of America, as near perfect and saintly men. She developed them as men with flaws, wavering allegiances, questionable faculties, but also men resolute in their cause and demonstrating gifted leadership abilities. Likewise, the British army and occupiers of the colonies were displayed not as disdainful, brash and belligerent, but as men who did not wish for war against what they felt were their fellow Englishmen. Forbes put a face of humanity on the entire circumstance whereby the reader today, even 233 years after the first shots were fired at Lexington and Concord, can be touched personally by the events in which Johnny Tremain found himself."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I first read this book when I was in fifth grade and enjoyed it more when I reread it decades later. I still consider it one of the best books of historical fiction ever written. Johnny Tremain is an apprentice to a silversmith in Boston as the ferments of revolution are beginning to boil. American leaders are beginning to believe that the only course of action open to them is an open rebellion against the British crown. Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Paul Revere are three of the Boston-area leaders that Johnny encounters.When is hand is maimed in an accident, Johnny is forced out of his apprenticeship and forced to live on the streets. Fortunately, after a spot of bad luck he becomes associated with kindly people who let him work with a horse and then use it to deliver newspapers. These people are strongly sympathetic to the revolution and Johnny is caught up in it.The most striking aspect of the book is the way the British troops are portrayed. They are described as being kindly, doing what they can to avoid conflict with the population. When Johnny plays a trick on a British officer that lands him in a mud puddle, the officer laughs and does not retaliate. Major Pitcairn is characterized as being quite popular among the people. Of course, history runs its inevitable course and the initial clashes occur at Lexington and Concord, igniting an open war. The patriots are also sometimes characterized as nothing but thugs, ganging up on Loyalists in the guise of being patriotic.This is a book that should be read by every American youth and I can report that all of the schools I know of require it."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book when I was young. Must have read it 20 times. I bought this book for my 10 year old nephew so he could enjoy like I did.Book goes a long way to teach some values."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"As a homeschool teacher I found Johnny Tremain a wonderful aid in helping my students learn about the events that led to the Revolutionary War. Set in the growing city of Boston, Johnny Tremain is a young teenage boy learning about the trials and tribulations of being a silversmith's apprentice. Johnny learns a hard lesson when he rushes to finish a silver pitcher and burns his hand terribly. Unable to continue his apprenticeship, Johnny is forced with a life changing decision, what shall his trade be now that he has this disfigured hand?The book gets exciting at this point and Johnny meets Mr Lorne and his nephew Rab. They run a printing shop called the Boston Observer. They take Johnny in and give him a job riding a skittish horse named Goblin. Johnny's new job requires he learn to control his horse Goblin and deliver the Boston Observer to men on the outside of town. Johnny quickly becomes informed about the currents events transpiring in Boston. He attentively listens to the leaders of opposition and becomes an ardent Whig. Very much interested in Politics and wanting to make a difference, Johnny shares that he will do whatever it takes to help his fellow Wig. Johnny becomes a strong force in the Boston Tea Party, gathering young boys and men to dress up as Natives and dump the english tea into the Boston Harbor. These events anger the British terribly and they want the colonists to pay for the destroyed tea. The rest of the book describes the Boston colonists fighting against Tyranny, demanding representation in the English Parliament, the famous words are written Taxation without representation is tyranny.This is a wonderful book to share with young students, they can relate to the character because he is a young boy that is driven to make something of his life. In addition the students can get a taste of the importance of standing up against tyranny at all costs. Johnny is truly a remarkable boy and participates in the changing of American History.I highly recommend this book to any teacher who is interested in integrating Social Studies topics with English and Writing activities. Our school used this book to write a paper about the events that lead to the Revolutionary War and how Johnny Tremain helped his fellow colonists overcome the Tyranny of the British."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"When I first started reading this book I was not hooked at all. To understand just the first chapter I had to read it two or three times. This book has a slow start but then it does eventually build up.Johnny Tremain wants to become a silversmith. When his hand was burned and eventually covered in silver his dreams were crushed. Although this did happen he did not give up all together. He earns a job as a paper boy, delivering papers by horseback.After working here he becomes a strong supporter of the Sons of Liberty and becomes a spy as well as a part of the Boston Tea Party.This was a very good book and I highly reccomend it. Usually I don't enjoy history but reading this book was actually an enjoyable way to learn about the Boston Tea Party, Lexington and Concord, and many other important events of the American Revolution. I was able to relate to Johnny very well which was not expected. He doesn't give up very easily and neither do I. All in all I really recommend this book to anyone, children ands adults included."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The Granddaddy of Young Adult Historical Fiction!Without hesitiation, I can echo the other reviewers here and mention that this book deserves to be a classic. It's take on historical fiction has kept it in the hands of school children for over 50 years.What I find truly remarkable about the book is not its description of Boston in the mid-1770s. I find JOHNNY TREMAIN really stands out in its description of how a young arrogant boy matures into a young man who takes responsibility for how he has treated others in the past and how he continues to connect to his own emotional life. Johnny changes significantly from the beginning to the end in understanding himself. Metaphorically, it is much like this nation -- arrogant, changing, proud, young... though this country still has a lot to learn.With an excellent middle school vocabulary, this book remains truly relevant to today's middle school reader. It is challenging reading, particularly with the details of people and places as there are plenty of each.I read this book thirty years ago as a child and the only thing that I remembered before recently picking up this book again was the incident with Johnny's hand and the molten silver. But is better than I remembered. It deserves to be turned into a television series (one season) that tells this story intimately without cutting any of the material. JOHNNY TREMAIN is a multi-layered, exquisuite piece of American literature that should be required reading for adults as well as children."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The book, Johnny Tremain, was pretty good but, it was also pretty long. If you have a lot of free time then read it because you won't want to stop. It is about a fourteen year old boy that is and apprentice for a silversmith. He is so good at his work that he gets to boss the older kids around. One day he is working on something and he drops one of his tools in. Without thinking he grabs at it and the hot silver burns his hands. His hands basically get melted together in between his fingers making them look webbed. Now obviously he can't do the silversmith work as good as he used to so his master tells him to go find new work. Johnny goes out and finds a printing press and quickly becomes friends with the owners son, Rab. Johnny finds things being printed about the British that are bad. Johnny decides to take it into his own hands and basically runs a postal route so he can get letters from the British and show Rab's father. You'll have to find out how it ends."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is fascinating historical fiction, for Esther Forbes has seamlessly woven a good Colonial yarn about an aspiring apprentice silversmith into the tapestry of New England's grievances, which culminated in the American Revolution. One could almost believe that Johnny--quick, cocksure, ambitious--actually lived and rubbed shoulders with the brilliant and fervent Boston patriots: Paul Revere, John Hancock, Sam and john Adams.What a wonderful parallel read this is for English-History classes, which will definitely appeal to boyswho crave literary action. The protagonist is an impoverished youth who loses his job and ultimately his place in a modest craftsman's home, because of an accident in which he burns his hand beyond folk healing. He struggles to find a few position, new friends and a sense of self-worth, since he realizes that his silver dreams are shattered beyond repair. But Johnny also undertakes a personal quest--a legacy from his poor mother: to be recognized by a wealthy merchant's family as a direct heir. But was this spirited and talented fellow meant to be a nobleman? Ultimately he learns to value the nobility of the heart.As war clouds loom increasingly over disgruntled Boston, Johnny's outlook changes; his new, American loyalty is refined in a crucible of patriotic hope--fired by the empassioned oratory of James Otis. The coming Revolution will stand as a beacon to oppressed people the world over, even back in &quot;mother&quot; England. Johnny learns to curb his temper somewhat, as he comes of age and suddenly must perform a man's job by defending his values in perilous times. This book is an excellent story which will hold the reader's interest because of the intensely personal storyline, plus accurate historical details. This book makes one proud to be Yankee born!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I'd highly recommend this book. There's a bit of everything a book should have-pride, a theme, history, action, death, and a touch of realization.The prize apprentice silversmith of Boston, Johnny Tremain is proud and arrogant. He has a silver cup which shows his true ancestry. He is actually the grandnephew of a rich English noble family, the Lytes. He is forbidden to show this cup to anyone, but he shows it to his master's daughter, Cilla Lapham. This is handy later, but when he gets back home to the Laphams, John Hancock arrives and orders a silver sugar basin. Of course, Johnny is given the most difficult part, the handles, as he is the better of two other apprentices, Dusty and Dove. Yet, Johnny can't get the handles right and is forced to work through Sabbath. Dove on purpose hands him the cracked crucible, and Johnny cripples his hand. He is useless for silver work, but the Laphams don't turn him out yet. Still, his pride is also crippled, and he goes door-to-door looking for skilled work. He is rejected by everyone until he comes to the printer's shop. There, he meets a boy named Rab Silsbee. Rab works for his Uncle Lorne and aunt. Johnny knows he can't stay in their hospitality forever, so he goes to the rich Merchant Lyte for help and shows him his cup. Merchant Lyte accuses him of stealing that cup on August 23rd that year. Now, Johnny has a witness: Cilla. The case is dismissed, but Merchant Lyte cheats Johnny out of the cup. Johnny finds out Rab is a Son of Liberty. He joins in with some of their actions, such as the Boston Tea Party. He helps spy on them by sending letters for the British army. Then, Johnny went to the last meeting of the Sons of Liberty. He would never forget James Otis lecturing about how some would give everything just so a man can stand up. Before he knows it, war starts and Lavinia Lyte, who took Cilla as her servant and Isannah as her prodigee was going back to London with Merchant Lyte. Cilla is staying, and before she leaves, Lavinia explains how she actually admired his mother and how her father, Merchant Lyte did not mean to cheat hikm out of the cup, he thought he was taking back his own property. Eventually, Johnny discovers a few more-than-best-friend feelings about Cilla, and happily discovers she has them too. Rab goes to war, but is killed, leaving the theme of \\"A man can stand up\\" supported.And so the book ends, leaving the book reader at the same time satisfied and disappointed, wanting to know more and having fun guessing what would happen to the characters.

Character development is key here--perhaps all readers can cite the historical events around which this story is crafted--don't expect new revelations or quick action here. Instead, the richness of this book is the glimpse of truly believable people amidst the growing turmoil that envelops them during this distant but so significant time.

Johnny Tremain lives in Boston and works as an apprentice to a silversmith. He's talented and arrogant, lording it over the other apprentices until his right hand is badly burned. His nearly-unusable hand means that his apprenticeship is over.Now more humble, he makes friends with the calm, enigmatic Rab, a boy a few years older than himself, who works for the Boston Observer. Soon Johnny gets a job delivering newspapers--on horseback. The publisher of the Observer is very political, and Johnny learns about the Whigs, who want freedom from England, and the Tories, who are loyal to England.A secret group of Whigs regularly meets regularly in the newspaper offices. Before long Johnny is delivering coded messages to the members, including Paul Revere. The Whigs are incensed that England is charging the colonies a tax on tea, but the real issue is freedom. As one Whig leader says, \\"We give all we have, lives, property, safety, skills...we fight, we die, for a simple thing. Only that a man can stand up.\\" Johnny too is becoming inspired by the cause of freedom.The Whigs organize the Boston Tea Party in December of 1773: sixty young men dressed as Indians, including Johnny and Rab, board three British ships and dump the tea into Boston Harbor. By June of 1774, British soldiers and officers fill the streets, Boston is blockaded, and the air is filled with talk of war. On every village green in New England, men and boys are drilling, but with only ancient squirrel guns and flintlocks as weapons.By early 1775, the Whigs suspect that the first British attacks will be at Lexington and Concord. Johnny's friend Rab goes off to Lexington to fight, but insists that Johnny, who is part of Paul Revere's spy network, must stay and report on British plans and troop movements. War is inevitable, but what will it bring for Johnny and Rab?This book, which won the Newbery Medal for 1944, brings to vivid life the beginning of the American Revolutionary War as no history book ever could. Disney made a movie of \\"Johnny Tremain\\" in 1957. I haven't seen it, but one reviewer felt it missed the mark, showing the war as a jolly adventure for boys, instead of a time when great sacrifices were made, \\"only that a man can stand up.\\"Ages ten and up"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"\\"'Dorcas, shut that door.

Also, the plot wasn't that good because the climax point was in the beginning of the book. However, the other members of our group would say that this was a pretty good book because the ending makes the reader think more about the book. You can also relate to some of the plots, such as a love triangle.We would recommend this book to people that like open ended books.

Here's an excerpt from one of my favorite negative reviews:\\"First off, I can't figure out how or why Johnny Termain [sic] won the Newbery award.

All the characters are well developed. For me, the only major setback of this book is the drag in some parts. For example, even though I could vividly imagine the Lapham's home, the early descriptions of the home were not really needed, as the majority of the story did not take place there. Other than that, it is a solid read, good for anyone interested in the American Revolution. In fact, I remember watching the Simpsons one time, and there was an episode where Bart had to read Johnny Tremain- and liked it, quoting \\"they should call this book Johnny's Deformed Hand.\\" If even TV's worst child read the book and got some knowledge out of it, can't everyone?"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This is fascinating historical fiction, for Esther Forbes has seamlessly woven a good Colonial yarn about an aspiring apprentice silversmith into the tapestry of New England's grievances, which culminated in the American Revolution.

This story takes place in colonial Boston, in the time of the Revolutionary War. Johnny Tremain, a young apprentice of a family \\"the Lapham's\\" has a skill for being a silversmith. IN the family there lives Mr. Lapham the grandfather of Madge, Dorcus, Cilla, and Isannah. One day, while prideful Johnny was working in the smithing areas trying to complete a silver sugar basin for rich Mr. John Hancock his rival apprentice, Dove, tried to teach Johnny a lesson. The marshmallow like Dove gave Johnny the broken crucible as revenge. Little did he know that this incident was to ruin Johnny's life. It changed and deformed Johnny's hand making two of his fingers stick together. This incident banned Johnny from silversmith and pretty much everything forever. This also puts down Johnny's confidence and makes him more aware of his surroundings. This badly told story by Esther Forbes is badly written with several grammar and punctuation mistakes. Also, it is very unclear in some parts that are very important and correspond to the main part of the story. Later in the story, while Johnny is looking for a new hobby, he meets Rab. Rab, whose uncle owns the printing shop, becomes Johnny's new companion and offers Johnny a job there as a rider. When Johnny goes to Jonathan Lyte, the merchant kicks him out. When he finds out about Johnny's cup, he asks to see it. Johnny tells Rab about his visit to Merchant Lyte and finds out that Merchant Lyte is a traitor. When Johnny takes his cup, Merchant Lyte accuses him of stealing it and has him arrested. With the help of Rab and through Cilla's testimony, Johnny is freed. He then takes up Rab's offer to be a rider for the Boston Observer.Meanwhile in the story and important battle is going on in Lexington. Mrs. Forbes does an atrocious job of describing to people who have no background in that area what is going on. Johnny meets with important leaders such as John Hancock, Paul Revere and Sam Adams to talk about the Boston Tea Party. Johnny takes part in the Boston Tea Party there and then he meets up again with the one who ruined his life, Dove. The conflict in the story seems to be Johnny trying to find himself, the aloof, shy nobody, or the strong, confident apprentice. Johnny works with Cilla and figures out through research and his supposed aunt Lavinia Lyte that the Merchant Lyte is his uncle. Johnny lives through this part showing more about Johnny's character and that he is a strong person on the inside. As Rab and Johnny's connection grows tighter Rab decides to leave to join the Minute Men to fight in Lexington which makes sense because Rab is from Lexington. Johnny is devastated but makes it through because it's Rab's dream and Johnny is a good friend. This is the climax of the story because Johnny has to live on his own and not have Rab there for support. In the war Rab gets wounded and Johnny's life is crushed but he is assured that Rab is a strong man and that he can make it through. Alas, Rab dies from loss of blood, but Johnny learns to move on, and that is the best part of all. For the solution is that Johnny finally finds his true self. Overall, this book is more about American History than just fiction. This book was a major disappointment to me because in chapters and big chunks of the book you could understand what was going on. Also, what majorly turned me off was this, when the book ended usually I feel sad when it ended because I feel attached to the characters, even the rude ones. They usually grow on me. With this book, I was glad it was over, it was a drag. The characters never really connected with me the way I wanted them to. All I have left to say is, good bye Johnny Tremain, and good riddance."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain is an old book, but still loved by kids today!I read this with my \\"historical fiction class\\" (ages 12-16). It was the first book of the year. At the end of the year, I asked the kids about their favorite books, almost all of them listed Johnny Tremain as their favorite, or second favorite.Other books (the competion, so to speak) were Stowaway, Witch of Blackbird Pond, Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, Sunrise Over Fallujah, for example."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"I read this book aloud to my children. It won the 1944 Newbery Medal.This is an historical fiction novel that takes place in Massachusetts in late 1700s before the American Revolution. Although the character of 14 year-old Johnny Tremain is a fictional hero, Forbes weaves many genuine historical figures throughout the story, including: Paul Revere, General Thomas Gage, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Doctor Joseph Warren, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, John Pitcairn, Francis Smith, Josiah Quincy II, and James Otis, Jr.At the outset, orphaned Johnny Tremain is working as a silversmith's apprentice. He shows real promise and skill in his craft but, unfortunately, one of his hands is burned by molten silver. Unable to perform the delicate work any longer because of his injured hand, he is forced to find another trade that he can learn. He is steadfast in trying to find skilled labour but is unable to find someone that is willing to employ him, so he takes a job delivering newspapers on horseback for the Boston Observer which is run by the Silsbee family. He learns that secret meetings are being organized by the Silsbees and are being attended by local businessman known as the Sons of Liberty. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea Party which is organized by the Sons of Liberty, and he also aids Paul Revere in warning the Minutemen that the British soldiers are coming.Forbes goes into great detail describing the Boston Tea Party, the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Paul Revere's Ride, and the political differences between the Whigs and the Tories. For the most part, my 9 year-old remained engaged in the story even through the lengthy historical narratives. We all loved Johnny Tremain and the fictional story lines, and it was nice to see Johnny's growth in maturity as a result of what he went through.Overall, we really enjoyed the story. Because of its historically rich content, the book is more ideally suited for an older reader.MY RATING: 4 stars!! It was really good, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy historical fiction!"},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"The main characters, especially Johnny are likeable. Though he is very arrogant and prideful, you can't help but sympathize and like Johnny.The idea of the book is interesting and unlike some \\"historical\\" fictions, Forbes actually did her research on the Revolutionary War.BUT, the book is fairly boring and the plot thins out in the middle and becomes uninteresting again until the end. But, then the end is not very good either. There are touching moments, but for the most part, it just ends and leaves a lot unanswered and not in a good way that makes you contemplate.Most kids seem to hate it, so I'm guessing you can skip this one for your kids."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"this book was a terrific adventure from the beginning of the revolutionary war. jhonny will take through the ups and downs of his life. i recommend it to everybody."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"This book was a Christmas gift for my elementary-school aged nephew who has a yen for reading early American history.

When he gets a job at the Boston Observer, a local newspaper, he is plunged into pre-war events. Forbes combined suspense, pre-war events, and interesting characters in Johnny Tremain. Even though Forbes's book has the qualities that I like in a historical fiction book, it also has downsides. Johnny Tremain seems to have a little-kiddies plot, Disney-like plot. The main character has no parents, a mean Great-uncle who despises him, and more Disney-like traits than I can name. I think it was a good historical fiction book, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who dislike slow-moving plots and stories."},{"Title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Gr.3-8 Pulitzer Prize winning author Esther Forbes has created another masterpiece, Johnny Tremain.

Cowan includes work of Evelyn Scott, Maurice Coindreau, Irving Howe, Olga W.Vickery, Perrin Lowery, Cleanth Brooks, Carvel Collins, Louise Dauner, Robert M. Slabey. John W. Hunt, Walter J. Slatoff, Hyatt H. Waggoner, Edumnd L. Volpe.It also contains a few brief discussions by Faulkner including interviews with Cynthia Grenier,and Jean Stein on his composition of the book. Faulkner tells us it is the book he loves the most the one which caused him the most pain and travail. He says he wrote it five times. It was originally meant to be a short story. It began with his image of a little girl Caddy Compson who has climbed a tree her three brothers would not dare to, and who is looking in at the parlor in which the funeral of her grandmother is conducted. The famous technique of the work in which each chapter is devoted to a different character's perception, mind, style recollection of the events of one day is discussed a great deal in the essays. Much is said especially in the excellent essay of Lowrey on the differing conceptions of Time presented in each of the chapters. The idiot son Benjy who in the opening chapter knows only what his immediate present gives therefore tells the tale in continually dramatic terms. Reflective and suicidal Quentin goes through the whole history of the family and his deeper perception of Time is understood as more abstract and philosophical. The evil hero of the piece brother Jason in his satirical, critical and sometime humorous perception sees Time in terms of 'use' and 'task'. His Time is a business time but of course he is critically late when it comes to seizing his niece who has run off with the savings he so carefully accumulated over many years. In the end it is the time of Dilsey the 'Negro' servant who wraps up the story and presents a kind of more reasonabkeand humane idea of Time. She combines a common- sense feeling for real Time in everyday tasks, with a religious sense of redemptive Time.Faulkner wrote his famous appendix to the book only fifteen years after its original publication. It is considered rightly and discussed in these excellent essays as one of the great masterworks of twentieth- century Literature.These essays will enhance the understanding of the work even for its most diligent readers."},{"Title":"Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War (Epochs of modern history)","review":"The narrative is good, flows pretty well, and gives the strengths and weaknesses of FtG as commander. Good overview of the powers and events of the SYW in Europe. Problem is that the maps reproduced here, except for one, are HORRIBLE! Why publisher let a book get the final OK with 90% of the maps entirely too blurry to read is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)","review":"This fine volume in the Cambridge &quot;Companions&quot; series is an essential aid to readers of Baruch Spinoza. Edited by Don Garrett, it includes ten essays on Spinoza's life and thought by ten world-class Spinoza scholars (including the late Alan Donagan, to whom the book is dedicated).Topics covered are various and pretty much exhaustive. W.N.A. Klever opens the volume with a summary of Spinoza's life and works; the closing piece by Pierre-Francois Moreau traces the influence of &quot;Spinozism&quot; from Spinoza's death through the twentieth century. The eight essays in between discuss, in turn, Spinoza's metaphysics (Jonathan Bennett), his theory of knowledge (Margaret D. Wilson), his natural science and methodology (Alan Gabbey), his metaphysical psychology (Michael Della Rocca), his ethical theory (Don Garrett), his political theory (Edwin Curley, in a piece strikingly entitled &quot;Kissinger, Spinoza, and Genghis Khan,&quot; in which he argues that Spinoza was essentially Machiavellian), his theology (Alan Donagan), and his influence on Biblical scholarship (Richard H. Popkin).The resulting collection is a clear and thorough examination of every essential aspect of Spinoza's thought. My recommendation to new readers of Spinoza: begin with Roger Scruton's fine little book in the &quot;Past Masters&quot; series, and then go on to this one."},{"Title":"Church And Israel After Christendom: The Politics Of Election (Radical Traditions)","review":"Scott Bader-Saye's work contends that the church, in the wake of the Holocaust and the demise of Christendom, has the opportunity to recover its identity as a people grafted into Israel, dependent upon Israel's covenant election. Rather than merely arguing against supersessionism, Bader-Saye develops a fascinating account of the political consequences of this new vision. He argues that only a recovery of the church's covenantal relation to Israel can provide the resources to resist modernity's politics of voluntarism and violence. This is a stimulating piece of integrative theological thinking, linking theology, ethics, biblical studies, and cultural analysis to create a fresh paradigm for understanding our identities as Jews and Christians. Since the twentienth century has tragically proved the lethal dangers of the old paradigm, the need for such fresh reflection is urgent. This book-with its incisive critique of MacIntyre, Milbank, and Hauerwas-is sure to provoke intense and constructive discussion in the theological world."},{"Title":"Church And Israel After Christendom: The Politics Of Election (Radical Traditions)","review":"Scott Bader-Saye is one of a very select group of younger Christian theologians who are engaging Jewish theology in an unprecedented, positive, way, and who are up to the great challenge this project presents. His book is a feast of empathy, learning, and critical theological reflection, conducted with extraordinary intelligence. It will no doubt contribute greatly both to inter-Christian discourse and Jewish-Christian discourse. It is a noteworthy theological debut."},{"Title":"Church And Israel After Christendom: The Politics Of Election (Radical Traditions)","review":"At 196 pages this price is outrageous.

When finally liberated, he was a walking skeleton, blind from malnutrition, but still a proud American.The American POWs as described in the book could be beaten, but not broken.This is a little memoir, 108 pages, written shorthly after Major Bank's return from the Philippines in 1945. He went home to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, reunited with his wife, got on with his life, raised his children, and served in the Alabama legislature.The book is not literary, a la Elie Wiesel or Viktor Frankl. It is plain and simple. It shows the enemy clearly, describes the sadism without lingering on it. It seems to be written by a mentally healthy man, despite his tortuous imprisonment.He says he is haunted by nightmares sometimes, which is not to be wondered at, given that he had to witness the burial alive of Americans, saw firsthand the bayoneting of his comrades in arms, endured the screams of his fellow prisoners being tortured for weeks, and survived the daily sufferings and psychological suspense that came at the hands of the unpredictable, cruel Japanese captors.We are not raising this kind of American anymore. We all dwell so deeply on our experiences. We spare our children failure and loss.We would do well to remember that our enemy in 2008 is another sadistic political system that holds human life at no value and takes glee in torture and dismemberment. Imagine the experiences of Bert Banks and the other POWs. Now imagine them televised and their cruelty celebrated in the streets of the Middle East. That is our world. God bless our children."},{"Title":"Back from the living dead: An original story describing the infamous March of Death ; 33 months in a Japanese prison and liberation by the Rangers","review":"I knew Mr. Bank when I was in my early 20's and fresh out of college, working in the radio broadcasting business in Birmingham Alabama. It was the Mid 90's, and he was already up in years. I knew him at first as a friendly older fellow that was always around University of Alabama football and soon learned that he founded the Alabama Radio Network. I was stunned to learn that this man that knew had survived the Bataan Death March and was liberated by the Rangers at Cabanatuan. I learned of this book and read it with much fervor. It is a point-blank recollection of events. There is no hyperbole and very little embellishment at all. Just a man telling what he saw and what happened to him. If you can find a copy, get it. You won't regret it. Mr. Bank died on the 22nd of June 2009. He was a war hero, a radio pioneer, served his state as a legislator and state senator, and was above all a good, caring gentleman. The world is a lesser place without him in it."},{"Title":"Back from the living dead: An original story describing the infamous March of Death ; 33 months in a Japanese prison and liberation by the Rangers","review":"I received an electronic version of this book for free, and read through it quickly. The book reads more like a diary than anything; it is not a literary work full of imaginative descriptions or hyperbole. What it is is a book that quickly reminds the reader what others have suffered to offer us our current quality of life in the United States. What the author went through is truly incomprehensible to me, yet we are only 50 years removed from that time period.If you have late teen or early 20's kids complaining because they don't have a new car, or new clothes, or any of the other things kids gripe about, I suggest you lock them in their room and tell them they can't come out until the finish this book.

But her steps are vauge and useless, rarely haveing more than four steps. You can not learn how to paint wood grain or marble in four steps, although marble is presented here in three meaningless steps. So as a learning tool this book is useless. I would recommend instead Trompe L'Oeil Creating Decorative Illusions with Paint by Roberta Gordon-Smith or Painting Murals by Patricia Seligman, for new muralist.

Written by a niece of a survivor of BOB and German POW camp, it is a compilation of the experiences of her uncle and other members of the 106th Infantry Division and particularly the 81st Combat Engineer Bn. thereof. The Division was one of those pushed into a previously quiet line in Belgium in December 1944 to get get used to the idea of war before finding themselves in a major conflict.Very well documented, logically presented, a very good read for those interested in the Battle of the Bulge."},{"Title":"Book of King Arthur and his Noble Knights","review":"No doubt a very difficult version to find, however. I happened to trip across it while browsing in a used book store in south Minneapolis. There no doubt is a great deal of smiting and smoting betwixt the knights going on in this version, but dated language notwithstanding, my two sons thoroughly enjoyed my reading of this to them. They loved the pure action contained within these tales, and the drawings at the beginning and ending of each chapter were terrific. Of all the versions I've looked at of the King Arthur tales, this, I felt, was the most accessible and readable for audiences of all ages. Too many versions contain language that is far too &quot;medieval&quot; or far too modern. This strikes a nice balance. A wonderful read to follow this one up with is, surprisingly, Don Quixote, which is a spoof of exactly this type of book."},{"Title":"The Honeycomb, An Autobiography by the Author of Final Verdict and Tell No Man","review":"This is a beautifully written book about one of the most fascinating women I've ever heard about. She knew everyone from Jean Harlo to Eleanor Roosevelt from Wyatt Earp to Bobby Kennedy. She was a newspaper reporter who lived in L.A. at the turn of the last century and watched Hollywood become Hollywood. The vast array of people in her life included almost everyone who was famous. I would love to have known her and spent house listening to her talk, but after reading this book I feel as though I did.Reading about her life has enriched mine."},{"Title":"Cornerstones of Freedom the Story of the declaration of Independence","review":"The first political document of the fledging United States was the Declaration of Independence, and it was a very radical document for that or any other time. For it declared as a basic principle, that all men are equal and endowed with rights that arise from the creator and not from the monarch. It is true that the words must be understood now in the historical context of \\"men\\" meaning at the time \\"white male over 21\\". Nevertheless, it clearly stated that governments existed only with the approval of the people and was the first step in the sequence of events that led to the establishment of the United States of America.All American school children must learn the genesis of this document and understand the basic concepts that it contains. This book will give them the former and it is up to other entities to give them the latter. This book should be required reading in elementary schools."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"Drums by Boyd has been called the best novel ever written about the Revolutionary War. Narrated from the viewpoint of a North Carolina Tory gentleman's adolescent son, it's unique outlook soon draws the reader into the drama of colonial unrest and the emotional battle men fought within themselves whether to cede from England or not. However, this is no psychological melodrama. Some of the most superb scenes in the novel are the depictions of a local horse race and a John Paul Jones sea battle. So why isn't Drums read more widely? It would seem Boyd's own excellent writing has gotten him into trouble for today's reader. Not only are his fight scenes realistic, but his cooly penetrating description of the early entrenchment of southern slavery, with all crudities of language and social class structure, is too graphic for our modern tastes. In short, he uses the &quot;N&quot; word too liberally. Reading this novel reminded me of reading HUCKLEBERRY FINN. It also reminded me of Olasky's FIGHTING FOR LIBERTY AND VIRTUE. Personally, I think it should be put back on high school reading lists. I think it would help in revealing why slavery was not addressed at the time of the Revolution as well as why it took a war to settle the matter."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"I had never heard of James Boyd or his 1925 novel Drums until listening to historian David McCullough's speech, The Course of Human Events, wherein McCullough cited Drums as a historical novel he'd read as a child and helped inspire him to become a historian. That was enough for me to give it a look myself.Drums starts out set in North Carolina and features Johnny Fraser as the main character. Johnny is the son of a well-to-do Scottish immigrant with expectations of becoming a gentleman and dreams of adventure. The story begins when Johnny is a boy, and depicts his growth into a young man during the time of the American Revolution.While I was expecting the protagonist of a novel about the Revolutionary war to sign up for the Continental Army the moment shots are fired at Lexington, this turns out not to be the case in Drums. Instead, what we see is Johnny's struggle to determine the right course of action, torn between loyalty to the King and pride in his country. Meanwhile, we also get to see how Johnny's family, friends, and neighbors respond to the choice before them between loyalty and patriotismThis conflict is actually the central struggle of the drama. While there is action and we do eventually get to see some of the war, the focus is definitely on the civilian side of things, and the look at how civilians lived, and how they fared and the choices they had to make is very interesting.Since a large portion of the book is set in Revolutionary North Carolina, slavery is very present. Boyd doesn't shy away from the ugliness of the situation. It's presented much as it must have been, and as a simple fact that none question. While I certainly didn't enjoy reading those parts, per se, I appreciated Boyd's willingness to depict things honestly. There's no overt condemnation of slavery or the treatment of African-Americans, but in this case, showing things as they were and how even our protagonist doesn't give it a thought can in itself be powerful.One aspect that was a pleasant surprise was a historical connection between Drums and Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel, Kidnapped. Kidnapped is set in Scotland of the 1750's, and given that Johnny's father is a Scottish immigrant, some of the major historical events of that time affect each novel. I'll say no more to avoid spoiling either book.I read an edition of Drums illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. Wyeth is a favorite of mine, having illustrated many young men's adventure stories of the era. His work here is again excellent. Wyeth contributes nine full color, full page illustration, as well as a small black and white drawing at the opening of each of the 47 chapters.Overall, I would have liked a novel about the Revolutionary War to have a bit more action, but Drums does an excellent job of depicting the rest of the Revolution, which often gets less attention, and the action it does include is quite good. If you're a fan of the American Revolution or historical fiction, Drums will probably appeal to you."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"I first saw the Scribner Illustrated Classics series in a Museum in Chicago. I believe Treasure Island was the first that I purchased. The Wyeth paintings were reproduced for this book and many others. The artwork is fabulous. I visited the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, PA to see many of the original Wyeth illustrations. The titles in this series are still classics and every bit as riviting as when I first read them. I have read some to children and they are great fun for all. I have collected the whole series, they will be passed on to children and grandchldren."},{"Title":"Drums,","review":"The book arrived in very good time and was in the condition as shown by the seller. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I have the full collectlion of these classics illustrated by N. C. Wyeth, and needed this one to complete the set. All of the others I purchased new when they were published. This one is in as good a condition as my other books."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"It was OK, and had some good anecdotes, but over all not life-changing or awe-inspiring. After all of the plugging on Dave Ramsey's radio show, I expected more."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Both of Miller's books are life changing. One is QBQ! and the other is Flipping the Switch. Very practical content that anyone can use. He teaches how to stop the blaming and victim thinking. As I read it, it stopped me in my tracks: Simple but profound. I realized right then, though I thought I was an accountable person, I had been off track by asking the Incorrect Questions that lead me to finger-pointing and waiting for others to get things done. Now at work I am better able to practice personal accountability by simply looking at a situation and asking, \\"What can I do to help?\\" as opposed to blaming the other dep't or my boss or my colleagues. I find the QBQ! approach reduces my stress and I manage my time better. Blame is such a time waster. When I then read Miller's newest book (Flipping the Switch) I realized these ideas can be taken even deeper. I can build Trust, Learning, Creativity, Service, and Ownership into my daily walk. I highly recommend both books. Buy them as a set. Both are an hour read and well worth the time and money!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"So many books miss the point when it comes to accountability/responsibility. But author/speaker John G. Miller QBQ! in QBQ! it with a practical \\"how to\\" method to live it each day. Rarely do you find a book so small with such a \\"hands on\\" approach. It is specific in every way because:1. QBQ! tells us WHY personal accountability is important and WHAT it is.2. QBQ! teaches us what accountability is NOT. This is critical because without this, we don't really \\"get it.\\"3. QBQ! shows us HOW to do it by eliminating bad questions we ask and how to ask excellent questions of ourselves. The three step technique taught is effective and easy to apply. A gem of a tool.4. QBQ! changes one's thinking instantly so you view problems, frustrations and your daily work differently right away .... and in a better light.5. QBQ! helps us realize that accountability is about ME and not others6. QBQ! provides excellent stories about people who practice personal accountability and it is these stories that live with me long after I've read the book.And just like the author recommends, QBQ! is to be read over and over so it becomes part of our daily walk. I keep my copy right on my desk as THE resource to help me stop blaming, whining, and procrastinating and begin each day with an accountable mindset.I also give 5 Stars to Miller's new book \\"Flipping the Switch ...Unleashing the Power of Personal Accountability.\\" An absolutely terrific companion piece to QBQ! More wonderful stories and additional practical content.We had Mr. Miller (QBQ.com) in to keynote our conference and he is a fantastic speaker ... so that is another way to bring QBQ! and the message of accountability into an organization."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ! is the most practical book out there on accountability and the only one on PERSONAL accountability. Others are fine, but none have the pinpoint accuracy and incisive content of QBQ! The 3 step QBQ! method of asking better questions is user-friendly and practical. I enjoyed it due to the stories and the realism of the message. And with the pace of life today, a one hour read is far more effective for me - and I suspect most all others - than a thicker book full of theory. Our firm bought three thousand copies of QBQ! and had John Miller into keynote. His content is becoming a way of life for us. Five stars for QBQ!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"A couple of months ago I ordered 24 QBQ!s for our bank. Our managers have sooooo enjoyed this book and have taken it back to their teams and are sharing it with them. The feedback I am receiving is incredible. I can tell you it made a huge difference for me and I passed my copy along to my husband who agrees. We have a daughter with special needs and it helped us to realize we can make a difference in her development if we will just ask The Question Behind the Question when it comes to working with her, the teachers, and her school. This book is making a difference in our home life and at the bank and we HAVE to keep the momentum going!! It's all about personal accoutnability and ownership and QBQ! does that!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ is easy to read and the most powerful book I have ever seen on Personal Accountability. I believe it should be assigned reading in all schools because I feel we live in an excuse filled society. By that I mean it is okay not to perform as long as you have a good excuse or someone or something to blame. QBQ hits you right between the eyes with techniques anyone can use to be more accountable. If I could, I would rate it a 10!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"While this book has some good bits of advice, there is nothing in which a reader can sink their teeth - there is no substance to the book at all. The chapters consist of 'fortune cookie' sayings that are supposed to guide you into a more successful workplace. How about providing some substance so that readers can really delve into a topic, rather than just being presented with a headline. I 'read' this book in under an hour, and didn't come away with any real words of wisdom, other than to not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I enjoyed this book. One point to make, for those shopping online and who can't thumb through the book. The text is about size 18, and the book could easily be condensed into 50 pages or so. I find the tidbits and stories interesting, the the text itself is very choppy and really just a collection of stories.I think that this book will help my personal growth, and my growth as a leader, but I disagree with the theory that people have to change themselves, and correct managing cannot do that. I wouldn't give the author 5 days running a real business."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I expected a lot out of this book. For me, the book seems to lack substance. While the topic is valid, and everyone needs to follow the intent of this book, the book itself is not a road map on how to get there. There are a couple of nice stories of people who go the extra mile, but if you are not one of those people already, this book is going to guide you to get there.The book came highly reccommended by Dave Ramsey, however, it did not live up to my expectations. Had the book been an article in a magazine, (it can easily be shortened to fit) it would have been worth the price of the magazine. The story was not ready for a stand alone publication."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This is one great book. The author came and spke for us and I looked into the mirror and realized I do too much blaming and complaining. We are going to train all our people on QBQ! Personal accountability is perfect for us now with all the change we are going though. As a manufacturing facility, finger pointing has been the way of doing things, not anymore. QBQ! is a great tool for teams and individuals."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I am in the real estate/investment business and when I read QBQ! it changed completely for the better the way I think. I had been blaming my tenants/customers, property mgrs, the marketing dep't, etc. for my results and when I read QBQ! I sat down that night and asked &quot;How can I be more effective?&quot; and then set about writing out a new plan for my approach to my business. Since then things have improved greatly. The chapter on how I can only change myself has made me a better manager of my people, by far. The book took me an hour to read and then I went back through and re-read and highlighted. I take it wherever I go as it is such a practical message on personal accountability I can use it in all areas of my life. QBQ! deserves 5 stars ... maybe 6. I've read a ton of business books and QBQ! has made the difference for me."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I must say that based on my experience with QBQ! the book and the QBQ! training program, it is truly a great way of creating personal accountability and building solid and lasting relationships. I have seen using it for almost a year now and it has increased my efficiency and productivity, while allowing me to develop stronger relationships by being a part of the solution vs. an added cause of the problem. I would like to thank Mr. Miller for taking the time to write this book and create the training system. Seeing it in practice reinfoces the practicality of QBQ! and the truth of its philosophy."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Since the book is 115 pages, double spaced, with lots of white space, it's not a very daunting read.I especially like some of the quick wit such as recounting on page 63, one CEO &quot;projected this message on a huge screen behind him: 'Personal accountability begins with YOU!&quot;The author then states:&quot;Personal accountability does NOT begin with you. It begins with me.&quot;"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Okay, I got this book from a friend at work. Started reading it and immediately thought of how badly everyone around me needed to read it. But then it got me. Instead of thinking about how 'bad' everyone else is, I need to be working on me! Embarassed to even acknowledge that something as basic as that was an 'ah-ha!' for me, but it was. That's the power of this excellent book. It'll totally turn your thinking around and put it where it should be. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I will start by saying that the book was not bad, in fact it was decent and left me thinking in a more positive manner. The essense of this book is personal responsibility, thinking positively and seeing how you can positively affect a negative situation. I was drawn into the book by the initial story of the waiter who got his manager to go out to the store to buy a soda that the restaurant did not carry. I was turned off by the story of the Home Depot associate who paid for an impatient customers merchandise and then denied a tip later. I think that story boarders on insanity. Trying to take personal responsibility in situations is great but there needs to be a point in which taking personal responsibility does not solve the problem."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ! is the right message for all to hear, right now. With so much finger pointing going on in our lives you would think that not being personally responsible and accountable is acceptable behavior. Unfortunately our children, co-workers, and friends see the leaders of our nation whether they be public servants or Fortune 500 executives setting a poor but all to common example of blame.QBQ! teaches us it is time to get our act together and step to the front of the line and change our behavior, now and forever. It's such a powerful book that all five of our grown children now have a copy. This is a quick read one cannot put down. And it's the real thing because it works. It is simply the best work on accountability on the market."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I found John's book online when searching the term \\"execution\\" on Google. I was asked to read \\"Execution\\" the book to prepare for a presentation at work. As much as I tried, I just could not get through the book, even though I thoroughly agreed with the message. I decided to look for another book that offered a similar message. I read QBQ! twice in one evening! Not only did it help me create a fantastic presentation, if I must say so myself, it inspired me to contact John and ask him to present to my company. My group was \\"wow-ed\\"! The message is simple, yet people are so busy and challenged on the job and in their personal lives that pointing fingers and making excuses is easier than accepting the accountability of a situation. This book makes you think."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ! touched me on many levels. It is all about how to really practice personal accountability and responsibility. It is easy to understand, entertaining, and very actionable. I read it in one evening - a quick read and effective. The author teaches how to ask excellent questions - QBQs - that help us be better leaders at work (regardless of title or position) and at home. The stories are fun and relevant. It's worth getting for others."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"For everyone forced by management to read this book and/or take the class I will summarize it for you: Quit you're whining and accept the fact that your company is the way it is, just concentrate on what you can do now. There's alot of motivational talk about personal accountability and not blaming others, just concentrate on what you can do to rectify the situation.That's it. Seriously. John Miller also goes on and on about how we learn by repitition, so read that 5 times and you don't have to read the book or take th class. Serously though, I understand that the book has good points and I understand why corporations all over the US will have their employees take this class, because it just says what I said above. But in the end it is very demotivational and a little insulting. This is from a person who truly feels he has learned quite a bit from reading many CEO biographys, management books, and books such as the 7 habits and six hats. I don't necessarily but into motivational hype, but I keep an open mind and try to pull in as much useful information as possible. I took the the DVD/facilitor-led class and then read the books in hopes of more inspiration and just left a little insulted."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"\\"The Question Behind the Question\\" only took about 30 minutes to read, and consists of several 'chapters' that are about 300 words each in length. Each chapter was short thoughts or anecdotes that are relational to the theme of the book, that 'personal accountability' is gone from modern society, specifically modern business.Though I would agree with Mr. Miller that not nearly enough people prefer to take responsibility for problems, I believe that the book does a poor job of selling the theme of asking better questions and motivating employees to take more responsibility. Mr. Miller doesn't ever assert his point clearly, but rather darts around in a syncopated style that often leaves the reader thinking 'that was a neat anecdote, but why did he share it'.On a grander scale, this is a management book, for management types who fall in love with self help books. For those types of managers, this book will seem like a godsend, because it focuses on the idea of making your employees want to work, which would be a common complaint from all managers. It also emphasizes the idea that its not the managers job to motivate them, or help them, but rather to ask specific types of questions that should lead their employees to their own idea of 'personal responsibility' about their jobs. I would argue that work is just that, work. And the only way people are motivated to work is by being paid.Mr. Miller is a salesman, and a savvy one at that. He recognizes that managers complain about a lack of motivated employees, so he wrote a book that speaks to that point. If managers complained that not enough people wore green to work, he'd write a book about that too. His game is not making you a better boss, but selling more books. Remember that with all the self help books people think about buying. Also remember that there is an incredible industry behind 'management consulting' and these sorts of hokey, cheesy things rarely are deep enough to provoke real results. There's no excuse for 'going and seeing' issues, talking to people and gathering opinions, and making decisions."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Every day we are faced with hundreds of choices. Many of them are so routine and seemingly insignificant that we don't think twice about them. Ultimately, where we are and where we end up in our life is the result of each and every one of those choices. If you aren't happy with where you are right now, start looking at the choices you make. Want to start making better choices for your life? Start asking better questions.For years in my life, without realizing it, I had been asking questions that wrongly deflected responsibility from me to my family, friends and associates. Not only was that punishing them, it kept me from growing and becoming the husband, father and friend I wanted to be. QBQ helped me to \\"reframe\\" different situations and start asking questions that would yield positive solutions rather than dwell on problems.With a healthy dose of humor, Miller shows us in thirty nine bite-size chapters how to accept responsibility for our own choices, actions and attitude. QBQ will show you how to approach your daily life situations with better questions. Better questions will yield better answers. Better answers will yield better long-term results.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"John Miller's book is easy to read - an hour or two, tops - but life-changing in scope. The secrets of personal success really are as simple as changing the mechanics of what you ask yourself, and how you respond.I can speak from experience on this, having made a career of helping many organizations dramatically change their service quality. I don't change their \\"attitude\\" - we just look at, and change, the mechanics of what they say and think, and suddenly the lights turn on for everyone. In the same way, looking for the QBQ (question behind the question) flips the magic switch that makes you a leader every time.The real secret is that QBQ! works at a global level as well as a personal level. Miller shares many stories of how people become leaders by being accountable and asking what they can do - but when you look critically at who are the service or profitability leaders in any business, you'll often find entire organizations who succeed by creating an environment where *everyone* feels that success starts with them.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I am a career military man and have learned that the most efficient way to lead is by using the concepts that I just read about in QBQ. I have seen unsuccessful military leaders only make it due to the contributions of their subordinates. Over the years though I have watched a decline in the abilities of the military to function in this realm. Remember the servicemembers are merely a representation of today's society. I am retiring from the military and going off into the world of secondary education as a teacher and look forward to applying these in my lessons to today's youth. I also strongly believe that the state of today's economy is s product of the blame game being played by the government, realtors, banking industry, auto industry, workers' unions, etc. This should be required reading for all of those and the American consumer. I found this book a good, quick read with many great concepts that anyone from the age of 10 on up can understand and apply in their everyday lives. Good job on a well written book. I wish you would lower the price so that I can personally buy multiple copies for the senior students that I will be teaching."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"John Miller's QBQ is a must read! This book is a practical book and the principles can be used in every area of your life. I would recommend that this book be a must read for every new and old employee, every church member and every member of a family.Personal accountability went out the window and was subsituted with \\"it's not my job\\". This book causes the reader to become aware of the part that they play in the scheme of things and taking personal responsibility for that part.It also challenged us to go the extra mile which is not the theme of the world today. My hat is off to Mr. Miller for shining a light on the lack of personal accountability. The thought for everyone should be \\"If I'm not part of the solution then I'm part of the problem.\\""},{"Title":"QBQ!

Even at 140 pages you definitely can read it over your lunch hour.The concept is pretty simple and I have to admit had I read this prior to leaving my last role I might still be there...glad this book waited until I was here.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Personal accountability is fine in theory, but enormously difficult in practice. This is because it will only work if the overwhelming majority of people practice it. It is a fact of life that it takes only a few people engaging in selfish behavior to slow down the progress of everyone else. If you hold yourself accountable for what is done and those you work with do not, then the group, including those that are unproductive, will collectively get the credit.I am not saying that you should avoid holding yourself accountable for what you do; just that one must be reasonable about doing it. You must keep your expectations to a manageable level and understand that there might be times when only you will know what you have accomplished.Personal accountability of course starts with the actions of each and every individual and from that perspective this is a good book. Miller discusses what questions or statements should be said rather than what is actually being said. By using the singular pronoun I in \\"What can I do better?\\" rather than \\"What do I get out of it?\\" each person can take an enormous step towards success and personal achievement. However, as has already been stated, the actions of others may render your achievements down to a much lesser height than they could have been. Miller largely ignores this segment of reality, which lowers the value as you ramble down your lane of the rat race."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"In a word, OUTSTANDING! This book is an inspiration and a guide for me every day. I share it with my students in EVERY class. It is a quick read and full of simple insight.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing Mr Miller speak to my organization and felt his message in personal accountability spoke volumes about how to make small changes create a large impact.Mr Miller speaks eloquently about his topic and is obviously passionate about the role QBQ takes for everyone, be they a leader, parent or any human being. The book is an easy read and the concept is not a stretch to understand, follows similarly to \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" or the One Minute Manager series. This is the type of concept that asks you to think about what is the right thing to do, and more importantly, complete it. The procrastination concept is powerful and impactful, again, very simple, however a concept all need to follow and practice...practice being the root of all habits.Mr. Miller has one example of a cashier at Home Depot that lowered the rating from 5 to 4 stars; this example is too far fetched and the litigious results that potentially could arise from other customers feeling slighted is too over the top. I understand what Mr. Miller is presenting, and why he purposely ignores the repercussions of such an act, this example only degrades the message he is presenting.I look very forward to reading \\"Flipping the Switch\\" and putting these concepts into action, along with re-reading this series annually to ensure I continue to practice personal accountability."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I want to express my thanks to author John Miller for his QBQ! idea. His material provides the link for all organizations'leadership and accountability strategies. I have read and studied both of his books (The other is \\"Flipping the Switch\\").

There are limitless possibilities for utilizing the QBQ, in both my professional and personal life! This is such a wonderful way to live a much stress free life...although at times it's not easy , it is very simple to change the things we say and do to create a more positive attitude in every situation. I work in a very negative environment and since I have read QBQ! I have implemented it each day to practice personal accountability ......I'm much happier and very excited to use what I've learned . I'm the only one who can change me, there is no one to blame. If the ball is dropped, I pick it up and make the play where it will benefit the organization I work for. I expect no praise however my joy comes from within me.

The stories in the book truly speak to all of us whther it's Jacob at the Rockbottom or Judy at Home Depot or Brian the disabled man. Just excellent all around.

Every day see we see other people blaming us for their problems. However we think that we are free from such a mentality.This book show you know that you too blame other people for your problems. This book is for anyone in the human race. It is a must read.I spoke with John on the phone a few times and he is really a great guy.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Although the reviews of Miller's QBQ are resoundingly positive, I do not appreciate the book at all. I have been a practitioner in Management Development for 25 years, I have a doctoral degree in the field, and I consider books like QBQ to detrimental to the education of managers. Books like Who Moved My Cheese, and others where you don't really have to read the book to be able to mouth the catchphrase, I find counterproductive. These brief, stand-alone concepts let managers 'off the hook' in their responsibility to their shareholders and their own professional development, by allowing them to think that they are learning and growing professionally. They are being entertained (a good thing,) getting a common language to use with their co-workers (also good,) and they allow the author to guide them passively through lots of applications of their 'buzz word' concept (not so good.) Nevertheless, they do not integrate with the next \`flavor of the month.' The \`big picture' of consistent messages to management does not materialize.Given my profession, I prefer a curriculum of concepts, courses, behaviors and skills, and even some management theory, but most importantly, a curriculum based on diagnosed organizational needs. Miller is entertaining in his stand-up delivery. Miller's book is a kind of business card for his $20k for a two-hour \`motivational' speaking business; I think organizations should put that money to better use."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"As a corporate training manager, I look for practical tools that people can study and then use. We are using QBQ! as a component of our leadership training for new and experienced managers. So often managers blame their people instead of demonstrating humility by asking QBQs like &quot;How can I improve me?&quot; We've found that QBQ! gives a manager a real foundation for leading and managing better, while improving themselves. They are then also more receptive to skills training. There really is nothing else like QBQ! that gives people a specific way or method for getting rid of blame and victim thinking. We are now going corporate wide with this message."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed. First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20. The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best. The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Reading QBQ is not difficult. It can be done in less than two hours (time it takes to roll one's eyes included).The premise is that employees need to be responsible... for everything. If employees do not perform... it's their fault. The employer has no part in this. Employees need to stop making excuses, stop being lazy, stop procrastinating, stop pointing fingers, put up and shut up. Most important, employees need to stop asking questions. If they do ask questions, they need to answer it themselves by taking responsibility for their own impotence.This must be music to irresponsible managers ears that will be happy to hire the author to give two day courses. They have no part in it. It is the employees fault."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I read this book for the first time a little over a year ago. At the time, I tried to soak in the message, but since I thought it didn't really apply to me, I think it went in one ear and out the other, so to speak.Fast forward to today. This book is required reading for my work, and I read it a little more closely this time around. As it turns out, this little book is jam-packed with morsels of good advice. It's all about using a JFK-esque philosophy: ask not what your company can do you for you but what you can do for your company. You can insert almost any words you'd like to replace \\"company\\": team, client, etc. The whole point of the book is encouraging people to take a moment to think before placing blame. Instead, look in the mirror first and see if YOU can resolve the issue instead of passing the buck as we are so wont to do in this society."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"The book is thin and it is a simple read. My 6th grade daughter would understand every concept in the book. While this would all generally make for a low rating, I instead give it the highest rating. Why? Because although it does not present many original ideas, the vast population of American at least, do not follow the QBQ. If it takes a book that can be read in an hour and that can be understood by someone who reads at a 6th grade level for people to start taking responsibility for their actions and thier lives, then I am all for it.This is not to say that the only people who will benefit from this book are the young and irresponsible. Many of the points, while not rocket science, were new ways to look at old ideas and as the book says \\"repetition is the motor of learning.\\""},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Any organization planning an organization-wide change effort needs to have every single one of their employees read this book. It's an amazing quick read, simple but powerful. It puts the responsibility and accountability into the hands of the individual.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This is a \\"rewrite\\" of his first book, PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, published in 1998. He is the founder of QBQ Inc. in Denver. In 1995, he began speaking about this concept in workshops.People change, one at a time, through his/her own choices. Personal accountability (which he uses incessantly throughout this little book) is the power of one. It changes the world one choice at a time. Stress is sometimes the result of our choices.Communication is not just being understood but also understanding the other person. You need to discipline your thoughts and make better choices (another word he uses a lot!). When we are faced with frustration or a challenge, our first reaction is usually negative and defensive. Only through action is anything accomplished. Action requires courage and leads toward solutions. It builds confidence and brings learning and growth at all ages.Humility is the cornerstone of leadership. \\"Wisdom is what we learn after we know it all.\\" By the type of questions we ask others and ourselves, the world may become a far better place, without blame and negativity.I'm sure John Miller is a great workshop leader, like the one one from Chicago who taught me the difference between agression and submission at a PTA training session when I was still young (I have never been one for submission!), but this book is so simple. He is a graduate of Cornell University while my Alma Mater is Martin Methodist College in Middle Tennessee. What a vast difference, but I doubt his major was English. Mine wasn't either -- liberal arts. And it is getting a workout par excellence."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Of all the balanced, happy, consistently efficient and \\"most-popular-with-the-customer\\" team members I've been privileged to know, PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY was the single common factor in their achieving whatever personal and career goals they had. I've tried hard to copy the good examples I've met in my life and very much appreciate QBQ!'s positive and thought-provoking examples. It really is the definitive piece on PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. By learning to ask better questions - QBQs - we have changed the way we approach our customer both internal and external. Working for government, it is easy to place blame, procrastinate and complain - but for whatever reason, I'm not made that way. I do completely believe in accepting responsibility and the consequences of my actions. I believe that I've lived my life along the principles QBQ! teaches, however, seeing it framed in this context most certainly provides guidelines to the principles I believe in.I will reread the book since the author points the amazing value of repetition. I will strive to instill more of the QBQ! spirit when I find myself drifting, and believe I'll find myself enjoying a much more fulfilling career.The QBQ! book: Concise, quick, and lots of fun. And life-changing for sure. Very, very real - and works for people at all levels. Five stars!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"It's so true I can only change me! As a manager I have wasted countless days and much energy trying to \\"motivate\\" my people. It took a few years but I've learned the best approach is to ask the QBQ \\"How can I be a better coach?\\" and \\"What can I do to improve my leadership?\\" As the author John Miller says, when I ask these questions I'm not blaming, whining, or procrastinating but truly putting PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY into action. It also works for me as a parent: When I look to become a better father I can then model humility and reponsibility for my kids. It doesn't mean I stop parenting at home and managing at work, I just find that QBQ! the book and the concept helps me be a better person. I have read QBQ! 5 times AND own the audio book on Cd. It's great for the car. I want to make this part of my daily walk and I want to be a better leader and QBQ! is showing me how. Just a fantastic book all around!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ! is the answer to quit fooling yourself. This is possibly the best book I have read that can truly make a difference in our businesses and our lives! In some ways, it is a simple reminder of how you should approach many of life's situations. The DVD/facilitator lead training is the best training I've taken yet. We are training various teams within our organization. Truly on target to the problems facing me in business - and in my home life. By forcing each of us to look in the mirror, QBQ! is life changing. Rarely does one find so many pearls in one 55 minute read (the book). The chapters are short and I return to them over and over. Mr. Miller is so right - repetition is the key. As I have learned to use QBQ! and be more accountable, I find I solve problems more quickly and avoid the classic blame game. Also, by going to www.QBQ.com I've found even more info, some I get by email from QBQ, Inc. and some I can download on to my desk top. Don't miss their \\"QBQ! Panic Button\\" which provides pithy content straight from the book that I can put on my desktop and review thoughout the day to help me get through the day.

Whenever I find myself about to do the blame game, I take a step back and think about what I can do to change the situation.

The struggle to take personal responsibility in a culture of blame is real, and it's great to have a resource at-hand that inspires me to be at my best. QBQ is succinct, and I find that I can open it up to any chapter and spend 5 minutes reading a lesson and the accompanying short story - and I am left feeling empowered and focused on what *I* can do to better any situation."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Over the last 9 years I have picked up the QBQ at least once a year. Each time I do it sheds new light on how I can be personally accountable for my actions. When I first picked it up it was to help me in my place of work. Since then I have been able to apply the principles in this book to my own business, my marriage, my kids, and every other aspect of my life. This isn't a one time read. It's a book that you will pick up over and over again because of how quick, effective, and impactful it will be in your life. If you are struggling with being personally accountable to your actions you need to pick this book up and take it to heart. John's stories are compelling and will help you to easily implement the QBQ in your life. 5 stars all the way!"},{"Title":"QBQ!

I have shared this book with my family and with my co-workers. Once people stop playing the blame game and hiding behind a team, what happens is amazing!!! When a group of people who work together understand that each of us is reponsible for our own actions, and that each of us plays a role in the success of the team, and then really owns it, the sky is indeed the limit. Being accountable for your own actions, decisions, and even owning the mistakes is very empowering. When you are empowered, you can make the right decisions, for the right reasons, for an OUTSTANDING outcome. Don't just buy this book and read it.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I've been using QBQ in my training sessions for years. The message is clear and effective - don't waste your time trying to fix other people; focus on what YOU can do to improve all of the things you find fault with. The other five-start reviews here sum up the content exceptionally well.Also, John Miller is great to work with. I love calling the QBQ company expecting to speak to a CS rep and getting John personally picking up the phone. It makes my day!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. It really made me think about the way I perceive others, but especially myself. It took me about an hour and a half to read it (the first time), but I immediately found myself wanting to go back and re-read about some of the more relevant parts to me.Mr. Miller has really hit the nail on the head. He has showed us some of the typical questions we ask others and often hear in the workplace. He has used great examples to illustrate how we can be personally accountable for our thoughts and actions.I think this book is long overdue, and a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I believe in personal accountability. I think it is great someone has finally written a book about it. Accountability is the key that takes values from the preferred to the real level. Its challenging, but exciting! We are living in a society that lacks personal accountability. Take a look at the legal system that is bogged down with civil law suits trying to place the blame on someone. I want to change what I can and that is me. I also want to spread the word about how much happier I am now that I apply the QBQ! to my life. I don't worry near as much. I have less stress in my life. Over-all my life at work and at home is more enjoyable. QBQ! has done that for me. I just received a promotion into middle management at my workplace, and have already made mistakes asking what the author calls \\"IQs\\" or Incorrect Questions instead of The Question Behind the Question or \\"QBQs\\"! I am so glad I found this book early in my management career so I can begin to do things the QBQ! way instead! I will read & re-read many times. I know our lives are lived through the choices we make. We therefore are responsible and accountable for our choices, the results of our choices and ultimately the consequnces of our actions. QBQ! is helping me make better choices. Absolutely Five Stars all the way!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"If only this fundamental and powerful message of personal responsibility was taken seriously by our world, we can only imagine what it would be like to live in a world like that! This book is fantastic! QBQ! showed me exactly HOW TO practicing personal accountbility by asking better questions of myself. I heard the author on the Dave Ramsey show and he is dynamic and the content is practical. I've already read QBQ! 3 times in 3 days and I will \\"return to the well\\" every time I feel myself about to blame, whine, procrastinate and point fingers. Personal accountability, as the author points out, is the better path! Fun read."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Finally, a book without funny characters and parables. One with excellent content that can be applied. QBQ! not only made meAWARE of the need for more personal accountability in my life at home and at work, but it showed me HOW to do it. Refreshing!Miller helped me understand that too often I play victim by asking questions like \\"Why doesn't my company train me more?\\" and \\"When is someone going to clarify my job?\\" I've learned to pause and simply ask \\"What can I do to develop myself?\\" and \\"How can I adapt to change?\\" This is a book that won't let you down. It took me an hour to read ... and then I read it again - twice. Each time I picked up something new. Really enjoyed it ... and then I bought copies for my team and now we're studying it together. Our training department is now using it for everyone! And I'm proud to say I found it first."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ! really give some meaty solutions to the problems of blame, victim thinking, and procrastination. It's a quick read with short chapters which I just love. I am able to reread the book or just a few chapters and immediately go use the content on the job. It teaches how to ask questions that enable one to practice personal accountability and how to take ownership. It also makes me aware of what questions to not ask. So much that happens at work requires a response of accountability - not blame and finger pointing. Clearly we need our politicians to ready this book. Unlike many popular biz books that just provide parables and fictional story lines, QBQ! provides a tremendous &quot;how to&quot; so it can become part of my daily walk. The supporting stories are fun and real life."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"A co-worker had been given the book by someone and she thought it was perfect for her team. I read it on the plane (a wonderfully easy and quick read). I, too, thought it would be perfect for my direct reports and others at our company. It just makes sense and it gives individuals a sense of empowerment when facing times of change and challenge - a constant in corporate America. Personal accountability is so critical and QBQ! shows us how to live it each day!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book will help you think wisely and clearly and help you maintain integrity in who you are and what you do.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Excellent Read !!! . . . chock full of examples we can all identify with, and ideas we can act on immediately. I ordered a box, and shared this terrific book with every business colleague on my Christmas list. Now my entire circle of influence is asking better questions, and we're all enjoying the fruits of practicing Personal Accountability. I'm not waiting for the next holiday though - - I want everyone I work with, and everyone I care about to have this wonderful tool. Thank You Mr. Miller!"},{"Title":"QBQ!

It's a self-coaching style book that reiterates to our &quot;not me&quot; culture, too take ownership of getting the job done. Buy it, read it, repeat and share!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I have loved this book for some time! I feel so strongly about the message of QBQ that I carry copies in my car to give to people! In my work as a leader in a nonprofit organization, working with folks who struggle with addictions, personal accountability is one of the most important keys for people who want to get better and John Miller does a great job explaining this using real-life examples and with practical ideas for application. But the biggest indication of how impactful this book is came in a meeting I had with a successful businessman I barely knew.When I visited him at his office on his desk were two books, the Bible and John Miller's QBQ! When I asked him about QBQ he said it had changed both he and his employees. He gave every one of them a copy and then asked them to write a one page essay on how they could implement some of the practical suggestions of QBQ's personal accountability into their lives. He thought the response of his staff to the book had been remarkable and that it was translating into a more customer friendly work place where people thought more of others than they did themselves. I would call that high praise for a book that packs a powerful punch into its 115 pages!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"An easy but engaging read that most people can get through in less than 2 hours. John Miller addresses the poor attitude that most people have - \\"I wasn't trained for this...\\", \\"If only the company would provide me __, I'd be a great salesman...\\" and other excuses we throw in the way of our own success. Miller's ideas are basic, but timeless attitudes of doing whatever is in our power to succeed, taking initiative to fix problems we come across instead of admiring them, and our charisma is what we are selling - not a product or service. Great book, I've started asking the people who work for me to read and benefit from the ideas within."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I learned a long time ago, the value of a book is not determined by it's size (QBQ is only 115 pages), nor by how long it takes to read (QBQ can be read in about an hour), and not even by the number pages where you make notes in the margins (my copy of QBQ is only marked on a few pages) but the real value of a book should be determined by what you learn from it. When I finish a book, I ask myself, Will I grow from what I've learned? Was the time I invested here well spent? How will I alter what I do because of this book? My personal creed is to be a better person today than I was yesterday, so the most important question is, will I become a better person because of this book?QBQ: THE QUESTION BEHIND THE QUESTION, by John G. Miller passed all of my criteria for being a \\"must read\\" type book. The primary message here is two-fold; personal accountability and ask better questions to get better answers. Sounds simple right? Let me give you a real life example to expand the principle.I recently had a store manager and her entire staff out with the flu and pulled personnel from other stores to fill in. It turned into one giant fiasco when the stores printer went down, their operating software went down. And even the fax quit working. It was a perfect storm and the mistakes that took place were colossal.My initial questions included \\"Who is responsible\\", \\"Why did you do this\\", and \\"When will I ever find capable people?\\" Had I read this book a few weeks earlier, my questions would have been much different. What can I do to prevent something like this from ever happening again? Or, How can I use this to improve our training program?We live in a \\"finger-pointing\\" world. We put more focus on placing blame (or protecting ourselves from it) than on finding solutions. To find those solutions without placing blame, our questions should begin with \\"What\\" or \\"How\\" (not \\"Why\\", \\"When\\", or \\"Who\\"). To reinforce personal accountability, our questions should contain \\"I\\" (not \\"they\\", \\"them\\", \\"we\\", or \\"you\\"). Finally, our question must focus on action. \\"What can I do\\" is a perfect example.Yes, the book is small. Yes, it only takes about an hour to read. Yes, you really do need to read it."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"The author keeps it brief and direct, but he hits the nail on the head. Time to quit pointing the finger at everyone else and get to work. If I owned my own company, I would make this mandatory reading for all my employees."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This was one of the best book purchases I have made in a long time. Easy reading, honest, and relatable. I would recomend this book to anyone looking to improve your personal accountability. It is funny after you read the book, you are able to pick the people out that have personal accountability and take ownership - with that said, you can also pick those people out who choose not to as well. Great investment!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"When a friend handed me this book, I thought to myself, Great, just what I need, another CHEESE in my life. To be polite, I thumbed through the first chapter...and never looked back. I used to think books had to be long to be helpful, but in the first 25 pages I knew all I needed to in order to turn around my attitudes and ways of approaching problems. Now I use the QBQ and things get done. And it has caught on with my colleagues (because I made them all read it too)!"},{"Title":"QBQ!

I know I do as a professor and teacher."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"A friend of mine told me that his company was having phenomenal results using QBQ in its sales training and suggested I check out the book. I read it in about an hour---its precepts are simple and practical, and what is amazing is that they ACTUALLY work! Kudos to Miller. We are now employing QBQ in our customer service training and we hope to expand its use to other divisions in the coming year."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I loved the QBQ and highly recommend it to all. Personal accountability is a term that seems to be used often, but understood by few. The QBQ clearly shows you how to take personal accountability -- by asking the right questions. By framing your questions the right way, you will avoid creating more problems by blaming others and instead deal with the real issues head on.If you are a manager, a parent, a teacher, or anyone that is in a leadership position, this book is for you."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"...This book is not a heavy read. Finished it in an hour and a half on plane with a meal. It heavily uses annecdotes to make it point. The gist of what it talks about is how you frame your question impacts your outcome. Many people frame their questions in the first person (I or me)and in the reference of victimhood, e.g. &quot;Why does (fill in the blank) happen to me?&quot;Through the annecdotes, the author tries to teach you to frame questions that empower people to take charge and responsibility for their actions and situations.This is a good book for managers and subordinates."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Personal accountability through the medium of questions is exquisitely executed in this timeless treasure. This is a book you will keep on your bookshelf for your children. This book earns 5 stars. Additionally, I strongly recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, another timeless, universal resource, which provides the questions necessary to be our best, maximize and situation, and bring out the best in others. By asking the best questions to invite the best answers, we can truly make the most of our careers and our lives."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"The quality of the questions we ask determines the quality of our results. If we ask mediocre questions we invite mediocre solutions and if we ask extraordinary questions, we invite extraordinary solutions. This book asks good questions, but the questions are supoptimal. ie they leave room for unexplored alternatives and do not lead us directly to the best solution.The best book on the market on this topic is Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman, Ph.D., where the reader is provided with relevant Optimal questions, and learns how to formulate and ask the best questions to invite the best possible solutions."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"The author is well intentioned, and apparently has a good training background behind him.But anyone who has been through any corporate training program knows that the trainers have a highlevel understanding of business operations, not a deep understanding of how to execute.There are no 'Wows' in this book only the meandering story tellings of someone with alot of miles under his belt...and a business to promote, QBQ.The book has simplisting examples and the writing style is pleasant, but void of any depth in business execution and analysis."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This quick and easy read is a life-skills book suitable for ordinary and extra-ordinary people, professionals, non-professionals, basically people of all ages. Unlike many other books on the market today that are trendy, this book is a &quot;timeless&quot; treasure with a practical, common sense approach. In most corporations, personal accountability is one of the top 10 core competencies, and the QBQ! book, together with its support tools (licensing agreement, training program, posters, etc.) provide the foundational pieces for organizations to create the culture of &quot;personal accountability&quot;; it cannot be mandated. Organizations need to embrace the notion of &quot;flying the plane differently&quot; (Stacey's story, page 28), and provide the environment for employees to translate this concept into their daily work life.From a personal viewpoint, QBQ! helps individuals deal with change in their life and eliminate victim thinking that holds people back from being their best. QBQ! provides the &quot;how to&quot; steps to have a peaceful and successful life.Key themes that support both corporate as well as personal success include &quot;How do I let go of that which I cannot control?&quot;, and &quot;I can only change me.&quot; This little book has helped me tremendously both as a business person/consultant in my work, and personally. I am so glad I discovered it. Others I have shared this book with have told me it has &quot;changed their life&quot;. A must read, and one that you will want to share with others."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book has some of the most irreverent, misleading quotes, and practices I have ever heard.We have all heard the maxim \\" think outside of the box\\".This guy uses sound bites like \\" succeed in the box\\"Basically this book tells how to blame yourself for what others fail to do.This to me is standard \\"Management 101\\" or how to make your employees improve your business with out giving them what they need to succeed.Kind of a \\"if you don't have a hammer you can always use your fist\\" type mentality.I imagine this guy makes a lot of money on the talk circuit easing the management conscience.repeat after me.....\\" the company is always right\\".Now don't get me wrong .I'm all for self improvement, and great customer service.But I also believe the truth will set you free and laying blame where is belongs.As a businessman I believe \\"everyone is a customer\\".You workers are your customer, and you are (if you have one) your bosses customer.If you see your workers as customers you will no doubt treat them as they should be.Just my opinion."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book is founded on the idea of personal accountability. Unfortunately, the random collection of parables and stories does little to advance the premise. Ideas are presented in a one-dimentional fashion deviod of any real depth of analysis and only a very few tools.The book is packaged in a palatable feel-good package which will make it ripe for the plucking for corporate management looking for the next &quot;Who moved my cheese&quot; or &quot;Emotional Intellegence.&quot;Bottom line - the book is simple common sence. The message? Stop playing the complain and blame game, take responsibility for your actions, make your own choices, and get on with your life.I have to belive that the reviewers who are rating this as &quot;the best read ever&quot; have a woefully small library. I do think that the premise of the book is very valid, however the book is more fluff than substance.Sidebar:If you are interested in the personal actions that help with following a path of personal accountability, I suggest you look at the ideas behind Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) which gives you a working model of how to apply the ideas of personal accountability to your own thinking."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ is a quick read but is loaded with powerful thoughts to challenge you to grow in your work, home and social life. Essentially QBQ is about personal accountability. The author, John Miller, has built an entire personal development system around the idea that we should focus on what we can do to improve performance at work or relationships with our kids, not on what others should be doing to improve or accomplish any given objective. The concept is incredibly simple and is presented that way in QBQ. Nevertheless, it is very foreign to many of us in post-modern America.If you find yourself hitting walls in your life or being frustrated with others, QBQ will teach you a new way of thinking that will wipe away much of that frustration. This book is especially powerful for people who work in teams or organizations where \\"people problems\\" are the greatest hinderance to achieving goals and/or being happy while trying."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Don't be fooled by the book's deceptively simple proposition: QBQ! is a masterpiece of practical insight that will help you become more effective in your work and happier in your life. The author offers you a simple set of guidelines that really work to help bring a sense of personal accountability to your life. I hate to sound like an informercial, but after only a few days of using the approach laid out in QBQ, I was getting more done and getting more out of life--I stopped moping around and wondering when good things were going to start happening to me, and I started making them happen. The chapters are a nice mix of inspiring stories and devastatingly simple truths. The book will only take you an hour or so to read, but once you put it down you'll never look at your life the same way again. After I read it, I gave it to my wife, and she gave it to her colleagues. I think that one copy has made it all the way through her department by now!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I am a very busy professional and mother and this book is excellent because it has short quick chapters I can easily read on my daily comute. Don't be decieved by the chapter size though, because the words each chapter contains are mighty. Every chapter gives me plenty to self reflect upon and new ideas to start putting into actions. I got this to boost my career and got the added bonus of it bringing new life to my marriage too! Love the Book."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This is one of the worst self help books I have ever read. It states that \\"QBQ works because it's based on the truth \\"I can only change me\\". This statement is a complete falsehood. While I am responsible for my actions, what I do can influence, and change, the behavior of others. In the new right-wing politically correct environment we are in this book might make people feel good, but it offers nothing in terms of new ways of thinking, tools one can use to improve oneself, or ways to figure out how to improve a process. It requires no effort and results in no paradigm shifts in thinking. It runs counter to most Lean Manufacturing ideas and methods if one is working in a production environment. Stick with \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" if you are really looking to do some soul searching."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"i really don't know why people love this book so much. it has about 1 real page worth of advice, with the rest being stories and platitudes. it basically says that in all cases, even where other people clearly drop the ball, you should do your best. one other review that states \\"Basically this book tells how to blame yourself for what others fail to do\\" is exactly right. there's got to be a better way to approach the topic of accountability without being such a doormat."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I found QBQ to be very elementary reading. I read the book in an hour and found a couple of tidbits worth remembering. I was very disappointed overall in the book. For a manager looking for ideas it was little more than trite, rah, rah material. Because of the ease of reading and time spent reading it, you may find it worthwhile."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"After reading this book, I decided to purchase it for my entire team. Now we are all on the same page when we talk about accountability and taking personal responsibility. I found it very useful for myself as I didn't realize how often I played the \\"blame game\\". A great tool for any team who likes to point fingers at others."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Each employee at our manufacturing consulting firm receives a copy of QBQ! to read. We have a short dialogue and its contents are referenced daily. Every time I listen to Miller's \\"book on tape\\" CD or re-read QBQ!, something new hits home. I have shared these books as gifts with employees and friends and with my family as well. From my wife to each of the four children ages 22 to 14. It makes a difference at all levels and now Flipping the Switch, Miller's new book, is also wonderful and being read by all!These books are not just for business and reading them once is not enough. Depending on the day, the circumstances, or even a new client, the basic sense of Miller's content is simply priceless. I now provide a personal copy of QBQ! to all our employees, and will be doing so with Flipping the Switch soon. When I meet a new client and they have not been exposed to QBQ, I give one away. It is so important to me to get this information out to all people because it is \\"simple and easy\\" to apply and better yet - it works. Personal accountability is such a perfect message. Thanks to John Miller for writing these little gems. One of our clients has had every single person read QBQ! From the President/CEO to the frontline employees everyone knows what QBQ! is. It is referenced constantly. This firm is between their second and third year of implementing LEAN manufacturing. They have been very wise about their LEAN Journey, applying what is necessary, staying focused and moving forward efficiently in most areas. QBQ! helps them keep the blame and victim thinking out of their culture."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book contains alot of common sense guidance on how to practice personal accountability. Like all books like this, your first instinct is to say \\"I need to give this book to my employees, spouse, brother, etc.\\" However, this book isn't about changing others, but about changing yourself, the one person whom you have any control over.I especially enjoyed the direction given on asking the right questions, often substituting \\"I\\" for \\"we\\", \\"you\\", \\"they\\", etc. This book gives good guidance on common sense leadership principles that I find especially useful which redirects you from the natural tendency to look for scapegoats rather than search for solutions, a common problem in many organizations.A very good little book that gives sound advice regardless who you are and what responsibilities you are faced with."},{"Title":"QBQ!

This book is a fast read (about an hour max) and I keep it with me. I pick it up and refer to specific chapters to helps me with certain issues. QBQ! and its core content on Personal Accountability can, should and will help me solve 80% of the problems I face at work. It's a great, common-sense book, but we all know common sense is very uncommon. If we all took responsiblility for what we did, first thinking about how we would like to be treated in the same situation, we might be able to avoid other issues that crop up. I know I don't live it to my best potential every day, but with consistency, I try to do my best every day.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Author John G. Miller admonishes people to quit whining! Miller advocates personal accountability, an almost novel concept in today's litigious world of finger pointing, excuse making and not-my-fault thinking. Instead of asking, \\"Why is this happening to me?\\" he says to ask, \\"What can I do to improve my situation?\\" Miller calls this the \\"QBQ, the Question Behind the Question.\\" When you ask such questions you become less of a victim, and put yourself more in control, empowered to improve your life and contribute to the success of your organization. Miller entertains and explains by using examples and uplifting stories culled from his personal experience. His easy-to-grasp theory is fairly one-dimensional and in the banquet of self-help books, it is more of an appetizer than an entr&eacute;e. Yet, if you want a quick bite of applicable self-improvement advice and don't mind a bit of a scolding, we recommend this tasty treat."},{"Title":"QBQ!

I have led many different teams throughout those years mostly in the emergency department. How I wish the QBQ had been written when I first started. John G. Miller has hit the heart of many organizations by capturing his understanding that organizations are made of people and those people hold the organizations success in thier hands. He then encourages the readers by not dismissing the hard issues they face today, but, to instead, learn to embrace new ways of thinking that will propel them to greater success than they knew before. His practical insights have become a tool I use with all my managment teams to challenge our ways of thinking and I also use it as a tool as well as when consulting with other organziations.One of my employees made the statement \\"John makes the book fun to read and hard to put down\\".I have had experiances where every department seemed to fall back into a \\"silo\\" as mentioned in chapter 15 or \\"protective cocoon\\" when hard times pressed in upon us. It was one thing to fight the regulatory requirements and competitors but to be fighting each other at the same time was just exhausting. We had become what he describes as the \\"victim\\" in chapter 5. The QBQ was the \\"instrument of choice\\" to assist us in breaking down those silos by learning to ask the correct questions and confront the negatives we were allowing ourselves to feel and placing us back in charge of our destiny.My management teams love the QBQ and share it with new employees as well. I have given this book a 5 because it truly helps people and organizations move forward."},{"Title":"QBQ!

By the time he had retrieved his luggage, I had made the decision to buy a dozen copies to share with each member in my department.

I like the stories. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I was reading QBQ! on a Saturday afternoon and my wife was trying to redeem credit card reward points from a Bank through Internet. My wife was not a computer-savvy person. She tried but she was not able to do so. She chose another alternative to redeem the points by phone. Later on she found out redeem over the phone deducted more points than it would through Internet. She said to me that \\"You did not help me because you are busy reading\\". I responded to her that she was demonstrating the exact \\"victim thinking\\" behavior mentioned in QBQ! and blaming me for what she did. I said to her that what she needed to to was to take personal accountability and solve the problem now. I am so happy that she quickly did - She called back the bank's customer service over the phone and explained what happened. Result - She was able to negotiate for renewing the credit card without the subscription fee. What a powerful and immediate application of the concept that we learned from QBQ! and what a big difference it made! In my work environment, I am sure our global project team would benefit from learning QBQ!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This is a quick read book, probably one hour max. I used to use &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; to help organizations deal with change and have now incorporated QBQ! instead. It has a very simple, but powerful concept. 1. All questions begin with &quot;What&quot; or &quot;How&quot; 2. All contain an &quot;I&quot; 3. All focus on Action. Eg. &quot;How can I today make a difference? or &quot;How can I contribute to a solution?&quot; Some real examples of people, both personally, and in companies using these concepts adds a real dimension to it.

It is a relatively brief read, but will stimulate a depth of thoughtful discussion and growth in the area of personal responsibility like nothing else I have ever seen or read. As someone who trains others for a living, I can honestly say that QBQ! is much more than a book...it's a way of looking at life that will create positive change in anyone who adopts the philosophies and methods presented."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"In The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in Business and in Life, John G. Miller presents an alternative way to look at our problems (or challenges) and encourages us to ask different, but better questions about them. In doing so, our efforts should have better results, our lives should be more rewarding, and others (e.g., customers, superiors, coworkers, subordinates, and family) should win as well. A wide body of research does concur with Miller, in that how we frame our problems and how we talk about them affects our well-being and our level of accomplishment.Miller starts off by illustrating incorrect questions (IQ's). IQ's focus on things or people outside or external to us. Some examples might be \\"When will he learn to manage better?\\", \\"Why can't they see my point-of-view?\\", \\"Why can't they hire better workers?\\". IQ's tend to sap our energy and deflate our spirit.IQ's do, however, seem to come naturally, perhaps as a result of human nature. Miller often asks groups of people what's the one thing they would like to change in their organizations. The answers always follow the external P's: that is, change the policies, procedures, prices, and other people. \\"Nobody ever says me.\\" As an example, look at the following questions and see what is the first response that comes to mind.-A poor subordinate blames the _____.-A poor executive blames the _____.-A poor driver blames the _____.-A poor church member blames the _____.Although these thoughts or questions may be natural, they lead us into blame, complaining, and procrastination. Miller's solution is to discipline our thoughts and to look behind our initial questions to come up with better questions-or, as he terms it, the question behind the question (QBQ).In practice, when incorrect questions pop into our head, we have the control to make a choice: we can either accept or reject the questions. The better choice is to ask more personally accountable questions, such as \\"What can I do today?\\", \\"How can I help my organization right now?\\", or \\"How can I assist my wife (mom, dad, daughter, son, etc.)?\\". The key, therefore, is to make better choices and decisions in the moment by asking better questions.Miller presents a nice framework for QBQ's. These are his three guiding principles for better questions or QBQ's. Better questions:1. \\"Begin with what or how (not why, when or who).\\"2. \\"Contain I (not they, we, or you).\\"3. \\"Focus on action.\\"A perfect example of a QBQ is \\"What can I do right now?\\" The essence of the QBQ system is that \\"the answers are in the questions\\". If you ask the right question you can make positive moves toward achievement and a rewarding life.Miller gives many examples of incorrect questions or incorrect questioning. Some of those are as follows:*Don't ask why. Questions such as \\"Why is this happening to me?\\" or \\"Why don't others do their share?\\" leave one powerless and a victim of the environment. This victim thinking leads to a diminished sense of control and more stress. As we feel we have less control over our lives we experience greater levels of stress.*Don't ask when. Questions such as \\"When will they do something about it?\\" puts the ball into other people's courts-we have no choice but to wait. When questions lead to procrastination, feeling overwhelmed, and again, more stress. A better, question behind the question, would be \\"What steps can I take right now?\\" As Miller states, \\"the answers are all in asking the right questions.\\"*Don't ask who. Questions such as \\"Who caused the problem?\\" or \\"Who did this?\\" lead to a search for scapegoats and someone to blame. These questions solve nothing and create barriers, resentment, and miscommunication. Questions such as \\"How can I improve this situation?\\" or \\"What can I do so this doesn't happen again?\\" are more appropriate QBQ's.Miller notes that one of today's popular phrases is \\"Think outside the box\\" in order to be more creative and solve problems. He notes, however, that QBQ thinking helps us to \\"succeed inside the box\\"-to reach our goals within our current system and circumstances. Every organization has deficiencies and finite resources. QBQ's help us to do more with less. A good \\"succeed inside the box\\" question is \\"What can I do with what I have?\\".The book concludes with a list of lousy questions and the better QBQ's or questions behind the questions. These are organized into different departments within organizations and/or different life situations. A brief sample follows.The sales department:\\"Why are our prices so high?\\"\\"When are we going to get some new products?\\"\\"Why can't we get better customer service support?\\"QBQ's:\\"What can I do today to be more effective?\\"\\"How can I add value for my customers?\\"The management:\\"When am I going to get better people?\\"\\"Why aren't my workers more motivated?\\"\\"Why do they keep making the same mistakes?\\"QBQ's:\\"How can I be a more effective coach?\\"\\"What can I do to help them do their job better?\\"One' spouse:\\"Why doesn't he/she let go of that old issue?\\"\\" When will he/she appreciate me more?\\"\\"When will he/she stick to his/her fitness plan?\\"QBQ's:\\"How can I understand his/her perspective better?\\"\\"What can I do to help him/her out?\\"To summarize, \\"The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in Business and Life\\" presents some very useful concepts in a highly readable format. In it, John G. Miller provides some basic, yet powerful ideas about creating a more rewarding and fulfilling life."},{"Title":"QBQ!

QBQ! truly works and more people need to stop blaming others and take accountability into their own hands to improve their own and others lives. It is all about what you can do for yourself and others not what others can do for you. I have recommended QBQ! to numerous clients, and just shared one of the QBQ! success stories I got from QBQ.com in my weekly ezine. It excites me because it is the ultimate way to put people back in charge of their lives (no we don't control what happens to us, yes, we do control how we respond to what happens to us!).

My language and attitude became much more sensitive and positive. I actually began to realize how negative I was speaking.This little book is really quite deceiving in how powerful it is.!! I will probably use it to open meetings by reading selected chapters ( average of 2 pages)not for motivation as much as for introspective personal evaluation.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"\\"Infantile\\" is the best word I can think of when describing this book. Ramsey seems to imply that great and wonderful things will happen just by following his advice. This is pure and utter nonsense. Sure, maybe if EVERYONE followed his advice, the world would be a better place, and we'd have world peace. But people aren't like that. This will sound cynical, but here it is... If you take the initiative to satisfy the customer by doing someone else's job for them, you may find yourself doing their job forever, while they sit around and do nothing.I thoroughly enjoyed his story about the Home Depot cashier, reaching into her own pocket to pay for a small sale rather than send the customer's $100 bill back to the vault for change. Yes, the customer brought all his business to Home Depot. But what's the rest of the story? Did Home Depot manage to keep that customer for the long term, or did they do their normal job and end up losing that customer's loyalty after a few months? Clearly, all of Home Depot doesn't act like that cashier, and while her actions may have attracted a customer, Home Depot's actions eventually lost that customer. So, tell me, what was gained?This book reminded me of \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\", which was another pseudo-management book which holier-than-thou managers give to their underlings in a vain attempt to inspire them to act in a way which the managers will never choose for themselves. (BTW, I am a manager.) This genre of books preaches the magic of kittens and rainbows. In reality, their only purpose is to give authors a product to sell, and a venue to preach their stupidity, all that the incredible expense of corporations who think \\"this book will solve all our problems!\\"Don't waste your money.

I'd recommend this book to any professional who is seeking to understand how to be effective in a constantly changing environment."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I found QBQ through Dave Ramsey's radio program. Dave is the Financial Peace guru and author of The Total Money Makeover. I am a big Ramsey fan and I figured if QBQ was mandatory reading for his staff then it should be for me and my team as well. QBQ is a quick read and when actually put into practice can have a dramatic impact on one's personal and professional life. Unfortunately, many people will miss its profound implications because of its simplicity. The fact is, if you're like me, you have very little time to learn new concepts much less put them into practice. If so, you're going to love QBQ. This is something that is simple enough to absorb quickly and practical enough to use every day! As a VP for a large organization I cannot think of a better culture to develop than one of Personal Accountability. It's the one concept that brings everything else to life. QBQ is the real deal when it comes to making Personal Accountability a core value in your life. I would also recommend Flipping the Switch by Miller which takes QBQ even further."},{"Title":"QBQ!

I immediately knew I had to have it. For anyone who knows me, you know I've struggled at time with various aspects of my life. Most notably my career choices and my weight. Over the past year, I've made some strides but know I have a long way to go.QBQ basically summed things up for me. It's all about personal accountability. In this country, we have so many freedoms and opportunities. I strongly believe that regardless of your background, one can accomplish almost anything. There have been many jobs I've had where I've placed blame on others rather than doing my best. I've went about making suggestions the wrong way. If I ask questions that start with \\"What, or How\\" rather than \\"Why, When, or Who\\" I'll go a lot farther in life. This book gives many examples of how that can be achieved.

John backs up his insights with examples that we can all relate to. It's not a magic pill or mysterious tonic. What QBQ is, is a set of guideline for living your life to the fullest based upon the conscious choices you make and asking better questions that focus on the \\"how and what I can do\\" and not the victimization questions that begin with \\"why, when and who.\\" The book is a quick read, but the changes are up to you to implement. John goes beyond the book by providing his readers with a website the supports the QBQ way. I've already seen positive changes in how I deal with family, friends and business associates.

Now how many of our managers would be willing to do that for us? On a regular basis? On a daily basis?I rest my case: Managers are part of the problem with customer service.Most bosses exempt themselves from the principles they teach. They use books like this to extort and guilt-trip employees into increasing customer service. However, most employees can see through all of this.[...]So to the book. Anything that forces us to change ourselves for the better is good. This books forces you to examine your motives, and to look at why you are raising the issues that you do. Not all question are equal: some are faulty, some are \\"loaded,\\" some are leading, and some are misleading.This book reminds me of a \\"Chicken Soup For Socrates' Soul.\\" The idea is to question your own questioning. We need to look at our motives for raising questions. Questions are not neutral: they can shed light, but it can also spread darkness.Fundamentally, it is a call to drop the hypocrisy, and the sanctimoniousness we put on. We are one-person wrecking crews, but we do it under a cloak of communication.

This system changes the typical attitude found in today's work place. By using QBQ! everyone wins. Personal accountability and asking the QBQ! helps me to feel more empowered. When I feel empowered I live a happier life. We can go around blaming others for our problems but if we don't realize that we have to take responsibility for making a difference then who will? We can't control other people. The only thing we can control is ourselves and our response to others. If everyone sat around waiting for someone else to respond to what needs to be done then nothing will get done. I truly believe that problems in the workplace, at home and in our nation would be reduced significantly if like the author John Miller says, we just asked, \\"What can I do to resolve this problem?\\" QBQ! is important because it focuses individuals on how they can change and improve themselves and their workplace."},{"Title":"QBQ!

It is an absolutely excellent book that is a quick read and contains very little fluff. It gets to the point - I am responsible - not my boss, my spouse, my kid, or my poor lot in life. I really like how the book is done. Short, real life stories are excellent ways to demonstrate how our society has tended to influence us to shed our responsiblities and sue the first person we find. I had an experience the other day on an flight that mirrored one described in the book - took the time to thank the flight attendent for taking personal accountabilty and told her about the book. She doesn't need it but she tells me some coworkers might!It is about time someone wrote a book that gets us all to refocus on the only person we can change - ourselves.QBQ! will change the way you look at things.

Books like 'Many Lives,Many Masters', 'The Seat Of The Soul', and the biography on Colin Powell and Nelson Mandela have set me on a spiritual path, searching for my purpose in life. I had little clarity as far as my professional career was concerned, until I read QBQ. Little did I know, my spiritual growth is linked to my professional development, if they are not parallel to each other.I truly believe John Miller was referring to me as he wrote QBQ for I was the procrascinator, the complainer, the person suffering from 'victimits', and on the way to be overcome by stress/ulcer. Having read QBQ (easily read in just one night) and believing in the message (because it is common sense!!!), I have found myself not only practicing personal accountability but influencing my colleagues as well as my senior managers to experience reading this extraordinary book. Who would ever believe this? Not I for I am my biggest critic. At times I wonder who am I, and who am I becoming. I cant wait to see who will I be.I praise John Miller for his dynamic and self awareness revelation. I thank John Miller for his inspiration in the QBQ, which is bringing me closer to my purpose in life. I truly believe that personal accountability is the anchor to humility, the cornerstone of Leadership in business and in our personal life. It is the foundation of teamwork and diversity.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"John Miller's intuitive perspective on the art of personal accountability answers the questions many organizations have about how they should go about maximizing productivity.Simply stated, personal accountability leads to a warm & fuzzy feeling of ownership, which in turn enhances employee engagment & morale. The end result is an internally driven stimulis package, without the crippling effect on federal government deficits.In other words, under these conditions, everyone will lead a better life, and most importantly, businesses can get back on track again and become far greater profit making organizations.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I've read this book at least five times now. As a career professional ranging from higher education to corporations, no one is immune to the \\"blame game\\" of he did it/she did it or better yet, \\"they\\" did it.Much time and emotional energy is spent on blaming others for problems, frustrations, and anger. This also spans into our personal lives.QBQ address the crux of the matter or what I feel is truly choice. Many people do not feel that they have choice or that they need to deal with the deck of cards they've been handed. The reality is that all of us have a choice on how to act or react in any given situation.QBQ takes the premise of choice and places into a framework that takes blame language into positive, actionable language where one can take charge of a situation. Instead of who did it or why did \\"they\\" cut our budget, an appropriate rephrase might be \\"how can I help this situation?\\"This book is a very easy read, half hour tops and is good to come back to again and again.

In the rank and file, it causes poor execution; among executive leadership, it devastates morale and leads to musical chairs for those beneath them.This book is a quick read; perhaps two hours, and offers an excellent antidote to this lack of accountability. The next time you begin whining, restructure your complaint so that it:1. Begins with WHAT or HOW, and not Why, When, or Who.2. Contains the pronoun: I3. Focuses on an Action.When am I going to get some sales help? becomes: What can I do today to be more effective?Why does management just not get it? becomes: How can I communicate better?Who is going to help me? becomes: What can I do to gain more support?The quality of the questions we ask determines the quality of our results. The more we focus on our own behaviors (which we control) the less we concern ourselves with the behavior of others (over which we have no control.

Mostly because it's stuff I've long believed, lived, espoused.

Anyone who has any experience with yoga, who has entered into that philosophy needs no further explanation.Well done to Mr. Miller; this is a great contribution not just to the business world, not just to the self-help community, but to society at large; what's here is the sort of 'enlightenment' that was 'common sense and good manners' a century ago.Namast&eacute;.Personal rating: 9/10 (I'd have appreciated some more illustrations.)"},{"Title":"QBQ!

It was refreshing for us to hit the \\"reset\\" on our personal accountability with each other and our students. It certainly can spring board into deeper discussions and processes but you have to have a start some where!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book counters the prevailing mindset of blaming others in today's culture. Most people have witnessed when churches do poorly, whatever is judged to be poor, typically this is a decline in numbers or contribution, there is a mindset to look for the problem or person to blame. Often the mentality is to assign blame to someone or some group. Typically the elders will blame the minister, the minister will blame the elders, and around and around we go. This book deals with this issue of blame. Instead of asking who, we are to ask \\"what can I do to help the attendance, or \\"How can I be more evangelistic.\\" The book deals with taking responsibility for situations. The easy solution is to blame, the mature solution is to fix the problem yourself. This is a quick book to read, and the message is a great reminder to us all."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Picked up this book based on a recommendation by Dave Ramsey. The concept in QBQ is an important one. How to stop thinking like a victim. I think the process/technique that Miller lays out is very well thought out and will definitely impact the way I think about and react to negative people, events, situations, etc. However, I was hoping for a little more meat. The book was small to begin with and when you open it up it also has somewhat large print. It took me about 45 minutes to read the entire thing. Great message and an excellent tool to use in your everyday life...but like Chinese food...it leaves you wanting more after you are finished."},{"Title":"QBQ!

I really enjoy inspirational books, especially quick and easy reads as QBQ is. I like to think that, for the most part, I am a positive person who likes to help other people. However, I don't do or think that way all the time. This book gives the reader a great way to be able to think about how they can make a difference in all situations, just by asking questions and asking them in a specific way that will result in the biggest impact. It is so simple and easy to do. Using it will change the reader's attitude as well as those around them.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I like to collect books I've read as a sort of \\"badge of honor\\". But, they usually end up collecting dust after the first read. However, QBQ is different. I was amazed the first time I read it because, yes, it contains some \\"common sense\\" concepts, but they're presented in such an articulate and entertaining way that they really send the points home. So many stories simply make me smile.I felt a profound change in my demeanor and attitude after reading this book because it really made me examine the way I thought and interacted with others. And every 6 to 12 months or so, I'll start feeling like I'm blaming others for things more than I should. I'll pick up QBQ and read a few chapters (or just the whole thing again!) and will feel \\"refreshed\\".I love one thing John wrote about in the middle of the book too regarding \\"there's probably someone you're thinking about who should read this book\\" (paraphrasing). It was true! Although I know it helps me, there are certain people I interact with who would benefit from it greatly! In all honesty, anyone and everyone can benefit from this. Plus, it's so affordable and such a quick, entertaining read, how can you not afford to own it?Lastly, I'd like to plug the QBQ Twitter feed and e-mail subscription. The QBQ concept is laid out beautifully in this book, but John sends out occasional e-mail stories exemplifying the QBQ mentality. It's a great way to keep QBQ fresh and alive.

Unfortunately, far too many people truly do not understand the real questions to ask themselves.In this book, QBQ! The Question Behind the Question What to Really Ask Yourself, Practicing Personal Accountability in Business and in Life, John G. Miller through the use of personal observations show the power of questions and their answers. Beyond being an easy read and quick one as well (less than 120 pages in bigger print), Miller paints in 39 short chapters how to eliminate blame, complaining and procrastination.The author states the essence of QBQ is all about making better choices through better questions. Just think how that could affect your life? Would you have less resistance by your children to customers? Would you actually have more of your desired results? Imagine the possibilities?I personally enjoyed Chapter 24 where the author encourages people to leave organizations they no longer believe in. Chapter 25 looked at the power of one because change begins with I or me and not with we. If you want to be noticed, to stand out in the crowded business world, to be The Red Jacket in a sea of gray suits, then in my opinion, this book should be in your personal library and reread on a regular basis."},{"Title":"QBQ!

Which is funny as that's the tile of Miller's knew book - Outstanding! 47 Ways to Make Your Organization Exceptional. I got QBQ! from a friend and could not put it down. Miller is so on point with his core message of personal accountability and how to get rid of blame. I am so sick of the finger pointing in this country and my organization. Every day we hear \\"Who dropped the ball?\\" and \\"Who screwed up?\\" and \\"When are we gonna get better people?\\" and \\"Why do we have to go through all this change?\\" The QBQ! author really nails it when he teaches how to ask The Question behind the Question which are questions that lead me to greater ownership.It's not about doing other people's work at all, it's really all about being so excellent that I rise above the pettiness and victim thinking that is so prevalent in our world today. QBQ! and the other book \\"Flipping the Switch\\" are so practical and quick reads. Great stories, too. I love the Home Depot story and the Rockbottom Restaurant story too. The ware amazing word pictures that help me remember the material and apply it at work. I even use QBQ! at home, as a parent and a spouse. Personal responsibility seem to apply everywhere. And the more I use QBQ! as a measuring stick, I find sometimes I measure up and other times I don't. And that's ok, because that's when I know it's time to learn and as Miller says, Learning Equals Changing. Bottom line, QBQ! helps me work on the only person I can change: Me! I would give it 6 stars if that was possible!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"The book of the week was QBQ! by John G. Miller. Fascinating little read... QBQ Stands for question behind the question. It focuses on what questions are really important and gets away from questions that issue blame or help you put off what should be done. Something I found quite interesting about this book was it was just over a hundred pages yet it had nearly 40 chapters. Each chapter in the book was a small story that showed what happens when the right questions are asked.Miller really knows how to tell a story. The book in incredibly easy to read and hard to put down. Some examples of \\"bad\\" questions are:-\\"Why don't customers follow instructions?\\"-\\"Who made the mistake?\\"-\\"Why doesn't anyone else do as much work as me?\\"-\\"Why don't I get paid more?\\"Some better questions to ask yourself would be:-\\"How can I serve the customer better?\\"-\\"What can I do today to be more effective?\\"-\\"How can I be a more effective coach?\\"-\\"What can I do to be more productive?\\"Notice anything about the second set of questions? They start with How and What instead of Why or Who or When. They focus on \\"I\\" instead of them, they, or someone else. And most importantly they focus on action. To get ahead in this world there is only one person that can be changed, and that's YOU. If you focus on asking questions dedicated toward making yourself better you will be much better off than someone that is asking questions about procrastination or complaining.Some of the stories in this book were very entertaining. One story that really incorporated the skills I try to push into people's lives through this blog goes like this: A man stopped at Rock Bottom restaurant in downtown Minneapolis. The place was packed and a boy holding a bunch of plates noticed the man hadn't been helped yet, so he took it upon himself to help the man. He asked what the man wanted and the man said he just wanted a salad and a couple of rolls. The boy said it would be right out. And then the man asked if he could get a Diet Coke as well. The boy said they didn't serve Diet Coke, just Pepsi products. The man was fine with this and carried about his lunch. After a little bit of time the man was greeted with an ice cold Diet Coke. The man said \\"I thought you didn't carry Diet Coke.\\" The boy said \\"We don't, but they have it at the convenience store across the street\\". The man asked who went and got it because the boy was way too busy and boy replied \\"My Manager.\\"There are so many great things about this story. Most people would have said \\"Why should I have to get a Diet Coke when we have Pepsi?\\" or \\"Why should I serve that man, he isn't sitting in my area?\\" or \\"Why are we so short staffed?\\" The boy didn't say any of those things, he just acted. He did what it took to make the customer happy, true customer service. Aside from the outstanding customer service from the boy, I also want to mention the manager. The manager is a true leader. He let his employees make the decision and then he acted. This is a fantastic sign of a successful organization.I really think this book is great for anyone. I think everybody could use a few lessons in personal accountability. Once someone learns to stop blaming everyone else, they really start acting and things start getting done. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Take a trip down the road to gullibility as John G. Miller teaches people to move beyond \\"victim thinking\\" into actual victimhood.Drawing on his vast experiences standing in lines at retail outlets he's developed \\"gems\\" of advice such as; low paid retail employees should use their own meager salaries to cover for managerial inadequacies and understaffing habits of the giant profit making corporations that employ them. Chocked full of childish anecdotes the book illustrates examples of people doing other people's jobs in the manner of a classic twelve-step enabler.Be wary of anyone giving you a book about personal accountability that doesn't also include the shocking idea of holding others to their obligations. Likely it's because they don't know how to fulfill their own responsibilities and they are planning on dumping the work/blame onto you. This book is a Trojan horse for goldbrickers everywhere.John G. Miller makes himself the darling of overwhelmed managers who are hiding in their offices, incapacitated by fear and their own incompetence, by proposing a silly fantasy world where the correcting and coping with the chaos that's created by a management vacuum is the responsibility of those suffering from it, not those who cause it or get paid to prevent it. Apparently inept managers should be out spending their bonuses on cars and golf and we could all facilitate that by just not whining about them being MIA. As the competency of the average 21st century manager continues to decline at meteoric velocity they will need to dump the blame and responsibility for their failure off onto their reports if the bonuses are to continue to roll in. If you're a \\"manager\\" unable to fulfill the duties of that management position you took for the extra money and to stroke your ego or because you can't provide any actual contribution to your company's core business then you may also be dumb enough to think that this book is the answer to the panic you feel now that you're realizing that you have absolutely no idea how to actually lead. Simple solution; don't start leading, avoid the tough choices, continue to not do your job and pass these books out to the underlings. Make the ingrates think it's their fault and their problem to solve; if you can con them into covering for you then you can keep doing nothing forever. Considering the average spineless employee, clueless stockholder, and the fact that your managers are probably as incompetent as you it should work like a charm.Where are all these positive reviews coming from? I can't believe these are real and not just paid plugs or friends & family of the author or the author himself using 115 pseudonyms."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Don't get me wrong, the ideas in the book were good ones, but it felt like all the supporting text simply rehashed the ideas over and over. The chapters were uncommonly short, sometimes only a paragraph at a time, which could be a good thing or an obnoxious thing, depending on your view. And while we're on the topic of short things, the entire book itself can be read through in a matter of a couple hours. It's very small. Perhaps my problem was that I just sat down and read the whole thing at once. Perhaps if I'd taken a chapter at a time over a few days it would have felt less like stretching the good points out to make a book."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Very easy reading, and useful. Many reviews talked about the contents and key messages in the book.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"What makes this book easy and fun to read are the many stories that John Miller uses to illustrate his points.As a company trainer, I have incorporated the QBQ! message into our Leadership training classes. It was a great addition to our training material and has been instrumental in achieving positive changes with many of our management staff. We also gave copies of the book to each of the 150 managers in our region.Other positive changes have happened in my personal life from reading this book. I am much more proactive in getting things done and less apt to blame. In addition, my teenage son, after having read the book (with some initial prompting), seems to help out around the house with less complaining! That alone makes it worth the price of the book!In short- this is a must-have book for any self-help library, professional or personal.Terry Schuman, Training and Communication Manager, Denver, CO"},{"Title":"QBQ!

To get to a satisfactory conclusion of a project, I often have to help with team-building. I saw a review of the QBQ! book and I felt it would help with the challenges I was facing at a recent client. I was right! I bought a dozen and shared them with management and team members on a project. The team read QBQ! and got the point about ceasing the blame-game and asking The Question Behind the Question. QBQ! does a a good job of blending humor and insight into a useful tool for pointing out the how taking responsibility/accountability can put you back in charge of your life. I look forward to sharing QBQ! with my other clients. It's just so dead on to what people need today. A fast read too, under an hour. I've now read it 3 times!"},{"Title":"QBQ!

I love the concept of turning bad questions I ask into good ones so I won't be the victim anymore. As I move through the material, more and more I discover I need to read this book over and over again. I even keep mine with me - it's a handbook on how to live life. When we had the author into speak, I realized he is very genuine and the content is for him, too. He even says that!

In our organizaiton there is so much blame, victim thinking, etc. that when we miss targets and deadlines it's just terrible. &quot;Heads will roll!&quot; is often the mantra of the day. But QBQ! is helping us turn that culture into one where people take ownership and are more creative by simply asking QBQs.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"My company required its employees, all high-tech, highly motivated people, to read this book. Not a single person has had a positive experience with it. The examples and anecdotes provided in the book are too simple and no practical methodology is given to get serious results.For example, Mr. Miller gives an example of Judy, a Wal-Mart employee who pays for a customer's purchase when all he has is a $100 bill. Instead of helping the customer politely using the process laid out by the employer, Mr. Miller suggests that this is the correct way to conduct business! Not practical in the corporate world. Often it is necessary to provide feedback to vendors, co-workers, and employees - feedback which can be negative. Mr. Miller suggests that if employees are showing up late for work, vendors are delivery sub-standard parts, or production line output is sagging, it's YOUR fault, and you must undertake fixing it! Mr. Miller tries to explain that constructive criticism is a concept not compatible with good employees or a positive view on life, but offers nothing helpful in dealing with problem employees or situations where you don't have time to be warm and fuzzy to get a problem resolved quickly.The rest of the book offers cliches, buzz words, feel-good tactics, and euphanisms that tell what great employees already know: you can whine and complain, or you can find out what's broken and work to fix it.I believe that there may be something useful in this book for personal growth or small businesses, but it doesn't really apply to highly motivated people or to companies where honest, direct, non-euphamistic language is critical to efficient work."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book is fabulously simple (and genius).

Any workplace that is willing to dedicate the time to turn these practices into habits will see an immense boost in productivity."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"QBQ is a great book and is very easy to read. After reading the book I ordered 10 other copies. I am in the military and make my subordinates do a book report on the book once they arrive to my unit. It has improved productivity for each service member and for our unit as a whole. Instead of someone saying \\"That is not my job you need to see so and so.\\" They say \\"Sure I can help with that\\" and service is provided immediately.If you are not in the military but do have a job I think this book will help at any rung in the corporate ladder. If you are an employee and have the attitude expressed in the book you will move up very quickly. If you are on top of the ladder and get your employees to read this book their productivity will increase and make your company more profitable.I personally think this book has made me a better boss, a better husband, and a better person in general.Great work Mr. Miller."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"John's main theme that he focuses on, through a number of short chapters/stories is on eliminating blame, complaining, procrastination and complacency. Its about stepping up in both your personal and career taking accountability, charge and action. Below are excerpts of some key learnings:-Action, even when it leads to mistakes, brings learning and growth. Inaction brings stagnation and atrophy.-Action leads us toward solutions. Inaction at best does nothing and hold us in the past.-Action requires courage.

Being accountable for my actions and attitudes allows me to deal with problem customers, unmotivated coworkers, and even demanding bosses in a way that makes me happy to be at work (and I'm in the service industry!)This book is required reading for anyone that I coach or mentor.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"\\"Was that very QBQ?\\"QBQ is now a verb within my company and family. I first read the book in 2005 on the recommendation of my wife. I'd been going through some significant career challenges and she gently pointed out that I was blaming everything and everyone for what was going wrong in my professional life. She was right, and what was holding me back was my typical \\"hard-coded\\" American obsession of always blaming someone or something for my predicaments and expertly not taking responsibility for myself. After one reading of the book, it got my attention. I then got the audio book and began listening to it in my car. Listening to it by myself in my car and then with my family. It is as applicable for business as family life, and I came to realize that it is an ubiquitous message that is appropriate for every fully functioning person in society...no one is excluded unless you refuse to take responsibility for yourself in everything you do.Its simplicity is the genius behind the message. I think everyone knows the message but have been influenced so heavily by our culture of always blaming and complaining about someone or something else that hearing it presenting by Mr. Miller is a wake up call. It was a call to action for me and I truly credit it as a key tool that has helped me double the size of my business in the last 5 years. There's no mystery about it. Once you commit yourself to become personally accountable for everything good and bad within your life, your potential is unleashed and success will find you.It's a life-truth, there's no way to fake it!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I discovered John G. Miller while listening to The Dave Ramsey radio show. At the time, John was promoting his newest book - OUTSTANDING - 47 Ways to Make Your Organization Exceptional. His candor and wit quickly caught my attention and prompted me to order the book. Outstanding was excellent and compelled me to look for more of John's material - hence my discovery of QBQ. Being an avid reader of business and motivational type materials, I don't know how this gem has escaped my attention for so many years! Shame on me!QBQ is an excellent book. I find John's writing style unique in that when I read the materials I don't feel like I'm reading. I feel like I'm having a conversation with a friend. This is extremely refreshing in the literary world in which so many authors seem to feel the need to talk way above the heads of their intended audience.Much like Outstanding, I finished this book in days. And then I read it again and again. I found so many take-aways that I could apply immediately to my life, both professionally and personally. Admittedly, I have spent a lot of wasted energy looking to lay blame for my misfortunes, \\"bad luck\\", roadblocks, problems, and trials on others. I believe it is our human nature to do so. This book challenged me to cease such behavior and start asking myself a different set of questions such as, what can I do? How can I make a difference? What about ME needs to change?In a world filled with finger pointing, personal accountability is sometimes a bitter pill to swallow. It's not always easy to look inward, instead of out. If you feel like you're up to the challenge of changing the person you see when you look in the mirror, this book is a MUST HAVE! If you really want to turn up the heat...follow this book with John's next title, Flipping the Switch.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"After reading a few pages, I'm hooked. This book takes about an hour to read and has a lifelong impact. The title implies exploring other questions based on the original question. However, the real story is about personal accountability in work and life.Rather than doing what comes naturally for many of us and becoming defensive and pointing fingers, the book changes your mode of thinking from \\"It's his fault\\" to \\"How can I fix this?\\" For example, in a restaurant, a diner is waiting for his waiter to come to the table. He catches the attention of a waiter who says, \\"This isn't my table\\" and walks off. The diner can only hope the waiter went to alert the person who is responsible for his table.A waiter who uses QBQ thinking would help the diner rather than dodging the table just because it's not his table. Such action has positive results on both the waiter and the customer.In another story, a cashier pays for the customer's under $3 purchase as her register didn't have enough to provide change. This action resulted in the store getting 100 percent of the customer's business.The book grabbed me and I applied QBQ thinking the day after reading it. It feels much better to take the QBQ route instead of responding defensively. Check the QBQ site for more examples and details (http://www.qbq.com)."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book was recommended to me by a new friend Rini from BP, and i love it. I read it just in a two hours flight ( i am not a fast reader!), finishing it right when the plane landed, and i kind of feel very motivated and enpowered!In the simple similar tradition of One Minute Manager, Fish, and other simple to read business book, this one has one great idea about how we should ask questions.In a nutshell:1. Begin with \\"WHAT\\" or \\"HOW\\", and not \\"Why\\", \\"When, or \\"Who\\".2. Contain an \\"I\\"3. Focus on Action.So, instead of: \\" When are we going to be more competitive?\\", use: \\" What can i do today to be more effective?\\".Or, instead of \\" Who will care as much as I do?\\", use \\"How can I communicate better?\\"QBQ is a simple powerful technique that will improve the way you see life. John Miller has a whole organisation build into training it.Even that the way they write is way different, i would like to compare the idea of QBQ as such similar power with One Minute Manager. It's easy to teach, easy to implement, and have great return if people start using it.So, for 2 hours easy reading that might change your life for the better, you have nothing to lose, get a copy."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"In The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in Business and in Life, John G. Miller presents an alternative way to look at our problems (or challenges) and encourages us to ask different, but better questions about them.Miller starts off by illustrating incorrect questions (IQ's). IQ's focus on things or people outside or external to us. Some examples might be \\"When will he learn to manage better?\\", \\"Why can't they see my point-of-view?\\", \\"Why can't they hire better workers?\\". IQ's tend to sap our energy and deflate our spirit.IQ's do, however, seem to come naturally, perhaps as a result of human nature. Miller often asks groups of people what's the one thing they would like to change in their organizations. The answers always follow the external P's: that is, change the policies, procedures, prices, and other people. \\"Nobody ever says me.\\" As an example, look at the following questions and see what is the first response that comes to mind.-A poor subordinate blames the _____.-A poor executive blames the _____.-A poor driver blames the _____.Although these thoughts or questions may be natural, they lead us into blame, complaining, and procrastination. Miller's solution is to discipline our thoughts and to look behind our initial questions to come up with better questions-or, as he terms it, the question behind the question (QBQ).These are Miller's three guiding principles for better questions or QBQ's. Better questions:1. \\"Begin with what or how (not why, when or who).\\"2. \\"Contain I (not they, we, or you).\\"3. \\"Focus on action.\\"A perfect example of a QBQ is \\"What can I do right now?\\" The essence of the QBQ system is that \\"the answers are in the questions\\". If you ask the right question you can make positive moves toward achievement and a rewarding life.The book concludes with a list of lousy questions and the better QBQ's or questions behind the questions. A brief sample follows.The sales department:\\"When are we going to get some new products?\\"\\"Why can't we get better customer service support?\\"QBQ's:\\"How can I add value for my customers?\\"The management:\\"Why aren't my workers more motivated?\\"\\"Why do they keep making the same mistakes?\\"QBQ's:\\"What can I do to help them do their job better?\\"To summarize, \\"The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in Business and Life\\" presents some basic, yet powerful ideas about creating a more rewarding and fulfilling life."},{"Title":"QBQ!

QBQ (the question behind the question) isn't a blame book, or a self-flagellation book either! As irritating as work can be at times, when blow-ups occur, this book gives you the tools to work thru these headaches, and dismiss the whining that can accompany tough situations. Similar in speed and impact to 'Who Moved My Cheese?' this book will stick with you long after you pass it on. And remember pass it on because you like it, not because you think others need it!"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This was a fascinating read because, as other reviewers have said, the change that comes over you when you read this book is gradual but decisive. It is true that a change in the language used often coincides with a change in attitude and action, and it was so with this book.I found as I read furthur on, I recognized myself in the negative questions or comments posed, and when I thought about what I could say differently to pose the questions or comments usefully rather than complainingly, I had trouble rephrasing them myself, but then said \\"Aha!\\" as I read the author's suggestions.This is almost more of a New Age/ self-help book than a business book in some ways, because it is working to subtly change the way you pose questions to yourself. If you find yourself feeling powerless in any part of your life, I'd recommend this book as a way of taking positive action and taking charge of your reactions to the world."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"Finally, a book without funny characters and parables. One with excellent content that can be applied. QBQ! not only made me AWARE of the need for more personal accountability in my life at home and at work, but it showed me HOW to do it. Refreshing! Miller helped me understand that too often I play victim by asking questions like &quot;Why doesn't my company train me more?&quot; and &quot;When is someone going to clarify my job?&quot; I've learned to pause and simply ask &quot;What can I do to develop myself?&quot; and &quot;How can I adapt?&quot; This is a book that won't let you down. It took me an hour to read ... and then I read it again - twice. Each time I picked up something new. Really enjoyed it ... and then I bought copies for my team and now we're studying it together.

The whole book could be boiled down to one of those laminated placards leaving enough room left over for VCR programming instructions :). I'd say its worth $2 - $4. Sorry I can't recommend an alternative. On the more positive side, as I said it wasn't a COMPLETE waste of time but any 2 - 3 page article in a magazine would do as much. Not even, imho, a good Cliff notes type thing for those who just want to talk the talk. To paraphrase &quot;Less Filling, More cost&quot;"},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"First I want to give credit where credit is due. There is truth in this book in that many people look to place the blame for their unhappiness, inadequacies and feelings of helplessness on other people or circumstances supposedly beyond their control. The real truth is that we only control ourselves and not perfectly at that. Further, we only have the ability to influence, not control others. Having said this, the beneficial part of this book can be summed up in the following statement. If we learn in each situation not to try to find whom or what to blame, since we have no control over others, but rather how we can take control of the situation and resolve it ourselves, we will greatly reduce the feeling of helplessness we experience. More simply stated learn to ask in each situation \\"What steps must I take to resolve this?\\" By doing this you take charge of your life putting yourself back in control. Also notable is the fact that chapter 36 \\"Wisdom\\" is the shortest chapter in the book. Chapter 37 \\"We Buy Too Many Books\\" applies to this book."},{"Title":"QBQ!

Optimal Thinking provides the best questions to help you make the most of the present moment, the most of your personal life and the most of your career.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This is an exceptionally short and interesting book. I finished it within an hour. Ironcially that's the beauty of it which is just so straightforward and well written that I can remember some stories/teachings long after I closed it, especially the story of the waiter asking his manageress to buy the author a diet coke in a restaurant that served only Pepsi (dare you challenge the company policy to satisfy a customer?), and the one of a Cinderella cashier in Home Depot who bought a $2 stuff for a rich man (the prince who would marry her) who got only $100 notes to keep customers from waiting too long. In short, well worths the price and the time, though QBQ and personal accountability to you (and me) may just be another marketing name, similar to the \\"5 Whys?\\" (asking \\"why?\\" at least five times for every problem engaged) that Toyota, the excellent auto maker, had adopted for decades.Below please find some passages I like the most for your reference.I saw the angel in the marble and I chiseled until I set it free. - MichelangeloFocusing on what we dont have is a waste of time and energy.....Let's ask the QBQ \\"How can I achieve with the resources I already have?\\" pg 40\\"When are we going to hear something new?\\" is the wrong question. The right one is \\"How can I apply what I'm hearing?\\" - even if I've heard it before. pg 42What can I do today to solve the problem? How can I help move the project forward? What action can I take to \\"own\\" the situation? pg 46God grant me the serenity to accept the people I cannot change, the courage to change the one I can, and the wisdom to know..........it's me! pg 79Leadership, more than anything else, is about the way we think. It's a moment to moment discipling of our thoughts. It's about practicing personal accountability and choosing to make a positive contribution, no matter what our role or \\"level.\\" A receptionist, an engineer, a sales person, a temp worker, a cashier: They all can be leaders...Parents? Absolutely. Parenting may be the most important leadership role there is. pg 93\\"Servant leadership\\" is the QBQ way, and it requires a humble spirit combined with a servant's heart. Humility is the cornerstone of leadership. pg 95We attend too many seminars. We take too many classes. We buy too many books. We play too many audios in our cars. It's all wasted if we're unclear on what learning really is: Learning is not attending, listening, or reading. Nor is it merely gaining knowledge. Learning is really about translating knowing what to do into doing what we know. It's about changing. If we have not changed we have not learned. What have you learned today? pg 110"},{"Title":"QBQ!

It's easy - as John Miller writes in QBQ! - to slip into blame and victim thinking. We have big goals and quotas and we all want to win, but it's easy to ask the worng questions like \\"When will others carry their weight?\\" and \\"Why can't corporate support us more?\\" But then I work to create what Miller calls QBQs - questions that help me eliminate the blame and complaining. I begin to ask \\"What can I do?\\" and \\"How can I contribute?\\" and it's amazing how fast I am refocused. We are using the QBQ! training program with all our managers along with the book, and this whole concept of accountability is taking root. Our culture is changing and as we gear up for the end-of-year, it's apparent that people are asking QBQs and we will have better results. I know I will.

And thought it is normal and human to blame and play victim, but as we've brought QBQ! into our culture we've seen an amazing improvement in creativty and teamwork. Less blame = less fear. It's making us a stronger organization. We actually practice the QBQ! method of asking ourselves better questions so we can practice personal accountability. It truly is a Five Star book. So many on the market today tell silly fables, but not QBQ! The stories are enjoyable and real and the message is right on: NO MORE BLAME!

I try to read it about once a month because it talks of a subject we constantly have to remind ourselves about. That subject is Personal Accountability. In a world which is quick to blame others, find fault with others and pass problems along to others, this book causes one to view things in a much better, more helpful light.Then, I heard John speak at our convention. I was amazed at his great sense of humor and how he could teach this very important subject in such a way that it really hit home and made sense. I would reccommend him to any group looking for a great public and motivational speaker.Everyone should read the QBQ.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"What a great book!I purchased it on Amazon 2/22/11 and finished it today 2/27/11 which is probably an all-time record for me as books I buy usually take months, if not years, to percolate to the top of my to-read list. This one, however, I seemed to keep getting prompts about in my other reading, Amazon searches, and of course regular mentions from Dave Ramsey. I'm currently going through Financial Peace University with my wife and am doing some personal enrichment reading in that regard, including currently reading The Millionaire Next Door and listening to Thou Shall Prosper on audiobook. Hopefully that puts things into perspective.Having read quite a few business-related books in the last few years, what sets QBQ apart?1. An ultra-sharply clear concept.2. Broad usage potential, both in professional and personal life.3. Super-fast readabilityThis is a 115-page book that reads even faster than that. Most chapters are 1-4 pages long, and not particularly dense pages at that. Each chapter reads as a mini article covering a specific item all of which revolve around the QBQ concept.What is that concept? It's simple: getting to questions in our lives that move us toward positive action. As opposed to all those questions most people use daily in their work and personal lives which attempt to avoid responsibility or place blame on others for the problem of the moment. It really is that simple. But because the concept is so clear, the majority of the book gives examples of how we can rephrase our words and thinking to become more effective at problem solving. More effective ourselves. Not by attempting to change others. Not by anything other than realizing that we simply can NOT change others, and asking questions about why others do or don't do what we want them to do are useless questions.Too often in this country today people act the victim. \\"I couldn't do what I needed to do because that person didn't do their thing.\\" \\"It's not my fault I burnt my tongue on that coffee, the cup wasn't clearly enough labeled 'HOT!'\\" You get the idea. So much of the genius in this country seems to be spent in figuring out how to avoid personal responsibility. At work. At home. At school. In parenting. For anything. Does anyone think this is a good thing? In any way?To me, this book is a brief rebellion against that epidemic. It's something I'll make sure my kids read. It should be read by everyone in America, in my opinion. It's a short, easy, fun, enlightening read. Every 6th grader and every high school senior should be required to read it. Twice. Maybe again in college. QBQ is that good a concept."},{"Title":"QBQ!

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I love a couple of things when I pick up a book. I love when the title is clear and promises me something tangible (something of course that I care about). And I love it when the book delivers. When the book is also written by a really smart person, who I've had the privilege to work with a bit, it is even better.This book is all of these things.John G Miller, author of QBQ - the Question Behind the Question among others, has written a fast paced, easy to read and hard to put down book about making our organizations more... outstanding!He accomplishes this with 47 short chapters with titles that make the lesson clear. Some examples include:Make No ExcusesDo What You PromiseBe FastBe Flexible: Put People Before PoliciesSeek No Culprits(and 42 more!)A cynic would say \\"I already know or have read most of those things.\\" Perhaps this is true, though I doubt it would be true for all 47 and I more highly doubt that you and your organization as doing all 47.Each chapter is carried by one or more stories and examples, and is illustrative rather than preachy. You can read one each day, over a couple lunch breaks or in one sitting.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book was short and to the point. I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars. It had a few really good nuggets that I hope to continue to brew about. The book, \\"QBQ\\" is question about the question, how to ask better questions and practice personal accountability.Here's the points that caught my attention:Chapter 1 - A Picture of Personal Accountability, \\"Make better choices in the moment by asking better questions\\" -page 11 - good nugget.Chapter 4 - Don't Ask\\" Why\\", \\"How can I do my job better today\\",\\"What can I do to improve the situation?\\",\\"How can I support others?\\" - page 23 - I really like this last question and for me to focus on how to support others better. For me this includes not only my team mates, but also my family.Chapter 6 - \\"Why Is this Happening to Me?\\" , \\"Stress is a choice\\" - page 27\\"Stress is also the result of our choices\\" - page 27 - This was the key take away for me, stress is a choice. Period.Chapter 11 - When will we get more tools and better systems, \\"succeeding within the box\\" - page 39 - Very successful people figure out how to succeed within their box. I really liked this concept.Chapter 29 - The Risk of Doing Nothing, \\"Action requires courage. Inaction often indicates fear. Action builds confidence; inaction, doubt\\" - page 85Chapter 31 - Leaders at All Levels, \\"If we think like leaders, we are leaders.\\" - page 93 - - -fake it until you make itChapter 32 - The Cornerstone of Leadership, \\"As a leader, I'm here to help you reach your goals\\" - page 95 - I had a boss once that used this as her motto and it was refreshing, made me rethink how I manage others."},{"Title":"QBQ!

It took me a little over an hour to read, and, in that hour, my life was changed for the better. I have read it at least another five times since then have given several copies away to co-workers, family members, and friends. It has positively affected our lives in several different areas.WorkI work in Corporate America, where the blame game is alive and thriving. When I discovered the QBQ, I became more productive.

And it has served us a a great parenting tool.SchoolWe have even made up a game to teach the QBQ to our children.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"This book was assigned reading when I began with Schwan's in 2006. I had left the credit card processing industry over frustrations with some of the companies I had worked with. I did not stay with Schwan's, but kept going over this wonderful book.I tested areas of customer service including getting a waitress in an Outback to ask if I'd like her to get me a Pepsi because the restaurant only served Coke.I went back to credit card processing, because I knew the industry so well. Long story short, I put the principles discussed in QBQ to action. Although dyslexic, I made the decision not to let it stop me from writing a book on credit card processing. That book hit the best selling list on Amazon after a great review from an industry magazine and now I have a column in that magazine to help others in the industry.Personal accountability seems to be obvious, but how many people have you seen that are all too willing to look to blame other people or medical conditions for their own shortcomings?

Being the President of a organization, I can see application to everyone."},{"Title":"QBQ! The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life","review":"I wish someone had told me a while ago, \\"Go out and buy and read this book...It could have an instant, dramatic, and positive influence on your life.\\" I did buy and read this great book, and it has begun to change my life in some very positive ways. In fact, I think so much of this book that I have shared it with my boss (who loved it) and we have bought it and shared it with everyone in our office.Miller's common-sense approach to addressing the deeply personal and broadly universal character issue of personal accountability was both refreshing and enlightening. The book is a series of short, simple, and inter-related chapters that discuss or illustrate different thoughts and perspectives about personal accountability. The chapters contain many outstanding stories, anecdotes, and personal experiences of people making a difference through personal accountability. Many times I personally related to the questions and situations Miller presented.According to Miller, the essence of QBQ is making better choices in the moment by asking better questions. Instead of asking lousy questions that do not solve anything -- \\"Why don't they communicate better?\\" or \\"Who dropped the ball?\\" or \\"Who is going to solve this problem?\\" - Miller argues for questions that begin with \\"What\\" or \\"How,\\" contain \\"I,\\" and focus on action - \\"How can I make a difference?\\" or \\"What can I do to contribute?\\" Miller's argument was a great complement to Stephen Covey's first habit (of 7) of highly effective people (being proactive; being responsible for making good things happen in your life) and Viktor Frankl's last of the human freedoms (being able to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances).Lastly, I believe Miller intended this book for individuals who are serious about introspection for the sake of character refinement and life improvement. I love challenges, and I took Miller's words that follow as a constructive challenge that I have gladly accepted:\\"Learning is not attending, listening or reading. Nor is it merely gaining knowledge. Learning is really about translating 'knowing' what to do into 'doing' what we know. It's about changing. If we have not changed we have not learned.

That being said, there are some worthwhile thoughts embedded in it, and it can be read in an hour, so there's not much to lose.My biggest problem with the book is that Miller's impliicit definition of \\"personal accountability\\" is not distinct from responsibility and therefore loses all of its power, especially as a business requirement. Yet, the subtitle of the book is \\"practicing personal accountability at work and in life\\", and, sorry, you can't practice accountability if you don't know what it is...Oh, and the phrase \\"personal accountability\\" is a redundancy -- there is no accountability other than that which is personal."},{"Title":"QBQ!

There was one place where the first half of a sentence was missing altogether.The publishers would not, presumably, put up with this kind of sloppy editing in a print version. What makes them think it's OK to put out an electronic version with this many errors?"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I will not discuss the book which is, in my opinion, one of Agatha's best. I would like to mention a clue that seems to be overlooked by Poirot. This message does not reveal who the murderer is, but you should not read it unless you already read Orient Express, because it might spoil you the fun.The clue is about compartments in the railroad car. As you know, the murderer(s) wanted to book up all the compartments in the Istanbul - Calais car, but the compartment number 1 has been booked months before, by the company's director, Mr. Buck (Poirot ended in that compartment later). Now that implicates that the compartments were allocated sequentially. Mr. Rechet got the compartment number 2, his valet Mr. Masterman got the bed number 4 (the first available bed in the second class) while his secretary Mr. McQueen got the bed number 6 in the next second class compartment. All that implicates some kind of the plot, since the car was obviously empty (except for Mr. Buck) before Rechet and his escort booked their tickets, and then all the sudden the whole bunch came.Let us proceed. In his statement Mr. McQueen states that the valet always traveled second class, but he (McQueen) usually traveled first class, so that his employer, Mr. Rechet could use McQueen's compartment to store his own luggage. But on this occasion all the first class compartments were booked, so McQueen had to travel second class. Now that is a highly suspicious statement - Rechet got number 2, and McQueen and Masterman got the first two class 2 compartments. It seems like first class compartments 3 (etc.) and the complete second class was empty when Mr. Rechet's ticket was bought and that McQueen did not want to be in the compartment number 3, next to Rechet's, for some reasons of his own. He also did not want to share the compartment with Masterman, since they could probably have booked beds number 4 and 5. All that strongly points to some kind of the conspiracy engineered by McQueen who, as a secretary, was in charge of booking tickets."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Though I had heard of Agatha Christie and her classic Murder on the Orient Express, I didn't know much about it. However, being a fan of the Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series, I was quite excited to read another classic mystery novel. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the book my disappointment started to set in.The problem with this book is that there is absolutely nothing driving the plot forward. Even with the old \\"the murderer is still aboard the train\\" plot-line, Christie manages to make this story as boring as possible. We know, for example, that there is no present danger to any of the current passengers because we learn early on that the murder was for the sake of a very specific revenge. We also learn early on that the murdered man was a despicable and infamous character, so none of the passengers were very distraught over his death (in fact, many of them seemed happy about it). Even the detective, Christie's famous Hercule Poirot, seemed like he was only interested in the case because he had nothing better to do at the time.To add to this, Christie's writing is tedious. The structure of the novel consists of interview after interview (and even several re-interviews) of every passenger on the coach. There are interesting red-herrings, but they obscure the plot too much and they all seem to only be revealed at the very end (rather than slowly throughout the course of the novel). I didn't enjoy this book, and, frankly, it makes me want to avoid Agatha Christie's books altogether."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I feal a bit bad giving such a low rating for one of Christies mysteries,but I found this book to be slow moving and draggy in the middle and towards the end.

The characters come alive much more in print, and the humor much sharper.After reading this, do read _The Murder of Roger Acroyd_ and after all the others, _Curtain_.

Hercule struggles too, the suspect could be anyone on the train, but then he realizes, maybe the answer is right under his nose."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is arguably Agatha Christie's best known novel, which is a status it more or less deserves. The book features Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in one of his earliest appearances (his eighth novel). The plot is a clever one -- a murder takes place on a luxury train and one of the 12 passengers must have committed it. Poirot is travelling on the train, and he is drawn into the mystery by one of the executives of the train company who knows Poirot and also happened to be on the train. A few of the passengers seem like obvious suspects, but Poirot takes his time and does not draw any rash conclusions.Many of the plot devices in \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" have been borrowed from Christie by later, lesser authors, so the novel may not seem as fresh as it once was. I'm a relative newbie to Christie's writing but enjoyed this book quite a bit, particularly the colorful and interesting characters. I marked it down one star because some of the plot twists are not very believable and the novel relies on a few coincidences. However, even with these issues, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a very good to excellent mystery novel that is sure to please fans of the genre.I read the rerelease version by Black Dog & Leventhal. They have done a nice job with this hardback series, including an attractive dust cover and quality paper. However, I'm not sure that the novel is worth the extra price you'd pay for a typical soft cover version."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is almost certainly the most famous Agatha Christie novel and may well be the best-known novel from the entire mystery genre. Despite the fact that I had been told the solution to the case many years ago, I decided to go ahead and finally read the book and am very glad that I did.The basic plot, for any who don't already know, involves a murder on board a train with a small, but colorful, group of passengers. It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case. The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting. My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting. The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is one of Poirot's best mysteries. On this train, everyone is a suspect and there are few clues.This book dosen't have any boring parts. It's allways fast-paced and intriguing all the way."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Possibly one of the most famous (possibly due to the fine movie of the same title) in the Hercule Poirot series, this classic little mystery has survived since its first publication in 1933 -- maybe that says it all! The plot is fairly familiar -- during the night on a several day train trip across lower Europe, Poirot's seemingly unpopular sleeping car neighbor is murdered. Rather than little or no clues or suspects, almost everybody aboard the train is a suspect; plenty of clues float around besides. Since the train is totally stalled due to a heavy snow, no resources other than sheer brainpower are available to our intellectual Belgian sleuth. Poirot gets by without his familiar sidekick, Capt. Hastings, but \\"adopts\\" a railroad executive and the traveling doctor as foils upon which to foist his evolving theories. After Poirot very cleverly determines that the victim is a hated child kidnapper/killer from America, the plot thickens as the interrogations proceed -- first one and then another and then another of the passengers seem to be related somehow to that long ago famous case. Could it be a conspiracy? You'll be turning the 200 pages rapidly to find out!As usual, Christie's \\"economy\\" of words dwells on little but the straightforward story telling, but we're soon cast under her spell. Like most of her stories, there are more than ample pointers for we readers to take a decent stab at the solution ourselves, but we suspect it will be a rare person who beats Poirot to the task!

Some criticized it for its novel ending. This book also has an unconventional ending that should surprise a reader. It is another variation on the \\"locked room\\" murder mystery which takes place on a sleeping car in Europe. Some of the comments reflect life in the 1930s. Hercule Poirot's visit to Syria may reflect the events of that era when it was part of the French Empire. Poirot's trip on the Orient Express finds it packed in the off-season. Then a passenger is found stabbed to death. Has anyone left the train? If not, the murderer is still aboard! Poirot is asked to investigate as the snowbound train is isolated from the authorities.In Part II Poirot interviews all the people on the train. Could anyone be connected to the dead man? Seemingly not, unless Poirot can uncover any facts not disclosed by the passengers. Yet we know it had to be someone on this train. In Part III Poirot considers the testimony and poses Ten Questions about the murder. [Did you pick up any clue?] If any of the passengers have a connection to the murdered man could it explain the crime? In Chapter 9 Poirot assembles the passengers to explain his solution. [This was the common practice in many mystery novels.] Poirot offers two solutions. The first is that Ratchett's enemy entered the train at the station, stabbed him, then slipped away before the train left the station. Poirot explains the second solution to his audience of varied nationalities. Could such a fantastic plan be possible? The Director of the Wagon Lit company chooses the first solution and all the passengers agree. Case closed, the murderer was not found.This clever story is one of Agatha Christie's best. The murderer of Roger Ackroyd was never tried. This story is an example of clever deductions by finding the undisclosed clues. The description of Ratchett as traveling armed tells about the right to keep and bear arms in Europe before the 1940s. One fault of Christie is her description of American citizens as \\"subjects\\". That hasn't been true since the War of 1775."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I picked up this book second-hand, and was it worth it. The version I have is an older version than I could find here, but same text. Either way, this book kept me reading until the end.

If you have read any other Christie, you might not be as surprised, but if it your first Christie novel, you will be blown away. The cast of suspects was a classic, but the ending was amazing. The last piece of the puzzle slapped me in the face like my alarm clock.I liked this book because it kept me reading until the last page. Also the way the demise of that unlucky person, and how he died was pretty amazing. Lastly, the background on the murdered was based on a real event, not to mention the train they were on is real too."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"It's been such a long time since I've read a mystery novel...so, either I was willing to be pulled in by this story (whether the plot sucked or not), or I found this \\"whodunit\\" really absorbing.

I have not watched the screen adaptation and am not interested to--the reading experience was more than enough...this was a very enjoyable snuggle-into-your-bed-and-read-till-the-late-hours-of-the-night mystery. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This terrific mystery novel from 1934 defines the whodunit genre. For me, Christie builds on Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels by introducing the culture and mores of the twentieth century, including nagging doubts about our own ability to discern right from wrong. Although one knows that Poirot, like Holmes, will crack the case, Poirot's flaws (vanity, unimposing stature, and lack of power to bring anyone to real justice) introduce some dramatic suspense. In addition, Christie uses the genre to explore the culture, manners, class tensions, and national rivalries of the day.The twist of this whodunit is remarkably clever and ties in well with some of the disillusionment of twentieth century man with the ability to tell right from wrong and with the limits of rationality. There is a wonderful irony to all this given Poirot's Holmes-like belief in reason.The novel is dated but reads very well. Great fun as well as containing literary merit."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Agatha Christie is one of, if not the, most prolific mystery authors to date. With a handful of captivating protagonists, ingenious plot devices, and unusual settings and cases, she managed to single-handedly establish the core of the mystery genre. And this book that I am about to review is one of her most famous works.When Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express he has no idea that he is about to descend into one of the most baffling cases of his career. After he makes eye-contact with a passenger by the name of Ratchett, he knows immediately that this man is no good, possibly even downright evil. With his sentiments echoed by everyone on board, it is not so much a surprise when Ratchett comes to him with an interesting proposition. He is being targeted for death by a private enemy and would like to enlist the detective's help in the detection of the culprit. M. Poirot refuses the case and thinks no more of it until the unfortunate Mr. Ratchett is found murdered. But as the case progresses, it comes to light that the circumstances are not so unfortunate as \\"Ratchett\\" was most certainly the despicable man everyone thought him. Armed with the knowledge that the murderer must still be on the train and the certainty that all the passengers are more than happy to see Ratchett dead, Hercule Poirot must sift through a handful of clues to track down a murderer.I myself love the work of Agatha Christie, although some might find her stories a bit dated and outlandish. Sometimes the leaps of logic are a bit hard to follow, but that's what makes Detective Poirot such a formidable crime-solver. And the ending is superb. A must read for anyone who wants to acquaint themselves with classic mystery!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Originally published in 1933, this story has some historical references that will be of interest to historians, but fortunately have only minor relevance to the main track of the plot. These references are to ethnic and national personalities and biases as well as the British dominance of India and Iraq.In this case, M. Poirot is traveling on the Orient Express, the train that connects Western Europe with the Balkans, Turkey and the Middle East. He boards in Syria along with a cosmopolitan group of fellow passengers. Since the group contains such a variety of people the comment is made at the time that it us unusual for so many nationalities to be aboard the train in the winter season.A murder is committed, and the odd point is that the man was stabbed 12 times. Given the nature of the wounds, it appears that some of them were caused by a man and the others by a woman. Since the train has been stopped by a severe snowstorm, the murder had to be committed by someone in the same sleeping car.M. Poirot is called on to solve the case and as he interviews all possible perpetrators, he finds that everyone has an alibi, each person has others that can vouch for their innocence. Therefore, after the first pass through the interviews of the 12 people, the only conclusion is that it is impossible for any of them to have murdered the man. However, M. Poirot is able to determine that the victim was a vicious criminal who had kidnapped and murdered a young girl. Although it was known that he committed that crime and no doubt other similar ones, the kidnapper was able to escape from the clutches of the law.While this knowledge does not help pin down the murderer, when told of the victim's true nature, all twelve of the people express joy at his death. Some express it more emphatically than others. After a second round of questioning, M. Poirot starts extracting additional facts and of course he is led to the path of identifying the killer(s).This is Agatha Christie at her best, the story at first leads to an impossible end, although the path there deposits many clues to the solution. Once M. Poirot starts the second round of questioning, the clues begin to pop up rather quickly and the structure of the murder plot becomes evident."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book that I have ever read and believe me, it really made me wanna read much more. The beginning started off a little slow, but as soon as I got to the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. The basic plot is that a murder has occurred on a train filled with strangers. It feels terrible to know that you will be stuck on a train for at least 2 days(this is because of a snow storm) on the same train as a murderer. The victim is an American kidnapper, so detective Hercule Poirot tries his best to question all the passengers, trying to find someone who is involved with the kidnapping case. The end is very unexpected, but I wasn't too happy with it. Overall, I suggest that anyone who loves mysteries and suspense read it soon!!!!!!!-Reviewed by Preethi"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This type of book is fit for the sort who enjoy reading murder mysteries. I thought this book was at a medium difficulty level and was suitable for ages ten and above. The protagonist (Hercule Poirot) was a wonderful edition to the story. His cunning plans and charming attitude made him the perfect detective to solve the crime. The book overall was a fabulous thriller with twist and turns making you point your finger at every suspect."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I have never really read many mysteries but after reading Murder on the Orient Express I have decided to start reading more. This novel is so great for many reasons. First off, the murder occurs fairly early in the book so you are not bored by tedious non-important facts. I also like this book because it lays out all the characters at the beginning, so you can flip to the front if you get confused. This murder is so full of twists and turns you never know what is going to happen. This mystery keeps you guessing until the end. When the murderer is finally shown you are shocked and bewildered. I think that Agatha Christie did a fantastic job of writing a great mystery. She developed all of the characters so that the reader was acquainted which each of them .She made it so the reader truly cared about figuring out who killed the horrible murder victim."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Hercule Poirot, a distinguished European lead detective, inadvertently finds himself on a train where a diabolical event is about to occur. The only problem is that Poirot is the only person on the train who seems to notice that something horrific has happened. In Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie, a rich American man on his way to Paris is found dead from multiple stab wounds. Minutes after the murder took place, the passengers on the coach, who all have a secret about the murder, are wondering who has done it. Along with M. Bouc, his trusted friend from Europe, Poirot begins to interview his fellow passengers. Will Poirot be able to solve the most intense case of his career, or will he have to give up and let the dreadful murderer get away?Murder on the Orient Express is an excellent murder mystery. I was continuously intrigued by the complex plot. Christie makes the reader dwell over the book, through clues and quotes, all provided by the different vivid and interesting characters. For example, while Poirot was interviewing Miss Debenham, a neatly-dressed and composed English governess, she told Poirot that she had seen someone in a scarlet kimono embroidered with dragons, on the night of the murder. This left me wondering whether the murderer was a man or a woman. This book really did not compare to any other book that I have read in this genre, such as Ten Little Indians by Agatha Christie, because it was so much more compelling from the start. Within the first few chapters the murder occurs, and for the rest of the book I was trying to figure out who the killer was. Another reason why I liked Murder on the Orient Express was because the author made me feel like I was in the book, and like I was Poirot. Because the book is written from his perspective, I was picking up different clues and pieces of the mystery along the way just as he was, and in the end they all came together.I recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries and who is looking for a complex, but fast and exhilarating read. So go out and get one of the best murder mysteries of all time written by Agatha Christie, Murder on the Orient Express."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I first read this book when I was 13. 17 years down the road, while reading it for the 20th-odd time, I'm still amazed at how Agatha Christie managed to blend everything so flawlessly amidst a sea of clues and red herrings. So much so that I've decided to write a short review about it.Using a real life crime as its foundation, the book puts celebrated detective Hercule Poirot in a stranded train, with a dead body to boot. There are 13 suspects, and each one of them have a perfect alibi. If you haven't read this before, the solution will really be a surprise to you, and gives a total different meaning to the term \\"whodunnit\\".What I like about this book is that it's nicely structured in three parts. The first was used to establish the characters up till the actual crime. The second part was used to gather evidences, mainly through interviewing the suspects, and the last, Poirot's proposals on the truth. This style of writing gives an order to an actually very messy affair, and is perhaps the only way to reduce one's confusion.To make it a more pleasurable read, Christie also sprinkled some humor throughout the story, which provides some light-hearted moments. On the whole, I thought this was (and still is) a very enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"An unusual crime takes place in a unique setting: a train car where no one can get on or off, yet the murderer remains a mystery. I listened to the audio version and the narrator was one of the best I have heard. He takes on the character of Poirot with total enthusiasm and convinving emotion. This is a classic that is anything but typical."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Suspensful novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat. So many suspects and yet none of them seem to be the murderer. Hercule Poroit keeps you guessing till the end. A must read novel that you won't regret you read."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Hercule Poirot, planning to do some sightseeing in Istanbul, is called back to France on urgent business. He books passage on the Orient Express, and becomes an earwitness to a murder in the adjoining sleeper compartment. A desperate criminal attempting to escape some unknown retribution has been stabbed twelve times in his sleep. The train becomes snowbound and Poirot is asked to solve the mystery while the passengers await rescue. It begins as a locked room mystery with all the possible suspects possessing ironclad alibis. Poirot labors mightily in unraveling the Gordian Knot. As the plot unfolds, the circumstances become more and more bizarre, until at the end, Poirot makes perfect sense out of everything.Poirot's insights appear more intuitive than logical, but he proves to be a shrewd guesser. He doesn't seem to have the deductive powers of Dupin or Holmes, but he makes a quite satisfactory detective nonetheless.The audio dramatization published by BDD was excellent. I had a long drive on a business trip, and the miles went by much faster as I listened to the story, staying several steps behind Poirot throughout. It proved so good that I listened to it again on the way home.One quibble about Christie's work. She wound up giving a very logical explanation for almost all the improbabilities that occurred in the story, but she (or at least the audio version) overlooked one very salient feature of such a stabbing. There would have been bloodspatters all over the victim's sleeper and probably trailed down the hallway of the sleeper car, and the killer would have been unable to dispose of his/her bloody clothing. In reality, Poirot should have been able to solve the mystery by following the killer's blood trail or canvassing the train for the bloody clothing."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is a great book! If you have never read an Agatha Christie book before, read this and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. It is very good and you have no clue who did it in the end. Poirot is one of the greatest fictional detectives ever."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"The novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie, is a riveting and impelling book which chronicles the adventures of a adroit detective traveling on an unusually crowded train, The Orient Express, at the time of a murder. When this detective, M. Hercule Poirot, takes on the investigation, he realizes immediately that the killer is a deceitfully clever and ruthless individual who leaves a trail of false clues designed to keep him off track. The suspects, a diverse, international collection of travelers, are marooned by a snowstorm, preventing the escape of the murderer. M. Poirot takes the passenger's testimony, examines evidence, and through flawless logic and ability, begins to unravel the crime. The story builds up slowly, gathering momentum as it approaches its startling, spellbinding conclusion.Through an intriguing plot, an unusual setting, and realistic, detailed descriptions, the author makes this an appealing book to read. The plot is somewhat slow in unfolding, yet the emergence of unexpected evidence and revelations compel you to keep reading. In addition to the plot, the atypical setting of this book, depicted with detailed imagery, focuses your attention as you seek to uncover hidden clues. The characters are brought alive through detailed depiction of their appearance, personality, and manner of speech.I would highly recommend this book to people who enjoy mysteries and crime stories that are not too scary or violent. M. Poirot is a intriguing main character who takes you through the evidence as if you were actually the detective trying to piece the puzzle together. Yet one can hardly predict the incredible and thrilling resolution to this mystery! Thus, for people who savor suspense and enjoy trying to put clues together to solve crimes, this is an exceptional book to read."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"A detective named Poirot on his way back home (in Belgium) suddenly received a telegram calling him for an emergency mystery in London!

It's the classic British drawing room murder mystery, and in spite of the fact that there's no \\"action\\" it's never dull.

I remember when I was a child, I would sneak out of my room and turn on the living room television after my mother went to bed and stay up late watching old movies on TCM. My favorite nights were when Murder On The Orient Express, starring Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, and a dozen other Old Hollywood stars that I just loved. Years later, when I discovered my love of literature, the first author that I indulged myself in was Agatha Christie.Murder On The Orient Express is everything a guilty pleasure novel should be. Quick, interesting, easy to understand, and keeps you devouring every single word until the last page. I absolutely love the character of Poirot, love the supporting characters, and find the Armstrong case more and more heart-breaking every time I read it. You will read this novel and you will love every word of it!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Undoubtedly, this is Agatha Christie's most renowned novel. Others have come close to its fame, and others perhaps even surpass it in their ingenuity, (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd;And Then There Were None) but \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is the one story in Christie's vast collection of detective novels that absolutely everyone has heard of. Likewise, most (whether they've read the book or not) are probably aware of the solution to the crime, but if you are one of the few lucky souls who remain in the dark: consider yourself extremely fortunate and get your hands on a copy before it is given away in casual conversation! (And be careful pursuing these reviews - there's bound to be someone who discusses the ending).Poirot is returning home from Syria and meets up with his good friend Monsieur Bouc, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, who helps him abroad the Orient Express. Oddly enough for this time of year, the train is full of passengers of varied nationalities, including a man known as Samuel Ratchett. Ratchett approaches Poirot with a request: having received several anonymous death threats, the American wants Poirot to investigate the situation and provide some semblance of protection. Disliking the man, Poirot refuses.The following morning, Ratchett is found dead, having been stabbed twelve times in the chest in a rather erratic manner. To make matters worse, the train has become stuck in a blizzard in Yugoslavia, and Monsieur Bouc begs Poirot to investigate so as not to involve the added complication of governmental red tape. Poirot obliges, and what follows is an investigation that relies almost solely on Poirot's interviews with the passengers. Ascertaining that Ratchett was in fact a gangster responsible for the kidnapping and murder of a child, Poirot plumbs the psychological depths of his fellow passengers in order to see who had the motive and opportunity to do the deed.The novel is based on two true events that happened in Christie's lifetime, the first being the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son (an investigation which involved a maid of the household committing suicide after being interrogated by the police on suspicion of her involvement), and the second being Christie's personal experience on the Orient Express in 1931 in which she and other passengers were trapped on board due to the flooding of the track (during which she was said to have met a woman who directly inspired the character of Mrs Hubbard). In the 1970s it was adapted into what is considered the most successful movie adaptation of a Christie novel ever:Murder on the Orient Express, starring Albert Finney as the Belgian detective. There are current plans to adapt it for a second time in the David Suchet television series.The real Orient Express is shrouded in intrigue and glamour (featuring in Bram Stoker'sDraculaand Ian Fleming's James Bond novelFrom Russia with Love- heck, illusionist David Copperfield even made one of its dinner carriages disappear!) and Christie only adds to its mystique with this novel. As such, this is one of Christie's more atmospheric novels, as well as her most sophisticated. The claustrophobic conditions of the snow-bound train somehow heighten the sense of darkness and mystery, and the circumstance of the event that drives the entire plot (the death of a little girl) imbues the entire book with an inescapable sense of tragedy and grief.Make no mistake; this is Christie at the height of her powers. You'll never forget \\"Murder on the Orient Express,\\" and there's a reason it's described as \\"the perfect murder\\"... a description that even takes into account Poirot's presence on board."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book!!!

Mr Poirot certainly has his work cut out for him. There are twelve suspects, but none seem to have a strong motive and most have an alibi. There is a major clue pointing to the identity of the murder in the beginning of the book. After finishing the novel I found myself laughing that I could have overlooked something so obvious. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining read. So many clues, so many suspects, yet Mr Poirot and the two men who assist him with the mystery, the doctor who examined the body and the director of train, come up with nothing but dead end theories until the end of the book.

Given repeated readings I know exactly whodunnit and every twist and turn of the plot but it doesn't matter.

Not now. When it's all over. When its behind us -- then --\\" This quote is essentially the spark that lit the long, winding fuse leading to the explosive labeled, \\"AHA!\\" The person who spoke these intriguing words was Miss Debenham. Hercule Poirot, the main detective in charge of the whole investigation of Rachett's murder, overheard this being said. He started to wonder. This is my favorite line out of the whole book mainly for its meaning and spark. After this was said I automatically knew someone was going to die, hence \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\". I also knew that the two people talking, Miss Debenham and Colonel Arduthnot, were close and may later turn out to be accomplices. In the book it says that Poirot heard this and started to wonder. This says that Poirot is very observant and pays attention to small details and what they could mean. One thing I really liked about this book was how there were three parts. Part one was essentially the story, that is, everything before the murder and the reactions of the people after. Every chapter in part two was an interview between Poirot and one of the passengers from the Calais coach. Part two is when Poirot gathered the bulk of the information he needed to narrow down the murderer/murderers. In part three, all of the pieces were beginning to fall into place and in the end Poirot found out who it was. Or so he thinks. I won't spoil it for you. Another thing I really liked about this book was when you read this book, you don't only read it from one perspective, you get to see what happened from many different perspectives, some more reliable than others. But reliable or not, it still makes the book a lot more interesting. A third thing that made this book very fun to read was that is wasn't that difficult of a read, it was easy to understand and the writing flowed very easily. There was one tiny, unnoticeable downside to this book. Well, I wouldn't even call it a downside. At least half of the book is dialogue so it can get pretty confusing if you get distracted. This is the best book I have read in a very long time. I really enjoyed reading this book and following along with Poirot's train of thought while he was investigating. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and enjoys mystery."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"You willl never guess who did it. There is not a dull moment. The book captivates the reader as if you were actually on the train."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Classic Agatha Christie -- nearly to the point of being campy, but remaining entirely charming. I love the way her writing moves through stages that seem to pull in even the most experienced mystery/detective readers, presenting each possible conclusion as perfectly acceptable before revealing the next twist. In the isolated setting of a snowed in railway, she does a great job of pulling you first to one conclusion and then the next, all of which ultimately pale in comparison to the big reveal-scene. And of course, her characters -- as always -- are wonderfully illustrated and never fall too-neatly into the generic roles of their genre. Christie's writing never dates itself as far as technique is concerned, and I don't think her contributions to detective fiction are ever likely to lose their charm."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is the benchmark for all crime and suspense novels. An instant classic by the Grand Dame herself, it sucks you into an intricate web that you fail to entangle. A train moving through the orient, a list of passengers representative of many segments of the population, the extremely modest Hercule Poirot. What more could you want?

Her greatest talent i think, it the way she satirises her readers through the &quot;pathetic&quot; Poirot"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is probably one of Agatha Christie's best known mysteries, thanks largely to the excellent movie based closely on the book, but it's also one of her best mysteries on its own. Here is Hercule Poirot, the rotund Belgian detective, whom we meet in the restaurant car \\"trying to keep his mustaches out of the soup\\" as the Orient Express is about to begin its run across Central Europe. Also on board are an English governess, a British colonel, an American pseudo-philanthropist and his multilingual secretary, a Russian grande dame, a Hungarian count, a garrulous American matron of certain age, and others representing various countries and nationalities. During the night, one of the passengers is found murdered in his bed, and we learn the next morning that the victim was a vicious child kidnapper and murderer who richly deserved what he got. But who gave it to him is the mystery to be solved. It's the typical English parlor mystery transplanted to the exotic setting of the Orient Express, and it's a brilliant switch. Enter Poirot, sifting through the facts, half-facts and outright inventions, until the mystery is unraveled and we find out not only whodunit, but also who Poirot's fellow passengers really are. It's one of Christie's most satisfying novels, perfectly crafted, concisely written, and totally on target from first to last."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"As I said elsewhere I am not a Hercule Poirot fan.

It was very slow in certain parts of it but at other parts it really sped up & I was very interested. I also thought it was too organized & it made me think very hard but over all I really did like the book."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I'm combining this review of the book and movie together because the stories are so closely related, and I think that anyone who likes the movie will be interested to know about the book, and readers who have enjoyed the book may like to get some details about the movie. The 1974 movie is a true classic, and along with many others I look forward to the time when it will be digitally restored and issued on blu-ray disk.I love the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express movie and have watched it several times over the years on TV and DVD. I've only recently read the book for the first time on Kindle, and was frankly quite amazed to see how faithful the movie was to Christie's novel of the same title written in 1934. Since most of the story takes place on a train, it was relatively easy for producers to keep the movie closely aligned to the book even in many small details, and I'm grateful that they did. After reading the book and seeing how Christie portrayed Poirot as being a more quiet and low key personality, I can appreciate that some criticize the selection and performance of Albert Finney as Poirot because he is often quite emotional and demonstrative, as well as physically different than the Poirot Christie described. This is the only major difference between the 1974 movie and the book, though it can be a crucial difference for Christie fans. I have not seen the later version starring David Souchet as Poirot, but from the reviews on Amazon it seems that at least some changes were made to the story so it apparently does not adhere as closely to the book. I won't comment further on this since I haven't seen it.Christie's story is loosely based on the actual kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's 20-month-old son in 1932. A $50,000 ransom was paid but the baby was murdered and his body was found two months later. A household servant who was suspected by the police of playing a part in the kidnapping did commit suicide.In Christie's story, Hercule Poirot is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. The train is halted at night because of heavy snow and a passenger is found murdered in his bed the following morning. A doctor happens to be on board and tells Poirot that there are twelve stab wounds in the body. Everyone in the coach is a suspect, but what was the motive? Poirot must wade through the maze of contradictory clues and apparent impossibilities, some of which make him recall a child kidnapping/murder that happened a few years previously.The 1974 movie was stylishly done with great performances by an all star cast, and the music is also wonderful.

It can be frustrating when everything is so obvious to Hercule Poirot as the reader is disadvantaged by being in the world of non-fiction. The disadvantage makes the book no less entertaining.Clearly borrowed from the story of the Lindbergh baby, the plot of this novel sees the kidnapper get what he has coming. On the run after murdering a child that he kidnapped, Ratchett is aware that his days are numbered. On the Orient Express, he continues his attempt to flee, even seeking the assistance of Hercule Poirot. When the train becomes stalled in a snow embankment, Ratchett is murdered. While there exists no clear line to the killer, many seem to have some loose connection to the family of the deceased child. Noting the fine details, Poirot makes a stunning revelation in the end. And while the ending may be known to contemporary audiences, watching the plot unravel makes it more remarkable.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is one the better known works of Christie because she is at her best. Veterans of Christie novels may see the ending coming more easily, but will certainly find reading enjoyable."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This classic mystery combining Agatha Christie's knowledge of the early Twentieth Century Middle East, with one of her most intricate plots,keeps you turning the pages and enjoying every word. If you like intellectually challenging mysteries, this is one for your shelf."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it is a great read! It is a true page turner, I read it too fast, now I need to find another book to read. Before reading this book, I had watched a PBS documentary about the Orient Express, this was nice because then while reading the book I had in my mind a very clear image of the train decor, cars, etc. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Tales of detection often depend upon a closed community of characters to provide a limited cast of victims and suspects. Christie has used estates of the wealthy, as in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, but she also set many of her stories at resorts, on islands, on boats, and on trains where one of her detectives happens to find him or herself.The Murder on the Orient Express is a brilliant counterpoint to her, island based, And Then There were None. Christie further isolates the famous train through use of a track-blocking snow storm which allow Hercule Poirot to exercise his resolvent powers.This novel transfered very well to the screen, but the book can be read with enjoyment even by those of us who have viewed the film also.Of Christie's eighty-some detective stories, this one rates with her best.I have no hesitation giving it 5 stars. I love it and will read in again."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"The Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a perfect mystery novel by Agatha Christie where Hercule Poirot is the detective. It takes place on the Orient Express, a train which travels from Stamboul (Istanbul) to Paris. When the train is approaching Yugoslavia a murder occurs and near that time the train has to stop because snow blocks the way. The train staff leader Monsieur Bouc wants Poirot to solve the crime before the train reaches Yugoslavia.This novel is one I would definitely recommend as a detective novel. It is very European in feel. Agatha Christie writes comfortably with both male and female characters and I wouldn't have known her gender by her writing because her portrayal of men is dead-on correct in the manner in which men act. This is a good novel to read on a rainy day with a cup of tea to drink."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"After my daughter read it for a report, I wrestled the book away from my wife to read it again for myself. Fortunately, I'd forgotten the plot in the two or three decades since last reading it.It did not disappoint me. The plot is ingenious and the characters come alive. It falls a little short of five stars because of the inclusion of some objectionable stereotypes of women, Italians, and various other nationalities including the cold-fish British. Also, Agatha Christie generally includes misleading details in an unfairly dense profusion for those of us trying to guess the truth in the plot, although that was consistent with the plot in this case.A story that should be read by anyone remotely interested in murder mysteries."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"The plot is intricate, fascinating and suspense filled. You will find yourself turning page after page to discover what could possible happen next. The plot moves fast and the conversations are full of clues. Pay close attention.

It is a true masterpiece of mystery writing."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"To begin with, do NOT buy this book from Amazon. The mass market paperback is priced in the bookstore at $5.99, but on Amazon it is $6.99 plus shipping. Just go to the bookstore and pick it up.This is one of the most interesting murder mysteries I have ever read. Every little element, every little slip of the tongue by each of the suspects, every piece of evidence - real or faked - will keep you guessing right up until the end. I just kept reading and reading late into the night because the evidence and suspects were so confusing. I changed my mind about who was the true murderer at least four times. I won't reveal the actual plot, but it will surprise you right up to the last page.This is actually the first Agatha Christie mystery that I have read (surprisingly) and I'm glad that I picked it up. Although there were times that I considered everything about Hercule Poirot to be almost cheesy, in the end his methods were justified, and I really enjoyed the story. I will definitely pick up a few more Poirot mysteries in the coming future."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is the greatest mystery book I ever read. It has a magical ends, it seems unbelievable, but actually followed tips really well."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I've been thinking quite a bit recently about MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, the first adult mystery I read--too many years ago. I thought then, and I still think today, that MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the perfect classic mystery. Christie created a murder in a stranded railroad car--a murder her sleuth Hercule Poirot must solve. She has a classic collection of suspects, and a crime supposedly impossible to commit. Poirot, of course, solves the crime, and I still admire this book decades after I first read it."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"When Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express he is surpised by the loud diversity of people on the train. From a Russian Princess to an English governess the train is filled with different classes, and nationalities. THe last thing he expects is a murder to take place. But when it dose, only he can find the killer. As Poirot shifts through the clues and interviews every member on the train he finds out the case is connected to a kidnapping mystery that took place in America year ago. Thus complicating things ever futhur. Can he solve the case? Or will the killer slip between his fingers.When I saw the book assigned to me on my summer Junior year British Literature reading list I was happy to actually get to read a decent book. And when I read it I was swept up in the mystery of things, trying to find the real killer myself. Poirot is an interesting and clever charecter. This was my first Agatha Christie book but it won't be my last. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is probably Agatha Christie's best-known book (largely because it is the only one that made a really good movie). It is an exceptionally atmospheric book; there is something haunting about a train caught in a snowdrift miles from nowhere. The solution, oddly enough, is not really much of a surprise; Poirot's investigation proceeds in such a way that you do see the solution coming before it is revealed. But I think this was intentional on Christie's part (her plotting is so beautifully precise that it is hard to think she would make such a slip). Also, the lack of surprise at the end is more than made up for by the exceptional (even for Christie) attention to detail shown here; this is certainly a triumph for Poirot as well as Christie."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book that I have ever read and believe me, it really made me wanna read much more. The beginning started off a little slow, but as soon as I got to the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. The basic plot is that a murder has occurred on a train filled with strangers. It feels terrible to know that you will be stuck on a train for at least 2 days(this is because of a snow storm) on the same train as a murderer. The victim is an American kidnapper, so detective Hercule Poirot tries his best to question all the passengers, trying to find someone who is involved with the kidnapping case. The end is very unexpected, but I wasn't too happy with it. Overall, I suggest that anyone who loves mysteries and suspense read it soon!!!!!!!-Reviewed by Preethi"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a \\"motley crue\\" - Poirot employs \\"the little gray cells\\" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.There is nothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I first read this book a half-century ago, and, in my youth, I was very impressed by it. I've just read it again, having forgotten most of the details of the plot, and did not find it nearly as good as I had remembered.The novel did not seem to be &quot;fleshed out.&quot; The denouement was a bit too bizarre. Poirot is just a trifle too facile in his logic. The characters seem leftover from a dozen other works.The British train was, for some reason, the perfect setting for a murder mystery and was employed many times for that purpose. The Orient Express does provide an excellent backdrop for this study in murder, not entirely separate from the Lindbergh case that was the &quot;crime of the century&quot; when this was published. The method of laying out the plot is quite good, if a little too thin. Most books tend to be overwritten--&quot;too many words.&quot; This one needed more, somehow. As I turned the last page I found that I just was not convinced that this could have happened.

I needed more elaboration in order to see the scene, the characters, etc. I also thought that the structure of the book was too \\"fill in the blank.\\" By this I mean that the book lacked transitions and it was as if the various parts of the book were written independently of one another and then were strung together at the end."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This book was a good book.

The book was good and it kept u intrigued in each chapter mostly."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I read about 60 Agatha Christie mysteries in my teens. It took me about a year to realize that she's a mediocre writer. It seems like she owes her fame to the lower demands placed on escapism in a different era. I can't imagine that if she started her career today the results would be the same. She's not real challenging. I don't remember much about them, except that she averaged one good book for every 15 I read. The 4 that still distinguish themselves in my memory are Crooked House, Towards Zero, Roger Aykroyd and this.This generally reads like an outline. I mentally checked out after about three pages. That's how I recall her, years later; an author that \\"checks out\\" once she gave the formula a crank. The middle of this book has been described as \\"inert.\\" Each page offers slim reasons to continue on. A crime occurs followed by a long sequence of interviews. That's just not very engaging and probably causes the books main problem; It doesn't build. Only in the last three chapters does Poirot get things moving again. Her writing doesn't draw you in. It doesn't offer much to envision. Her characterization is not strong. She avoids writing in which characters aren't speaking.(Spoiler)You actually do have a better chance of guessing the solution here than in the 1974 movie (which is enjoyable for other reasons). Remember until the last few pages of the book the red herrings are all a reader has, and it's a long trip though those phoned-in middle chapters. The apparent mystery is just not interesting and it's solved with about ten seconds of thought, so why waste 23 chapters on it? It would have been a better book if she had constructed those middle chapters with more complexity.People probably don't admire this book for the writing. Ignoring the fact that these characters probably would not have been able to assemble anonymously, the book is a clever solution that deserves a better lead-upSide note: It seems like you'd have to have some very poor taste, to include the Lindbergh kidnapping (\`32) as a major plot point just two years after it occurred. Christie also took actress Gene Teirney's exposure to german measles (and subsequent retarded & blind child) at an Army canteen and used it in The Mirror Crack'd."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"The book arrived within the scheduled arrival time and in good condition.

I am a great fan of hers, but I have to say this book sort of dissapointed me. I found it boring. 18 chapters in total were all just Poirot interviewing the suspects. And I didn't find the end surprising at all. To me, there wasn't any climax, and all in all it was pretty boring. I really don't see why this book is so popular. Some of my favorites are Easy to Kill, And then there were none, and N or M."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"To her credit, Agatha Christie surprised me with the solution to this locked room murder mystery, but in my defense, that's because the solution was entirely nonsensical.Without getting into any spoilers, this mystery novel has its good points. There is a certain 1930s charm to it, especially with a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" subplot about a thinly disguised Lindbergh Baby story, and an assumption that every woman on the train wears a \\"dressing gown\\" to bed, and an assumed knowledge of how servants are expected to behave in the estate of a wealthy family. There is some (unintentional?) humor as characters pat themselves on the back for how socioeconomically diverse the train's passenger list is.. before they (And Christie as narrator) proceed to show condescending contempt for the second-class passengers and Italians. And Christie's portrayal of Americans is great (for example, an American man wears a loud suit, smacks his gum, and says \\"OK\\" a lot, although at least a little of this is revealed to be an intentional misdirection on his part). I spent most of the book frustrated that some of the second-tier investigator characters weren't noticing some of the big obvious clues, but Christie surprised me when Poirot got around to explaining the meaning of the clues.**MILD SPOILER ALERT**The solution to the mystery, though, is simply nonsensical and unfair to the reader. It is clever and brings an element of artistic/moral satisfaction, but it just doesn't correspond to human behavior at all. However, I am intrigued by the almost postmodern way the solution challenges a reader's presumptions about mystery stories and presents almost an epistemological crisis (how do we know what we know? We presume that the murderer is lying, but I think we implicitly trust at least a little of what other suspects say, especially when we see confirmation, and Christie rocks us with an ending based on layer upon layer of lies and manipulation.). I can't exactly recommend this book, as the ending is too frustrating and the characters are too unbelievable along the way, but I find myself intrigued by the (I think) unintended philosophical challenges..."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder On the Orient Express was a story about a detective by the name of Hercule Poirot. While he was on a train going to London, a murder occurred, and he was asked to step in to try to solve it. With every person on the train a suspect, you'll never believe the twisted ending.My opinion of the book was that I didn't like it very much. The plot was simple, but it got confusing for me with all the different characters that were involved. It was difficult for me to understand, and keep everything straight. I most certainly didn't enjoy it. I would not recommend this book, unless you want to be bored to death."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"It was my first time to read this about a week ago, yeah I know I am a loser.

Well, its bad enough that the plots goes a little bit dragging for my taste but to think that it is very famous makes it all the more dreadful.The ending I was hoping for was not there.

Agatha Christie sets up all the rules of crime and then shatters it right before your eyes! Truly ingenious! Worth the read!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Agatha Cristie does it again, in her Hercule Poirot mystery, Murder on the Orient Express. Known as Mystery's #1 Best-selling Author Agatha Cristie writes the astonishing mystery about a detective, Hercule Poirot, on vacation when a snowstorm brings his train to a standstill a murder takes place in the cabin next to his own. Agatha Cristie has great talent when twisting plots and this is no exception.In the beginning of the book, chapters two and three, Agatha Cristie leads you on to suspicious characters before the crime even takes place. In this specific case some of the members on the train are built even before Hercule gets on the Orient Express. He encounters a man and a women on his previous train of whom he is suspicious of and even the victim and his co workers, all of which he quickly decides to keep a close eye on. A few pros and cons with this technique are as follow. The con, at some points you feel as the story will never continue, that the whole time all you will know about is this persons paranoia. The pros, firstly, you feel as though you must continue to read because something is bound to happen. Another point is you began to think you know who are the bad guys and as mentioned early Agatha Cristie knows how to twist a plot.Towards the middle of the book, chapter 63, another story is introduced. One of a crime that took place a few years back. The second story, is brought up from a piece of evidence, it is about a three year old girl who was kidnapped and turned up dead, weeks later. When it is first introduced it could tend to be a bit confusing and also a little frustrating because just when you think you know who the murderer is in a single chapter you know there's more to it then you originally thought. This does however add a bit of excitement to pick the book back up after a couple of informative yet on the boring side chapters. This gives the detective his hunch that this kidnapping case will lead him to the murder.The next section in the book is labeled the Evidence. In which Agatha Cristie introduces you to every member in the coach. She goes through and gets to you to feel sorry for some and suspicious of others. This part is great, and is why the characters being built before the crime is no longer a necessity. This part leads up to some great discoveries made by the detective and evidently the unusual and surprising outcome.Agatha Cristie is able to teach and put morals into the most unusual stories in this case she incorporates pay back, love, and the common never give up ideas. Though this is not my favorite mystery of all time I have no regrets in reading it and do plan on reading future Agatha Cristie novels."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" By Agatha ChristieThe book I read was \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\" I liked this book a lot. It is very suspensful and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. I love the way Agatha Christie writes. She makes her stories so good that you cannot put the book down until you finish it. This is one of the good books written by Agatha Christie and is enjoyed by people from all over.I liked the book and enjoyed reading it, because Agatha Christie writes books so well. When she made Hercule Poirot the main character,it made the book even better. I love the way he solves mysteries and the way he asks questions. He is so good at asking questions that he gets the person he is talking to, to answer the question correctly. He is also very good at solving mysteries and is correct in his guess in the end. I like the way M. Poirot speaks. Agatha Christie writes so well that you could hear his accent when you read the book. In the book he said some things that made it seem like you could hear him talking. Here are some quotes: \\"You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute my inquirities,\\" he said with a twinkle.This is on page 146. Poirot emergered \\"Nothing,\\" he said. \\"Not even a compromising bequest!\\" This is on page 187. \\"I like to see an angry Englishman,\\" said Poirot. \\"They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel the less command they have of language.\\" This is on page 232.The main theme of the book is: \\"If someone jumps over the bridge, would you jump too?\\" The theme is saying, just because someone committed a murder, it does not mean you have to go and kill them back. You should not go so low and be just like the criminal. Then, you too, will become the criminal. One person was going to kill Mr. Ratchett, but then he called more people and they all listened to him. They should not follow the person if they believed it was not the right decision to make. Another theme is: \\"You should not get revenge for your hate.\\" This means hate is the reason people want to get revenge. The last theme is: \\"Hate can come back and haunt you.\\" Mr. Ratchett killed someone from hate, and the hate came back and killed him. I do agree with the main theme. It is very true and people should believe in their heart and not do what other people tell them. Also, I agree with the other themes they are also true.I would recommend the book to others, because it is such a good book. I had a fun time reading it. It teaches you about life and to be a good person. People should not tell lies, like the characters in the book or they will be caught in the end. It is so mysterious and a book everyone will have fun reading. If you like mysteries, this is a good book to read. Each page is filled with clues to find out who the murderer is.

He is able to find evidence that is out of the ordinary"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"What gets me every time reading these detective murder mysteries is the amazing ability of the detective (Hercule Poirot in this case) to observe and make educated guesses about whether this or that happened; which clues are significant and which are not. The hero of these stories is in fact Poirot, not any of the characters. He is like Sherlock Holmes: he sees what other people do not see. He observes with 1000x magnification while others must be content with 2x. He logically deduces conclusions with agility, while others are left dumbfounded. In short, Poirot's reputation is well deserved. We, as readers instinctively root for him because we know that he will always get his man.Christie concentrates on character development. While Poirot is a familiar figure, the other characters are completely new to the reader. We have the villain Ratchett contrasted with the other passengers: Hardman, Col. Arbuthnot, Princess Dragonmiroff, Count Andrenyi, Countess Andrenyi, Mrs. Hubard, Greta Chisson, Mary Debenham, Hildegrade Schmidt, and Hector MacQueen. Each of the characters has their own peculiarities and their own reasons for being on the Orient Express. When Ratchett is murdered on board the train, it is Poirot's job to discern who the murderer is. In this case the conclusion is very unusual.On the whole, I enjoy reading Agatha Christie mysteries. This one in particular is iconic and makes for a good character study. It also helps to see the movie to better appreciate the subtleties of the book. The book is organized to a tee and draws the reader in to drawing their own conclusions before the end of the book. Astute readers will identify the culprit (probably early on in the book), but will still enjoy the book nonetheless. Agatha Christie maintains her reputation with each book she wrote. While the book is somewhat formulaic in the overall structure, it is nevertheless enjoyable."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Great Book Highly recommend!

As the author of classic British mysteriesHundred Thousand Dragons, A (Jack Haldean Mysteries)Agatha Christie is the writer I turn to most for inspiration and sheer enjoyment. I love the way we get to know the characters so quickly and the mystery builds so well.

If you read any Agatha Christie, if you're even considering reading any Agatha Christie, read &quot;Murder on the Orient Express.&quot; The ending is sure to surprise, and throughout there is the joy of watching the great little Belgian, Hercule Poirot at work -- meticulous, exacting, and rather insufferable in person, I would imagine, but interesting to read about!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Agatha Christie does a wonderful job, and this book is a good one.

Overall the book is exciting, and I would recommend it to any mystery lover."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Reading Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express is like calling up an old friend. It is alway a familiar comfort. This book is so perfectly Christie. All of her favourite character types are here as suspects and the action is stripped down to Poirot simply interviewing one of these suspicious characters after another in his own inimitable style. The solution is joyous, but almost sublimely ridiculous, and many of the clues with which Poirot uses to solve the crime are denied to the reader but still this is one of Christie's more elegant reads (to speak nothing of the perfect film version which even improves on the book). This is the one to pick up and read again and again to get away from any of the stresses of a long day. Simply the best."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"this would be a good choice.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is one of the most well known mysteries of all time, and for good reason, it is brilliant. The story begins with Hercule Poirot beginning a journey on the famed Orient Express. His fellow travelers are a mixed lot; an American businessman and his secretary/assistant and his valet, a Russian Princess and her maid, a Hungarian Count and Countess, a governess, a missionary, a British military man returning from India and two salesman, one American and the other Italian.On the second night out one of the group is murdered, murdered several times over by multiple stab wounds. The train is also snowbound. Poirot quickly discovers that the murderer must still be on the train and works to solve the crime before the train is freed and the killer able to escape, or kill again. He soon learns that the victim is not exactly who he seems, and in fact was connected with a famous kidnapping/murder case.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is an example of how Christie took the events of her day, in this instance the Lindbergh kidnapping, combined with her own experiences (she traveled on the Orient Express many times) to write her novels. Christie also pushed the rules of detective fiction in this one, as she did in THE MURDER OF ROGER AKROYD earlier and would again later in AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (TEN LITTLE INDIANS), to come up with a novel solution."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Inspector Poirot is at first confused by the murder which occurs while he is on the Orient Express. The man who is murdered is traveling under a false identity as Mr. Ratchett, while he is actually the man who murdered a baby in a notorious case in America. While Poirot questions each person, he begins to form an opinion as to the solution to the murders. His friend M. Bouc becomes increasingly confused as he hears the passengers' testimonies, and some stories seem to contradict others. He changes his mind several times as to who he thinks is the murderer while Poirot remains ever confident that he has the solution. This is one of Christie's best-known works and it was made into a movie many years ago. It is recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This particular mystery is actually a little slower and less engaging than other Christie novels. For one thing, the author gives Poirot an ascendant over the supposedly-expert medical examiner on board the train, making the doctor second guess himself a little too often (a nationality bias on Christie's part). Second, the victim is a hated man, making the murder less sensational, but the fact that the train is snowbound and that no one can escape the Express makes for a less-than-exciting notion that the killer is still on board (though everyone acts as if under sedation during their &quot;enforced captivity&quot;). As the mystery is unraveled, the entire truth appears on the instant, abruptly ending any suspense. This is my 2nd Christie mystery after &quot;Death on the Nile,&quot; a much more gripping book."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"The Murder on the Orient Express is a book that fascinates everyone who reads it. If you like suspicion and are curious, that book has a great story. On the trip in train Orient Express there are 14 people going to Paris and one person is killed and everyone becomes suspected. It is your job to go over the book and have a great time reading trying to find out who is the murderer. It is a very interesting book because after each chapter you will be changing your opinion about WHO DID IT? Hercule Poirot is a very good detective that was on the train. With his great strategies he reveals the real murderer."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is one of the best books I've ever read.

Agatha Christie writes a muder mystery in a manner that doesn't dwell on the immorality of the situation; she doesn't stoop to the level of using sex or violence to capturing her reader's attention.

And you have a chance at guessing the bad guy!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"It was a pretty good book because it kept me wanting to read it."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a foundation upon which Agatha Christie's reputation rests. It is the famous story of the murder on the train loaded full of suspects. It has been made into several films, and I have enjoyed reding this book several times."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I haven't read a mystery of this ilk in a long time and it was a breath of fresh air. Agatha Christie wrote this book in 1934 and it's a beaut! It stars her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. It seems to me many books and movies like 'After The Thin Man' have stolen Agatha's idea of gathering all the suspects for one final interrogation to solve the case. Can anybody do it better than Agatha, who has out-sold every published work except the Bible and Shakespeare? Maybe the only character that can challenge Hercule Poirot is Agatha's other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple. Since this book was written so long ago, it gives the reader the flavor of the times, such as the European attitude towards America, the style of clothing, and the reminiscence of long train trips.The story starts with our hero boarding the Orient Express in Aleppo, Syria, after a successful investigation for the French Army. He meets one of the directors of the company that runs the Orient train, M.Bouc. Hercule Poirot joins the other thirteen passengers, M. Bouc, a Dr. Constantine, and one conductor in the Athens-Paris Coach. And folks we are off to the races!! One of the passengers, a Mr. Ratchett, who is of vile and dubious character turns up dead on the first night of the trip. He's been stabbed twelve times in his bunk. To make matters worse, the train is now at a standstill, snowed-in by a blizzard. That means the killer is stranded on the train and posses a threat to the remaining twelve passengers on the Athens-Paris car. As you probably guessed, the director of the train, M. Bouc, engages our lovable and pyknic detective, Hercule Poirot. Let the Lumosity exercises begin! The rest of the novel is a cat-and-mouse game between the twelve passengers and Hercule. I tried to figure out who the killer was and I didn't even come close!It's amazing to me how Agatha Christie can make the reader visualize all seventeen people on the train in only 265 pages. I liked the way Agatha has Hercule use the director ( M. Bouc ), and the doctor ( Constantine ) as a sounding board to test his theories. He actually makes them think that they are helping him solve the mystery. This is a very sound novel and completely enjoyable. I am totally drawn- in to this series and hope to read 'Death on The Nile' in the very near future. Do yourself a favor and read A Hercule Poirot novel right now, especially this one."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"So I have rated this title 5 stars for the story, however I feel that the Kindle edition deserves four stars for these (relatively minor) reasons:1) There were randomly missing spaces between some words (5-6 times or so in the whole book). This never impeded understanding, but I did find it a minor distraction/annoyance. I have no idea if this is also true of the print copy of the book or not.2) I wish this edition had footnotes with French translations for those of us who are a little rusty in the subject. The usage of French throughout the book is minimal, and really you can probably get the general gist from the context in most cases, but as I like to know exactly what is being said I was still pulling out my phone to use Google translate as I read."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is the perfect place to start if you intend to read murder mystery books with any regularity. The story has been done in plays and movies and on TV for decades but it is only in reading it that you catch the early clues and nuances of the characters. Your knowledge is broadened to the allure of foreign languages and refined mannerisms of different nationalities.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is an easy read. The foreign expressions are brief and easily researched if one wishes to translate them. The descriptions of clothing, appearance, and behavior are easily visualized and not a hindrance to the flow and enjoyment of the narrative. Certainly I would recommend this book to eighth grade readers and up. Murder is a serious crime and in reading this story young readers become acquainted with the deductive and methodical system of reasoning. Education is advanced when \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is required reading in class."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a true classic of a murder mystery. Ms. Christie chose Hercule Poirot to try to solve this puzzling mystery.Someone has been killed. The someone is not so nice. The murder took place on The Orient Express, a famous European train. The train is, at the moment, stranded in a snow drift. The cast of suspects is varied and unusual. The solution to the mystery is pure Agatha Christie.I have, also, seen two or three different video versions of this mystery. The book seems to have some advantages over the video versions. Still, it is obvious that this mystery weaves a spell over its fans.This may be one of the best murder mysteries of all time, but I have never been thrilled with it. Things get too confusing in parts. Also, Hercule's accent and unusual character sometimes adds to the confusion. Finally, it does take effort to follow how the murder must have happened. I wish it were possible to make this story flow a bit better.Read the book and watch any of the video versions. I do like Hercule's fi9nal resolution. And, that says something about us humans."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"In her autobiography, Dame Agatha wrote that when she journeyed on the orient express, nothing more exciting happened than that she had to kill a few bed bugs. The journey, however, provided ideas for one of her most ingenious and tightly-plotted books.So brilliant is the construction that she manages to have Poirot concoct two possible explanations of what happened and who did it - each involving a dozen suspects. Expect to find Poirot present on almost every page, a wide range of characters who \\"talk up\\" well in the requisite interviews, some humour, and a resolution that bypasses the need for justice to be done.Only one film adaptation of this book has been attempted so far. It premiered during Dame Agatha's final year and she pronounced herself well-satisfied with it. More satisfying to me has been listening to David Suchet's reading of the book. Adopting and switching between perhaps twenty different accents, male and female, while reserving a clearly recognizable narrative voice, he easily feeds my imagination with travellers, a train, and a tale.In the 1930s, writers of detective fiction still retained the earlier convention of including, towards the end, a survey of who might have committed the crime, considering motive, opportunity, alibi, etc. This happens here. I registered a falling off of interest while this occurred; otherwise I was a willing and vastly entertained captive."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"After watching the different movie versions (repeatedly) of Murder On The Orient Express over the years, I finally got around to reading the book.

To do so, Poirot has to question every member aboard the Orient Express letting you get to know the characters. The ending of the book is wonderful, with a surprise no one would have guessed from the beginning. Agatha Christie does a great job of laying down the identities of the characters and letting the reader choose whether that identity is real or fake."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"My first Agatha Christie book, and it was AWESOME.

When I was an eighth grade, we had to do a book report on a mystery from the school library. I ended up grabbing this book at the last minute just because I needed one. I've never regretted it. This book has introduced me to Agatha Christie and this is her at her best.You have a wide assortment of nationalities all stuck on a train, on which a murder has just occured. Hercule Poirot happens to be on the train and takes up the case. His only clues are a match, a burned note, a handkercheif, a pipe cleaner, & a broken watch. Poirot manages to solve the case with just those four clues and information from interviews with the passengers.I'm typically pretty good at solving mysteries half way through the book. Here, I was stumped. One page made me certain it was a American and the next it was an Italian. And then there's the HUGE twist at the end. I didn't see it coming and you probably won't see it coming. Unlike many mysteries, this twist actually made sense and was the perfect solution to an apparently perfect crime!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I had a really fascinating traveling experience by reading this Agatta Christie's novel.

All the 13 passengers have alibis. Only a pipe cleaner, a scarlet kimono, a monogrammed handkerchief and a watch pointing to 1:15 a.m. are the physical evidences. You will be able to follow step by step the inquiries of the famous detective Poirot, who by interviewing all the passengers discovers a strange relation between the victim, the Armstrongs which are a wealthy American family, and the murderer.

After solving some case in Syria, Poirot hopes to unwind in Turkey for a few days, but receives a telegram urging him to come to London immediately. With some difficulty, he secures a berth on the train, finding himself surrounded by a lively cast of characters from Europe and the United States. Not long after departure, one of them is found dead, and Poirot is tasked with determining who of his fellow passengers is the culprit.Agata Christie did not become one of the world's bestselling authors by writing particularly deep characters or original narrative. Poirot's international companions on the train are ethnic caricatures, with the Italian initially fingered as the murder because of that nation's supposed blind passion, and Americans portrayed as uncouth and rustic. The solution is in many respects a deus ex machina. Nonetheless, the novel is an entertaining enough read if one wants some light to pass a couple of hours. Christie's depiction of her protagonist, ambiguous in his sexuality and lacking fashion sense, is always amusing. The investigative methods used will also provide a chuckle in how they violate the rights of suspects and ignore local laws."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on The Orient ExpressAuthor: Agatha ChristieGenre: MysteryPages: 245Murder on The Orient Express talks about a detective named Monsieur Poirot, who tries to unpuzzle the mystery of the death of Mr. Ratchett. It takes place on a train, which holds passengers, Mary Debenham, Colonel Arbuthnot, Hector MacQueen, Antonio Foscarelli, Edward Masterman, Cyrus Hardman, Princess Dragomiroff, Greta Ohlsson, Mrs. Hubbard, Hildegarde Schmidt, Count Andrenyi, and Countess Andrenyi, are all suspects of the murder of Mr. Ratchett.In the beginning, Mr. Poirot returns from his affair in Syria. Along the way, in Stamboul, he meets his old friend, Monsieur Bouc. Mr. Bouc, is the director for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, meaning, International Company of Wagon Lits, joins Mr. Poirot to London. Leaving Stamboul, Poirot meet a man named Mr. Ratchett, a very wealthy man, with many enemies. Ratchett offers Poirot a job but refuses it. Poirot meets several other passengers and goes to sleep.In the morning, Mr. Poirot learns that Mr. Ratchett is dead. In the scene of the crime, Mr. Ratchett was found stabbed 12 times. Also there, was found a handkerchief and a pipe. What was this supposed to mean? In this story, the clues get tougher and the case get more confusing. Will Monsieur Poirot ever find out who murdered Mr. Ratchett? Read Murder on The Orient Express to find out! I rated this book 5 stars, because I love mystery books and this one is the best one so far.This mystery book will keep you running around in a maze trapped to find out the mystery of Mr. Ratchett and will keep you guessing till the end of the book This book keeps you guessing over and over again which was what I liked about this book. I recommend this book for kids age 12 and up. There are also more books by Agatha Christie another good mystery book with Monsieur Poirot, like Death on the Nile, another puzzling mystery, where Linnet Ridgeway, a greedy woman, takes her friend Jackie's fianc&eacute;, Simon. They take a trip on the Nile and someway Linnet appears to be dead. Can Mr. Poirot figure out who murdered Linnet? Read Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"The book Murder on the Orient Express is a good book with many unexpected occurances. The Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot , is on a train ride when a murder happens. The killer is unknown and Poirot has no leads because all passengers have well- developed alibis. The man murdered was an American businessman that was stabbed twelve times and because of heavy snowfall on the trip, the train was stopped. Since the train was stopped the murder was still on board. The detective had only three clues to work with. He then began to find many of the passangers on board knew more than they told. The killer is quite ironic and very hard to guess. As usual, Herule Poirot found the killer and the Simplon Orient Express returned to its station with the killer caught."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This book is such an awesome book. If you are not sure which Agatha Christie to start off with, choose this book! Hercule Poirot is a mastermind at work, and beware, Agatha picks the person who least expect. Once I picked the book up, it was impossible to put it down. It's not one of those boring books that dragged on and on. Read some of her other books too, they're just great!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"A train ride, a murder, 12 suspects, and one decision. Hercule Poirot must investigate the crime and solve the mystery. Monsieur Ratchett was found dead in his compartment with the window left open. But that wasn't how the murderer got out because it was snowing and there would have been footprints. Ratchett was stabbed 12 times so it obviously wasn't a suicide. Mrs. Hubbard claims that there was a man in her compartment that night. Turns out that when M. Poirot came up with a solution to the murder, he was correct. All 12 people on the train had stabbed M. Ratchett one time each. It's a wonder how everyone on the train at that exact time knew who Monsieur Ratchett was and why would they all want him dead so bad? Well, Ratchett wasn't his real name. That was an alias, his real name was Cassetti. He was on the run for kidnapping and murdering a little girl named Daisy Armstrong. Everyone on the train had set everything up so they all would be there to all stab him once each. Everyone had some sort of connection to the Armstrong family. I really enjoyed this book a lot because it's very suspenseful and you never know what's going to happen next.This is a very interesting book. I like it a lot because it's very suspenseful. Every time M. Poirot thought that he had something figured out, something else would pop up. Like when M. Poirot thought that a woman most likely killed M. Ratchett, the Italian man said that the killer was a short man with dark hair and a womanish voice, a description that didn't fit anyone on the train. Then when M. Poirot thought he had figured out that there were only 2 killers, he found out he was wrong. M. Poirot also automatically decided that Mrs. Hubbard could not have been one of the killers because the weapon was found in her bag and if she did kill Ratchett, she wouldn't have hid the weapon in her own bag. And also because she stated that the murderer had escaped through her compartment. But M. Poirot found himself wrong again.This book by Agatha Christie is also one of my favorite books because you never know who to suspect as the killer. First you suspect Mr. MacQueen because he seems suspicious and he's Ratchett's secretary and he seems to know Ratchett the most. Then you suspect the Italian man because Ratchett is Italian and he seems to know Ratchett a lot too. Then you suspect Countess Andrenyi because her husband made her book suspicious. And lastly you suspect the Wagon Lit Conductor because there was a missing button found in Ratchett's compartment and on the conductor's suit, there was a missing button. I like this book a lot. I like how everyone is guilty and how you can't tell who the murderer is.I also really like The Murder on the Orient Express because it is very creative and unique. I absolutely love the way Christie set this murder up. Everyone on the train was related to the Armstrong family somehow. Whether it was a maid, cook, friend, butler, etc. Everyone's story fir together perfectly and it was well planned out. Countess Andrenyi changed her name (and smudged her passport to make it unreadable) from Helena to Elena because her handkerchief was found in M. Ratchett's compartment and she didn't want them to know that her real first name started with the letter \\"H\\" because on the handkerchief her initial was sewed onto it. Everyone on the train denied smoking a pipe except for Mr. Hardman because there was a pipe cleaner found in M. Ratchett's compartment also. And Mr. Hardman's pipe cleaners didn't match up with the one found. They hid the weapon in Mr. Hubbard's bag because they knew that she was less likely to be suspected. And the dragon kimono robe was placed on top of M. Poirot's bags so he wouldn't find out who owned the kimono robe. All the timings were precise for when interviewing with M. Poirot. Someone even set M. Ratchett's watch onto a certain time (1:15) so they would confuse M. Poirot which didn't work. This book was one of the greatest mysteries ever. I love this book.Overall this book was definitely one of my top 3. It's just a fantastic book. Agatha Christie is a wonderful author who knows what she's doing. This book was well planned out and very organized. Everything fit and everything was perfected. This is a wonderful book and you should read it."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha ChristieAgatha Christie has become an antique. She may once upon a time have broken ground for her genre. She certainly became its poster child, selling unbelievable numbers of book and becoming the go-to comparison for any female mystery writer who aspired to greatness - Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham, P.D. James.A catchy tune or two and some good PR can go a long way - think of the Monkees, and all the boy bands that have proliferated since. But four BILLION copies in circulation, and claiming the third rank behind Shakespeare and the Bible as most widely published? Those are truly awesome numbers.I decided to read Murder on the Orient Express (or MotOE) because we recently got a boxful of Christie books at an auction. I enjoyed them when I was younger, and first started reading mysteries. They were often stuffy and slightly dumb, but it was a stereotypical stuffiness that defined \\"British\\". Part of the magic of Christie is that she introduced into that perfectly conventional scene the convention defying. I refer to the slightly subversive quality of the characters she made famous: Miss Marple, the wise old everywoman who never misses a trick while hiding in plain sight, and Hercule Poirot, the fussy little foreigner who was amusing until he had your nuts to the fire.The problem I find after reading MotOE is that I enjoy watching the BBC version of Poirot's adventures more than I enjoyed reading the book. The reason is simple - it only takes an hour to watch, which is about right for these stories. What you lose in the translation is a lot of red herring dangling, and a load of outdated British-isms.I have been thinking about how to reduce the number of books on our shelves to make room for, well, more books, and since I finished MotOE I have been eyeing those Christie's, which are occupying a long stretch of bookshelf real estate. All of which brings me back to Dame Agatha being an antique. One of the things that make antiques worth keeping is their value, and that is often dependant in turn on their scarcity. This is where Christie's publishing history starts to work against her - with 4 billion in print, it's going to be a long time before they are worth anything at all. Now that I think of it, the DVD's of the BBC versions are thinner than the books, and they have three episodes each. Hmm ...."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is one of Christie's finest books. With a great plot, it's one you can't put down. If you pay very close attention, you will probably figure it out.Also Recommended: And Then There Were None"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express was a good book. It had me thinking the whole time. The story takes place on a train. There is a world famous detective that gets on the train, and the first thing he notices is all the different nationalities of the people. Then after switching trains a few times he gets on a train that is headed for a snow storm. The train is stopped and the detective notices a few weird things goin on. The next morning he wakes up and the guy in the coach next to him has been murdered. It was not of the famous detectives best interest to investigate the murder, but since the train was stopped and his friend had convinced him, he really had no other choice. So the detective got to his usual business and started investigating the scene of the crime. Then he interviewed everyone on the train. After interviewing he came to no conlusion, untill he added bits and pieces together. He then interviewed everyone another time. Which is when he came to his conclusion. The victim, which was not a well liked man in the first place, was stabbed thirteen times. There were fifteen passengers, and it ended up that the victim was killed by thirteen of the fifteen passangers, and each of the thirteen passengers were connected to the victim in some way or another.

When a man is found stabbed in his apartment, Poirot has to investigate the crime.After the murder was discovered, the story started to pick up speed. Christie separates the later chapters into individual interrogations with each suspect, which makes the book seem like less of a novel and more of an evidence log, bringing to mind shows like Law and Order. However, I liked this method; it made me feel like she was presenting me with the facts so that I could deduce what happened.The dialogue was a bit stiff, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the story is set in the early 1900s, when people were typically more articulate.

That's why I was a bit disappointed to slog through reading one of her most famous books, Murder on the Orient Express.The mystery itself is a good one, the old room locked from the inside conundrum, and the solution at the end was good and the explanation of clues satisfying, but I found the story telling itself to be very tedious. It's a seemingly endless recitation of interviewing everyone on the train, then searching everyone's luggage, then interviewing everyone again and again. It was very tedious to sit through multiple interviews with every single person of interests on the train.Part of what I, and most people, enjoy about a mystery is trying to guess \\"who done it.\\" But the large number of characters and red herrings in the story, and the amount of time spent on them, made me give up trying to figure out the puzzle and what to just skip to the last chapter so it would be over with.All in all, its still a Christie novel so that makes it a good one, but I'll never read it again."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Length:: 5:48 Mins"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"There's been a murder in compartment No. 2 on the Orient Express.

There is a brutal murder that takes place on the train while it's in transit to its destination, but who could the killer be? There are a number of killer prospects, because they were all on the train at the time the murder was committed and the killer could not have left the train since it's been stopped by snow drifts on the track, so we know the killer is still onboard.We follow Mr. Hercule Poirot, detective, throughout the whole book, as it's him who's doing all of the questioning, and solving this unbelievable case.

This &quot;who dunnit?&quot; is about a detective, Hercule Poirot who is on a train when an infamous mobster is murdered. Poirot takes the case and is determined to catch the killer. Everyone on the train is a suspect. Christie's work is brimming with imagery and details that keep the reader captivated. She draws a meticulous picture in the reader's mind of each character by portraying the appearance, personality, and voice through her book. For example, one of the characters is a fat Italian man who has a thick accent and has a habit of gesticulating with his toothpick after he has removed it from his mouth. Many of the expressions and words that she selected are so humorous, I found myself smiling every few minutes. However, I did not like the fact that she uses French expressions in the story. Who knows what, &quot;Voil&agrave; ce qui est embetant,&quot; means? I did not have the slightest clue what was being said. Another aspect of the book I didn't like was the fact that many of the clues in the story were written in italics and were easy to point out. This made the story seem rather predictable to an extent. However, one would have never guessed the surprise ending. Although thecrime story was ingeniously thought out, I didn't think the structure of the book was. Each chapter was dedicated in interviewing a certain passenger on the train. I found it tedious boring because I anticipated what would happen in the next chapter. Despite this, each chapter leaves the reader hanging and lures him or her to read ahead. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read mystery books that aren't too scary or violent. This is a murder mystery that will not give the reader nightmares! I also think that people who are entertained by humor will enjoy this book. However, those who like reading books that just get down to the vital facts, skipping over details and imagery will not find this book very fascinating. I urge everyone to try to experience the book because I truly believe that Agatha Christie has done a praise worthy job on it. As said in the end of the book, &quot;I made one fantastic suggestion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This book is great. the begining was awesome then the middle kinda dragged cuz it was just information after information. but then the ending is unbelievable. this book should be bought by becasue you will want to read it more than once to sum up the clues. great book."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"A wondefully written mystery.

I read this book before I saw any of the movies based upon it. Christie has three of the most ingenious mysteries I have ever read because she blew all of my assumptions out of the water. They are this one; &#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; and &#34;And Then There Were None&#34; (also known as &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34;). Even non-mystery fans should read them. I will never forget the astonishment I felt when I read all three. This one is my favorite. The Orient Express, especially in the period this book was written (1934) evoked a sense of mystery and intrigue. The cast of characters represented many classes and nationalities, which was an important clue for Poirot, but I will say no more. This book is not dated in IMHO because it provides an evocative glimpse of a fascinating and often glamorous time (at least for those who travel on the Orient Express)."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This unabridged reading of one of Agatha Christie's best-known and best-loved books is great fun. David Suchet, the perfect TV Poirot, here gets to show off the amazing range of his acting talent. There are about 15 characters in the book, half of them women, from a variety of different countries and Suchet manages to sustain a different voice and characterisation for each. Yes, occasionally he goes a bit over the top (the Russian Princess for instance) but that adds to the enjoyment - Suchet understands that Christie's books are first and foremost light-hearted fun.Christie shows off her usual winning formula here - a baffling crime, a limited number of suspects, each interviewed by Poirot, and then the d&eacute;nouement as Poirot reveals both murderer and method. What stops the books from becoming repetitive is that there is usually an unexpected twist and this book is no exception. Once you know whodunit, it's easy to look back and see that Christie, more perhaps than any other crime-writer, plays fair with the reader - all the clues are there, we see everything Poirot sees, but can we work it out before he does?I downloaded the audio book from Audible - but discs or download this is a first-rate reading of a deserved classic of the mystery genre. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Definitely enjoyed this one. No way to figure out in advance how it's going to end. As the book went on, I started thinking that the plot was extremely implausible, but all was explained at the end and it wrapped up quite nicely."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express (alternatively titled Murder in the Calais Coach) is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries featuring Hercule Poirot, the detective with the egg-shaped head and the little gray cells (along with a big ego in a diminutive body). I find it difficult to rank books, but it is certainly one of Christie's top five Poirot mysteries. Murder on the Orient Express has everything a good mystery should have: a great plot, excellent characterization, a surprising d&eacute;nouement, and an interesting (albeit immodest!) detective.When it was first published, some critics grumbled that the solution wasn't fair. That wasn't the first time that critics complained about the d&eacute;nouement in a Christie mystery. Her earlier book,The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), had many critics (and some readers) up in arms complaining that her solution was unfair. As far as I'm concerned, Dame Agatha always played fair; she just came up with unique and innovative solutions (and that's really what the critics and readers were objecting to).Murder on the Orient Express is an unusual Poirot mystery in other ways. It is told in third person narrative mode, while most other Poirot stories are narrated by Captain Hastings, Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Hastings invariably provides some comic relief as well. Never fear: there are a number of humorous moments to be found, even without Hastings.One of the marks of a good book is that it stands up to re-reading. This is particularly difficult with mysteries, since you usually will have remembered the solution. One of my pleasures is re-reading Christie's better works from time to time. Even knowing the solution, there remain nuances to be discovered.For my permanent collection, I have the Black Dog & Leventhal low-priced hardcover 2006 edition (Murder on the Orient Express: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)), which I recommend without reservation.I also highly recommend Sidney Lumet's marvelous 1974 screen adaptation,Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. Lumet and the all-star cast do justice to Dame Agatha's book. Just make sure you avoid the horrible 2005 made-for-TV remake (Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express)."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Fascinating, with so little to go on to solve, with many misdirecting clues and hints manufactured to throw the detective off."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Hercule Poirot is back, and this time he's aboard the exotic Orient Express, a passenger train traveling between India and Europe. A murder is committed, but then the train is delayed due to a snow drift, and suddenly the murderer cannot easily escape. Poirot is in his element as he rounds up an eccentric cast of suspects to question.This novel presents itself more like a word puzzle mystery game - the clues and evidence are presented in a logical matter and summed up accordingly throughout the story. Everything is pretty much laid out on the table for the reader to draw their own conclusions. I couldn't guess whodunit, but maybe you can.

After all, my personal favorite book have still remained after reading these &quot;famous&quot; books through.

Read some reviews of it and GET EXCITED."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"Murder on the Orient Express is a very exciting book with a really unexpected ending. Hercule Poirot (the main character) solves yet another puzzling crime.The story takes place on the unusually crowded Orient Express (A prestigious Euroean train), which is forced to stop practically in the middle of nowhere because of a snow storm, and nobody can get in or out of it, again, because of the storm.On the train, in the Calais coach, where the murder was commited are some very unusual characters: A big Italian man; The killed man's valet; The killed man's secretary; A Russian princess; A count and a countess; A detective undercover, who pretends he is a dealer of typewriter ribbons; A loud American woman; Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc, and Dr. Constantine; And some more unusual characters.The murder is commited sometime in the night, and on the next day, Hercule Poirot, Monsieur Bouc (Poirot's friend, and manager of the train company), and Dr. Constantine (another one of Poirot's friends) start questioning the suspects (in this case, everybody) and looking for evidence. They know that the killer is very clever, and still on board.When I got this book I thought, well, I'm just going to read about the evidence and stuff like that, and that will be all. Well, it wasn't. The first part of the book (first 50 pages) really isn't very interesting even though I enjoyed it very much. But after page 50, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. As it is only the second of her books that I have read, I can't be sure, but I can see a pattern to Christie's writing; she seems to definitely draw from a certain formula in her writing. Even with what appears to be a predisposed pattern to her writing, these are still enjoyable reads.Murder on the Orient Express is a Hercule Poirot mystery, one of her more colorful recurring characters. Like The Mysterious Affair at Styles (the only other Christie book I've read), Poirot finds himself in an unexpected situation; traveling to Paris on the Orient Express, there is a murder, and Poirot is pressed into service to try to solve the mystery before the killer can escape!There isn't much thinking involved on the reader's part; most of the clues are clearly presented, but Poirot doesn't make the connections until the end, but he clearly illustrates how the crime was committed and who did it and how he came to the conclusion.Agatha Christie obviously enjoyed writing her books, as that enjoyment is passed directly onto the reader. 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a clean, fast, invigorating reading experience, just as enjoyable as its most famous adaptation: the 1974 film by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. Interestingly, the elegance of the \\"Orient Express\\" experience was a thematic addition to the film. Here, the now famous traveling experience is described as little more than a long train ride laced with the usual inconveniences of an extended trip. Either the Orient Express wasn't in reality all that sumptuous or such richness was taken for granted when Christie wrote her book.The details and resolution more or less play out as they do in the movie, though the book has a few extra layers of detail and a few small differences in the murder's solution, though there's nothing hugely different in either case. The book, in fact, makes one appreciate the movie even more, in that was it able to faithfully tell the book's story with only a minimum of simplification and consolidation.As the years go by, however, the book has gained one added literary benefit beyond the pleasures of its mystery story: with its dozen or so characters who represent many nationalities and political positions, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" presents to the modern reader a sharp snapshot of the world stage just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Sometimes the best time capsules are those that never aspired to be such, and that's certainly the case here. So, while modern readers will certainly enjoy the mystery story on hand, I think many will also be fascinated with the journey back to a period when the clouds of war were still somewhat in the distance, but- as personified by the uneasy comments and offhand worries of one character about another- were nevertheless slowly creeping closer."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a \\"motley crue\\" - Poirot employs \\"the little gray cells\\" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.There is nothing about \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"I am 12 years old and I'm a big Agatha Christie fan.

It was a pleasure to reacquaint myself with Hercule Poirot, her unassuming, unlikely detective. When Poirot is called back from the middle east to London, he finds himself aboard the Orient Express with a wide cast of characters, unlikely at such a dead travel time of year. When a passenger is found murdered on the third day of the journey, Poirot sets himself to the task of figuring out who is responsible.With the train stopped by an unexpected snowstorm, Poirot is convinced that the murder, or murderers, is still on board. He begins by fortuitously uncovering the true identity of the murder victim, then proceeds to interview the passengers as to their actions the night before. With no way to check their stories, he and his fellow companions must use their reasoning to figure out the mystery at hand. Yet with each interview that precedes, more and more information is brought to light that confounds, rather than enlightens, the detective process. With several well-placed red herrings and a few 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' clues, Poirot is able to dispell the mystery surrounding the murder and present the solution, or solutions, to everyone on board.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a well-written and fast-paced novel. Agatha Christie knew how to throw in twists that at once confound the facts at hand but never distract from the story. Hercule Poirot, easily unlikeable (in the hands of a lesser writer) for his know-it-all pomposity, is perhaps Christie's best known and best liked detective with good reason. The case she has conceived for him in this novel is a mystery lover's dream."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is, closely followed by \\"ABC Murders\\", the best book I have ever read.

Every person that is involved seems to have strong alibi and it looks like it has been made a perfect crime. A murder without mistakes. That's the way it has to look like.

I enjoyed it thoroughly because the plot was complex but the author made it easy to follow. Agatha Christie is a gifted writer and she makes you feel as if you personally know the characters. It was easy to get engrossed in this mind-boggling mystery. In some Christie's many other books she uses the same detective but entirely different plots. You solve the mystery right along side the highly revered, French detective Hercule Periot in this intriguing tale. I would recommend this book to anyone with an appetite for a juicy mystery and would also like to recommend some other books by this proficient author.

Christie uses irony in her novels, which makes her novels even more interesting, such as how she gave so many possibilities for the solution, yet the right solution is the easy, unexpected one.

The world famous case of the \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (MotOE). It is so famous, even people who have never read Christie know who did it. I first read it 12 years ago even though someone had already revealed to me the identity of the murderer. I've never forgiven him. But I read it anyway to find out for myself how Agatha Christie constructed the story in order to fool her readers.Christie was probably inspired by the true story of the 'Lindbergh baby' kidnapping. Charles Lindbergh (he who flew across the Atlantic alone) had an infant child who was kidnapped and murdered even after the ransom had been paid.The background to MotOE is also similar to the Lindbergh case. The victim is revealed to have been involved in a kidnap-murder case a few years back and got away with it. Was he punished for his crimes at last? Was he murdered for something totally unrelated? Or was he a victim of mistaken identity?The usual suspects remind one of the typical English drawing room murder mysteries: an English colonel, a Russian princess, a count, a beautiful mysterious woman...they are all here. And Hercule Poirot has to discover who the murderer is and why, all by using his \\"little grey cells, mon ami.\\"The revelation in the final pages will surprise the reader yet it will not strain belief too much. MotOE has been accused of being incredulous and downright silly but I disagree. Those who feel that way probably forgot that they are reading a fiction novel. I am sure one will find it a lot of fun if only to find out who from among the varied cast did it. You'll be gobsmacked, I assure you :)The solution will also show the reader why MotOE is famous in its uniqueness and has never been copied (no writer dares to).Another Agatha Christie mystery that features an incredible revelation and giving an \\"I would never have guessed that\\" feeling to the reader is \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". Both the Ackroyd and the Orient Express books should be in the Murder Mysteries Hall of Fame, if there is one."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"If I had to select a single Christie novel to read again for the first time, this would be my choice; more than twenty years after my first encounter with the novel I can still recall my complete amazement. I strongly urge those who have not seen the film version to avoid it until you have experienced the sheer pleasure of being being tricked by the master trickster herself. For MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, superlatives are not enough."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"One problem with audiobooks is the dialogue. Very often an author does not supply the &quot;he said/she said&quot; before or after each quotation and the listener is often at a loss as to who is speaking. David Suchet, the ultimate Poirot, gets around this by using a different voice for each character. He had accomplished this in his reading of the complete &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for Audio Partners and he does it again with a superlative &lt;Murder on the Orient Express&gt; for that same label.This set was designed for a release to coincide with the CBS dramatization of the classic whodunit, but Audio Partners need not have bothered. That telecast was an utter disaster with a lusterless Poirot, a cast that for the most part could scarcely create a character, and an updating of the decor (among other ludicrous changes) to the present. So the older film with its starry cast can rest unchallenged; but the public is entitled to enjoy the original and this audiobook is just the ticket.Christie uses the usual &quot;closed environment&quot; setting (an island, a cruiser, a train) to give us a small number of suspects; and then she hits us with Poirot's &quot;gather everyone together while I explain the solution&quot; scene. One of the gimmicks of this novel is that Poirot comes up with two solutions! But for the sake of those very few who do not know the ending, I will say no more. And even for those who do, there is always the joy of Suchet's reading.I have the CD edition, a format that makes it difficult to find where you last left off since each full chapter is usually given a single track number. Here Audio Partners has thoughtfully broken each chapter into several tracks so you pretty much can get back to where you were with a minimum of trouble. Tapes, of course, stay where they are--and are much better for use in autos.So by all means choose this as your next purchase, and do not forget the &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; offering while you are about it."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"First Sentence: It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria.In the Orient Express Calais Coach, a wealthy American is found dead of multiple stab wounds.

Her dialogue is flawless; it flows in the natural style of conversation, particularly multi-lingual conversation. I'm reminded, too, that her books were written in a time when the middle- and upper-class English had, and may still have, a rudimentary understanding of French so no translations were made in the story.

It is discovered that the murdered passenger was travelling under an alias and that he was an infamous kidnapper who killed a child from a prominent American family and changed his name and took the ransom money on the run.

They find several clues but as they dig deeper they find things are not always as they seem. There are suspects from various nationalities and economic backgrounds. Alibis, motives and movements are accounted for and then discredited leaving the reader wondering if the crime will be solved.

It becomes apparent relatively quickly that no one could have possibly committed the murder but Poirot has no option except to exercise his little gray cells to their utmost in an effort to solve the case. The story moves along at a nice clip and the cast is varied and interesting. My favorite aspect of any Poirot novel tends to be the little Belgian himself and he is in fine form here.It is a tribute to Agatha Christie's writing that I could enjoy reading a mystery novel so much on my first read even knowing the murderer before starting. The book is an excellent choice whether you are an old Poirot fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet or a first-time Christie reader."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This beautifully crafted murder mystery ranks among Agatha Christie's finest. The dapper Belgian detective finds himself investigating the murder of an American businessman on board the Simplon Orient Express. The death occurs in a a manner that implicates one of the twelve passengers in the Stamboul-Calais coach. Poirot carefully interviews the suspects, all of whom have cast-iron alibis. The case appears impossible to solve, until Poirot, using nothing but his wits and a few tiny, seemingly insignificant clues (including a monogrammed handkerchief, a pipe-cleaner, and a Hungarian passport), assembles one of his most brilliant explanations.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is not just another Agatha Christie book. The plotting is as skillful and ingenious as her best, filled with even more baffling twists and turns than usual. This novel has even more to offer, however: a delightful international cast of characters, an entertaining train setting, and gripping suspense. This is edge-of-your-seat reading from the world's foremost mystery writer."},{"Title":"Murder in the Calais coach,","review":"This is one of the best murder mysteries i've read. Guessing the end is really quite challenging and hats off to anyone who actually does. This is a slightly 'intellectual' thriller, meaning there is more to think about but not too much 'happening' in terms of action. Poirot prefers to trust his 'little grey cells' to solve any case!!The story : Contrary to his plans, the famous detective Hercule Poirot ends up on the Orient express along with an assortment of fellow passengers of various nationalities. One of them approaches Poirot to help save his life, but Poirot declines the offer. The man is found murdered next day, stabbed in 12 places. The blows are such as to suggest at least two different people delivered them, and other clues are bewildering to say the least.Further, since the train's stuck owing to heavy snowfall, the murderer(s?) must be on board, making the task of discovering their identity/identities all the more urgent.Now the story really starts moving, as the passengers give their 'evidence' one by one, and Poirot proceeds to analyse, understand and deduce. He unravels a web of lies and deceit and soon it is apparent that many of the passengers know more than they're letting on and there is much more to it than meets the eye.Before you know it, the story builds towards a stunning climax and the ending is truly memorable, which is what ultimately makes or breaks a thriller of this genre.All in all, an expertly crafted murder mystery which will keep you thinking all the while as you're furiously flipping pages.

My favorite, Mr. Poirot, has such class and intelligenge. He uses his charm to his advantage in solving the case. The reason I enjoyed this book so much is, it was written so that I could speculate on who committed the crime, however when the criminal was revealed to me I was in shock. The case seemed so complicated, yet it was really quite simple. I am very much looking forward to reading more of Agatha Christie's work."},{"Title":"Gouverneur Morris (American statesmen)","review":"The book could have just as well been categorized as an extended essay - in the best sense of that description - a piece of writing from an author's personal point of view. T.R. is, as usual, adamant in his opinion, often presented bombastically as fact rather than perspective. No doubt he is right more often than wrong, but unfortunately the reader is never sure where biography ends and essay begins. There are no citations, no included correspondence, no referenced schools of thought... only T.R.'s indomitable opinion, which frequently lapses into a sermonizing form as it does, though more forgivably, in his own autobiographyTheodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography.We do learn much of Gouverneur Morris and his remarkable life, though the author ignores an opportunity for a more detailed analysis of Morris' enormous contribution to the Constitutional Convention which would have required far more of the scholarly arts than found in an essay! Morris' life in Paris during \\"The Terror\\" of the French Revolution is well presented as harrowing and heroic. And despite T.R.'s evident love of his subject, the author breaks free of his infatuation long enough to excoriate Morris for his contemptible behavior as leader of a secessionist movement during the War of 1812. It is an easy read, \\"between the lines\\" to see Morris as a haughty aristocrat, contemptuous of the intellectual capabilities of the \\"common man\\", and yet T.R. struggles in vain to caution his readers that this was NOT the case.Much of T.R.'s opinion and perspective can come off in the 21st century as bluster, or oddly dated - (20th century macho has morphed into 21st century buffoonery). A brief example: (pg. 261) \\"The king who could suffer with firmness, and who could act either not at all, or else with the worst possible effect, had the head and heart that might of suited the monkish idea of a female saint...\\". Why pass along the \\"monkish\\" gender disdain? And, with remarkably unreasoned bluster, T.R. writes (pg. 49) \\"We did not owe our main disasters to the might of our foes, nor our final triumph to the help of our friends.\\" Thus at Yorktown, eight-thousand French soldiers under Rochambeau, a French naval fleet under de Grasse of AT LEAST 28 'Ships of the Line', totaling 2,078 guns and 18,138 crew members, a fleet carrying a half-million in Spanish silver to pay unpaid American troops, all blithely ignored and dismissed by our essayist! Nonetheless- the book is a worthwhile read and recommended, but as much for its unintended \\"autobiography\\" of the writer as for its essay of his subject. Still-- exuberance and self-assurance make for a better told story than the dry simplicity of a recitation of facts gathered through laborious research. But, the right combination of those two styles is what can make history come alive and unfortunately this book misses that mix; the historian's expected rigor and depth does not show. As a biography only three stars despite the eminence of the author, perhaps more stars as essay?kindle edition-----Generally well done; there are no typos, or awkward page breaks, or line feeds, etc that can be an annoying artifact of the \\"remastering\\" to digital process. Oddly, the book did NOT recognize the dictionary, so there is no look-up. The dictionaries are particularly missed as a translator for T.R.'s flamboyantly \\"dropped\\" French phrases. Page numbers are shown with selection of the menu and toolbar display (tap top of kindle-page) ."},{"Title":"The Carroll Shelby story","review":"Almost forty years later, the man and the book are still fascinating!! Get it while you can."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"It was hard to decide whether to give this book four stars or five. The book isn't anywhere near to being a complete history of the conquest of the alps (con), but what is here is extremely well-written and interesting stuff which I could barely put down (pro) even though it's a pretty hefty 360 pages in all.The first half of the book (176 pgs) is devoted to Mount Blanc, starting in prehistory, working up to its first ascent in 1786, and then continuing on up til the mid-nineteenth century. More than just the climbs themselves enters into the story. Fleming is as much concerned with the philosophical and cultural meaning of the exploits as with the exploits themselves. So he tries to give us a feel for their context in the wider scheme of things and what the people were like who were doing these things. The amount and variety of material which Fleming has researched and brought into the mix is what makes the reading so fascinating. There's everything from what the mountain villages were like to the scientific debate over why glaciers move.Most of the second half of the book concerns itself with the eventual first ascent of the Matterhorn (1865) and the events surrounding it in the decade before. If Mount Blanc was all about ice, the Matterhorn is obviously all about rock. The author's obviously British perspective weighs heavily in here, which is where we get the most info on first ascents other than the two principals -- esp. if they were done by Whymper as warm-ups for the big prize.Only the last twenty pages or so is devoted to the &quot;modern&quot; (post-Mummery) era, and the concentration so far as the detail is concerned is on the Eiger North Face.So even if the coverage is much more limited than I would have preferred, Fleming is such an accomplished story-teller that I could recommend this to climbers and non-mountaineers alike."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"&quot;Killing Dragons&quot; is a history of the exploration of the French, Swiss, and Italian Alps from the early 18th century to 1938, when the &quot;last problem of the Alps&quot;, the Eiger Nordwand, was finally &quot;solved.&quot; The first half of the book discusses the early French and Swiss scientists and adventurers who explored the slopes of Mont Blanc and studied the glaciers of the Bernese Oberland. The 19th century belonged to the eccentric British explorers and scientists and an American expatriate, William Coolidge, who were driven to the mountains by a variety of forces. The end of the British domination of Alpine exploration came when almost all of the peaks had been conquered by their most straightforward routes, leaving only the more technically challenging direttissima routes, north faces, and other novel paths. These climbs required technical innovations (such as the use of pitons and carabineers) and a new more gymnastic approach and attitudes that the British and the French considered to be unsporting. This left the great technical climbs in the Alps to the Austrians, Germans, and Italians, and hence it is fitting that the book ends with a description of two Bavarians' and two Austrians' conquest of the Nordward.Parts of the book, particularly in the first half, although competently-written and useful from an informational perspective, are quite dry and not particularly gripping. Later sections on John Tyndall and Edward Whymper are significantly better and Fleming's description of the personalities and feuds involved are actually quite interesting. I enjoyed the biographical information about Whymper, which fleshes him out as an individual. For more details about Whymper's exploits, I would highly recommend his book &quot;Scrambles Amongst the Alps.&quot;There were a few worrisome factual and editing errors early on in the book, such as when the mountain Pilatus is repeatedly placed above Geneva. This is a strange error as the general map included with the book correctly puts the mountain near Lucerne. A few detailed maps would have been a most welcome addition.Overall, this is a smoothly-written and useful historical overview of Alpine exploration written very much from a British perspective and one that I would recommend to anybody who has a special interest in the area or the history of mountaineering. (A prior knowledge of the area by the reader will also help compensate for the lack of detailed maps.)"},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"In Killing Dragons: The Conquest Of The Alps, Fergus Fleming recounts the incredible exploits of the men who explored Europe's most famous and dangerous mountain range. French and Swiss scientists tackled the peaks in the late 18th century seeking to learn more about the atmosphere, earth's origins, and glaciers. By the 1850s this scientific pursuit had evolved into a fierce competition between British climbers. The climbers became celebrities seeking to climb ever higher and more impossible mountains -- while trading quips and barbs and in public press. Stories of the climbers valor, rivalries, egos, and disasters become the substance of popular interest. Highly recommended reading that is both informative and fascinating, Killing Dragons tells how the great Alpine mountains fell to these colorful, eccentric climbers and is a &quot;must&quot; for anyone who has ever contemplated the adventure and sport of mountaineering."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"I am surprised to see only a 3-star rating average currently for this book. I thought it was an engrossing read for anyone with an interest in the history and development of alpinism in general and tourism in the Alps. I had recently read Trevor Braham's \\"When The Alps Cast Their Spell\\" which left me cold. Despite it winning the Boardman Tasker Prize I found it dense and dull. Starting into Fleming's Killing Dragons I was wondering why I was reading a book that covered so much of same ground, and expected to more or less skim through it, but I soon found myself hooked.Braham focused on the players: each chapter is centered on one major figure from the era. Fleming instead works chronologically through the development of the key mountains and towns, and, although he does attach the narrative to each character for a time (especially to Whymper), he really follows the succession of challenges: Mount Blanc, the Matterhorn, the Meije, the Eiger Nordwand. This structure lets him write a book that maintains a sense of suspense and drama that is rare in non-fiction."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"This book while not compelling or a must read, is still a well written if standard introduction to the the story of the conquest of the Alps by (mostly) British climbers from the Alpine Club. While it is neither as authoritative nor comprehensive (nor thankfully as long) as Walt Unsworth's &quot;Everest&quot; it is nonetheless a fine introduction that engagingly lays out both the plot and characters in the story of man vs the Alps. From his blbliography and introduction, you can pick up the story in more detail where you please. His treatment of Whymper is first-rate; indeed he is more indulgent and less sardonic with these heroes than he was of John Barrow and his &quot;boys.&quot;Mr. Fleming, in addition to laying out the facts, is always shrewd in his analysis of motive and character. Again, while this is no classic, it is a professional job by an intelligent writer on a fascinating subject intended for the general reader. I was appreciative."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"I read Mr. Fleming's two books on the North Pole, and because I liked them I picked this one on the Alps, but this book is a failure by Mr. Fleming's own standards. It is quite a mess, and worse than that, a dull mess. Mr. Fleming literally wanders around the Alps in his narrative without any real plan as far as I can see, and although it is presented as \\"The conquest of the Alps\\", the editor (if not the author) should have been more honest and simply acknowledge that it is just a sort of whimsical account of some of the British pioneers in the Alps, plus a bit on the Eiger, but just because the Eiger has such a vis atractiva of its own (there were no Brits there).It seems to me that while the history of the exploration of the North Pole follows a more or less straight chronological line, and because there is a vast bibliography to consult about it, Mr. Fleming did well in his two books on that subject, but this one is not worth reading, at least not to me.I suggest you rather go for Harrier's \\"The White Spider\\", and for Whymper's own recollection of his Cervino's first ascent."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"\\"Killing Dragons\\" is an engrossing series of portraits of men and mountains woven into a chronology of alpine exploration that spans 150 years. The bulk of the narrative focuses on two big, suggestive mountains - Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn - and their two principal suitors: de Saussure and Whymper. But there are delightful side roles for a whole throng of colourful characters such as Bourrit, Forbes, Tyndall, Ruskin, Stephen and Coolidge. Ultimately it's also a story about how surprisingly quickly and drastically man's relationship to nature can change: in barely two centuries the general mood regarding the mountain world switched from superstitious awe to scientific interest to exploratory zeal to nationalist competition to, ultimately, solipsistic thrill-seeking (which is still the dominant ethos today).Fergus Fleming is a masterful storyteller with a penchant for tongue-in-cheeck humour, quirky details and the burlesque. In one or two cases it's even over the top, as when he inserts a footnote with a deadpan comment of Edward Whymper on the ubiquity of \\"cr&eacute;tins\\" (deformed, mentally handicapped people) and goitre sufferers in rural Alpine communities: \\"Let them be formed into regiments by themselves, brigaded together, and commanded by cretins. Think what esprit de corps they would have! Who could stand against them? Who would understand their tactics?\\" An example of a more successful gag comes when Fleming comments on the death of Coolidge who, after the demise of his beloved aunt Meta Brevoort, withdrew and became and quarrelsome, exasperatingly punctilious Alpine historian. Fleming: \\"An imp of perversity was loose in Grindelwald that season - either that or the Swiss possessed a keener sense of humour than they were normally credited with - for the great pedant was given an exquisitely apt send-off. The 'Echo of Grindelwald\\" misspelled his name in its official notice, the authorities put the wrong age on his headstone and the carver missed out the the 'u' in 'mountains'.\\" The book is full of these kinds of hilarious observations. (Incidentally, Fleming himself may have something of Coolidge's pedantry as he is remarkably scrupulous about spelling of French and Germain toponyms throughout the book).On the whole, Fleming does an admirable job in weaving the locales, the societal trends, the climbing epics, the individual characters and their relationships and rivalries into a rich tapestry. My only complaint is that this book refers only in passing to and omits a more extensive discussion on Albert Mummery, an important and colourful character who heralded a new era in mountaineering. His remarkable ascents on the great Alpine peaks (Zmutt ridge on the Matterhorn, amongst many others) and his fantastic daring to be the very first to attack a Himalayan 8.000 meter peak (already in 1895!) would have been a more fitting and logical conclusion to this very British epic than the unsavoury story of the German siege on the north face of the Eiger."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"The author has admittedly presented a thorough (if not exhausting) history of the earlier attempts and successes in summiting the Alps. And there you have it! Not much excitement, nothing thrilling...sort of like Sgt. Joe Friday on the old &quot;Dragnet&quot; series...just the facts, ma'm! This book might be enjoyed by those who find interest in the arcane and the mundane. I say pass it by and find any number of much more interesting books on mountaineering, exploring and stories of summiting. I gave it two stars for the nice picture on the cover jacket!"},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"The author of &quot;Barrow's Boys&quot; has once again written an extremely interesting work that deals, mainly, with British eccentrics doing unusual things: this time they are exploring, and climbing, the Alps. I found the subject very compelling, because I have always had a desire to see the Matterhorn, a desire that began when I saw, as a young boy, Walt Disney's &quot;Third Man On The Mountain&quot;. Having lived one winter in Denver, I loved going into the Rockies and just looking around, and observing the majesty of creation. This work is a very good introduction to the beginning of mountaineering in Europe, and is suitable for the general reader. Anyone who considers themselves learned in the field will probably not like this work, but I enjoy learning something new in everything I read, and this book certainly gave me that type of information. There were a few typos scattered here and there, but they didn't detract from my pleasure in reading this work. The writing style is casual, and it's something worth reading if you love mountains, and like hearing about the odd and determined people who climb them."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"Fleming is not, as one reviewer states, a &quot;great writer&quot;; he is, in fact, a fairly dull, lazy one, given to repeating himself, relying on second-hand sources (i.e., he quotes other writers quoting Dumas, Dickens, etc.) rather than the originals, and he has a silly, reductive view of theism (i.e., one either believes in natural development OR God and dragons). I can't say I *enjoyed* reading this book all that much, but it did make me want to hunt down books on mountaineering by Leslie Stephen and Edward Whymper, among others. Fleming approaches his subject--the popularization of the Alps--not from a mountaineering or literary or scientific point of view, but rather from a social one. He is very much concerned about whether so and so was a snob or a gentleman, and that's fine, but prospective readers should be aware. I would much prefer a more technical discussion of climbing, but Ferguson doesn't seem all that well-suited for this. Having bashed this book pretty well, I have to admit I learned from it and am glad I read it. It beats reading Bill O'Reilly or being poked in the eye with a sharp stick."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"British historian-author Fergus Fleming has recently been a prolific chronicler of the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Exploration.&quot; Since 1999, he has published three relatively lengthy antholgy type works, including &quot;Barrow's Boys,&quot; about British Polar and African exploration in the first half of the 19th Century, and his recent &quot;Ninety Degrees North,&quot; about the numeorus attempts to conquer the North Pole.&quot;Killing Dragons,&quot; the second of the three, also has the least interesting topic. The polar and African expeditions were mammoth affairs that taxed those who participated in them to the limit, often killing or horribly maiming them. By contrast, being the first person to scale an Alp, as we know today not by far the most imposing of mountains, just doesn't rate as an achievement. Still, the book is interesting as an historical account of the beginnings of the sport of mountaineering.Fleming is an excellent writer and a good stroyteller. Parts of &quot;Killing Dragons&quot; are quite thrilling, particularly his accounts of the conquest of the Matterhorn and the first ascent of Mount Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps. Between such events, however, the story lags. The history of the founding of Britains Alpine Club and squabbles among its illustrious members, for example, isn't exactly the kind of stuff that takes your breath away.Overall, &quot;Killing Dragons&quot; is better as a work of history than as a collection of adventure stories."},{"Title":"Killing Dragons: The Conquest of the Alps","review":"What a disappointment. This book is full of in-depth biographies of explorers who weren't that exciting, although they did some exciting things. One or two bios might be okay, as long as lots of other stories about climbing in the Alps are thrown in. But how about a zillion bios? One after the other. I put it down about 2/3 of the way through and was thinking of reading another of Fleming's books; now I've decided not to.And don't expect any good scenery photos...it's full of a bunch of guys in Victorian dress.

While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library. One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used, with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress. It also spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching. The terminology of traditional grammar is used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases; abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).

All come together to form a beautiful quilt which features dancing animals, swaying trees, and all manner of beautiful ornamentation.The quilt serves variously as a quilt, a tent, a huppah at a wedding, a tablecloth, and so on. Polacco uses the same illustrative technique she employs in her wonderful \\"Betty Doll\\"--the quilt itself appears in multicolored beauty, while the rest of each picture is done in subtle and evocative pencil. Because of this simple visual choice, the quilt and its many permutations leap to the fore and become, essentially, the main character in a story filled with realistic and full-bodied people.I have always liked the fact that Polacco doesn't draw pretty-pretty people. The little kids always look like regular little kids, with all the inherent awkwardness and realistic expressions (whether they be joyful or pouting or wondering), while the adults sometimes have worried or thoughtful expressions, bad posture, or wrinkles.

THE KEEPING QUILT is about Polacco's Great-Grandmother Anna, who immigrated to New York City. The only two things that she still owned from her native Russia were her dress and a babushka. Anna's mother eventually takes parts of her dress and babushka along with old clothes belonging to other relatives and makes a quilt that will remind everyone of their homeland. This quilt serves as a source of comfort and memories for future generations. This is another book that I bought my daughter for her birthday. She will read this book to her second graders perhaps inspiring a new generation to write down the memories of the past."},{"Title":"The Keeping Quilt","review":"I read this book some time ago in a public library and later purchased it for a friend of mine who recently got getting married. I wanted it to be special gift for her. Like myself, she loves the book's warmth. My friend later wrote to me thanking me for the book. She loved it and is now sharing it with others, and mentions that she too will keep the book in mind as a future special wedding gift. I love how Ms. Polacco places special values on familial traditions and history by using the quilt as its center piece. Of the many other books I have read by Ms. Polacco, this is one my of favorites. I would also like to thank public television's &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; for introducing me to this wonder author.C.J., Teacher"},{"Title":"The Keeping Quilt","review":"What a beautiful family story.

This is a wonderful story about the traditions of passing things down from generation to generation. The family in the story made a quilt from some of the clothes they brought over from Russia. The quilt was then used for weddings, births, and deaths. The story of the objects on the quilt were passed along with the generations. I thought this would be an excellent book to read for a unit on family traditions. The students could talk about objects that might be passed down in their families."},{"Title":"The Keeping Quilt","review":"Patricia Palacco can always be trusted to tell beautiful stories that teach moral lessons revealing a love for family, people, and life.

The author of the book should be ashamed of herself for writing a book like this, it is very anti Jewish. She takes advantage of her Jewish ancestries, values, beliefs, religious, and culture to only show that she's NOT proud of it and obviously does not want to be part of. She shows that it's ok to change and grow away from something that her ancestors have been doing for thousands of years. She especially shows her carelessness of her own people by marrying Mario at the end (a non Jew). The book starts of beautifully with her great grandmothers quilt, but really has nothing to do with a quilt and the narrator is like a snake leading you astray. I feel very sorry for her great grandmother who is looking down on her and probably shedding spiritual tears knowing that the future generation will no longer be Jewish. I'am astonished at the positive reviews of this book, it goes to show how many people (assuming Jewish) are so disconnected from Judaism. If you want your children to be proud of who they are and continue to have the spark of Judaism in their hearts, please don't read them this devilish book that will only lead them astray.

In short, recommended.Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Every time you feel lost alienated, or cut off from life, or from the world, every time you feel despair, anger or instability, practice going home. Mindful breaking is the vehicle that you use to go back to your true home. pg 99If your house is on fire, the most urgent thing to do is to go back and try to put out the fire, not to run after the person you believe to be the arsonist. pg 107The reason we are foolish enough to make ourselves suffer and make the other person suffer is that we forget that we and the other person are impermanent. Someday, when we die, we will lose all our possessions, our power, our family, everything. Our freedom, peace, and joy in the present moment is the most important thing we have. But without an awakened understanding of impermanence, it is not possible to be happy. pg 119If it is your partner who is angry, just listen. Listen and do not react....Do not listen for the purpose of judging, criticizing, or analyzing. Listen only to help the other person express himself and find some relief from his suffering. pg 159We cannot enjoy life if we spend a lot of time worrying about what happened yesterday and what will happen tomorrow. We worry about tomorrow because we are afraid. If we are afraid all the time, we cannot appreciate that we are alive and can be happy now. pg 179"},{"Title":"Taming the Tiger Within: Meditations on Transforming Difficult Emotions","review":"Great things to say in this book...

A lifelong peace activist, Buddhist monk, and beacon of hope of in a dark world, \\"Taming the Tiger Within\\" is not unlike reading a few notes from the chorus of a monastery and hearing them at the same time.Essentially, Hanh is only telling us what we should already know and practice with ourselves and our loved ones in a tone of gentleness and love--without a hint of condescencion. Many of us would ask, \\"How can we actually return home after a busy, nettlesome day and not express our anger in immature ways, just to vent?\\" (privately, of course). Hanh's response is simple: talk about it. Be it. This means shedding a lot of the illusions (the ego goes first, of course) and being totally vulnerable which a lot of are simply not willing to do. Without this willingness which sets free, however, we are always a slave to destruction.Despite being more of a \\"quick read\\" as many reviewers have pointed out, this quick read contains more wisdom than busty tomes of theology on Buddhism or any faith.

In actuality, given the framework of warped Nazi ideology, the Holocaust had been quite rational. Buchheim comments: \\"The war was presented as a war waged by Jewry against the German people, a life-and-death war between races...Anti-Jewish measures were therefore presented as action in battle...In a racial and ideological war on the National Socialist model, however, the enemy had to be killed even when a prisoner--as proved by the systematic murder of Russian commissars in the prisoner-of-war camps.\\" (Buchheim, p. 364). In addition, Himmler rationalized the killing of Jewish children as a preventative action against their eventual revenge directed against successive generations of Germans (Krausnick, p. 123).Wiskemann recognizes the intertwined fate of Jews and Slavs, and how practical matters got in the way of total extermination, especially of the Slavs (who--if nothing else--were too numerous to forfeit as a source of slave labor and to readily exterminate under wartime conditions): \\"In 1939 and thereafter many Poles were liquidated in conquered Poland, and Dr. H.-A.

He was, however, faced with another paradox, for he needed the labour of the people he had marked down for destruction.

It is therefore instructive that, originally, the Germans DID plan to treat the Zamosc-area Poles in very much the same way as the Jews (albeit with a greater fraction of able-bodied adults spared for forced labor). This is shown by the following letter from Dr. H., the Medical Officer to Warsaw, to Hitler (on December 7, 1942): \\"During a discussion at government level concerning the fight against tuberculosis, Oberverwaltungsrat W., Head of the Population and Welfare Section, told us under ban of secrecy that 200,000 Poles were to be deported from Eastern Poland to make room for German settlers and that in this connection it was intended, or at least planned, to treat approximately a third of them (70,000 old people and children under ten) similarly to the Jews, in other words kill them.\\" (Buchheim, p. 379). Dr. H. was opposed to this policy for strictly pragmatic reasons. He feared, among other things, that Polish resistance to its implementation would devastate the very area that Germans wanted for their lebensraum (ibid, p. 380). Those Zamosc-area Poles murdered at Auschwitz were killed by methods that disguised the actual cause of death (Broszat, p. 502).

My answer mostly consists of the performance by Robert DeNiro in The Untouchables. If there's one book that started my interest before DeNiro, then this one is most definitely it! I got it two years before DeNiro's performance and was quickly wrapped up in Mr. Lindberg's storytelling of old Chicago. The book is set right before Al Capone set foot in Chi-town. So many interesting non Capone stories in here. I highly recommend it to all the Chicago buffs out there. It helps understand how Capone would come to be and what was going on before in old Chicago. We get a great glimpse of how Chicago was named, events after the great fire, it's players, movers, shakers and the Great Mike McDonald etc... Just a great book with terrific illustrations! Lindberg makes the readers use their imagination, and it works!Can't find it new?

The author, a professional anthropologist, traces out the history of Britain geologically from the time of the first vertebrates, and anthropologically from the first human settlement during the last ice age more than 40,000 years ago. This is an eminently readable treatise, with rich, beautifully written prose throughout and accompanied with a touch of poetry. The book lacks illustrations and maps, and may be slightly the poorer for it to some readers, though not to me. The first part covering the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras suffers from the inevitable omission of two subsequent discoveries; one is plate tectonics which bring about continental drift, and the other is the sudden and dramatic end to the dinosaurs and most Mesozoic life in a fiery asteroid impact 65 million years ago. The latter reintroduces us to catastrophism in earthly science, after uniformitarianism had held sway for more than a century and in this book. Nevertheless, Hawkes is remarkably free of much need for revision, despite these omissions, with prose that carries all before it. Nature and man appear all of a piece to Hawkes, even if this unity cannot be sharply defined. It is an equivalence that works despite the two different time rates."},{"Title":"A land (Pelican books)","review":"The book, written a half century ago, should be more widely known than it is.

The writing is drowned in imagery and stylistic phrases; repetition is rife.The plot involves Nonie, whose father has just died, moving to exotic Beadon Island to spend a holiday with a brother and sister. The brother was a friend of her father and as such is way too old for this young woman. However, she is going to marry him for no particular reason other than she is not sure what to do next. Unfortunately for the would-be husband, Royal, a younger man whose only relative owns a family plantation down the road turns up, determined to leave the island. It transpires that Nonie and Jim realise that they are in love, but too late! The wedding is set and Nonie, although she has plenty of opportunity to tell Roy of her change of heart, does not do so. Things go downhill from there...Murder, secrets, theft and a tropical storm tearing the place apart create confusion. Jim is accused of one murder, then another and is constantly being told he's under arrest.However, nothing seems to happen.I am surprised that this book has been re-issued without being edited and parts of it truncated.

(A Falcon's head suspense novel)","review":"I liked What of Terry Conniston? (1971) by Brian Garfield (author of Death Wish). It's an easy/enjoyable read. And once the novel's villain splits for Mexico to see an ex-Nazi doctor turned plastic surgeon, about mid-novel, it's practically impossible to put down.All hell breaks loose when the leader of a five-member rock group decides to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy Texas businessman. All the band's members, except for one, are a pretty despicable bunch of losers. The leader is reminiscent of the main villain in Jeffery Deaver's A Maiden Grave (1995) or Carter Wick's (Collin Wilcox's) Dark House, Dark Road (1981). The disfigured band member is reminiscent of the over-sexed villain in Deaver's Maiden Grave and the big, dumb villain in Robert Vaughan's Heart of Nashville (1975). If you can get over a few fortuitous coincidences: a horny, Rich Little wannabe; family strife cause by perceived lack of love; sudden, unexpected violence; death; greed; and a love willing to overlook practically everything, then this one's for you. And who said the author doesn't have a perverse sense of humor: Read the novel to see what happens south of the border to the sole female kidnapper and to the Texas businessman's ranch."},{"Title":"Reading with a Passion: Rhetoric, Autobiography, and the American West in the Gospel of John","review":"I think that every biblical scholar should read this book, and every scholar of religion should read it, because I know of no better place that one can EXPERIENCE the problematics and possibilities of reading texts--either ancient or modern--and experience the issues of interpretation.

But if no photos are available, then something may be omitted. All of these books are vertical studies covering a period of years. Though sometimes the illustrations serve to identify individual items of equipment, these works are not intended for that purpose. They are not catalogs intended for materiel collectors.

Shiraz: Persian City of Saints and Poets is that rare combination.This book is the second volume of several books from the University of Oklahoma Press called \\"The Centers of Civilization Series.\\" Other books focus on Athens under Pericles, the Augustan Age in Rome, Chaucer's London, Dante's Florence, Baghdad During the Abbasids period, Kyoto During the Momoyama Period. Oddly I have been unable to find any books on this series that deal with either India or China. I am not sure why, back in the 1960s and 1970s when these books were first written for this omission.This work on Shiraz was written A. J. Arberry who was himself and expert on Persian history and Sufism. Despite have a wealth of material he selected two aspects of the story of Shiraz during the period of 800-1400, the first is the development of the Sufi sect in Persia and second the development of Persian poetry. The book begins with an overview of the period which featured the fall of rulers of Persia, the development of Mongol control over Persia, followed by a period of local factions, followed in turn by the development of Timur's central and southern Asian empire.As Bernard Lewis has observed, although \\"Iran was Islamized, it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians, It was during the period covered by this book that this Persian notion, within the context of Islamic culture, continued to develop. Politically this period was significant for the lack of political stability with various dynasties emerging in the region, particularly arising form the North and East. In this environment, Shiraz was probably well served by its geographic location to the south and west.Arberry selects four individuals as emblematic of the period. The first is Ibn Kafif who brought the ideals of Sufism to Shiraz. Sufism is characterized in part by its quest for mystical union with God, through the concept of dhike (or remembrance of God and asceticism. Originally a reaction of the worldly Umayyad Caliphate, it soon spread to other parts of the Islamic world. Ibn Kafif was a great traveler who while on pilgrimage and completing his education managed to meet many of the leading Sufi figures of his time, including the ecstatic Hallaj who sought and claimed a mystical union with God (a claim that lead to his execution). Kafif is both part of the mystical quest for closer ties with God, but also in his writings combines with this spiritual quest, a desire for social justice and abandonment of worldly concerns. These were the focus of his life. His death around his 100 birthday (it could be more or less) lead to the acknowledgment of his many achievements in both areas. Interestingly, of the figures of Shiraz, Ibn Kafif wrote in Arabic and this was not remarkable given his subject matter and his cosmopolitan Islamic world outlook. Literature in Persian becomes more important as the story progresses.Ruzbihan, the second figure in the book is fascinated not only by sacred love, but also profane. His most significant book was \\"The Jasmine of Lovers,\\" an interesting volume for one such as he who was involved in the monastic life of a Sufi teacher. This work was part of a greater tradition tawid which is a longing for mystical union with the beloved, which could be sacred or profane.The third and fourth figures are Sa'di and Hafiz who were strictly speaking Sufi poets. Sa'di, following in the cosmopolitan tradition was well-versed in the ways of travelers, having frequented tea shops on traders routes and even gotten as far as the Holy Land where he fought against the Crusaders, was captured and subsequently escaped. His writings speak of a quest for freedom, justice, tolerance, and contentment.Hafiz, the final figure was if anything a more problematic figure during his lifetime. Both he and Sa'di lived during a period of profound political instability which included the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols and disruption of Persian cultural life. Hafiz was frequently the target of political and religious censor and was constantly butting heads with authority to include Timur himself. Both have had a profound impact on Persian literature, Hafiz being a figure as profound in his own language as Shakespeare is in English. Both poets continue to remain popular because of the ability of their poems to transcend their original time and place.Arberry has produced a remarkable short treatment on a very lengthy and important period in Iranian history. I look forward to reading the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Gastronomy of Spain and Portugal","review":"A complete travelogue, including the foods and wines of Spain and Portugal.

You can also see all the signs of a thriving, healthy native American community, with huts, smoking fires, gardens and cleared woodland, not to mention dozens of drawings of Indians. By the time the Pilgrims arrived, Patuxet, the Wampanoag village on the site where they built Plymouth, was dead. Every single native American had died in an epidemic of what was probably smallpox, except Squanto, who was saved only because an English slaver kidnapped him and sold him in the Malaga slave market in Spain,from which mirculously he managed to return. David Jones shows how wherever Europeans who had acquired immunity to viral diseases in their childhood --- Spaniards in Hispaniola in the 1520s, Englishmen, Frenchmen and Dutch in the 1620s, and Brazilians in the Amazon and Americans in Alaska as late as the twentieth century --- fearful mortality struck the indigenous population. Something between 90 and 95 percent of the native American inhabitants of eastern Massachusetts, for examaple, succumbed to European infections in the early seventeenth century. Europeans had been on the coasts of New England and the maritime provinces of Canada as fishermen and traders for more than a century when the Pilgrims arrived, and European diseases had taken hold, to become even more dangerous when settlers brought children with them. David S. Jones has analyzed the story of this series of medical catastrophes coolly, with empathy, compassion and great erudition. This is an impressive example of medical hnistory."},{"Title":"Human development and education,","review":"I needed this book to verify information for a book chapter I was writing.

Jake Holman, primary American character of this book is an old China hand. He's a sailor on an American gunboat, a part of the multi-national forces cruising the interior waters of a China in the throes of unrest, warlordism, rebellion, turbulence and chaos created by the downfall of the Manchu Dynasty and the Boxer Rebellion.Jake's navy is one that resembles the post-WWII US Army in most of Asia prior to Vietnam in some ways. Asians do the unpleasant and difficult chores as houseboys and other types of assistants, to the point of imposing a dependence on them and degradation of competence of the Americans. Those who love Chinese history, those who love historical fiction, those who served in the Far East and remember, almost anyone can appreciate this classic work of (greater than) historical fiction.This book is one you'll read more than once, probably see the movie and love it, and read the book again without feeling the least letdown.

The author, Richard McKenna, was a China sailor in the 1930s and his experience shows in the rich authenticating detail that colors (but never obscures) the story.The book was soon followed by a movie, also calledThe Sand Pebbles, and both are remarkable. China in 1926 is certainly alien and complicated. The book is filled with hard to forget characters: the complex Chinese, the sometimes childish crew of the USS San Pablo, and the too-good-for-their-own-good American missionaries.The Sand Pebbles has been around for nearly 50 years. But that's no reason to pass it by--or to skip the movie. The film is remarkably true to the book and both are very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"For a book that eventually got made into a Steve McQueen movie I was very surprised by the depth of this book.McKenna does an excellent job of portraying China in transition, told from the points of view of the sailors on the USS San Pablo and from the missionaries at China Light, people whose world is literally shattered. The first part of the book focuses on the protagonist, Jake Holman, as he learns to adjust to life onboard the tiny San Pablo after having transferred from the Pacific Fleet. Everything is going to be perfect, he is going to have his own engine, his own engine room and be able to run it the way he wants to. Except that's not how it is on the San Pablo - most of the engineering work is done by coolies, cheap contract laborers who make their living by skimming off the ship's supplies. Coolies cook, clean, iron uniforms, swab the decks, maintain the engine and do all of the menial work leaving the crew to drill, and drill and drill and drill. The paper tiger of the San Pablo's small crew and it's three pound cannon is the only force guarding American interests - missionaries, factories, mines and more, this far up the Yangtze and appearances have to be maintained no matter how ultimately ineffective the reality may be.By the second part of the book the Chinese have seen through it. The armies of Chiang Kai-Shek marching under the \\"gearwheel\\" flag of the Kuomintang are marching north towards the Yangtze while Bolshevist forces are working and agitating along the northern banks of the river. At first the coolies start skimming more and more off the top, and then they abandon the ship, running overboard and swimming towards a blockade of sampans that have started to surround and harass the ship every day. China is awakening to a sense of self-identity that had been suppressed for a very long time and the men of the San Pablo are despised relics of the old China, an abused and tortured China with no sense of pride or self-worth.Perhaps one of the most difficult things for the crew to deal with is the fact that the people they are supposed to be protecting, largely missionaries, are full supporters of the Kuomintang. When the San Pablo is told to stand back and only defend American lives, not American property, it is because of the missionaries who have gone home and lobbied for American non-involvement in China. The reader feels the frustration, anger and demoralization of the crew as they are curtailed repeatedly from executing what is supposed to be their primary purpose - protection of American interests. The Chinese have also learned how to make paper tigers of their own from their Russian advisors and waste no time in churning out propaganda and sometimes outright lies about the San Pablo and their men. There is no place for the men of the San Pablo towards the end of the book - their country has for all intents and purposes abandoned them and there is no place in this new, alien China they find themselves in.One last thing I will mention is that that most readers will be sent running for a dictionary of mechanical engineering by about fifteen pages in. I learned more about steam and marine engines reading this book than I ever expected to."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"I read this book in the early 60's and enjoyed it. I got it again a couple years ago to see how McKenna handled writing about shipboard life. I enjoyed the work tremendously. It gives you a real feel for life aboard a US gunship in the China Fleet, and how its crew interacted with the Chinese. I particularly liked the description of how the coolies started by simply collecting the garbage from the ship and gradually wormed their way into running just about everything on the ship. The crew finally came together as fighting men, when they had to, at the same time China came together as a nation and ended the rather genteel way Warlords ran their fiefdoms. It was a thought provoking story."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"\\"The Sand Pebbles\\" by Richard Mckenna gives a detailed look at the life of a navy sailor in China during the rise of Chinese nationalism and independence prior to World War II. The main character is Jake Holman and he is the engineer of a navy steamer called the San Pablo. The crew are called after the ship the Sand Pebbles. The ship is commanded by Lieutenant Collins.The San Pablo is patrolling the Yangtze River to protect a Christian mission at a place called China Light. This is part of the treaty, however the local Chinese want the navy boat out of China and the missionaries are also bothered by its presence. The missionaries think that having navy ships patrolling the area will give the impression that they are converting the Chinese to Christianity at gun point.The character Jake Holman eventually falls in love with a woman at China Light called Shirley. Jake Holman is conflicted over his responsibility to his ship and his love for Shirley.The novel is informative in two ways. It gives a detailed description of navy life and it also gives a detailed description of life in China with all its politics. The navy sailors are unsure about their mission. \\"The Sand Pebbles\\" does a good job of describing an amazing period in Chinese history and showing how it was witnessed by a crew of American navymen."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"I loved the movie as a kid and the book was even better, which I didn't expect considering how great the movie was.

I'd place it on a par with THE FAR PAVILIONS as one of my favorite all time books.THE SAND PEBBLES (the name was an affectionate nickname for the crew of the SAN PABLO) is story about the people, places and troubled time of China in the 1920s. The Chinese revolution (Nationalists rising) was underway and the rules were changing. The main character is Jake Holman, a US Navy mechanic who is new on board the SAN PABLO.Jake likes the unequivocal nature of working on machinery - it's not as complicated and confusing to him as people, politics and ideologies. He prefers to establish who he is through the excellence of his work and leave the other complications to those who care about them. On board the SAN PABLO however he is forced to with those complicated, ambiguous things head on.The characters are great, the story line is first rate, and the details of the time, place and historical situation are fantastic. The author himself served in the USN in those parts shortly after the time the story is set in and served with many who were there at the time, which made for good, accurate detail.I'd highly recommend this book.ps - there was a movie starring Steve McQueen, Candice Bergen, Richard Attenborough, and Richard Crenna.The Sand Pebbles"},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"\\"The Sand Pebbles\\" by Richard McKenna is a superb story of an antiquated American gun-boat that finds itself protecting American interests and missionaries along the Yangtze river during the Chinese rebellion of 1925-1928. The sailors are a rare breed (and mixture) of Navy men called \\"river-rats.\\" Unlike their \\"blue ocean\\" -fleet brethren, the sailors of the U.S.S. San Pablo (Sand Pebbles), have through time, unconsciously allowed the ever industrious Chinese boatman to split their command and symbolically strip them of their pride and duty.The ongoing revolt and events that haunt the ship and it's crew bring them to their knees ...like the bad karma they have earned. If, it was not for a few good and hardworking men like Machinist Mate, Jake Holman the \\"Sand Pebbles\\" would have surely been lost in the swift currents of dishonor and mutiny.I'm sure almost everyone recalls the 1966 movie, \\"The Sand Pebbles\\" staring the late great, Steve Mc Queen.

I would recommend it to other readers."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"The Sand Pebbles is a wonderful, edgy, sweeping, panoramic novel, to be sure, and I highly recommend it for all those reasons. But one aspect of it makes it an unexpectedly valuable historical statement. It concerns the sailors of a US Navy vessel patrolling the upper reaches of China's Yangtze River in 1925 and....Excuse me? Hello? There were US Navy vessels a thousand miles inside China? In 1925? In the heyday of \\"isolationism?\\" During the supposedly minimalist administration of \\"Silent Cal\\" Coolidge? Can you imagine the equivalent, were the tables turned: that some foreign power might assert its \\"right\\" to protect its expatriate nationals by permanently stationing gunboats on the Ohio between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh? The arrogance of it (and its undoubted cost to the US taxpayer) is staggering.If highlighting this absurdity was any part of author McKenna's immediate intention, it's not apparent. He was too great an artist to flog any political point-of-vew. But his realism requires him to portray the ambivalence of the sailors on the front line of this policy, the rigidly-repressed doubts of the captain, the hostility of some of the putative beneficiaries, the cheerful advantage taken of it by a few, and the stubborn resistance to alternatives or change everywhere."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"This is one of my favor novels, one that I would want on the proverbial desert island. I re-read it about once every ten years, and it's always fresh. This is a novel that can be enjoyed on many levels. It is an historical action-adventure story, with lots of pushing, shoving and fighting. It's a historical romance, in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott: a hero in an exotic foreign land, a long time past, fighting for what's right. It's a novel about Navy life, with lots of Navy procedures and protocol.But to me it's more than that. It's a philosophic novel that asks the question, \`Who's life is this?' I believe that in all our lives, there is a tension between what we would like to do, what we would like to be, and what the rest of the world tells us what we ought to do, indeed, what we will do. Our family pushes and pulls us in one direction, our employer in another direction, our community in another direction. Where does my own autonomy fit with the countless demands everybody else is making on me?This is the essence of \`The Sand Pebbles,' with the Navy acting a surrogate for society. The protagonist of this book, Jake Holeman is a misfit in life, forced into the Navy to avoid reform school, he drifts through the Navy without meaning or purpose until he learns to work on the ship's engines. It is only while he works on the engines that he finds fulfillment. Jake is not an anti-hero, he is smart and likable but he chafes at the many impositions society and the Navy place in his way. Everything in life is something he has to endure, except working on the engines.Like an unappreciated artist who must paint or write, Jake Holeman must work on machinery. Machinery doesn't care who a man is, where he was born, or how good his manners are. Unlike the rest of the world, machinery can't be flattered, cajoled or ordered. It only cares how much you know. If you know how it works, it will perform wonders; if you don't, if you try to con it, it could kill you. At first it appears Jake has found the perfect ship, a small gunboat patrolling some obscure river in an obscure part of China. Jake is the senior engineer, and as long as he keeps the ship running, life will be perfect. But no man can live is he chooses, there are always others who will tell you what you will do.So what happens to when you decide to live life on their own terms, to answer only to your own conscience? The world strikes back, and the results are tragic. Yet the tension remains, if we are to live life instead of just exist in it, we have to, by our own nature, push and shove back. Everybody dies, but few actually live. It would be a shame if they book were forgotten.This book was made into a great movie with Steve McQueen playing the lead character, but the books offers so much more detail. If you enjoyed the movie, you will be delighted with the book. Buy the book and re-read it every ten years to see how your life is going."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"It is one of the great ironies of American life that the U. S. military, though it is necessarily one of our least democratic institutions, offers many young people a unique opportunity to realize the American dream. This is so because in addition to providing them with training and instilling discipline, it has, for the most part, functioned as a meritocracy. Which is not to suggest that it has been devoid of politics or racism, but that in general it has been a place where a talented young man could rise through the ranks, provided that he could tolerate the restrictive lifestyle and function within the command structure. This tension though--between opportunity on the one hand and the requirement of submission on the other--makes the military a natural setting for a novel, where an author can exploit these conflicting themes.Most would probably argue that From Here to Eternity is the greatest American novel of military life (as distinguished from novels about actual combat, like Red Badge of Courage and The Killer Angels), indeed it made the Modern Library Top 100 and it is excellent, but The Sand Pebbles is even better and Jake Holman is one of the quintessential heroes in all of American literature. Jake, like his fellow anti-heroes RP McMurphy and Cool Hand Luke, or for that matter Huckleberry Finn, is smart, likable and a natural leader, but bristles at the many petty indignities of life. His fierce sense of injustice got him stuck in the Navy in the first place, in order to avoid a jail sentence for punching a spoiled rich kid, and he has transferred from ship to ship, seeking the one with the least responsibilities and the loosest discipline. He's deeply ambivalent about the Navy but does love one thing about it, the chance to work with ship's engines. He values this opportunity for what is, significantly, a political/spiritual reason :Machinery only cared about what a man knew and what he could do with his hands, whether he was a coolie or an admiral, and that was the secret, very good thing about machinery.And Jake's desire to be judged in this impartial and unprejudiced way carries over into his relations with others, so that he seeks to judge them on these terms also :The coolie was an engineer; well then, he was not a coolie, he was another engineer like Jake Holman.His devotion to this simple democratic code, and his loyalty to people who measure up to its standards, especially the coolie Po-han who he takes under his wing, makes Jake very appealing and, when added to a thrilling adventure story set in the China of the 1920's, a society perched on the edge of Revolution, produces one of my all-time favorite novels (and movies).GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"&quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is an interesting and entertaining novel set in China circa 1925. China is governed by feuding warlords, and its foreign trade is dominated by foreign &quot;treaty powers&quot; including the USA, Japan, and the leading European nations, all of which maintain strong naval and marine forces in China to maintain their positions and protect foreign persons and property.The novel takes place on an obsolete, barely functioning American river gunboat, the &quot;San Pablo,&quot; known to her crew as the &quot;Sand Pebble.&quot; The protagonist, Jake Holman, is an engineer-crewman aboard the Sand Pebble. Jake has a passion for mastering the ship's engines, but initially is frustrated by the fact that aboard the Sand Pebble each American sailor has a Chinese coolie understudy who in fact does almost all of the work aboard ship. The Sand Pebble crewmen have delegated almost all of the ship's routine to a shadow crew of Chinese coolies, and do very little actual work. Jake's frustration with the coolie-understudy system and his attempt to fit in with the Sand Pebble crew are part of the main theme of the novel.The real story of &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is, however, the emergence of China as a modern nation. The Kuomantang Chinese Nationalist movement is becoming ascendant in China as the novel unfolds, and it seeks to sweep away foreign influence, and the warlord system that has kept China weak and divided. The officers and crew of the &quot;Sand Pebble,&quot; in common with the other foreign military forces, must deal with this new movement, which seeks to change Old China, which had seemed eternally unchangeable. The slow understanding by the foreigners, including the Sand Pebble, that this change is real and something that must be dealt with, is the real story in the novel.Author McKenna does a masterful job of presenting China as it was in the 1920s, together with life in the American gunboat navy of those times. This is a novel rich with detail and atmosphere. Both the American and Chinese protagonists are presented with dignity and insight, making this a very interesting read. While the storyline of crewman Holman is interesting enough, this is only an excuse to tell the real story--the transformation of China.This novel will reward the patient reader. I personally found it engrossing and entertaining. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Old China Hand had a meaning during the early 20th Century. Jake Holman, primary American character of this book is an old China hand. He's a sailor on an American gunboat, a part of the multi-national forces cruising the interior waters of a China in the throes of unrest, warlordism, rebellion, turbulence and chaos created by the downfall of the Manchu Dynasty and the Boxer Rebellion.Jake's navy is one that resembles the post-WWII US Army in most of Asia prior to Vietnam in some ways. Asians do the unpleasant and difficult chores as houseboys and other types of assistants, to the point of imposing a dependence on them and degradation of competence of the Americans. Those who love Chinese history, those who love historical fiction, those who served in the Far East and remember, almost anyone can appreciate this classic work of (greater than) historical fiction.This book is one you'll read more than once, probably see the movie and love it, and read the book again without feeling the least letdown. It's a gripping tale of an almost forgotten time in history. I recommend it thoroughly, whatever your reason for reading it."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Richard McKenna's The Sand Pebbles is a great novel, it never gets boring and the story really catches the readers attention. The story has elements of humor, action, sadness and drama. It's a great read for anyone who loves reading, or a great work of fiction. McKenna masterfully takes us on a journey about many different people, with very different views on life and philosophy. Whether it be Holman who refuses to conform or Lt. Collins' firm belief in military duty, or the views of the missionaries who resent gunboats in China. The story touches on the issues that people little know about China in the mid- 20's, and the lives of river rat sailors who were placed in the middle of the Chinese revolution."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"The Sand Pebbles is the story of a small ship, on a small river deep in the heart of China. Unknown by most of the rest of the world but home to the crew of the ship. McKenna, a former Asiatic Fleet Sailor, describes life in the river gunboats of the 1920s with an accuracy and authenticity that is amazing. I could almost feel the heat of the engines and the aromas from the galley.The book is a study of men in the Navy. They are far from the public eye, doing a job deemed essential by someone in Washington. They are essentially feared by the Chinese and despised by the American missionaries they come into contact with. It must have been a brutal emotional duty to carry out. Yet many men loved it. They spent their careers on the rivers and retired there when their time was up in the Navy.Jake Holman, the central figure, is not better or worse than most other Sailors of that time. His motivation for joining the Navy were &quot;...Army, Navy or reform school...&quot; and so into the Navy he went. He is a competent machinest mate but has few real people skills. He is a loner on the outskirts of the Navy world. He has bounced from ship to ship and has now reached the end of the line. But even Holman makes friends in the ship as he tries to adapt to his surroundings.It is an interesting look at the gunboat navy. The crew did military duties and drills but the day to day ship's husbandry were done by Chinese men. Is it any wonder the crew loved China duty once they got there.One might say that the conclusion of the book is confusing and leaves you feeling troubled. Well it fits with the mission of the gunboat sailors and I think is perfect. Antiimperialists may condem the book and the subject but it was a real part of the American Navy and deserves to be remembered and respected."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"I'm very glad to see this one back in print. From their name, I'm guessing the new publisher is one of those that caters to students of military and naval history. Certainly the other reviewers seem to focus on McKenna's depiction of the lives of men serving on a U.S. Navy river gunboat in the 1920s.And indeed this aspect of The Sand Pebbles is very well done. The whole book is worth reading just for one finely-crafted scene where the other sailors bet a foul-mouthed messmate he can't tell a story without cursing. He wins the bet, but on his own terms.But there's more to this book then the lives a few seamen. It's about their interaction with the strange, wonderful Chinese civilization around them. And with China itself, which is, in a sense, the most important character in the book.McKenna motivates this action by centering the book around an intelligent but half-educated hero, a rebellious man who joined the Navy to stay out of jail, and who transferred to the river patrol to escape from the hierarchy and rituals of ocean-going ships. Lacking his shipmates' contempt for the Chinese, he becomes fascinated with their lives and culture. This fascinatation become the source of many complicated interactions between him, his shipmates, and the Chinese, leading to friendship, love, conflict, and tragedy.Another fascinating character is the boat's skipper, an aging Lieutenant Junior Grade. On one level, he is off-balance martinet, overly fond of military ritual, striving to achieve a strange personal state of grace -- with disasterous results. But he's also a keen observer of the events and people around him, and his inner conversations about them make for compelling reading.Most people know this story from the Steve McQueen movie, which reduced all the complexity of McKenna's story to Vietnam-era historical guilt tripping. A pity, because this book contains much insight about the interaction between China and the west, an interaction to often reduced to simple political cliches."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Great novels create complete worlds with characters who are fully human. This novel allows us to enter the mind of Jake Holman and see the world (or a small part of it: China 80 years ago) through his eyes. The book is deeply philosophical without being didactic or boring, exploring profound ethical issues in a fascinating way. Make no mistake-- it's serious fiction, though not &quot;heavy&quot; or overly literary reading. It's fine writing, an enthralling story, a classic novel."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"i first read this novel in 1965 and loved it. i was a sailor then. picking it up 30 years later and reading portions of it,still is satisfying. i can't say this about many other novels."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Some weeks ago, I was playing channel flip on the telly, and came across an old movie on a cable station. Happily, I caught it at just the begining, and settled in to watch this tale of American Navy men aboard a rickety gunboat in China. In fact, I was interested enough to find a copy of the book that the film was based on and happily settled in to read.The Sand Pebbles tells the story of the San Pablo, a creaky, none too sturdy gunboat from the Spanish-American war cruising the rivers and lakes in Hunan Province in China. Much like the boat, the crew isn't much too look at either; under the command of Lt. Collins, they're a rough lot, at the very bottom of the barrel. Into this world comes Jake Holman, another American seaman, who has come to the San Pablo to find a place where he can fit in, without the annoyance of the petty demands that the Navy sets on their crewmen.As Holman finds out very quickly, he doesn't fit in very well at first. For one thing, there's the system of letting the local chinese coolies do all of the work, while the crew merely sits back and, well there's a lot of topside drills. Holman hates it, being one of those sorts who would rather be with his beloved engines than around other people. It's a trait that instantly sets him apart from everyone else in the crew. They don't care what's going on, just so long as they don't have to do much, have good chow and clean quarters, with on board coolies to do the laundry and give daily shaves, and liberty now and then. They grumble a bit, but it's friendly jibbing -- they know they have it good here, with a fine soft perch, and are collectively known as the Sand Pebbles.But Holman -- it's not so good. He almost immediately gets into a fight with the coolie who is running the black gang in the engine room, with consequences that will have much more serious repercussions later. He takes another coolie, Po-Han, who has promise, trying to teach him the inner workings of the ship's engines, but a lack of communication skills make it nearly impossible. Holman struggles to fit in, but it not easy.We also get to met other crewmen, from Frenchy Burgoyne who is smitten by a delicate Chinese girl that he could never marry; Red Dog Shanahan, perpetual troublemaker and wise-mouth; Lynch, one of the petty officers with a Russian woman tucked away in Hankow. Finally there are the missionaries at China White, a nearby religious outpost. Holman is attracted to Miss Eckart, a young woman that he is drawn to despite the deep wide of culture and morality that separates them. For a while, everything seems to be settling in place, but all too soon, revolution is growing and soon the San Pablo will be right in the middle of it all.I have to say, I was really impressed with the book. Author Richard McKenna takes the time to create a world that is very alien to most of his readers, and his own knowledge from serving with the US Navy gives the details of living on board a gunboat an authentic flavour. While many readers will be offended by the slang and abuse that is very misogynist and racist, it also brings forward a past that most of us never knew. McKenna is simply writing about the world as it was at the time -- where other nations and races were viewed with outright suspicision and no one worried much if such terms as 'slant eye,' 'Slopehead' or 'chink' was hurled about. But McKenna is also careful in how he does it as well -- the reader will find themselves being rather unsettled as they read, and left to decide for themselves if times have really changed much in the last forty years since this novel was published. In any case, it is certainly a very good read, with plenty of introspection, action, and the day to day lives of men who are being forced into a untenable situation and one that may have no survivors.I recommend this one for any one interested in military history, China in the 1920's, or just want a good story about bravery and heroism in a desperate time.In this new edition, Robert Shenk provides an introduction that talks about Richard McKenna's own adventures serving in China with the US Navy, his attempts to write after leaving military service (he wrote science fiction at first), and then the experiences that brought around writing The Sand Pebbles. The book is now published by the Naval Institute Press as a Bluejacket Edition, a collection of books that focus on naval and military subjects.It really doesn't matter about your attitudes about war with this one; instead it focuses on the people who work hard and serve, sometimes in awful places and situations and explore their lives and thoughts, and how they survive. It's just about a five star read, and I was left with quite a few questions and thoughts myself once I had finished it. It's a very different sort of novel than what is being published today, without the hyperaggressive macho of most military thrillers today, and one that feels and sounds realistic.Five stars. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Interesting, clear, good read about China's start to modernism withit's rejection of Western influence after The Boxer Rebellion and it'srejection of Western power's trading ports."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"A GREAT HISTORIC FICTION AND LOVE STORY.LOTS OF DRAMA AND TECHNICAL KNOWELEDGE ABOUT STEAM BOATS AND THE POLITICS OF THE TIMES"},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"A sympathetic portrayal of a man more comfortable with machines than people who found an uneasy place in the riverboat navy"},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Good book.

Ok, the book was only $3.99, but I would have rather paid $9.99 for it and had it formatted in a professional manner. Sadly, I would recommend that you purchase this in a book form rather than an e-book."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Jake Holman, the protagonist, probably has Asperger's Syndrome, which makes it easier for him to run machinery than to relate easily to other people. A very important factor is the change in Jake's personality functioning as the personal relationships which he develops for the first time with some characters who are empathetic to him allow him to overcome some of the impediments of his psychological condition and to function more fully as a self-actualized person.However, the novel is not based on history. No American gunboat was atacked from the shore or river by the Chinese in the 1920s, although one was bombed by the Japanese in the 1930s. Thus the story's inaccuracy creates bad feelings against the Chinese Nationalists who are the legitimate government of China and defames China's government."},{"Title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"Richard McKenna's novel is not the reason for only 3 stars. The Kindle version of this novel is prepared by Rosetta books and their work is shabby at best.

The text has instances of a correctly spelled word that clearly does not belong -- for example 'than', rather than 'then'.

The author, Henri Charriere, called &quot;Papillon&quot; because of the butterfly tattooed on his chest, was wrongfully convicted in a French court in 1931 and sent to a penal colony in French Guinea to serve his sentence. He is determined to escape, and the book takes us through many attempts until at last he attains his freedom and begins a new life in Venezuela. The book is full of heroes and villains---good people who befriend him and treat him decently, and cruel, sadistic people who make his miserable life even more so. Charriere's tone throughout is honest, rarely self-pitying, and unsparing in its depiction of feelings as well as actions.&quot;Papillon&quot; is marred only by its misconceptions and dated, wrong ideas, especially about health and nutrition. Also, women readers may find the constant diet of adventure with only rare mentions of his loved ones back in France, and of the two children he fathered by girls of a welcoming native tribe, rather unsatisfying. One further jarring note is, as in true in prisons today, apparently a high percentage of the inmate population claim they are &quot;innocent&quot;--a concept that stretches Charriere's credibility."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I'm not a religious person, but this book is my bible. I will forever remember Papillon's goodness in the face of extreme evil, resilience within a hair's breadth of death, and power to love and lead those who were perhaps weaker than he. He will forever be an example and a teacher to me. To meet this great man would be a wonderful gift. Though he is no angel and life has brought out the ugliest of all of him, he remains a powerful influence. If he can be so strong in such situations (i.e. watching his best friend devoured by unforgiving sharks, withstanding solitary for two years in the most creative ways, the list goes on...for 13 years!) then I can survive anything this existence throws my way. I've met my Jesus through this book. I hope to read it again one day so as to have a greater appreciation of it, perhaps after i've been through some of my own horrors. I'll definitely see the movie. I've already passed the book on to a lucky person, despite that I'd love to keep it. Looking for adventure, romance, lust, utter suspense, even amusement (he's got a great sense of humour through it all)? READ IT!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"While I suspect certain elements of Papillon are true, e.g. the conditions in the \\"bagne\\" and general state of French penal code when it was written, you would have to be pretty gullible to believe the story itself to be based on facts. The author suffers through a number of escape attempts that each read like screenplays, and proves to be virtually indestructible in situations that claim the lives of everyone else surrounding him. But even so, it's a good adventure story.Like most people, I started this book thinking it was a true story. Research on Papillon confirms the book was originally planned as a novel, which makes a lot more sense. The believability meter for me finally broke when Papillon (who is loved by all, including all the guards, wardens, convicts, etc), becomes adopted by Indians who typically hate all outsiders. Not only do they take him in, but they offer him lovely virgins to bear his children and tearfully wave bye-bye when he abandons them! I caught myself laughing out loud.Papillon is a Frenchman to end all Frenchmen. He is well liked, fearless, good looking, rough and tumble, a lady killer, and a gentleman. Just ask him. The four stars are for the entertainment value, the book is worth reading. It is fun, exciting, and engaging. Just don't for a minute believe it's true."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"After having read Papillon, I'm left wondering how this book became considered such a classic. The prose is horrendous. \\"She did this. Then I did that. Then she did that. And I did this.\\" It's like reading a play-by-play that an 8th grader would give. Besides the prose, the plot is repetitive. Papillon is captured, then escapes, again he is captured, again he escapes, and so forth. Amongst all this, the narrator provides little insight into what he is thinking. You would think that after experiencing the kind of suffering and adversity that he does, he would be a little bit introspective and want to share his thoughts with the reader. Nope. Papillon's ego also makes this book rather tedious. He thinks the world of himself, and believes everyone else does as well. Those characters who do not respect him are painted as villains.After making it halfway through the book I was really disappointed. Not because of all the negative points I described above, but because I realized that there was no way the story described was true. I picked this book up because I thought I would be reading about the real-life adventures of a man who suffered unjustly in the French penal system of the early-to-mid 20th century. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, these stories are too far-fetched to have actually happened. While some people may be able to enjoy the book as a work of fiction, I found the wooden prose, the repetitive plot, the egomaniacal narrator, and the \\"false advertising\\" to be things that taken together prevented me from enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"In most cases comparing a book to the movie version of it inevitably results in the conclusion that the book is \\"better\\". This seems to be the general opinion of others as well as myself. I believe that when reading a book, we fill in the details to the limit of our own imaginations and experience, rather than having the image presented before us as in a movie, and therefore the book will probably be more meaningful and personal for us. However, I find this not to be the case with \\"Papillon\\".The movie shares very little with this book other than the broadest of details (name, location, imprisonment, etc). In fact the only real detail they share is the \\"falling-down-the-gangplank\\" stunt at the beginning.Many more attempted escapes and travel from one prison to another happen in the book than the few locations in the movie. There are eight entire months Papillon spends with the local Indians and gets two young women pregnant before deciding to leave them.Although the movie is a lengthy 151 minutes, the book is no lightweight either, coming in at 544 pages. However, I found it a bit tedious and am glad I got through it. It's an OK read, but not particularly a stand-out.If factual, then my hat is off for Charriere's fortitude and determination. If fiction, then he could have used a better editor."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Papillon is the roughest, toughest, rootenist, tootenist, best lover, and most fair, prisoner ever.

For those of you that can read French, the French/original version actually has many stories that were shamelessly edited out when translated into English.

There were many beautifully described adventures in Georgetown that the non-French reader will never know. The translation into American English is quite accurate in feeling.

At the age of 62, ex-safecracker, ex-convict, ex-fugitive, ex-nightclub owner, Henri Charriere wrote this book - in large, sprawling longhand on lined, school exercise paper - and sent it to a publisher with the simple note: &quot;These are my adventures, have a professional re-write then&quot;.The publisher, to his credit, did nothing of the sort. He produced the book exactly as Cherriere had written in. PAPILLON went on sale in France in may, 1969, and became an instant literary sensation. It was praised stravagantly, attacked viciously, discussed universally in all the media. Since them it has been translated into 14 languages and has sold more than 17 million copies !The book's critics point out the spontaneity and fluency of the romance. They also noted that PAPILLON is not a writing literature, but an oral one, and from that arises its narrative power.The story must be regarded as the greatest adventure of scape ever, yet Charriere account of his experiences has been criticised in some circles as being too bizarre and a handfull of the book's critics felt that no man could have exeperience so much. Charriere always persisted, however, that: &quot;There is nothing embroidered. Everything is rigorously true. if i have lied, it is by omission&quot;. And most people who met him believe this is the truth.What is important is that PAPILLON is a story of a man's courage and his relentless pursuit of freedom in spite of overwhelming odds. Charriere whas born in 1906 in Ardeche, south French. By his late teens, he has drifted into the Paris underworld with a reputation as as safebreaker. At the age of 25 in 1931 he was arrested for the murder of a pimp, a crime he absolutely denied until his death in 1973 with cancer in a Madrid hospital, claiming the evidence was rigged against him by the police."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"After watching the movie, I knew I had to read the book. This is one of those books that you cannot put down.The adventures that this man had...astounding! I was impressed with the movie as well. Many times, the movie is a disappointment but not in this case.Pick up this book and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"When I readed this book for the first time, I had only watched the film on TV... and not very closely. All what I knew about the book was that it was some sort of autobiography and it had been famous in the 60s as &quot;Papillon&quot; was a convict.And as soon as I began to read the book, in a great Spanish translation, I got completely trapped by it. Papillon is not merely written, it's like a flow of words that get into your brain like water, and soon you forget who's who, you won't tell if you are either the reader or just the guy at Guyana.I can't say why, but Papillon is the most fascining &quot;reading&quot; I ever found. I've readed it 6 times and the last one I still was trapped by it. From a reader's point of view, it's a must.People can opinate a lot about if the book is true; but, you'll rarely find a better written story. To me, the book looks like true; sometimes is too rushed as to have been plotted, and there are little details that make you think, &quot;why bother with this if you were building the thing from scrap?&quot;There are many lessons to get from Papillon; one is, following the rules when the rules are to die, is dying. The &quot;toughs&quot; never followed the rules, as the rules meant an 80% of casualties in the first 2 years. Papillon is not the ordinary convict, but the &quot;tough&quot; convict, with money and friends. But also has another thing: the strength to break the boundaries of his mind on his own, before the boundaries broke out of control and he loses the mind. The abbility to self-hypnotise himself, plus the insistence in being innocent no matter what was said in the Court, give Papillon the background to that appealing &quot;no surrender&quot; message.Also, Papillon offers lessons to modern readers. Now that building private prisons and filling them is a blooming business, Papillon helps us to remind that convicts are human beings. Maybe they aren't as easy to pick as Papillon argues, and certainly all them had failed to live an ordinary life, but Papillon takes long efforts to show himself and his comrades as human beings who try to keep being human in hell, while other human beings living in civilisation use their human abbilities to send their brothers to hell. Or to the &quot;Dry Guillotine&quot;, as Guyana was grimly known.Even now, Guyana would appeal to all the people who never care about the convicts -as when looking at it they just see a legal target for their egotic interests. Papillon/Charriere describes this kind of people, those who created the Reclusion, thinking that Guyana wasn't hell enough, it needed another hell of its own, and one that did everything but downright murder the... convicts? Or, victims? This would be just one of the many moral/amoral/unmoral cases that develop before the reader.I think that you can't take Papillon on the whole; its content is very varied and covers a wide spectrum of moral/amoral/unmoral attitudes, so you need to pick; but anyway reading Papillon is a fascinating experience, and is a book you'll like to read many times. As each time you'll find the same strenght of will, determination and courage you liked before, and the less-than-bright and not-very-clear details will offer you a chance to think again...To say in short, Papillon is a must. Either to fly in the highest of human soul or to look at the wickest places of the heart, you probably won't have a better mate than this writen, but not readed, instead listened, book."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Entertaining real life events-based story. I read burmese translation of combo Papilon and Bango. It is one of the few books which I read more than 5 times."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"This novel sheds a lot of light and understanding on how important moral, making deals where both sides benefit and how far high people skills can take you. This man also demonstrates a very high level of cleverness and intelligence. This book will have a positive impact on your life and speaks volumes on many different levels. Because the narrator has a focus on escape and how to improve his situation the whole book, it is not as depressing as you would think. I highly recommend it, even if some of it's stories are supposedly taken from other convicts."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"An amazing story of an innocent man's journey from the underworld of France to the underbelly of the penal colony of French Guiana in 1931. The movie, though excellent, pales in comparison to this incredible page turner that any author would be hard pressed to fabricate unless he lived it. Charierre (aka Papillon) sheds light on the beauty and brutality of humanity with touching insight and shrewd instinct. Depicting life and society on the inescapable islands in a straightforward fashion, Papillon paints a colorful, if not surreal, picture with humor and sheer agony. After nine escape attempts, the reader is left wondering how a man could have prevailed. Charierre's auto-biographical adventure is a testament to a good man's astounding mental capacity to survive the most hellish circumstances by his wit, ingenuity and imagination despite the odds of survival. A must read for the soul."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I saw the movie first and have seen it many times, I consider it one of my favorite movies. The book however is a lot better, and goes into a lot more detail than the movie did. In fact, the movie is so loosely based on the book there are hardly any similarities, except for maybe the name. The book describes Papillion's 6 or 7 cavale (escapes) attempts. The movie I think there are only three. Degas (Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie) is no where near as prominent a character as he was in the movie. Papillon's time in solitary confinement is also descibed a little different, and he gets sent there for different reasons than he did in the movie. The first time was punishment for the longest and best cavale. He received two years and the second time was for murder where he received 8 years, but only served two or less. Solitary was a lot more easy going the second time, and he was released after saving a child from drowning. In the book his most successful cavale is a lot more interesting than in the movie and it explains the time he spends with the natives in great detail. He takes two wives and has children. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie and wants to read the true story of Papillon and his struggle in the harsh French prison system."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Papillon is a work of unparalleled brilliance. Charriere's description of his incarceration in the French penal colony in French Guyana is both riveting and haunting. For a man as uneducated as he claims, Charriere reveals himself as one of the 20th century's greatest writers, succeeding in use of suspense, allegory and poetic style.Charriere builds a cohesive story, from the beginning in a rigged French court, through the trip to Cayenne, various cavales, and finally to a complete rebirth of spirit. Seen through eyes of compassion, anger, love and the wisdom of hindsight, Charriere gives a complete story that is not just an incredible adventure story, but a whole moral tale about life, strength, hope and faith."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I recommend this book to everyone who has an adventurous side. It is one of my favourite books and I found it very easy to read on kindle."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"\\"Papillon\\" the book blows \\"Papillon\\" the excellent movie (starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman) out of the water, but that makes sense considering what a one-of-a-kind book it truly is. I'm not one prone to blandishments, but I have no problem saying this is one of the most incredible and purely readable books ever written. It reads like fiction, but even that would be too unlikely.Some things in life are better read about than experienced and this is a great example. Henri Charriere is no angel, but nonetheless it would be hard to root against him as he endures 14 years of hell on earth, serving time in some jails and prisons that would send human rights activists into a fit. Getting beaten, starved and isolated in cells where a tide washes in crabs, cat-sized rats and 8-inch centipedes two fingers thick is only the beginning.Charriere not only survives penal colonies and escapes from the nearly mythical Devil's Island -- among others -- but his spirit and refusal to be imprisoned shows a will and spirit nothing short of indomitable.Charriere uses real language jailhouse slang and supplies a glossary, making this book impossible to put down. He has the patience of a chess player, watching the tide and plotting his escape through jungles, rivers, leper colonies and ultimately the ocean. I don't think Alcatraz would have been able to hold him.But what really sets Charriere apart from other writers is his powers of observation and description -- not to mention his will to survive. While awaiting a craft to escape the jungle, he watches a mundane yet incredible scene unfold: a colony of ants. He notices the roles of different ants. Some act as the police, others the workers. When some of the worker ants get out of line, they are pulled from the rest of the ants and subject to an execution squad, which chops them into three pieces. Then along comes a burial squad of ants, which digs separate holes for each part and buries them. Back to work.Charriere, upon escaping from French Guyana, actually finds his way to an Indian colony, where he lives as an Indian for seven months.I could go on and on, but then I'd just be retelling a story that practically begs to be read. I couldn't possibly give a higher recommendation for this work, which is about the most unique book I've come across in more than 40 years of reading just about every type of book there is. Do yourself a favor and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"An unbelievable story of adventure and redemption.

My problem with Papillon was twofold. A lot of people compared it to Shantaram when recommending it to me. Gregory David Roberts created such vivid characters, and Papillon is really only about one person (you never get to know much about anyone else). Secondly, I didn't like Papillon, the person, he never felt real, he seemed too good to be true. If he was really such an amazing, noble person how would he end up with a life sentence in the first place.

Reaching the prison camp in South America, he didn't stop for one moment to try inumerous and different ways to escape and have back the normal life of an honest man. In the book, Papillon tells us how were the years in prison, the friendship with other inmates, the terrible and inhuman confinement in a prison cell he had to take alone for two years as a punishment while in prison, the evasions and what he did in the brief time he was a free man in Colombia.All the while, Charriere kept the word that all that was in the book really happened to him during his years in prison in South America. I tried to believe that for most of the book, but there were some things that made me believe that, while the essence of his very hard times is told in the book, the narrative was transformed to provide the readers a more compelling story. As an example, the constant division of the characters in the book: those who were totally friendly and loyal to Papillon, and those who only wanted him to suffer.But what is important in &quot;Papillon&quot; is Charriere's strenght and his extreme denial in accepting his terrible fate, always trying to make his life and his friends' a little better in the situation they were. Aside from that, it's important to notice that the &quot;correction facilities&quot; and inmates situation maybe haven't changed that much since the 1930s and 1940s.

His book dispenses with the usual boring literary prefaces, academic fluff, and the typical pointless essay-like exercises in boredom and other such language skills. From the very first word to the very last, the book is so flooring that one cannot put it down.It takes no more than a pifly half a page to engage the reader, a feat no other author has been able to come close to.In the 70s H. Charriere was attacked that Papillon was nothing more than a made up tale. My response is simple to all these allegations that still surround the authenticity of this book today.I pray and hope that indeed H. Charriere made it all up and not a word of it is true! All the better!This book is not about some factual nonsense or some historical account of the police files but about a personal battle for freedom, grace and honor.

This book is a real page turner. Though rumors persist that Charriere made PAPILLON up, there are enough nuggets of truth to make you think otherwise. I had a little trouble with Papi's consistent nobility throughout. Charriere leads you to believe he was a gentleman throughout. Kind of hard to believe. Also, he's a little sketchy on his conviction for murder. That leads me to believe he probably commited the crime for which he was convicted. I would agree that the French system of justice was pretty harsh back in the 1930's, but I'm sure Charriere exaggerated \\"a little\\" here and there.But don't get me wrong. This was an amazing read.

I typically find autobiographical books to be a thinly-disguised excuse for self-glorification. However thankfully Papillon does not follow this pattern. And a much bigger surprise, it is extremely well-written. The literary world would have been a better place if the author started writing books earlier (..perhaps when he was in prison! :-)).If you've seen the movie Papillon then you have some idea about what the book is about. However the film adaptation is very watered down compared to the book. The book doesn't cease to amaze the horrors of prison life in French Guiana (in the 1930s) and the extraordinary efforts Henri Charriere went through to escape. I was shocked and heartbroken in equal measures. And although the author claims he was wrongfully imprisoned without really explaining the details it is clear he is no angel; he doesn't gloss over his weaknesses and failings.Bottom line: a terrific tale of horror and triumph.

So says the narrator in the Third Exercise-Book of 'Papillon.' Though we are confronted with 'underworld' and 'crime' they do not seem as terrible as 'State' or 'civilization.'At the end of his torrid adventures the author relates the following appraisal from a fishing village in Venezuela: 'Too much material progress, a rat-race of a life, a society with only one ideal - more mechanical inventions, a life that grows easier and easier all the time, a higher standard of living...this dries up people's hearts: it does away with pity, understanding and nobility.' And yet earlier on from an island prison of comparative luxury he tells his friends: \\"We'd have to be a right set of twats, though, to worry ourselves sick about a society that's never had the least pity on us.\\"Henri Charri&egrave;re's Papillon is a volume of rich human understanding. Unlike the film of the same name it is not a white man's struggle. I must underline the deep understanding of what it is to be human in this book irrespective of language spoken or skin tone or notions of well being. Freedom to love and be loved separates the distinguished from the barbarian.Along the path of one of his escapes he comes across real love. He has two wives there. All three of them live in the same dwelling. Each has a door of their own in that same dwelling. His instincts tell him never to make anyone jealous of himself. He is loved by all. So, why does he decide to leave? The answer is the very soul of the narrative. Some convoluted equation involving comfort, revenge and forgiveness.I read this book more than thirty years ago in my youth. At that time I marvelled at the man and what he experienced. But now I understand the truth. From my single-minded prison of costed existence, reading an electric book (this is a review of the UK Kindle edition) sheltered from winter's bitter ices, I also know that too many people live alone. Too many people in a position to change that also live alone with others. And the mighty State of Technology imports our notion of love and converts it into material desire. A wage increase means I.Pad possibilities. Cloud, sky, fire, available on credit or subscription. Where is freedom?For George Orwell freedom was the ability to state that two plus two equals four. In that one mathematical sum the character of Winston Smith opposes the forces of oppression. Papi also recognises the interaction between State and the individual. He just wants to live his life without being a danger to anyone. The chance to do so is all he asks.These days the State removes the chance to earn a living and buys the seeds of revolt with beads."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Loved this book.

It's a pity that most people do not know that this book has a follow up even better than this one called: Banco; which is about how he establishes his new life after he escapes from that terrible slavery."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Henri Charrere himself is Papillon.A man obsessed with escape from the penal colony of French Guiana. He has many great adventures during his confinment and many escapes. This is the best adventure book I have ever found."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"The thing that Henri Charriere desired most was his freedom. A French prisoner, he never stopped plotting ways to escape. The only time when he didn't have a plan in motion was when he was either in solitary, or upon personal request of the warden (they would request that he didn't escape so that they could finish their term, and not have their record/pension ruined by his escape).This autobiography spares no details about the violence and horrors that surrounded the prisoners daily. He loses a number of his friends to disease, or murder. Papillon was generally respected by his fellow prisoners, and the administration. He was quick to criticize the administration to their face. Many of the wardens and doctors even agreed with how screwed up the French justice system was.Henri is very detailed about his experiences and escapes. He remembers well the people who aided him before, during and after an escape. You will find yourself rooting for Henri with each escape attempt!There has been some criticism that say that Henri took details from other prisoners' accounts or that some of the anecdotes are made up. Regardless, this autobiographical tale of escape is better than any work of prison escape fiction that can ever be written."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"When Henri Charriere finds himself sent to a French prison colony for a crime he did not commit, he makes up his mind to go on a \\"cavale,\\" literally to beat it and escape the custody of his captors. Like the butterfly (or in French \\"Papillon\\") which Charriere has tattooed to his chest, he will live his life in freedom or not at all. When a doctor questions him about his repeated escape attempts, Papillon's reply is matter-of-fact: \\"I don't belong here - I'm only visiting.\\"\\"Papillon\\" takes a while to get started, and Charriere's elusive and terse tone keeps one from feeling too close to the narrator. He tells you he didn't kill the man the police claim he did, but credits himself for not being a stool pigeon by telling them who did. So he's not exactly Dreyfus here, though he pretends otherwise at times. He mentions a wife and child in the outset almost as afterthoughts, then scarcely refers to them again. No false modesty for this guy - he runs the roost in every clink he is assigned, dispensing wisdom to prisoner and warden alike. No physical challenge is too much for him to overcome, no fellow \\"mec\\" too much for him to handle.Let's put it this way: If Charriere is selling bridges, I ain't buying. But if this is more fiction than fact, \\"Papillon\\" still makes for one amazing novel. With minimal pretense at craft, Charriere crafts a white-knuckle, plain-spoken suspense tale that finds our hero in every imaginable predicament - and some not at all imaginable - as he makes attempt after attempt to escape the hell on earth that is French Guiana, the three Iles du Salut (literally \\"Isles of Salvation\\"), and ultimately Devil's Island. Taking you from the lush, mosquito-choked jungles of the Caribbean coastline to a solitary confinement where Papillon stays sane by imagining himself in childhood haunts, this is about as picturesque a ride as you can have sitting in your comfy chair.A sense of life abounds in this book. Charriere holds court on such things as the proper way to sleep in a hammock, how one secretes money on one's \\"person,\\" how the sharks knew when a corpse was about to be dumped in the sea, the strange tales prisoners tell, how one fishes for mullet on Devil's Island, etc. How much of this is on the level is tough to tell, but it fills the mind with a sense of a world lived in, and in one of the world's most obscure corners at that.Whatever else, one statement Charriere makes is no doubt true: He is a spellbinding storyteller. He has a sense of the tragic and the funny and never lets the storyline sag. He also throws in nice little asides that keep the reader engaged. At one point, when he is thrown in solitary, Charriere takes a break from relating his squalor to offer this merry assurance: \\"The movie could not stop there; it must go on. It will go on, mecs! Just give me time to get back my strength and you'll have some new episodes, never fear!\\"What makes \\"Papillon\\" especially readable and gripping is how Charriere comes into contact with the best and worst in people, sometimes the same people. The most seemingly depraved people can turn out to be not all bad; finding your hermit-like host keeps dead bodies in a pit outside his home is not necessarily proof he is out to do the same to you. He also has an intriguing religious sensibility, which yo-yos between antagonistic disbelief to a sense of profound grace. \\"Where there's life, there's hope\\" is an oft-repeated maxim in the book, and they are not hollow words for Papillon, whatever his state. Despair is unknown to him, and he's heartening to read for that alone.I'd love to know how much of this tale is true. Apparently, there is a French-language book that analyzes the story of \\"Papillon\\" from a historical context, and the History Channel in the United States did a documentary you can order online. The little I've seen indicates some holes in the number of escape attempts Charriere made. But he was a prisoner, and then he was free; he wrote a book that, if just 10% true, would be enough to fill out four or five adventuresome lives; and his legacy is one people still passionately relate to more than 30 years after his death. I can't give this book five stars only because of this trust factor, but rest assured \\"Papillon\\" is worth your time, and you will be happy you read it."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Great book. Part novel. Part autobiography. Thrilling, compulsive and picturesque. But this is a truly terrible translation. It tries to emulate penal colony slang but fails. Get the UK version with the padlock/butterfly on the cover. It's by Patrick O'Brien (Master and Commander etc)"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Papillon is the most moving true account of a time in a life I have had the luck to read. I have read all the reviews both here and on the UK site. Though it is the final word on perseverance, this is not the beauty of this book. No, it is not the narration, nor even the man himself or the breadth and depth of his adventures (though awesome). For me, it is the clear message that friendship is the greatest gift a person can have and give. It is friendship that allowed him to escape, to realize his dreams, to write his story. Where would he be without the kind Priest, how would he have planned the escape without Sierra, and what can you feel but shame (as did Papillon!) after the generosity of the lepers - how wholesome they seemed in their nature if not in their bodies. The examples are endless ( unlike this review - luckily! ) but the lesson is singular and clear.This book is inspirational - no doubt - its inspiration is to gain self-esteem, to fortify yourself against those that would climb your walls to pull you down, but, above all, it is to be human to others around you. The inhumanity suffered by Papillon and others like him were at the hands of those who could not feel for others as Papi and his friends felt for others.I read that one reviewer tattooed a butterfly on his chest in honour of Henri Charriere, for me, his story is tattooed on my mind. I think of his story and his friends as often as I do my own. The only other equally moving account of the power of friendship is \\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck.My friends, those who have read the book and those thinking about it - all the best!"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I will remember Papi's experienced all of my life. When I was 14 I read this book. Papllon is first book that I read totally. Afterwards I read it 4 or five times. And One day unexpectedly I noticed Banko (Papi's other book) I admired this french born, venezuelan died person. My hero, my prophet.I love him and her wife Rita. I remember that he write about meet her. If I could do one day I will go to Venezuela and visit his cemetery, and f there is, I wanna meet his relatives.Finally I am sorry for my english."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"At first, forget about the film. I like Steve McQueen's Papillon too, but the real book is something totally different. Papillon, as the story is almost unbearably heavy and emotionally devastating to the reader. The book is a genuine monster of juxtaposition of Human and the World (that is both the human community and the nature) in the most extreme sense. I cannot raise the question of whether the story is all real and if Papillon went through the horrors that exceed imagination of a human of developed world like me. The narration simply does not allow for that, because the author has put so much of personality into his account and described the events and images so vividly. What though is most astonishing to me is the truthfulness and the solid bear reality. There is no attempt to amaze the reader, both the little aspects and the elevated emotional and moral phenomena are narratively presented in a clear and ordinary style, but with an unquestionable essence of purity and truth behind them.It is also essential to apprehend the grand values that Papillon discovers, appreciates and highlights in his account. As a little example, the regular delivery of the little slip of paper from Dega and Grandet to Papillon in his solitary confinement cell on the Iles du Salut saying that they &quot;are with him, will try to help and do hope&quot; is essential. The reader realizes the incredible weight and importance of human support and friendship when one's in trouble or in loneliness. In normal life of a european, I find myself ignoring virtually millions of such little stimuli, for which Papi was so greatful and which kept him alive. I must admit I feel ashamed for this foolish nature of humans to ignore such small gifts when living in the relative luxury of the developed world.From a literary point of view, the book is written in a very simple language, that does not employ any sophisticated linguistic devices. The language of Charriere is such due to him not being a writer. I feel though, that this factor is what makes the story so incredibly pure and substantial.Henri Charriere has become a great teacher to me. Now that I have experienced possibly the greatest story of human experience, suffering and gradual purification of soul, my approach to every next minute of my life will be much more thankful. The values of friendship, reliability, absolute groundbreaking will AND honest truthfulness have been permanently engraved into my personality.It is hard to imagine that many people of the world do not even know of Henri Charriere. It is sad to realize how many of them could become better people by experiencing his life story. Nevertheless, I deeply encourage you to read Papillon, no matter what your age or status. You will never regret it. Matej"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I first read Papillon over ten years ago. I borrowed a copy on the recommendation of a friend. Ten years later, the story called me back and again it blew me away.Papillon is one of those rare books that leave you sad when you finally finish reading. Not sad for the character, but sad because the story has ended. It is an emotional roller coaster of a book that will have you crying one moment and laughing the next.A must read."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"During my 10 years of reading i've read countless adventure stories, some where good others were excelant and some were bad but none even comes close to \\"Papillon\\". the debated question wether the story is true or not is hardly relevant, (althought i simply don't believe someone can make up tales in this level of authenticy and realism) this book is impossible to put down and the reader is sucked into Charriere's world within the first page.If you can read only one book ,definitely read \\"Pappillon\\"."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I read this novel after seeing the Steve McQueen movie of the same name. In the movie, after Papillon's initial escape, I expected the movie to end, but as he experienced one amazing adventure after another, each wilder than the last, I felt as if I had gone into a movie-watching twilight zone of an unending action picture. I wanted to see if the book was more grounded than the movie.The book is even further out there. It strikes me as a partially fictional memoir of Charriere's experiences in a French penal colony in South America. What rings true are the dehumanizing conditions Charriere and the other prisoners experienced. What I think he made up was most of his adventures after his escape. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. For example, whenever Papillon and his friends land on British or Spanish territory, they admit they are murderers,yet they are always welcomed eagerly by the local officials who are eager to show their disdain for the barbaric French penal system. But the thing that really struck me as odd was when Papillon was captured by a tribe of Indians. He married two beautiful teenage sisters whom he left pregnant, and fled with a fortune in pearls. (One of his wives made her living diving for oysters.) That section reads like the daydream of a man stuck in prison for a very long time.The book is roughly written, and occasionally slows to a crawl as Papillon plans one unsuccessful escape after another, yet he is a wonderful storyteller and it is an excellent adventure, along the lines of \\"Beau Geste\\" or \\"The African Queen.\\""},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Papillon is by far the best book that I have ever read. It is the most entising story about Henri Charriere. When you finish the book you love Papillon so much. You are routing for him the entire book to escape. Don't see the movie if you plan on reading the book because the movie is terrible .The first two years that he is in solitary confinment is the most depressing part of the book.

I have found that during the most troubled times in my life reading the book helps greatly to get a perspective on what really is important. I will never be without a copy, more stars are required."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I actually really enjoyed reading the book. Its 400+ pages passed by without a lull though after reading it a while I started doubting some of the stories. Not that the ordeal was too unbelieveable just that everything he did he was the best at it. He was the best gardner, the best fisherman, the best animal hearder, the best you name it! When the wardens of all three of the penal islands got together and summoned Papillon to tell THEM how to handle goverment inquieries into a failed prison revolt was the topper. He states he had lucid dreams while in solitary confinement and I wonder if some of the stories weren't imagined episodes made real by such isolation. Any Psych majors out there?

He's mentioned that he was a safecracker & was involved with underground unsavoury characters so even though he was not guilty of the crime he committed he had obviously got away with plenty others & you feel that at the time France were better off without him. Of course we are all on Papillon's side through the escape attempts. Couple his steely resolve together with his determination to rehabilitate himself made the book both powerful & memorable.

As is the norm, the movie altered the book--unnecessarily--but not dramatically so. I actually found the story too amazing to be believable, and found myself asking many questions. Charri&egrave;re says it is all true to the best of his recollection. He is most certainly an excellent and vivid writer with a remarkable memory. After doing a little research I discovered that there are some who believe he was a fraud, or at least embellished certain elements. That he was an inmate for fourteen years in one of the most inhumane prisons--the French penal colony--is not disputed. Much of what he describes is probably quite accurate and in some cases Charri&egrave;re may have no reason to lie. We will probably never know, so just enjoy the book for what it is....as a novel if you wish.If the story is true Charri&egrave;re is a remarkable man--a jack-of-all-trades if you will. He was inventive, intelligent, resourceful, respectful and, respected. His generosity toward others grew as others continually expressed their humanity towards him. He became a changed man, so he says. He admits that he is not a believer and struggles with the idea, but gives thanks to God for providence on numerous occasions. He seems to realize his need to change his life around as the story progresses, and does later admit his guilt to the reader. Nonetheless, I do not necessarily pity him. As a petty thief within the French underworld he deserved some punishment.It is essentially an adventure story, as Charri&egrave;re expresses on occasion; it kept him focused, on what would be continuous escape mode, as he finds himself in new and strengthened prisons. Our sinful nature seeks and shouts for revenge, and Charri&egrave;re is not immune. The people who enriched his life along the journey touch the heart. Also, how he gained friends and respect from both inmates and guards is moving even inside a penal system that demonstrates man's cruelty upon our fellow man. There were many miracles, if it truly unfolded as told.Scott"},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Cracking adventure, a good read although I do recommend you DO NOT read the translators introduction until after you have taken the adventure with Papillon."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"How much you enjoy this book is all based upon how you look at the book. If you believe this is a true autobiography you will probably be disappointed. As you read you quickly realize that the notion that the tale is that of an accurate account of Paillon's life it is a complete farce! It would be extraordinary if one of the many tales in this book happened to a person when you look at the collection of adventures happening in ones life it becomes impossible. If you approach the book expecting a literary masterpiece with beautiful prose you will be disappointed. It is a nice read and descriptive enough that you can place yourself in the story, but a literary wonder it is not. However, if you approach the book as a work of fiction and take it in as a story being told to you by an uncle or a grandfather it is wonderful! Once I started the book I didn't really want to put it down so that I could see what happened to the character next. When you strip all the hoopla away it is a great yarn."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Papillon is many things. It is an extremely engrossing book that is almost impossible to put down. It is an inspiring and courageous testament to the human spirit and perseverance in the face of the most seemingly impossible odds - a true Odyssey. It is also an earth-shattering wake-up call to those who think that prisoners do not suffer. Although conditions in prisons have obviously improved since the time portrayed in this book, here we get a rare glimpse into the penal system - straight from the mouth of a person who has been through it. This book contains many disturbing things, and goes into quite vivid detail about a lot of things which prisoners take for granted that we don't even think about - I won't spoil it for you: just read it for yourself. ... Aside from all of its overhanging social ramifications, however, this is a very entertaining and exciting book to read. One can read it simply for the action and thrills - of which there are many - while totally forgetting about its other, deeper level, and enjoy it fully on that front. There is, though, yet another aspect to the book: Papillon's unwavering sense of hope in situations that would cause almost any man to give up. No matter what happens, no matter how bad things get, he never loses hope - is always looking toward the next cavale. Charriere (who is Papillon, in case you were confused on that point), though no angel, is obviously an admirable and deeply fascinating character - it's a small wonder that many look at him as a hero and even a role model. He also opens our eyes to something that we often overlook (or choose to forget): criminals, by and large, though they may be social outcasts and lawbreakers, are very often invariably more good-hearted and honest than the often corrupt law system that locks them up. The loyalty the prisoners display towards one another, as well as the integrity and self-confidence they exude, is nothing short of astounding. Papillon's favorable comparison of the so-called \\"savage\\" peoples to his French countrymen are eye-opening as well. An immensely rewarding, eye-opening book that should be read by one and all."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Henri Cherriere created a master adventure story when he wrote &quot;Papillon&quot; but many people overlook the true meanings of the book. It is not simply the account of an escape from the bagne in French Guiana, it is also, as Cherriere called his first notebook, &quot;The Descent into Hell.&quot; The full enormity of what happened in the penal colony there would have shocked French society to its core. Alfred Dreyfuss put the area into the spotlight, but very few people paid it much attention after his acquittal (World War I takes part of the blame for this). Over 70,000 French convicts were sent to French Guiana. Cherriere condemned the French judicial system for what it was: a decaying, corrupt, antiquated way of ridding French society of its offenders. Fyodor Dostoevsky once said, &quot;The civilization of a society can be judged by entering its prisons.&quot; From that scale France could have ranked even lower than the US, whose prison system is biased and absolutely dreadful.Cherriere also hit upon another point: hope when there is nothing but death and decay, hope when it seems that despair will finally extinguish the soul. Cherriere hoped and planned and was rewarded when he finally escaped in the early 1940's. I am not advocating escaping from prison but in a hellish place like the bagne, it was definitely justified.So, read &quot;Papillon&quot; for the adventure, if you like that, or read it for the deep, subtle 'between-the-lines' meanings if you like those. This book has served as a thesis for my outlook on criminals and the justice system ever since I first read it."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"M.

When I was back in school my father always asked me to read 'Pappilon'. Now after 14 years I understand why. The survival story of Pappi is 'surreal'. What I mean by that is - a normal person would give up and die in similar situations. From French Guyana to the Devils Island and finally to Venezuala, Henri Charriere perhaps brings out the extreme in mans zeal to survive all odds. While reading the book quite often you end up asking - can this be true, can this be real, what if Iam in a similar position. Pappi brings out great condradictions - he is on island inhabited by the Indians who are supposed to be ferocious and merciless. On this island he finds love and peace. He is on an island of Lepers - here he finds friendship and compassion. He is resting in a church and totally trusts the mother superior. And she is the one who betrays him.

This is an excellent read! I have traveled in Guyana and around the southern Caribbean to some extent and the sea is very rough. He must have been some sailor!Guyana is such an amazing and beautiful country, sadly remembered for the horrifying stories of \\"the bagne\\", its tropical deadly diseases, its giant ants and migales, its poisonous snakes, frogs and spiders, etc. During colonial times and later, the living conditions were indeed so difficult that diseases, i.e. dysentery and typhoid fever, would spread by the day or hour, mainly due to the lack of hygiene and the lack of access to medical facilities,. Malaria and yellow fever also caused more deaths among inmates than the internment horrendous conditions and other atrocities. The name and reputation of Guyana has not yet completely recovered since that time. The \\"bagne\\" was officially closed down in 1943. I can only wonder how one would ever think of an escape from it. Guyana is in the middle on nowhere. North and South is just the plain, thick, green, giant rainforest. What about Rivers, cricks? Then, probably only an expert Wayana could paddle a canoe and maneuvers through the strong stream of the Maroni or the Oyapock muddy rivers.I visited what remains of the internment camps in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, which gate stayed opened wide like a dead man's mouth, and the one in \\"Ile Saint-Joseph\\": a few compounds without doors or roofs still stand, black walls falling in decrepitude, zinc and iron bars rusted by the rain and the humidity... Surely, much of the tales of Charriere are pure fiction. Anybody (except of course the native Amerindians) will get lost and die just trying to find his or her way through the maze and thickness of the rainforest, and escaping through the sea doesn't looks such a better idea either. It is said that the sea, which is blue at the \\"Iles du Salut\\", is full of sharks who regularly swim about and around the islands to prey for sea turtles. Plus, there are at least 15 miles between the islands and the coast...In fact, Charriere's publisher, Robert Laffont, revealed in an interview before he died that Charriere submitted the book to him as a novel. However, Laffont, who had a true-life series of books on the go, persuaded him to present it as a true story. He also said that Charriere combined the experiences of several convicts (and we can only speculate how much they exaggerated their exploits)into his book.Indeed, it is highly likely that the book was ghost-written anyway.

But he has a sense of humour about his own hyperbolic amour-propre which makes it endurable. At one point, faced with a dilemma in this moral code of his, he writes:\\"I smiled at the prospect of having to search out an evil policeman with no family. How should I put it to him:'If I kill you, are you sure no one will miss you?'\\"Very droll, Papi.All this aside, what marks this book out from other books of the sort is the detailed descriptions of the torrid conditions of the tropic zone where our hero spends his sentence. They are utterly convincing, and if there's one thing to which everyone agrees it's that, guilty or not, Henri Charri&egrave;re did spend much of his life on penal colonies such as the le-Royale, described thus:\\"The noon sun was leaden-a tropical sun to boil the brain in your skull; a sun that shrivelled the plants not yet grown strong enough to resist it; a sun that, in a few hours, dried up all but the deepest salt-water pools, leaving only a white film of salt; a sun that set the air to dancing-it literally moved before my eyes-its reflection on the water burning my pupils.\\"In his second stay in solitary confinement, he pens - perhaps a bit too overtly - a passage worthy of France's greatest writer, who famously confined himself to a cork-lined closet during much of his latter years:\\"Such sharp recollections of moments and events fifteen years in the past, and the ability to relive them so intensely, can only be accomplished in a cell where you're cut off from all noise, in the most absolute silence. I can even see the yellow of Aunt Outine's dress. I could hear the wind in the chestnut trees, the dry noise a chestnut makes as it falls on the ground, or its soft thump when it hits a pile of leaves...And there was no one to stop me from rolling around in these memories and drinking in the peace so necessary to my battered soul.\\"Despite the nod Proust-wards here, there can be no doubt in the reader's mind after finishing the book, despite questions about specifics, that the writer has indeed been battered in soul and in body and seen the very best and the very worst of which humans are capable, and that the reader, vicariously, has done so as well.As Papillon says about the halfway fictitious explanation of an incident concocted, in order to save their skins and positions, by both guards and prisoners for the administration on one of the colonies:\\"It has since remained part legend, part true story.\\"So with \\"Papillon\\" and his harrowing tale of hope amidst the darkest adversity."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I first became deeply interested in Papillion when I became a regular visitor to French Guiana, the location of the real story.

From what I have seen of the movie, this book is 100 times better."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"As many reviewers have noted, it is a little difficult to accept 'Papillion' as being the True Story it's made out to be. At the very least, there's a fair amount of embellishment here, unless you believe that Charriere really was the strongest, bravest, smartest, toughest, most charming, most resourceful and most moral prisoner French Guiana ever saw. He's too perfect to be true, and the sheer number of unusual situations he gets into does make you wonder what's fact and what's fiction.But so what? Truth or fabrication, one thing 'Papillion' establishes beyond all doubt is that Charriere is an outstanding storyteller. The narrative is well-paced and fast-moving, and the author is equally at home describing the wonders of nature, the motley crew of fellow convicts, and the brutality of the French penal system. Many professional writers can't construct narrative as exciting as this, and rather than speculate about how much Charriere made up, we should be praising the literary skill of this \\"amateur\\". The English translation does a great job of conveying Charriere's vitality, and also makes a reasonable fist of conveying the slang and language of the time and place.After a short section dealing with his imprisonment and transportation, the first half of the book covers his initial escape from penal, which eventually spans several countries over the course of nearly a year. The second half covers the various attempts he makes to escape again, and the trials, misfortunes and punishments he suffers in doing so. It's interesting to compare how simple and effective the first break was, compared to the various detailed plans for a second break that come unstuck. Charriere is the sort of protagonist you just have to cheer for, and you'll find yourself actively willing every attempt to succeed, and sharing his devastation at failure. This emotional connection and tense anticipation means you'll make very quick work of its 500-odd pages.Parts of the book also offer commentary on the French penal system, although not how you might expect. Instead of a long angry protest, Charriere adopts a very matter-of-fact style; beatings, confinements and even killings are discussed almost as afterthoughts. This is actually more effective than a forceful rant could have been, as it highlights the very casual attitude both the authorities and fellow prisoners have toward a convict's life and liberty. There are also more upbeat sections detailing the friendship and comaraderie between the prisoners, and even between prisoners and the authorities. Charriere seems to recognise that the warders' and governers' lives aren't much better than the prisoners, all of them being trapped in a remote tropical backwater with few comforts.So sure, you can argue that not every word is strict literal truth. But you're kind of missing the point. 'Papillion' is an outstanding and well-written story that is entertaining while also conveying an important message or two. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"I first read Papillion in 1973 after my parents allowed me to watch the movie. At the time, I completely believed the story.My French is good enough that I have now read G&eacute;rard de Villiers \\"Papillon &eacute;pingl&eacute;\\" (\\"Papillion Pinned\\") and Georges M&eacute;nager \\"Les quatre v&eacute;rit&eacute;s de Papillon\\" (\\"The four \`truths' of Papillion\\" (a joke in French, someone who tells \\"four truths\\" is a pathological liar, as in \\"sure he's telling the truth, there's just four of them\\"). Both works make a compelling case that this is a work of fiction cobbled together from many sources and oral histories.With that said, so what? Is the book any good?The answer is an unequivocal yes, but only if you accept the self-centeredness of male narrative such as Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself or Claude Brown's \\"Manchild in a Promised Land.\\" It is perhaps this latter work that has the most fruitful comparison.Narrator Henri Charriere is condemned to a French prison colony for a crime he claims did not commit, but he sets his sights on escape, or a \\"cavale.\\" Regardless of whether the multiple escape attempts are all the experience of a single man, no one disputes that Charriere did spend time in prison and that his descriptions of prison life are accurate. This brutal, inner, unseen, and now vanished world are what make this work eminently readable today.Charriere's writing boarders on Hemingway's terseness, but without the poetics. He is full of himself at every turn, always casting his every action in a light most favorable to himself, but he mentions a wife and child in the outset then never refers to them again. This is abandonment. Throughout he wishes to escape for himself, not to be reunited with his family and his obligations to wife and child.Like Nicolas Murray Butler's \\"Across the Years\\" \\"Papillion\\" displays no false modesty he cast himself as the most idely respected prioner of all time, even getting Warden's and peanl Judges to do his bidding. No test of human endurance is too much for him, no \\"mec\\" (guy) too much for him to beat. It gets pretty tedious after a while, but let's face it...there are guys like this who just have star quality and for some bizarre reason float through their environment...why not in prison too?\\"Papillion\\" still remains an excellent novel. Charriere is an excellent storyteller and thriller writer ...plain-spoken, but every imaginable predicament from thuggish guards, sharks to crocodiles to outraged giant goons to hell-hole dungeons are items he endures or triumphs over. The exotic background is also a treat, with frank descriptions of weather, mosquitoes, centipedes, and other challenges of tropical life.The level of detail has the \\"ring of truth.\\" Sharks learn that the Chapel bell is their dinner bell as a prisoner's body is soon disposed in the sea. Fishing, growing vegetables, keeping chickens, and the small trades of tobacco and coffee so common in prison are all faithfully described. The gambling, the scams, and all the activities of prisoners, such as handicrafts, are all details that make it more real.Charriere's other talent is to reveal full-fledged characters with only the faintest of descriptions. From boys who become wives, to loner goons, to those truly evil, to those who appear depraved but have a unique code of conduct and decency of their own, are all on display here. These are full human beings through and through, the vast majority decent and noble.A thoroughly enjoyable read on a vanished world. Man's inhumanity to man is the theme, and it is well spoken."},{"Title":"Papillon, (Le Livre de Poche)","review":"Henri Charri&egrave;re, born in France in 1906, was not a gentleman. In 1931, following a shadowy career in the Paris underworld spent in the company of safecrackers, thieves and prostitutes, he was convicted for a murder he always maintained he did not commit and sentenced to transportation and life imprisonment in the notorious penal camps located in French Guiana.Charri&egrave;re, determined to preserve his health, his sanity, his spirit and, indeed, even his capacity for enjoyment of life, under unimaginably deplorable conditions and suffering inhuman punishment and abuse, always maintained that he was only visiting the prison. He definitely had no intention of hanging around for long. Labelled as \\"dangerous\\" by the prison authorities, he was an incorrigible \\"escaper\\".After serving a scant six weeks in French Guiana, Papillon (Charri&egrave;re's nickname earned in the navy due to a magnificent butterfly tattoo on his chest) escaped for the first time completing an astonishing sea-faring voyage worthy of Sir Ernest Shackleton. Without benefit of either maps or compass, Papillon navigated a thousand miles through shark-infested waters in an open boat to Colombia. With the assistance of a leper colony, he ultimately found his way to a native village tribe where he \\"married\\" not one but two young native girls who positively adored him and bore his children.But life was not yet finished with Papillon. Recaptured, he was cruelly sentenced to two years of solitary confinement and a starvation diet which was intended to break both his body and his spirit. It's difficult to believe but, when Papillon was released to the general prison population, he remained all the more determined to escape once again.\\"Papillon\\" tells the story of seven more daring but unsuccessful attempts. His ninth and final attempt on a raft of coconuts enclosed in a jute bag is described in breathless detail and has to count as one of the most exciting stories of adventure and endurance that I've ever been privileged to read.How much of Charri&egrave;re's autobiography \\"Papillon\\" is hyperbole and how much is fact is certainly not clear. Some have accused Charri&egrave;re of stealing the adventures of his fellow inmates and representing them as his own. But, to the breathless reader, none of this will matter. Incorporating themes reminiscent of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"Papillon\\" has to count as one of the most exciting stories of adventure and survival that I've ever read.Be warned! Don't crack the binding on \\"Papillon\\" unless you've got the time to finish it. Setting it down until Papillon successfully reaches the safety of the shores of Venezuala will not be an option.\\"Papillon\\" was a sensation when it was first published in 1969 and it remains sensational to this day.

What exactly is personal autonomy, and to what extent is it consistent with any approaches to mainstream normative Judaism? ... Are there grounds for halakhic pluralism within the halakhic system itself? How is halakhic innovation possible, given the weight of the past and of traditional authority? ... The chapters in this volume are intended to respond to these questions directly.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"We live in an era in which extravagant claims march under the banner of religious pluralism... Primarily, this phenomenon can be traced to the bold assertions of the Conservative and Reform movements...\\" (Pg. 94)\\"The overarching halakhic issues have not been formal ones... We remain in a kind of metahalakhic limbo, for these basic questions have not yet been resolved within Orthodoxy itself... More than one interpretation is possible. And we have not yet reached consensus.\\" (Pg. 143)\\"When my wife gave birth to our eldest daughter, we were overjoyed... One thing, though, distressed me: that I was unable to make the blessing... (which) is mentioned in the Gemara in connection with the birth of a boy, not a girl.\\" (Pg. 149)\\"There is an equally strong logic against the inclusion of women in the 'keter kehunah.' Why this should be so is a matter for historical conjecture, but it is certainly not because priestesses and other women religious functionaries were unknown to the pagan background against which the Torah is a sustained protest.\\" (Pg. 161)\\"A failure of talmud Torah will eventually lead to a failure of halakhah, for there will then be exactly the cognitive dissonance between law and sensibility that we find in the Conservative responsa. The answer to this is NOT halakhic change.\\" (Pg. 167)\\"In sum, our review of the evidence for HARD autonomy in Judaism appears to have yielded decidedly mixed results... Perhaps the tradition did not wholeheartedly embrace autonomy because it SHOULD NOT have wholeheartedly embraced it. Hard autonomy in most of its manifestations runs up against perfectly sound external reasons for questioning its validity.\\" (Pg. 198)"},{"Title":"Open Your Ears to Love","review":"Bettine has given us a wonderful account of her life and her music.

I think everyone who has serious questions about the full gospel, or charismatic christian experience, should read this book, because this is one informed believer that didn't get into extremes after receiving \\"it\\"-namely, the operation of one or several of the manifestations, or gifts of the Holy Sprit.I have only one cavet about this book. Please understand-the author of this book is A PASTOR. Full gospel believers who are Bible informed, know that a pastor in the christian faith, is an office of our faith-and must be called by, and empowered by-God. You can't twist his arm-he gives to whoever, and however he chooses to.Dennis saw many manifestations of the Holy Spirit in his life, because he was in the office of a pastor. After reading this book, I was somewhat disappointed that I did not see some the same manifestations in my life, especially that of seeing others healed.God DID choose to let me have a taste, in ministering to a lady, who I had ministered to for 3 years. She wasn't growing, and wasn't attending church regularly, and I felt that I had done all I could do for her if God didn't majorally intervene. I saw her touched as a result of my laying hands on her. So God did let me see it operate in the life of someone not called into the full time ministry.I will tell you that I did receive the manifestation of devotional tongues. But I will also tell you, that if you are struggling with surreder to God on several issues at the time that you do receive, you will prob not majorally benefit fromthis priviledge until you surrender ongoing, known sin.Please do not judge your spirituality by what God did in this author's life. Let me say-God wants to move through whosoever will-but he does it his way, not yours, and in his time-not yours."},{"Title":"Nine O'Clock in the Morning","review":"I met Dennis Bennett at a week long charismatic conference in San Jose, CA back in 1974.

I continued to be skeptical -- and still do -- of the reality of many Pentecostal claims, since I find them so ready to numerous numerous commands of Jesus and the apostles.

The book reaffirmed what I already knew, that we are to focus not on speaking in tongues but on expressing love and praise for Jesus. Speaking in tongues will come as an evidence of having received the fulness of the Spirit. As a former missionary to Ivory Coast, West Africa I can testify to the essentiality of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit in dealing with demonic forces, as well as an increase in power in bringing deliverance (Divine Healing) to the sick.Surely Father Bennett was used of God to bring a fresh renewal to our understanding of Charismatic gifts."},{"Title":"Nine O'Clock in the Morning","review":"When I read this book, I was a young parent who had become disillusioned with my life.

It was filled with mechanical errors. words were spelled wrong, the grammar was off, and several parts of the book were switched."},{"Title":"The Clouds (Nubes) (Greek)","review":"The legend is that when Aristophanes' comedy &quot;The Clouds&quot; was first performed in Athens in 423 B.C., his target, Socrates, stood throughout the performance so that everyone in the audience was aware that he was there and hearing what was said of him. The portrait of Socrates clearly satirical and most critics consider it to be inaccurate. But Aristophanes is making fun of Athens' renowned &quot;Think-tank&quot; the &quot;Phrontisterion,&quot; the school where the rich young men of Athens were taught the fine art of rhetoric. Instead of anything lofty the comic poet suggests the primary purpose of such an education is to be clever and out-reason greedy creditors. This is an especially good translation of the play, which includes insightful notes and essays on both Old Comedy and the Theater of Dionysus that helps readers understand the conventions of staged comedy at the time of Aristophanes.In this comedy Socrates is consulted by an old rogue, Strepsiades (sometimes translated as &quot;Twisterson&quot;), who is upset with the mountain of debts his playboy son Phidippides, who loves fast horses and fast living. Phidippides agrees to go to Socrates' school of logic where he can learn to make a wrong argument sound right. After graduation is able to use the system of &quot;unjust logic&quot; to outwit his father and kick him out of the family home. The Chorus of Clouds comments on the proceedings and in the end the Phrontisterion is burned to the ground by Strepsiades.The flaw of the play is Aristophanes is trying to satirize the Sophists, who were popularizing a new philosophy that denied the possibility of ever reaching objective truth, he picked the wrong target. The Sophists were mostly teachers who were not native to Athens, such as Isocartes and Gorgias. &quot;Sophist&quot; basically meant teacher, so while Socrates was a &quot;sophist&quot; he was not a &quot;Sophist.&quot; Twenty-four years later, when Socrates was condemned to death for &quot;corrupting the youth of Athens,&quot; the only accuser he said he could name was a certain &quot;comic poet.&quot; For contemporary audiences who are untutored in the traditions of classical Greek philosophy it is easy to see Socrates as the prototype for the absent-minded professor, but historically that is, of course, far from the truth. Ironically, even today, Socrates is still one of the few &quot;sophists&quot; that a contemporary audience would recognize by name if not by reputation.The version of &quot;The Clouds&quot; that has passed down to us is not the original version, which was defeated by Cratinus' &quot;Wine Flask&quot; at a comedy competition during the Great Dionysia celebrations. We know this is a revised version because the Chorus complains about Aristophanes finishing third in that competition. However, critics assume it is essentially the same play, albeit a more polished version. Once you forgive Aristophanes for his unfair characterization of Socrates, &quot;The Clouds&quot; is a great comedy employing all of his standard tricks of the trade from fantasy and ribaldry to funny songs and obscene words."},{"Title":"The Clouds (Nubes) (Greek)","review":"I'm in a humanities program at the University of Vermont, and this book was like watching &quot;Roseanne&quot; after a marathon of &quot;The McGlocklin Group&quot; (or however one spells that).

Aristophanes portrays intellectuals as an arrogant class of effete and pasty skinned unbelievers. Except for their skills in rhetoric, which help them get around the law and rip people off, their knowledge is of little worldly or practical value. In other words, their heads are figuratively in the clouds (hence the play's title).\\"Clouds\\" is funny in places, but also disturbing in its anti-intellectualism and nostalgia for marshal virtues and doubt-free theism. If Aristophanes were alive today, he might be a caustic, and very conservative, Republican (or even a Fascist). For all this, his play has an undeniably contemporary feel in its critiques of rhetoric, and makes a good primer for reflection on the nihilistic and shameless uses of argumentation (as when oil company representatives engage in blatant sophistries to cast doubt on global warming science).But when, at the end of the play, the lead character (Strepsiades) gleefully burns down the school of Socrates, one is sobered by the reactionary nature of the play. The ending reminds one of humanity's long and tragic history of genocide and iconoclasm (the destroying of a rival ideology's texts, idols, symbols, or buildings). The ending of Aristophanes' play clearly suggests that the killing of an entire class of people in his society would be a positive development. It is not without reason that Plato famously attributed Socrates' death, at least in part, to the popular prejudice generated against him by Aristophanes' \\"Clouds.\\"In short, Aristophanes' play is thought-provoking, funny, and sobering. It's an easy read and, even after 2500 years, still relevant."},{"Title":"Language Arts Activities for the Classroom","review":"As an instructor of one of the Language Arts methods classes at Southeastern Louisiana University, it was quite alarming to find so little on my subject matter.

Over-all, I was hoping to get more from this book than I did."},{"Title":"Why You Lose at Bridge","review":"This book is reaching its 65th birthday, having been originally published in 1945/6, but is certainly not ready for retirement! It is humorous and practical, concentrating on the unspectacular but effective ways to avoid making mistakes and make the most of your cards - and your partner. The first part, on technique, is interesting; the second part, on the psychological aspects of playing with different partners, is virtually unique. We meet people like the Unlucky Expert, the well-meaning but incompetent Mrs Guggenheim, Mr Smug and Futile Willie (the \\"very bad good player\\", who uses conventions without real understanding) in our clubs - and if we are honest, we recognise something of them in ourselves. Of course some of the material is dated - bidding has changed considerably since then on both sides of the Atlantic, and the examples concentrate on rubber rather than duplicate bridge - but the key insights come up as fresh as ever. I would definitely have had better results in the last 10 years if I had read this book earlier, for example because I would have had more realistic expectations of what a partner can remember or deduce in a bidding system (unlike the Unlucky Expert)! I remember similar \\"lightbulb moments\\" from the chess equivalent, Simon Webb'sChess for Tigers. Sadly, S.J.Simon died relatively young, at 44, only a couple of years after writing this book, which is why it and the equally insightful \\"Design for Bidding\\" have never been updated.

Even the most capable professionals may well (re)discover ways to improve their game as they absorb Simon's words of wisdom. Improve your partnership, and your game improves. Simon sez ..."},{"Title":"Why You Lose at Bridge","review":"The bridge-bidder's arsenal is usually full of \\"gadgets\\": non-literal bids meant to convey or suggest information that might escape the normal bidding sequence. Even by the time this 1940s book appeared, \\"scientific\\" systems by leading bridge \\"experts\\" were all the rage. Who would disagree with scientific \\"experts\\"? After all, you can't fight progress.WHY YOU LOSE AT BRIDGE dares to differ. S.J. Simon, author of this enduring little volume, shows us the genuine odds behind competitive bidding and play and explains things the highly regarded experts of his day didn't know -- or didn't want us to know.[Note: the following two grafs assume some bridge experience.]Would you almost automatically double a competitor's bid of \\"Six Spades\\" (12 of the 13 card tricks) if you had two \\"quick tricks\\" in your hand? Think about it, Simon warns. If the opponents have even a one-in-three chance of winning, your unthinking double will give them between four and six times the number of points for making contract considering vulnerability. Besides, when they hear your double the declarer will figure you for the two Aces and act accordingly. Watch out for the sure things that really aren't.And sometimes (usually, the author implies) the scientific gadgets aren't worth it. At one tourney, following tortuous symbolic bidding, one partnership came to a contract of four spades and went down one. How had the author and his partner bid that \\"impossible\\" hand? Like this: South - 1 NT; North - 3 NT. Simple and literal.After offering a bracing immersion in what I all \\"unlearning,\\" Simon spends the second half of the book on the psychology of bridge, starting with the times a partner or opponent starts what he calls \\"trancing\\" -- mulling things over. Chapter Eleven, \\"The Logic of Luck,\\" typically illustrates Simon's curmudgeonly attitude. We could almost blame him for the high-British-arch tone of his writing, except that he is always right!WHY YOU LOSE AT BRIDGE is a tremendous book for bridge beginners, perhaps even more so for intermediates and even the more experienced players trying to cope with a new partner. Of course, this WAS the 1940s so the author assumes that major suits (Hearts and Spades) can be bid upon with only four of them in hand as opposed to today's more prevalent \\"five-card major\\" approach. And I have to wonder what Simon would make of today's bidding in general."},{"Title":"Why You Lose at Bridge","review":"Very dated. I found it an odd book.

Read it once when you are a beginner. It is truly hard to find such a concise guide how to advance rapidly from the basics. Or, like me - after all it first appeared before I was born - rediscover it if you want to improve faster. Players at all levels will find something fresh and stimulating while reading it.Many books dwell for long pages on the intricacies of the complex game of bridge, but this book really focuses on the essentials, on how to think at the bridge table, and how to remain realistic, especially if you are playing with different partners. And if you have an established partnership, read it together.Walking the fine line between being too aggressive or too conservative is the key to success in bridge, and this book has good advice on how to fine-tune your approach. The pages on competitive bidding are pure gold. The reader will find practical gems like dealing with preempts, hesitations and psychic bids or playing 4-3 fits - just to name a few - which are as important to the matchpoint and team players today as they were for rubber bridge in the forties.The advice to adjust your strategy to the scoring system rings as true for duplicate games today as when this book was written, and can spare you making many bad decisions (and help you make many good ones!), once this way of weighting the pros and cons of a particular action at the table is internalized.To wrap it up, read and re-read it!

I had read a review somewhere (Rolling Stone? I do not remember) and I was completely blown away. It is a really excellent handbook of photography by someone who had complete access to the stars of their day. The technique is very very refreshing...Pigozzi actually mostly takes pictures of himself either as he is with some star he know or as one walks by him...Simply incredible and has to be seen to be believed. It really inspired me in many ways back then and he was the one that made me buy my fisrt M type Leica. Hilarious."},{"Title":"The Saga of Hog Island: And Other Essays in Inconvenient History","review":"When this book first appeared, the title THE SAGA OF HOG ISLAND AND OTHER ESSAYS IN INCONVENIENT HISTORY appeared strange until he read the essays. These essays are thoroughly documented with end notes taken from the public record and show what an honest historian can do with some work in the library as opposed to error filled \\"documentaries\\" and rehash of \\"mainstream\\" hisorians that are filled with distortions, fabrications, sloppy research, and omissions. Why the study of history has deterioated to this point may be due to cowardice, political connections, etc. \\"Historians\\" show a desire to be apprensively conventional rather than fundamentally honest which was ruined both the writing and teaching of history. Anyone who want to escape such dismal writing would find this book \\"a breath of fresh air.\\"James J. Martin's Introduction to this book is in itself a careful look at the sad state of historical writing. Historians actually did serious reading and research to write their books. This began to deceline in an attempt to write history as literature rather than give accurate accounts of history. Then the craft of historical writing declined further in that \\"historians\\" decided to write unreadable prose to be \\"popular\\" and politically correct. The refusal to do serious research and do any original thinking so historians can \\"fit it\\" was diagnosed by A.J.P. Taylor when he was asked if history repeats itself. Taylor's response was no, but dull historians repeated each other.The first essay titled \\"The Saga of Hog Island\\" is instructive. This essays deals with the financial scandal and massive theft and fraud that took place during World War I when wealthy contractors got lucrative contracts to build transport ships to send U.S. troops to fight the forces of evil in Europe. The financial scandals, theft, sloppy accounting, etc. was a scandal so expensive that it made the Teapot Dome Scandal of the early 1920s look like petty theft by comparison. The record keeping was so bad that government auditors who tried to unravel the problems surrendered in their attempt. One should note after all the flag waving and \\"patriotic\\" effort to build these ships, not one ship was launched to carry any troops, but some corporate executives were rich thanks to the American taxpayer.Of particular interest are the essays dealing with the criminality of U.S. policy makers regarding Pearl Harbor to enter World War II in Europe through the \\"Back Door to War\\" as Charles Tansill titled his well written on this topic. Martin reveals that erronous judgement that the Japanese who lived on Islands the size of California with less than the population of the United States and natural resources of the state of Mississsippi would not last six months in a war with the United States. This prediction was undermined by four tough years of war against an enemy who controlled much of China and were vastly outnumbered and outresourced. Martin makes the poignant remark that the this war was imposed by U.S. policy makers on behalf of the \\"Open Door\\" in China. The only thing the Japanese did in China was what the British, French, Russians, etc. did in China for much of the second half of the 19th century. In other words, the only crime of the Japanese was that they were the new player in the imperialist game in Asia. Yet, what did the Americans get for their \\"victory?\\" The Chinese Communists came to power in 1949 and slammed the Open Door shut for all of the Weaterners including the Americans. By eliminating the Japanese in China, the Americans left Asia wide open for Big Communism. Martin shows Asians were very impressed that the Japanese fought the British and Americans and made the war a tough fight in spite of overwhelming odds. Other Asians were aware of the Westerner's feet of clay and decided to \\"act up\\" with their large populations and huge land area. As an aside, an American diplomat was rattled by a Japanese diplomat who asked how the Americans enjoyed fighting the Chinese Communists since the Americans removed the only effective force against Chinese Communists by ruining the Japanese during World War II. One should note that the Japanese checked Mao tse-Tungs's emerging Communists from the 1930s to 1945.Martin also has a thoughtful essay on British efforts to first declare war on the Germans in 1939 and preach the utter destruction of the Germans during the entire war. Churchill's lads preached fire and vengence against the Germans and refused any negotiated peace. What did Churchill & co. have to show for this \\"victory?\\" The British brought the Soviets much closer to Great Britain. The Soviets who were now armed with nuclear weapons posed a much more serious threat than the Germans ever dreamed of, and six Soviet hydrogen bombs could make the British Isles uninhabitable. The British lost their empire very quickly and in turn their economic status. The declining value of their currency made the British as second class, and their brutal efforts in attempting to stop rebellions in Asia and Africa were equal to anything the Germans were accused of during and after World War II. Martin proves his case that the British have become an American welfare case ever since World War II and probably will be for a long time.Another interesting essay in this book is Martin's essay titled \\"The Death and Life of the Mafia.\\" The Italian government under Mussolini crushed the Italian Mafia and their \\"homcidal greed\\" only to see the restoration of the Mafia beginning in 1944. This essay shows that the revival of Mafia was yet another one of those unintended consequences of World War II.The other essays in this book are well worth reading. Martin shows precision in his research, and his writing style in concise and clear. Anyone who is tired of canned historical accounts and wants a starting position to more comprehensively understand the complexities leading the World War II and the Cold War would enjoy this book and would have the resources to write more honest and inconvenient history. As one of this reviewer's former students wrote one time, if one opens a can of worms, go fishing."},{"Title":"The Saga of Hog Island: And Other Essays in Inconvenient History","review":"In an article published soon after James J. Martin's death in April 2004, interviewer Jeff Riggenbach, said:\\"He didn't regard himself as a \\"revisionist,\\" really, Martin told me near the beginning of our first telephone conversation late in 2002, so much as an \\"additionist\\" - the fellow who comes along after the historical accounts have been written and adds what's been (inadvertently or deliberately) left out...\\"The phrase may as well have been the dedication for Martin's \\"The Saga Of Hog Island And Other Essays in Inconvenient History\\" (1977). These essays, like James J Martin himself, are both inconvenient and cannot easily be pigeon holed into the prepared square boxes labelled with your favourite or least favourite \\"-ism\\". There are six chapters (i.e. long essays) and three appendicies (i.e. short essays). The writing style is excellent and engaging, and I found only one of the essays (Hog Island) too long. Martin's writing style is plainly superior to over ninety per cent of the non-fiction writers out there, but this isn't the real jewel. That honour belongs to Martin's footnotes. Martin's footnotes are long, copious, scholarly, yet entertaining, incisive and opinionated all at the same time. To read the book ignore the footnotes, would be in this case, like ordering a fine meal and missing desert.Martin's additionist essays are historical correctives that have relevance to events today. The first essay tells the story of the massive world war 1 ship building yard built at Hog Island, now the site of Philadelphia International Airport. Legend has it that the \\"Hoagie\\" sandwich may have had it's origin among the many Italian American shipyard workers. At it's peak as many as 36,000 workers were employed on Hog Island yards. This vast facility was established to mass produce cargo ships for the WW1 war effort, along the lines of the more famous \\"Liberty Ships\\" of WW2. But the program was dogged by scandal and massive accounting \\"incompetence\\". In the end Hog Island, owned and operated by a consortium who's membership register reads like a \\"Who's Who\\" of the American business and industrial elite, delivered 122 ships that cost of \\"at least\\" $235 million to build (that is $2.4 billion in 2007 dollars, ~$20M each). Most of the ships were ultimately sold for a mere $35,000 each ($353,000 in 2007 dollars). Hog Island itself was a part of a larger web of mismanagement that embraced the Shipping Board and the Emergency Fleet Corporation. \\"Alfred D. Lasker, who assumed the direction of the Shipping Board under President Harding, on July 16, 1921 decalred that the total government 'loss' on the ship construction, operation and leasing activities during the World War came to $4,000, 000, 000- double the figure originally thought.\\" Corrected for inflation, those 1921 dollars amount to approximately $40.3 billion in 2007 dollar terms. In a January 31, 2005 CNN article published under the headline \\"Audit: U.S. lost track of $9 billion in Iraq funds\\". \\"Nearly $9 billion of money spent on Iraqi reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management, according to a watchdog report published Sunday.\\" It's probably not being over dramatic to say that the vast 'losses' in US military-industrial spending represent part of a 90 year tradition of apparently unending fiscal incompetence.On the 10th January 2000, \\"The Weekly Standard\\" declared that Winston Churchill was \`Man of the Century'. In his second essay \\"The Consequences of World War Two to Great Britain: Twenty Years of Decline, 1939 -1959\\" provides a much needed tonic to Churchill worship, and his elevation to the status of prophet, as regularly recycled by the History Channel and George W Bush's bedside reading. In 1942 Churchill declared \\"I have not become His Majesty's first minister to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire.\\" Yet to a large extent that was his real legacy as Martin explains. Martin's piece also illustrates the extraordinary fickleness of many American conservatives. Ever ready (and probably rightfully so) to condemn FDR for bending over too far to accomodate Josef Stalin, FDR's \\"willing accomplice\\" Winston Churchill largely escapes scot free from conservative criticism. Yet less than a year before his famous 1946 Fulton Missouri \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech, Churchill was praising Comrade Joe in parliament. Perhaps had FDR, who died in April 1945, had lived another year he would have had time to perform a public somersault too.Martin provides an eye opening essay on Mussolini's campaign against the mafia. Like most students of history I had heard of this but had assumed Mussolini must have conducted some kind of fascist purge or authoritarian \\"round up\\" of mafiosi. Not so. Mussolini's campaign was quite civilised with the accused being provided legal rights and indeed many accused successfully defended themselves against the charges and walked free. Still despite these 'handicaps', Mussolini's lawful and orderly campaign against the mobs was one of the largest and most successful campaigns against organised crime anywhere, and much of it's gain was unravelled by a mixture of postwar chaos and some allied cooperation with the mafia. Martin explores this last angle too. Many of us have heard of Lucky Luciano's claims to have helped protect the New York waterfront from German saboteurs and to have aided the allied advance across Sicily. These stories indeed have become legends of sort. Martin sees them as shameless self promotion from a crook on the make. The allied armoured and amphibious campaign in Sicily wasn't dependent on local mafiosi to show them goat tracks behind the Axis lines.Martin has three essays on the Pacific War. Only one could really be called revisionist. In \\"Pearl Harbor: Antecedents, Background and Consequences\\" he outlines the background to Japanese-American rivalry in the Pacific in the decades and days before Pearl Harbor. Usually \\"the revisionist position\\" here (as if there were just one) is summarised as the claim that FDR engaged in a conspiracy over Pearl Harbor. The old mainstream belief that FDR was really an innocent victim of a surprise attack has now largely been dismissed from serious scholarship, thanks to decades worth of unpraised work by revisionist historians. The new mainstream belief is that the unheeded warnings of imminent attack were mishandled. Administrative incompetence rather then conspiracy provides a better explanation. The revised mainstream account arbitrarily assumes incompetence and conspiracy are mutually exclusive categories. More to the point was \\"Rainbow 5\\", the then secret ABDA (Australian-British-Dutch-American) agreement \\"..to fight the Japanese in Asia if their forces crossed a geographic line..[which]..approximated the northerly extremity of the [Dutch East Indies].\\" The US government was advised that the Japanese had crossed the magic line on December 3 (Washington time) and that America's allies naturally expected the US government to live up to it's agreements. The apparent mishandling of reports concerning Japanese fleet movements in the northern pacific need to be considered with the ABDA timeline in mind. Considering the great difficulty the administration had in having conscription passed in Congress, it squeaked through by just one vote, a certain degree of planned incompetence, an art form familiar to anyone who has worked in a bureaucracy can attest to, is not an unreasonable explanation (although one inherently and deliberately hard to prove). Nor is such a hypothesis equivalent to Roswell UFOs or the Bavarian Illuminati as anti-conspiracists like to maintain.Martin also essays the stories of Colin Kelly and \\"Tokyo Rose\\". Kelly was an airman who died early in the Philippines campaign after his aircraft was hit following an indecisive attack on a second or third tier Japanese vessel, probably a supply transport. In the dark days of continuous bad news from the Pacific his deeds were inflated to legendary status by the media, and indeed the administration, until it sounded as if he single handedly sank a battleship in a one-man kamikaze attack. Subsequent revisions of the official account deflated the Kelly story down to a footnote before disappearing in later versions. The whole story seems to echo in the 2003 Jessica Lynch story. Times indeed have changed, the spin cycle is faster these days. The \\"Tokyo Rose\\" essay details how a soldiers' myth, that there was one seductive Japanese propaganda broadcaster luring GIs with tales of unfaithful girlfriends back home, led to a miscarriage of justice that scarred the life of Iva Toguri, a young Japanese American woman accidentally caught up in Japan whilst visiting family in the days surrounding Pearl Harbor. Toguri, one of many english language broadcasters was made carry the can for the lot. With the boom in recent years of feminist and multicultural studies, all under the history banner, it is surprising that Martin's \\"The Framing of Tokyo Rose\\", especially with it's hints of sexuality, hasn't become a standard in gender studies. This too has modern references, and not just in the United States. The current \\"War on Terror\\" is leaving in it's wake a growing \\"bodycount\\" of innocent bystanders caught at the wrong place, often to become the victims of tragic miscarriages of justice as government security apparatus strikes out at it's elusive quarry.The book is rounded off with three brief appendix essays, essentially magazine articles. The first compares the blacklists imposed on Axis commerce in South America by the US in the years before Pearl Harbor to the attempted Arab boycott of jewish owned firms in the US in 1975. The second discusses the Morgenthau Plan and the third is a brief history of political assassination in the first half of the 20th century. The last article is definitely the best, the Morgenthau Plan article is not comprehensive and seems to have been prematurely ended, neglecting to cover it's demise and the boycott article seems to me to be \\"drawing a long bow\\". The Rockefeller administered Axis boycott in South America, whatever else it was, was part of an actual economic warfare plan, the Arab boycott barely deserved the name and was almost entirely a propaganda campaign lacking serious enforcement teeth. If anything it probably boomeranged and hardened international opinion against the Arab campaign.\\"The Saga of Hog Island\\" is recommended to anyone interested in modern history."},{"Title":"J.G. Robinson: a Lifetime's Work (Oakwood Library)","review":"JG Robinson was born in 1856, became an apprentice in Swindon in 1872, and became an assistant to his father in the Great Western Railway's locomotive department in 1877, in the days of the broad gauge. He moved in 1882 to the Waterford and Limerick Railway, and from there was recruited to the Great Central Railway in 1900, where he remained until his retirement in 1923, at Grouping. It was at the GCR that he produced a number of famous locomotive designs.This is a well-researched and well-written book, and is also eminently readable.

Revelation and Rebellion in the Old Testament and the Christian World","review":"This is the 3rd book I've recently read on the Great Apostasy in the last year. Scott Petersen has clearly done a lot of research and summarized the concepts in an easy to follow manner. Years ago I had read \\"The Great Apostasy\\" by James Talmage which focused on the abuses that occurred in the middle ages and touched lightly on what occurred immediately after the apostles deaths since he did not have access to the writings of the early church fathers. Recent research has shown how quickly the Apostasy occurred immediately after time of the Apostles. It is fascinating to see how fast the doctrines changed. This book summarizes that data. The other two books I've recently read are \\"The Inevitable Apostasy and the Promised Restoration\\" by Tad R. Callister and \\"Turning From Truth: A New Look At The Great Apostasy\\" by Alexander B. Morrison. Morrison's book is the shortest and probably the best summary for someone initially getting into the subject. Callister's and Petersen's books are much longer, but give more details. Both are well written, but from different perspectives. I recommend this book as a very good entry on this subject."},{"Title":"Where Have All the Prophets Gone? Revelation and Rebellion in the Old Testament and the Christian World","review":"Religion often raises so many opinions that few people are willing to discuss the subject -even objectively. Scott Petersen, fundamentally a businessman, has plowed in where many have feared to tread. He has done his homework by doing extensive research in a serious attempt to truly understand what happened in the early Christian Church and more specifically where that leaves believers in Christ today. I applaud his noble effort and believe he has lifted the cloak of mysticism that has covered reality for too long. Outstanding reading for anyone interested in the truth."},{"Title":"A Good Stick","review":"I had the pleasure of flying with Captain Sulucco,back in the old Mohawk Airlines days.

In this, one of his very best novels, two plucky elderly women encounter all kinds of adventures and misfortunes, but face all difficulties with courage and resourcefulness, no matter how ridiculous the situation might appear. They are shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean and make their way to a tropical island. They set up house in a comfortable deserted home, being sure to deposit rent money in a ginger jar. Soon back in the US again, they journey from the West Coast eastward, enduring a stagecoach wreck, sliding down a mountain during a terrific snowstorm, and finally making it back to their home in Pennsylvania, none the worse for wear. These two women have the uncanny ability to look life right in the eye unblinkingly and with great humor.

His previous work, &quot;Natural Rights and the New Republicanism,&quot; in many ways a &quot;prequel&quot; to this volume, was a historical and not to mention philosophical landmark. This work picks up right where he left off. Part I of the work consists of an in depth analysis of the Declaration of Independence. This interpretration bristles with new insight. Unlike many past scholars, Zuckert makes an overt effort to place the Declaration in context. He does this by examining other sources of information, e.g. Thomas Jefferson's &quot;Notes on Virginia&quot; for instance. The end result, I must say, is brilliant. Contrary to modern conceptions, he demonstrates what the Declaration was really meant to say, and, at the same time, how philosophically sophisticated it really was. In Part II, Zuckert endeavors to prove that the United States was indeed founded as the natural rights republic, in a modern, dynamic, forward looking philosophical climate. To begin with, he picks apart the thesis that the American Revolution was merely an extension of the Glorious Revolution undertaken by the Whig ruling class in the late 1680s. This however, is nothing new, especially if one has already read his account of the Glorious Revolution and natural rights philosophy in his previous work. Nevertheless, he shows conclusively the incompatibility between the two Revolutions, primarily, but not wholly, through a comparison of the Declaration of Independence and the English &quot;Bill of Rights.&quot; Moving on, Chapters 5 and 6 address the issue of Puritanism and its legacy in early America. Many scholars have proposed that the American Revolution was merely an extension of ideals held by the early Calvinist settlers of the 17th century. It is this thesis, however, that Zuckert completely demolishes. He conducts and in depth analysis of Puritan ideology, as well as its sources. Of particular interest is discussion of Martin Luther's concept of the &quot;Two Kingdoms,&quot; and its influence in American thought. To make a long story short, he demonstrates how dramatically Locke's ideas clash with those of the early Puritans. This contention is driven home clearly by an examination of important political/relgious thinkers in 18th centiry New England, Elisha Williams and Jonathan Mayhew in particular. Finally, in Chapter 7 finds Zuckert further pushing his case for the natural rights republic. He takes on the so-called &quot;classical republican&quot; or &quot;civic humanist&quot; thesis expounded by such scholars as J.G.A. Pocock and Gordon Wood, deftly making mincemeat of them. Pressing on, he examines Thomas Jefferson's evolving political philosophy to reveal the truly radical, natural rightist foundations of American republicanism. Although the book is by and large solid, I do have several misgivings about it. First and foremost, Zuckert's Jefferson scholarship is highy suspect, as can be devined through use of Merill Peterson's biography, as the small, unscholarly Library of America collection of Jefferson's writings. I was very surprised that he did not cite Dumas Malone's definitive 6 volume biography &quot;Jefferson and His Time,&quot; or Julian Boyd's definitive collection of Jefferson's papers. Also, Zuckert's refutation of the Puritan &quot;Continuity Thesis,&quot; strikes me as a bit odd, as it does not prove anything at all concerning the colonies outside of New England, none of which have any Puritan heritage whatsoever. Despite these shortcomings, the work as a whole is brilliant. This volume, as well as his previous offering, is an absolute must for anyone interested in the relevant disciplines."},{"Title":"The Natural Rights Republic: Studies in the Foundation of the American Political Tradition (Loyola Lectures in Political Analysis)","review":"This book is an absolute must not only for loyal followers of a natural rights theory as basis of the US constitution. Every scholar who wants to research the foundations of American constitutionalism in depth should have this book in the personal library. It his here that he will find pure Lockeanism and is here that Zuckert puts forward his case of Lockean natural rights and social contract theory as ideological basis for the founders in such a concise way that it is difficult to argue against his case. Of course this is what avid Zuckert readers are used to. This book, however, in referring to Jefferson as a natural rights thinker argues the natural rights theory with one of the most convincing witnesses you can find in American history: Thomas Jefferson. Zuckert depicts the Declaration of Independence and American political thought from an interesting perspective, Jefferson's viewpoint. He succeeds in disputing the main opposing theories to the natural rights theory such as the exemplary role of classical Greece and Rome, the continuity theory based on Puritan thought and Bailyn's point that Locke was only one among others influential on American political thought, to name just a few. I did note, however, a certain tendency to neglect historical facts especially as far as the influence of the English common law and Whiggish thought on the framers is concerned. Finally, that Zuckert did not examine the Constitution itself as closely as the Declaration of Independence is not only excusable. It serves a good purpose: to underline the importance of the Declaration of Independence as an outflow of quintessential American thought, thus a document America should be proud of."},{"Title":"Storm Over Babylon","review":"A real page turner! Eric Alexander clearly knows a great deal about the movie business, and winds this into a fast-paced action story. I hope the next one will lift the lid yet further on the real Hollywood."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"I read all of the other reviews and was prompted to buy this book, because there was a consensus that this was one of his best books or the start of a solid string of Wolfe novels. The only problem with the other reviews I have is that none of them, really take into account the first time Wolfe reader. I found the dialogue and interaction between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin very intriguing. It shares some similarities of the genius detective and his trusty sidekick. The difference being here that Archie is more the eyes and ears and the man about town that Wolfe is not. If you read Christie or Conan Doyle, then you may tire of the dolt of a sidekick who can never figure out in the slightest what the hero detective is up to. While Wolfe is the genius here, the story revolves around the fact that Archie is present to the supposed suicide of a young single mother that he feels is actually a murder. It is Wolfe's trust in Archie that commits him to the case at hand. Throughout the way the police and other parties try to convince Wolfe to give it up, but his intelligence and the resourcefulness of Archie and company find the truth. Truly an entertaining story and intriguing characters. It is clear from Stout fanatics that it is worth the read, and take it from a first time reader as well."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"This is Wolfe in his pomp. After a patchy time, with a few sub-standard stories during the early/mid 50s, I think that in this book, Stout established the key ingredients which he continued throughout his excellent later period. After Champagne for One, he never wrote a weak full-length Wolfe. Good plot- there's even a passable sub-plot!"},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"One of the best of Nero Wolfe. I also recommend Some Buried Caesar, one of more light-hearted books. I read Rex Stout nearly 20 years ago and have just started re-reading them. I am enjoying them more the second time around that i did the first. the plots and characters are ageless! I can still laugh at the unique interplay betwee Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe, still envy the freedom of Nero's lifestyle, and still admire the plots. One of the great things about Rex Stout, is that (unlike some mystery writers that I could name), he doesn't hold out clues or keep secrets that the hero discloses at the end. He gives you the clues (sometimes tossed out in the middle of a paragraph). And sometimes, just sometimes, the reader get the thrill of solving the mystery!"},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"This book is fast paced and gets to the point quickly and with style. The characters are brilliant as well as deep and interesting. The setting rich and full and the plot clever. I'm hooked on Nero Wolfe and after reading this book, I'll never read another Anne Perry novel again. Rex Stout can capture and mix all the needed elements of a good and exciting mystery."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"followers of nero wolfe and archie goodwin will not be disappointed with this book. it's all here - orchids, lovely women, the globe in the office and saul panzer. you will love the way archie is forced to be at his most diplomatic when dealing with the many unmarried mothers in this book. and with an unexpected villain too."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"Who knew?Fetal alcohol syndrome just was not on the radar when Rex wrote this one. Faith Usher, a guest at a special banquet honoring illegitimate moms, dies shortly after drinking a champagne toast.It as the murderer's hard luck that Faith's chosen usher is Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin. It just won't do to have Archie's date die right in front of him...This one, like \\"The Mother Hunt,\\" addresses Stout's preoccupation with society's conventions around maternity. And of course \\"The Father Hunt\\" talks about paternity, and sometimes how it's wiser not to know some things..."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"With his usual crotchedy charm, private eye Nero Wolfe tackles another mystery, this one involving the death of a young unwed mother, in Champagne for One. Mixing in with the horrors of death are the poignant story of a girl in trouble trusting philanthropists to take care of her, and the careless class of the wealthy who are indifferent to everything save their own public images. Engrossing and suspenseful, Champagne for One is a quick read that will leave you wanting to devour more of Rex Stout's wonderful Nero Wolfe mysteries."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"This is anything but hardboiled crime - more like light musical crime. An odd genre that has a murder as the central plot device, but we're all meant to be well aware that, like in cartoons, nobody really gets hurt: the victim will get up, dust themselves off, and be ready to be done in or doing-in in the next novel. The TV drama based around this series suits it perfectly, with the same cast taking turns in different roles throughout. Still it's an enormously popular style, so safe in the knowledge that we're deep in convention we can have a nice time playing in a situation that in reality would be awful.While Stout never goes over the top (which is why I stopped at a B - I smirked occasionally but never laughed out loud), the characters and manor of dialogue are not too distant from a Wodehouse novel. Stout's narrator is dryly humorous rather than ingenuously hilarious. He has his moments:\\"It is always a temptation to monkey with locks, and one of the best ways to test ears is to enter someone's castle uninvited and, while you are looking here and there for something interesting, listen for footsteps on the stairs or the sound of an elevator. If you don't hear them in time your hearing is defective, and you should try some other line of work when you're out and around again.\\"Nice timing - it's the sort of thing I'd expect to hear from John Clarke. The confident females we encounter sparkle in conversation, and most of the company is pleasant enough to be with. Stout makes the trip quite agreeable.He puts himself under a bit of pressure with the frequent references to Wolfe's \`genius' (I always prefer a writer to convince me of a character's outstanding attributes by their actions and dialogue rather than expecting me to just take their word for it that they're intelligent/funny/cunning or whatever), but part of the reason for this is he enjoys playing with the hierarchy and professional protocol of various detectives who enjoy sorting out their place in the pecking order, and need a grand master to aspire to.This is not fantastic or powerful or stunning - but it was never meant to be. Stout was a prolific professional writer turning out another workmanlike product in his justifiably successful franchise - this is hardly his attempt at a masterwork, but it is a solid, enjoyable light crime novel."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"No good deed shall go unpunished. Archie fills in for a friend as an escort at a dinner for unwed mothers and one of the mothers ends up dead. Archie is the only one who thinks it was murder not suicide. Will the police never learn? Nero Wolf steps in to straighten it all out."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"In this Nero Wolfe mystery, written near the end of the 1950s, Stout returns to his best writing (as exemplified by some of his earlier Wolfe novels, such as Some Buried Caesar and Too Many Cooks). In this book Archie must attend a party for six unwed mothers, one of whom, Faith Usher, carries around a vial of cyanide just in case she feels like committing suicide. During the evening, Faith dies: poisoned by cyanide in her champagne. Was it suicide? No, says Archie, who had been keeping his eye on Faith and her drink and her behavior the entire evening. Archie claims that nobody had any chance to put anything into Faith's champagne, and therefore she was murdered.The pressure for Archie to change his statement is intense. Pressure not just from those at the party, who don't want a scandal, but also from the police and the Police Commissioner. Archie won't back down, and Nero stands behind what Archie says. And then Edwin Laidlaw hires Wolfe to keep something from being revealed: that he was the father of Faith's child. So Nero promises to solve the murder case before the information about Laidlaw and Faith is revealed.A well-plotted story, with lots of Archie-Nero dialogue."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"I first heard this Nero Wolfe mystery on the A&E TV series. I enjoyed seeing how close the program was to the book."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"If you are already a Nero Wolfe fan and are considering Champagne for One, I promise you won't be disappointed; it's one of the best. If you have never read a Wolfe book, this is a good one to start on. All the Nero Wolfe books are extremely funny and intriguing. In Champagne for One, the fat genius dectective Nero Wolfe has to solve the case of a girl who's death looked like suicide, but wasn't."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"One March morning in 1952 Archie Goodwin got a phone call from an acquaintance, Austin Byne, who wanted Archie to fill in for him at a dinner party that evening. Archie had an unpleasant experience with the hostess a few years earlier, he knew that the excuse Austin had given him was false and he was aware that the dinner party, an annual event where the guests of honor are unwed mothers, was unusual and more than a bit awkward. Despite all the reasons not to go Archie's curiosity got the better of him and he agreed to go. Before the evening was over though he came to regret his decision though. One of the unwed mothers committed suicide by putting cyanide in her post dinner champagne. At least that was the official explanation, Archie was convinced that the young woman had been murdered, and based on Archie's conviction Wolfe found himself involved in the mess. It was a decision that he must have had second thoughts about though when multiple women came through the brownstone on several occasions before the culprit was found.As always with Stout's stories the plot is clever, full of twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing as Archie ferrets out the clues. The dialog between Archie and Wolfe is witty and the scenes of Wolfe coping with a roomful of females is hilarious. Those who are new to the series would do well to start here and those who are fans will enjoy this one with its delightful peeks into life in the brownstone."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"Champagne for One begins with Archie Goodwin getting roped in to attending a somewhat unusual dinner. A small group of \\"unfortunate\\" young women (unmarried but had children) are paired with men of society in an attempt to broaden their horizons. It's sort of an odd premise but it does provide a great setup for Archie to practice his flirting skills. As you might guess, this being a Nero Wolfe novel, one of the young ladies swallows poisoned champagne and dies at the party. Most of the people there believe it's suicide, but Archie was watching her and knows she didn't poison the glass. From there, we are treated to a mystery with all the usual twists and turns until you're practically certain that no murderer will ever be revealed. And then, of course, Wolfe reveals the killer.Champagne for One is a good read. It isn't quite up there with the very best Wolfe novels but it is far from the worst. The characters are probably better than average, the humor typical of the series is present and accounted for, and the mystery is more than interesting enough to hold the reader's attention. I probably wouldn't give this to a first time Wolfe reader if I wanted to be sure they'd get hooked on the series, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a fan looking for their next fix of the corpulent detective."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"A straightforward mystery to solve...how does a young woman commit suicide in front of a watchful Archie Goodwin. She didn't as Archie contends and Wolfe proves; she was murdered.

Here, even though the plot premise is a bit strained, I really don't care. We get something better: in a quartet of dialogues -- through Archie's eyes, and through Fritz's & Wolfe's -- we see Archie at his Archie-est.A few brief tastes of these four:First dialogue, with a new male character. He calls out-of-the-blue to invite Archie to a very elite, possibly strained dinner party. After toying with him, Archie says to himself,\\"If I hadn't had my full share of ego I might also have been curious as to why he had picked on me, since we were not chums, but of course that was no problem. If your ego is in good shape you will pretend you're surprised if a National Chairman calls to tell you his party wants to nominate you for President of the United States, but you're not really surprised.\\"...the fact was that that idea [of the dinner party] appealed to me.

Also it would be an advantage to have the family already started.\\"\\"Pfui.\\"Archie, always a wonderful character, shines throughout this tale. But there are several other highspots: Hackett, the Robilotti butler, is given several neat scenes. (Stout often does butlers well.) After its weak premise, the plot kicks in, and has some really fun & unexpected twists. There are nice Wolfe-Archie tiffs, and a couple of fun Wolfe-women tiffs, as well as a few touching scenes, too. Great mature Stout, with many characters well-drawn.I close with the Archie quitting scene, one of several in the Stout canon. After a frustrating dry period, Wolfe had just given Saul an errand. Starting with Archie:That was when we had words. I cradled the receiver, not gently, and stood up. \\"This is Saturday,' I said, \\"and I've got my check for this week. I want a month's severance pay.\\"\\"Pfui.\\"\\"No phooey. I am severing relations. It has been eighty-eight hours since I saw that girl die, and your one bright idea, granting that it was bright, was to collect her mother, and I refuse to camp here on my fanny while Saul collects her. Saul is not ten times as smart as I am; he's only twice as smart. A month's severance pay will be--\\"\\"Shut up.\\"\\"Gladly.\\" I went to the safe for the checkbook and took it to my desk.\\"Archie.\\"\\"I have shut up.\\" I opened the checkbook.\\"This is natural. That is, it is in us, and we are alive, and whatever is in life is natural. You are headstrong and I am magisterial. Our tolerance of each other is a constantly recurring miracle. I did not have one idea, bright or not, I had two. We have neglected Austin Byne. ...he deserves better of us. I suggest that you attend to him.\\"I turned my head but kept the checkbook open. \\"How? Tell him we don't like his explanation and we want new ones?\\"\\"Nonsense. You are not so ingenuous. Survey him. Explore him.\\"\\"I already have.... Are you working yourself up to saying that you want to see him?\\"\\"No. I have no lever to use him. I only feel that he has been neglected. If you approach him again you too will be without a lever. Perhaps the best course would be to put him under surveillance.'\\"If I postpone writing this check is that an instruction?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"At least I would get out in the air and away from the miracle for a while.\\"All Wolfe-Archie fans are grateful that Stout kept this miracle alive for so long."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"For over 20 years, I have been collecting Nero Wolfe mysteries, and this was the one I couldn't find.

I read and reread my Nero Wolfe mysteries all the time.

But my favorite has to be Prichard's tongue-in-cheek, smooth-talking, sophisticated tough man, Archie Goodwin, the narrator of each tale. Prichard's reading of \\"Champagne for One\\" amply shows off his acting talents, as much as the intriguing plot and many characters demonstrate Stout's writing abilities."},{"Title":"CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE (NERO WOLFE)","review":"another in a series of simple, well devised Nero Wolfe mysteries. if you like the series this is a \\"gotta have\\"."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science (The Edinburgh lecture series)","review":"Trying to explain magic in rational terms has rather fallen out of fashion, and sometimes you have to turn to the classics.Half philosophy, half science, Troward's little volume builds a rational and plausible basis for controlling events in what most people would deem &quot;supernatural&quot; ways. His premise, condensed down to three words, is &quot;faith changes reality&quot; -- it's what comes up in exploring that hypothesis that makes the book interesting. The book is as well-organized and well-presented as you would expect any college textbook to be, although the flowery 100-year-old language might be a turn-off to some.While &quot;Edinburgh&quot; is of use to people trying to understand (or accept) magic, its greatest value is by far for those who are already exploring the subject. I wish that this book came in clue bat form, so I could hit a number of would-be &quot;mages&quot; over the head with it, and have them absorb it instantly. While one may not necessarily agree with everything Troward says (I found the insistence on a Christian perspective rather extreneous, for example), his ability to build a rich and cohesive system is an inspiration -- and a solid foundation. Ultimately, those who wish to change the world must understand it, and this book can be a great first step on that path. It's one of the must-read books on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science (The Edinburgh lecture series)","review":"I have been a student of quantum theory as it applies to our ability to create form from thougtht. &quot;The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science&quot; by Thomas Troward were published in 1909. They contain all of the same principles being set forth by today's gurus of quantam theory such as Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer. Very interesting book. Also recommend, &quot;Your Invisible Power&quot; by Genevieve Behrend. Ms. Behrend was the only student of Thomas Troward. Her book is a more basic way to apply the same principles."},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science (The Edinburgh lecture series)","review":"A classic by one of the pioneers of New Thought; these lectures deal with the questions of spirit and matter, the nature of intelligence, the unity of spirit, and the relationship between the conscious and subconscious mind. Troward had a knack for conveying profound philosophical matters in a most understandable way and for formulating ancient truths so that a child could understand. He explains the difference between form (matter) and being - that the one is the mode of the relative and the mark of subjection to conditions, while the other is the truth of the absolute and that which controls conditions. Because spirit is infinite, it is everywhere and must be present at every point in space at the same moment. This is a fundamental fact of all being. The relation between spirit and being as idea (from which the elements of time and space are absent) and form (the relative which is dependent on those elements) leads to the fact that pure spirit continually subsists in the absolute and from it all the phenomena of being flow. In proportion to our level of recognition of this fact, our power for producing visible outward results by the action of our thought will grow. The book concludes with the practical application of this knowledge in our lives and affairs. I highly recommend the Edinburgh lectures as well as the Dore Lectures and Troward's masterpiece &quot;The Creative Process in the Individual.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Edinburgh lectures on mental science (The Edinburgh lecture series)","review":"I first came across Thomas Troward through working with Bob Proctor on a coaching program.

But is this poet well understood, and are her birthdays and other important dates even recognized other than by those already devoted to her? One editorial reviewer for Amazon of the Cambridge Companion makes a key mistake-stating that she is one of our most important \\"19th Century poets.\\" No--Dickinson is one of the two most important American poets in all our literature-of whatever century, and most likely including this new one- the other candidate for top honors being Walt Whitman. Arguably, Dickinson is the more important of the two given the resonance in our later poetry with the depth of her interior, private vision. Whitman aspired to be America's great public bard-a project Robert Pinsky and others have pointed out that did not succeed (see my Amazon review of Pinsky's Democracy, Culture and the Voice of Poetry). But Dickinson's intense private vision is more responsible than Whitman's public one for generating followers and inspiring others. Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane are two examples. With rare exceptions, American poetry has developed more along the lines suggested by her more private vision and voice than it has to the broad, public sweep of Whitman's long-windedness.Everyone more or less knows who Dickinson is, and most educated persons have probably read at least one of her poems. But, do we grasp what a deep treasure trove Dickinson has left us? Do we get beyond the superficial portrait most have of her? And most importantly, how do we access the wealth of creativity and insight that lies beyond the few dozen or so most popular Dickinson poems most of us are familiar with?Wendy Martin's Cambridge Companion to Emily Dickinson is a great place to start broadening our view of her. The war over Dickinson's manuscripts (today part still belong to Harvard and part to Amherst College) and for defining her as a person is something that happened shortly after she died and was caused by a schism of sorts in her family when her brother, Austin Dickinson, took a lover, Mabel Loomis Todd, outside of his marriage to Emily's beloved friend, companion and lifelong correspondent, Susan Dickinson. This is a really racy story! It is ably narrated in Betsy Erkkila's essay \\"The Emily Dickinson Wars.\\"Christopher Benfey's essay \\"Emily Dickinson and the American South,\\" is also remarkable. How do you explain the fact that Dickinson wrote throughout the Civil War, Emancipation, etc. and has almost nothing to say about these huge events? While not a Southern sympathizer, there is much in her work that accords with the agrarian, aristocratic elements in American life that was also represented in the South and its literature, and she fit the sensibility of those who yearned for a pre-Industrial America in the 20th Century quite well-although it doesn't really fully define her to see it in this way.Wendy Martin's own essay on Dickinson's poetic strategies is a strong overview of how some of the larger elements in Dickinson's life worked themselves out in her verse, including her deeply meaningful relationship with her sister-in-law. Martin is very strong on her analysis of the poetic use of words like \\"sun\\" which appears so often in the poems, and she sees Dickinson as one who revels with her volcanic creativity in night and darkness. It's a luxurious image and picture of her.I have to confess that, though our last names are the same, I am no relation to Emily Dickinson. Starting when I was a very young child, my mother (who grew up not far from Amherst in a similar setting) read her to me frequently, and I was somewhat confused about the name. For quite some time I thought when my mother said we were \\"not related\\" that we really were related. I felt the poems were something that had been written to us, like letters from a relative, which were also sometimes read aloud to the family. I was disappointed to learn that \\"no relation\\" actually meant we weren't related-and somehow before figuring it out got some of the deeper messages even as a very young child -it was as though they had been meant especially for me and sent from a kindred soul.One suggestion for how to celebrate Emily Dickinson's birthday each December 10th is to read this book and others like it-and to re-encounter Dickinson's poems over and over. They richly repay our efforts to understand and enjoy them."},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Integrative Approach","review":"This text by Fred Toates is a spectacularly well done summary of the field of biological psychology. Not only would it be a first-rate text for courses, but an excellent self-education tool in one of the most exciting areas of science. The writing is crisp and interesting, permitting relatively easy reading of difficult materials. There are abundant examples to engage any student, and the illustrations are stunning. Toates does not avoid important philosophical issues as do many books of this type. He puts the all too abundant facts in a context which makes assimilation of material a delight. This is on the top of my list of texts to use in the relevant courses. It is also among the foremost I would recommend for those who want to study how brain and bodily functions help make us who we are."},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Integrative Approach","review":"I took a Biopsychology course with this textbook and I was entirely ungrateful that my professor chose it. This textbook is like a conglomeration of hundreds of research publications, instead of an introductory textbook. It would explain one topic after another without giving the reader a larger view of what all of this means in context to answering big biology and psychology questions. The paragraphs and sections were needlessly long and wordy. Instead of presenting easily accessible information, the author surrounded every fact with long-winded explanations."},{"Title":"Biological Psychology: An Integrative Approach","review":"As an introductory textbook for Biological Psychology, this book could certainly take a step back.

This would be a great book for a busy mom."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"I've taught college level logic courses, and I return, from time to time, to classics. No one who is serious about contemporary logic can afford to not read Quine. His explanations are clear, although the symbols used are a bit unorthodox. I recommend this to anyone who is already familiar with elementary symbolic logic. Additionally, an awareness of modal or quantificational logic would be helpful."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"Like any great book, this one could be a bit, though not too much, better. By far and away the most useful element of Quine's book is his treatment of translating ordinary English into logical schemata. I have never seen such a lucid and effective presentation of the task, and I recommend the book very highly to anybody on that account. His presentation of truth-functional and quantificational schemata are solid are simply excellent. The book, however, is not without its defects of which I should caution prospective buyers about. First, there are many treatments in the book of historical interest, but to a student of first-order logic they may seem to be a bit excessive. His incorporation of Polish notation, while fascinating in its own right, is not in accorance with Quine's drive for efficiency and conciseness. A similar account goes for his treatment of Boolean algebra. It is in that treatment that Quine introduces many ideas indispensible to quantificational logic, yet it is tempting to skip over those chapters when one can sufficiently delve into quantification theory. Secondly, his notation is, as another reviewer points out, unorthodox. It is very effective and in my opinion superior to the conventional formality, but this could be difficult to deal with, and one wonders if Quine should have been more cautious about varying his symbols from the norm. Finally, Quine's treatment of the Completeness Proof and the Lowenheim Theorem, while quite solid in their own right, could be more effective. Quine seems to be keen on applying a constructivist approach to the proof, and spends many pages on definitions and lemmas that can be avoided. One can provide a proof by contradiction in order to sufficiently demonstrate most of his treatment of the matter, as so much of it is spent proving the &quot;law of infinite conjunction,&quot; which is really only an 8 step proof. I won't go into the details here, but keep that in mind when studying the chapter. Nevertheless, Quine's work is as entertaining as it is rigorous."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"Quine is well-known in this century for being one of the premier analytic philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition. He probably used this book for his upper-division course in logic for philosophy majors. After reading this book, I can see his reputation is well-justified.This book is more than just a textbook in logic. In his own way, Quine shows in his examples just how difficult it is to break down ordinary language into symbolic logic, and in the process (hopefully), one should learn both rigorous thinking and charity. These are rare commodities today.Quine has the rather idiosyncratic position that modal logic only confuses matters. However, I would rather read a complete introduction to modal logic, than to receive only a chapter's worth of treatment. Hence, I can deal with his excluding modal logic from this book.I do wish there was a short chapter or glossary on informal logic, since many other treatments do continue to use those terms (e.g. Copi). Knowing the terminology does help one to communicate in prose one's analysis of an argument. It does help to know all those latin distinctions (e.g. ad hominem, ad nominem, ad populii, petitio principii, etc.).That being said, I'm a much clearer thinker for having worked through this book, and I would heartily recommend this for anybody."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"This book is a nice overview of the foundations of modern logic with some additional non-traditional topics, such as modal logic included. Quine is necessary reading for all those interested in mathematical logic, philosophical logic, and theoretical foundations of computer science. By far the best chapter of the book is Chapter 33 which deals with the Skolem-Lowenheim theorem. Even though it is very short, Quine does a good job of explaining what this result is all about, and does so with upmost clarity. Another nice feature of the book is the inclusion of historical notes at the end of each chapter. This gives the reader a general view of just where the results came from, and encourages further reading on the subject. Anyone interested in functional and logical programming will gain a lot in the reading of this book, as it introduces the proper tools and methodologies used in these important programming paradigms."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"It's Quine, so it seems almost polemical though it's an introductory logic text, which is a bit strange. E.g., he is always promoting his own terminology against what's standard: 'alternation' vs. 'disjunction', 'non-exclusive' vs. 'inclusive', 'singulary' vs. 'unary', and so on. The introduction of non-standard terminology is not as bad as some, however.In any case, it very much reads like a book on the philosophy of logic rather a current introductory logic text (especially of the mathematical sort). For instance, he goes into the use/mention distinct at length, quotation and quasi-quotation, justification of canonical translations of English sentences into the symbolism of a formal theory, etc. I suppose this is so because the book contains basically *no* metatheory (except the Skolem-Lowenheim theory in the appendix). The purpose of the book is to teach the ability to conduct reasoning *in* some formal theory (rather than about it), and to do so practically, putting aside some of the \\"eloquence\\" (as he puts it) found in other texts.It's old, the philosophy is interesting, but I would not recommend it as an introductory text. Or if you were to use it as an introductory text, then one for something more like a cross between critical thinking and formal logic."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"This is the best place to start if you want to learn first-order logic: truth functions and quantification theory. Here is why.Quine is an acknowledge master of symbolic logic.Quine is the clearest and most coherent writer on logic.Quine's logic is the most careful and conservative.By the last I mean the following. Propositional logic, quantification theory, set theory, and mathematics are all different animals. Drawing the line between first-order logic (quantification theory) and set theory allows one to treat the former without the antinomies and other issues plaguing set theory. First order logic has been proven complete, while set theory is not complete. And first-order logic alone is a fascinating and useful tool. One can then tack on set theory as another layer if desired. Yet all other authors I've read fail to make this distinction. I've even read one popular book on \\"first-order logic\\" that begins with defining \\"true\\" and \\"false\\" as members of a set. Why?This book includes nothing about modal logic, deontic logic, etc. This is a good thing. Begin at the beginning, the foundation. Then if you want to go off onto one of these tangents you'll have a solid base upon which to evaluate these other logics.Besides all this you'll learn some useful techniques developed by Quine himself such as his Main Method for proving the validity of valid quantificational schema. He'll also teach you alternative methods developed by others.If you don't understand any of the terms above, don't worry. You will by the time you're done with this book. It is easy to follow for the moderately motivated beginner and rich enough to be of great value to anyone else. And it is a terrific reference.If you really need something super-basic to get started tryElementary Logic: Revised Edition."},{"Title":"Methods of logic","review":"I don't think you get this in a lot of other books. Just look at the Historical Notes; In themselves a guided direction to the most important work on logics. This is truly time saving instead of go wondering what books to read, up to the date of Quine's book of course.In the end it also contains bibliography, but also a note to a whole other index covering literature up to 1935, this is truly at great value.I find this book helpful in analysis concerning ideas; Whatever they are, since language usage is the tool for thought, even if not written down.It's simply a MIND-SPEAKER.Also more newer books, in for instance computer science, in my personal opinion, skip important questions already asked by scientists which then have been elaborated on.People who read logic for the first time, like me, ask fundamental questions in order to understand, following Quine's reasoning is surely educational."},{"Title":"Wintry Night","review":"Translated from a Taiwanese trilogy, this book has two parts: Part One is the first book of the trilogy, Part Two is the third; the second book of the trilogy was omitted. Unfortunately, an unabridged translated version isn't available.A few pages into the book, I had to draw a family tree. Part One of the book focuses on the extended Peng family, and without writing it all down, the names and relationships would have been a big jumble to me. Part Two shifts the focus onto the extended family of one branch of the Peng family, and I had to draw a whole new family tree to keep up with the story.Before reading this book, I knew very little about the details of how Taiwan was settled by people from China, or of the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. Through the members of one extended family, Part One describes the hardships of those who first opened up aboriginal mountain lands for farming (a period of time that reminded me of the harsh life of American pioneers who moved West into Native American Indian territory). Part Two tells of the difficulties faced by Taiwanese men conscripted into the Japanese army towards the end of World War II. Frequent references were made to the anti-Japanese resistance movement (which reminded me of the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation of France). I would have liked to have read more about the anti-Japanese resistance, but alas, it was the omitted second book of the trilogy that focused on that part of history.Despite finding similarities to other more familiar histories, the stories in Wintry Night are entirely Taiwanese. While the book at times read like a non-fiction account of one family's history, the author interspersed the story with poetic descriptions of the Taiwanese mountains and the spirit of Taiwanese people. One understands how much the environs were an integral part of the lives and livelihood of the early settlers, and how much being Taiwanese (and more specifically, Hakka Chinese) was at the heart of their identities.While Part One told of hardships and struggles, it's clear that hope existed, and perhaps the Peng family would one day prosper. In this part of the book, people seemed to act rashly, and I didn't always understand a person's motivations. I wasn't sure if I was missing something, if the author wasn't developing the characters enough, or if some important detail was lost in the translation.Part Two, meanwhile, was somber and depressing, with graphic descriptions of the casualties of war. Even the rare faint glimmer of hope felt more like a yearning, blind faith rather than a practical possibility. The endings of both parts were poignant and artistically beautiful, but left me feeling empty. As the reader, I knew the family would survive - as they did after every setback - but I still wanted to read more, to find out how they would do it."},{"Title":"The patriot","review":"Mafia potboiler with plots, plots within plots, double crosses, & lots of violence.

Going back and forth in time made for more interesting reading and there was an element of mystery about the characters from the past that made the reader want to keep going to see what really happened and to whom.The protagonist in the present was an adventuresome boy and I could imagine more stories of his exploits from the author.

The writer sets out with a point of view and then demonstrates it while barely acknowledging that there is an opposing case to be heard. Virtually without redeeming value."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"Journalists find it easy to build fascinating stories around misunderstood science. This leads to serious consequences, but who cares? Catastrophe scenarios sell well and the misinformation disseminated to an unsuspecting public is not something the author will be accountable for. When writers without scientific training or comprehension take on complex issues such as global warming, the result tends to be a calamity as exemplified by this volume. It should be listed under 'fiction'.There are several excellent new books available on the topic, such as 'Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate' and 'Geological Perspectives on Global Climate Change', both of which provide a scientifically correct view - even if it may not be politically correct. Science, thankfully, provides the truth of the matter irrespective of what is politically acceptable.It differentiates between objective reason and pure advocacy based on little knowledge an no scientific insight."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"This book buys into all the hype and bad science surrounding global warming, and offers no proof whatsoever than the fossil fuel industry has anything to do with what is happening with the climate. It isn't the fossil fuel industry that's confusing the issue, but the kind of bad science, poor research, and ad hominen attacks that make up ninety percent of this book.While is does seem the climate is warming, it also is nearly certain that mankind is playing little or no part in the process. Global warming has happened many times before, and does, in fact, seem to be the norm. Dig beneath the arctic ice and you find tropical plants. In other words, the cooler climate we've experienced the last couple of thousand years is abnormal.The forecasts of what global warming will cause are also nonsense. Geograpical areas will not brown and die due to high carbon dioxide content. Drought might do this, but not high carbon dioxide. History disproves this completely. Rather, plant type will change, turning more tropical, and the geographical areas will actually grow more lush and green.Quite literally, we could stop burning all fossil fuels tomorrow, and the affect on global warming would be nil. A few thousand years ago, forests covered entire continents, and at that time a single forest fire could put more carbon dioxide in the air in a month than we do in a year.This book is for the paranoid who wants not facts, but hysteria. Instead of foolish attempts to stop a natural process, money and research should be going into how best to adapt to global warming.

The Vikings headed for the Arctic, even settling there, and rediscovered the Americas.The atmosphere isn't warming the Earth -- the Earth is orders of magnitude more massive than the atmosphere.The oceans are not warming at depth.The planet Mars has about as much atmospheric density as the Earth does at 40 MILES altitude and has never been warmed by greenhouse gases.The atmosphere of Venus isn't made primarily of CO2. Venus' density is slightly less than that of Earth's, same goes for its diameter. CO2 won't be found at the hideously high pressures known to exist on the Venusian surface.Surprise!

It is very true to what I experienced for the eleven years I was at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder.It was also required reading for a pilot climate change course I took at the University of Denver.

In the first place, Gelbspan goes through a whole list of observable features which should get people's attention. This part of the book is well-researched and written. It took me about half the book to realize that Gelbspan isn't actually a scientist. Probably the most controversial, yet useful part of the book is when he describes the attempts to mislead and discredit. Gelbspan goes through much of the history of this and, to his credit, gives long quotes from the naysayers at the end of the book. This should be compared to some of the books written by skeptics who give all sorts of short quotes out of context.

Our world is going to dramatically change, no matter what we do. We can affect the degree of change, if we choose to act. Gelbspan discusses why the issue of climate change (global warming) has gotten the media spin that it has and what the consequences of that has been on awareness of the issue. Thanks to people like him, we &quot;regular folks&quot; can have input into how to handle the crisis, because we know that we must act now. Otherwise the people in the &quot;smoke filled back rooms&quot; of politics will decide to tell us what &quot;we have to do&quot; in a climate-derived emergency.

Thanks, Ross!"},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"My complaint about this book, purchased in August 2012, is that it's so out-of-date. The cover says it is an \`updated edition' but that turned out to be circa 1998. Here is the best case I can think of for eBooks. A printed book should be up-to-date or timeless. Anything else should be published in eBook format and truly be updated if left on the market.As the subtitle indicates this is an important book. The author gives a dizzying account of the war against the science underpinning the climate crisis and the political and economic forces involved. A dozen years after the book was written it seems way too detailed and redundant. The main points are made over and over.An unintended consequence of reading a book written in the late 1990s is to realize how many historic changes we've lived through. The theme of the book is still life and death important, but a lot has happened in the world!Enron has collapsed, George W. Bush has served two terms, 911 occurred leading to two wars, Hurricane Katrina seriously impacted New Orleans, a housing crisis destroyed the American economy and a financial crisis threatens the world economy. As all those significant things happened, the climate crisis continued. Many of the dire consequences predicted in the book have come true, only ahead of schedule.If you'd like a more up-to-date version the same author has a 2004 book called \`Boiling Point' which might be better."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"The Heat Is On is a wonderful primer for debating the hype and myriad obfuscation about global climate change presented by highly paid industrial lobbyists and public affairs departments.

One wonders how anyone cantake that seriously, but then conspiracy is a theme for Gelbspan. In his only previous book, &quot;Break-Ins, Death Threats, and the FBI,&quot; he claimed a government-run conspiracy against left-wing political activists in Latin America and opined that the FBI and CIA were seeking new enemies, most likely in the environmental movement. Ahem.Gelbspan claims to be a &quot;Pultizer Prize-winning journalist,&quot; but Seymour Topping, administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes at Columbia University, nixed that claim in 1997. To be sure, Gelbspan was one of 2 editors on a Pulitzer winning series written by 7 Boston Globe reporters in 1984. But, since Gelbspan did not WRITE the articles, he cannot claim the honor.I would add that in 1997, two of the professors named in Gelbspan's conspiracy filed a formal complaint with the Minnesota Press Council after the Minneapolis Star-Tribune published an editorial based on Gelbspan's book. The Council ruled in favor of the two professors and the Star-Tribune was forced to print a full retraction. Gelbspan's book is the usual fodder for conspiracy theorists, no more than that."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"&quot;The Heat is On&quot; is a well-researched, detailed description of how the coal and oil industries are trying (and succeeding) to confuse the issue of global warming today. In this frightening expos&eacute;, Ross Gelbspan shows how the fossil fuel industries are spending millions of dollars to confuse the public through misleading advertising and PR tactics in order to protect their financial interests. The story behind this campaign of lies is astounding.Try a little experiment: talk to several people about global warming. Just bring it up in the conversation, and watch their reaction. I did, and I found that most people laughed, or said, &quot;Yeah, but I heard there's no conclusive evidence to support that.&quot; This is the direct effect of the fossil fuel industry's PR campaign. Gelbspan describes how they have done this largely through industry-created groups with misleading names (such as the &quot;Information Council on the Environment&quot;), and pseudo-scientists paid by the industry.Gelbspan explains that the industry's groups and scientists have received a great deal of media coverage because journalists, as part of their duty, are compelled to cover both sides of the story. The problem is that the &quot;other side of the story&quot; in this case is a small group who is paid by the industry. The confusion and lies promoted by the fossil fuel industry has been enough to drown out the 2,500 climate scientists around the world who all agree that global warming is a fact.&quot;The Heat is On&quot; offers irrefutable facts to debunk the myth that global warming evidence is inconclusive. For example, many people claim that recent extreme colde and winter weather refutes the theory. Wrong, says Gelbspan: &quot;severe winter weather perfectly consistent with global warming. One effect of climate change is to produce more extreme local temperatures--leading to hotter hots, unseasonal colds, and more severe snowstorms.&quot; And temperature changes are just the beginning of the problem. Other effects include outbreaks of disease, proliferation of pests, and extinction of species, among others.The only solution is to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions, probably as much as 60%. This is no easy task, but Gelbspan does offer a plausible &quot;prescription&quot;. He suggests that we (1) divert all fossil fuels subsidies ($20 billion/year!) to renewable energy development, (2) implement efficiency standards to require generating facilities to be highly efficient (instead of the current 35% efficiency average), and (3) support developing nations in the conversion with an international currency transaction tax.This is a very powerful book. Hopefully it will help to re-educate the public, and serve as a model for global change. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"Gelbspan is a reporter for the Boston Globe who does a great job of describing the science, economics and politics behind gobal climate change. He does an excellent job of defining the problem (in layman's terms) and discussing the disinformation campaign sponsored by the oil industry.If you're looking for the nitty-gritty science behind global warming, you will find only a sampling in the appendix. Gelbspan starts with the assumption that the thousands of world class climatologists who make up the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are correct in their consensus that climate change is real and happening now. From that assumption, he unleashes a barrage of disturbing anecdotal evidence describing the many effects of climate change. He also unmasks the efforts of a few scientists backed by the oil industry to sabotage the findings of IPCC. The book presents a thorough and disturbing expose of this effective PR campaign to neutralize the warnings of the scientific community."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"Ten years ago, I began to research and learn as much as I could about global warming. In that attempt I have watched alarming predictions be issued along with a growing, but minority voice indicating the opposite. I began to research these groups and their information. I learned a valuable lesson; good science and logic can no longer (nor probably ever was) used for sound policy decisions without the ugly head of bias and disinformation rising.This book serves to illustrate what I have experienced in the frustrating attempt to separate politics from science. I purchased &quot;The Heated Debate&quot; after learning from e-mail correspondance with global greenhouse skeptics that their mission is not to establish the scientific truth, but rather to protect vested interests. Needless to say, the words of this book were enlightening, confirming, and had excellent attention to detail that makes this book stand out as a firm summary to the &quot;debate&quot; of anthropogenic (man induced) climate change.It doesn't take long to learn what this book so amply demostrates; that propagandist statements from global greenhouse skeptics often are a pronosticator of poor science and obvious bias, and the dangers of the politicalization of the search for truth. As this book correctly states , scientific inquiry from industry isn't automatically nullified but it too needs to be peer-reviewed and subjected to the same processes as all other scientific research. This book makes it clear that evidence contrary to the scientific consensus has not met passed this test. After reading this book and comparing it to my own research, I find that the general conclusions outlined in the book are that the politicalization of science is at the very heart of this particular &quot;debate,&quot; not the science itself. Science becomes the victim in the politics of global climate change. Furthermore, the details of the &quot;debate&quot; in the US congress have so clearly and tragically indicated that some of those in power to make policy decisions are often too ignorant, scientifically illiterate, and have questionable ethical standards to be in such a powerful position. This book might be a wake-up call to not only the vast evidence in favor of an anthropogenic climate change but also to the need of a more scientifically literate public and its servants.I have to say that the scattered passages indicating extreme weather during the various timelines in the book are not useful. Indeed it is far too easy to use these passages as some kind of weak evidence that this book uses scare tactics as so many greenhouse skeptics accuse environmental publications and agencies of using. However, the actual transcipts of congressional hearings used in this book are more than enough to scare me let alone the poor science used by the skeptics in winning congressional approval for their biased lobbying efforts."},{"Title":"The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-up, The Prescription","review":"I found the book to be right on par with my own research into the effects of &quot;global warming&quot;.

Butterflies are migrating northward. Antarctica is melting. Northern hemisphere forests are being decimated by climate-related fires and insect infestations. The Great Plains states are becoming deserts, as are areas of Southern Europe. Tropical diseases such as malaria and West Nile fever are spreading northwards as temperatures rise.These are all facts that are incontestably documented by science today, and each of them is directly linked to the climate change brought about by global warming. The earth and its species are in for a tough time in the century ahead. Extreme weather patterns caused by the heating up of the planet is already creating climatic chaos: horrible downpours and snow in some areas, rising temperatures and drought in others, hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, and so on. And for the most part it's been caused by the incredibly high rate of fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions--6 billion tons (and counting) a year.Ross Gelspan argues that the science is clear; most of the world's leading scientists agree that fossil fuels are causing the problem. The rub is that the oil and coal industries--at $10 trillion, the largest in human history--have an obvious vested interest in convincing the public and lawmakers that global warming is all Chicken Little stuff. So they fund a handful of dissenting scientists who, like tobacco industry scientists a few years ago, are in the business of convincing the public that global warming is a myth. Conservative lawmakers have been particularly receptive to their line, and this in turn has affected public policy for the worse.Gelbspan's book is horrifying in its diagnosis of global warming and the extent to which the fossil fuel industry has protected its own interests at the expense of the planet's. But the book also makes clear that the technology to replace the world's use of fossil fuels already exists, and concludes with a plan of action for weaning ourselves from our oil addictions.Make no mistake about it, however: things will get worse, and perhaps much worse, before they get better. We're only beginning to feel the effects of carbon dioxide emissions from 50 years ago. We've yet to feel the whammy from our current frenzied use.

The author warns that totalitarian governments are very likely to emerge in the upheaval of massive starvation and dislocation brought by rising seas and increasingly chaotic weather. Gelbspan, a science writer and editor for The Boston Globe and The Washington Post, explains how a handful of scientists employed by oil and coal companies have managed to confuse the U.S. public about the greenhouse effect and the realistic choices we face. In this curiously hopeful book (considering its ominous theme), the author notes that the fossil fuel companies are now facing an increasingly powerful opposition led by island nations, Germany and international insurers (who may be bankrupted by escalating weather-related claims). He also notes that science has already invented our way out of the heat trap, and that all we need to do is shift gears (quickly, to be sure) and install sustainable technologies.

It tells in rich detail the life of the people in the village, and their interactions with the Church and Government.Set in a fictional world, it dissects our foibles with precision, but it doesn't hurt, because it's, after all, a fictional world, not us.I can't really call it fantasy, because it doesn't have dragons, or wizards, or little elves running around, although the myths about such are mentioned.

The mice-elves have ruined me.&quot; I just about busted a gut laughing at &quot;mice-elf.&quot;This doesn't really fit into any genre, although Jonathan Swift and Kurt Vonnegut come to mind for some reason.I suppose I should say that the first chapter is really long, and starts a little slow, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.This is a great read, and I can't wait for more books from Tim Hammack."},{"Title":"The Hierophant","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely.

But then, I expected nothing less, by the time I actually read it. I discovered Doranna Durgin many years ago, but even then, Dun Lady's Jess was already out of print. I finally tracked it down at an online used book store. It was VERY hard to find... apparently, not many people who read it were willing to give it up. That should tell you something. I, myself, couldn't wait for the American edition of the re-issue... I bought the Canadian edition. HUGE thanks to Red Deer Press for reintroducing it!I have read and enjoyed other fantasies that involved shape-shifting--and I'm looking forward to Durgin's new one in the Silhouette 'Nocturne' line next year. But Dun Lady's Jess is a 'change' fantasy on an entirely different level. As a person, Jess has the instincts and sensibilities of a horse, but has to learn to use her new and expanded human brain power. As a horse, Jess is not a person in a horse's body, she's a horse, confused by the new scope of thought available to her horse's brain. This makes the whole story fascinating on a personal development and characterization level, as well as the actual intriguing plot-line of travel and adventure taking place across two very different dimensions. All the characters benefit from Durgin's talent at characterization, of course--like all her books--but Jess has, and always will have, a special place in my heart. The action ain't bad, either. Durgin excels at pacing a story to keep you turning pages far into the night.Also recommended:ChangespellandChangespell Legacy (Baen Fantasy)continue the story. But I can confidently recommend any book Durgin's written. I've never read one from her I didn't like (and I have them all), no matter what the genre."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"Apart from the Harry Potter books, I've read few fantasy novels. My one exception: the books of my friend Doranna Durgin. Of course, as she's been my friend for over 20 years, you can't expect me to be wholly objective in a review. So I'll just tell you what I like about her very first published book, Dun Lady's Jess, which has been reissued in a beautiful new edition by Canadian publisher Red Deer Press.Beautiful dun mare Lady, and her rider, Cary, are running for their lives when Cary invokes a spell that sends them hurtling to an alternate reality--a reality that does not include magic. Not only that, but Lady has been transformed into a human woman.She's found by Eric, a kind-hearted environmentalist, and his friend Dayna. They quickly realize that Lady is in a state of mental confusion. Wary about turning her into the authorities, they take her to Dayna's home to try to figure out what to do next.They meet up with their friends Jaime, who owns a horse training facility, and her brother Mark. And when Carey shows up--that's when the fun begins.This book has everything I look for in great storytelling: endearing friendships, action, adventure; suspense, thrills and fun. I'm not kidding when I say it'll make you laugh and cry.There's a reason this book won the Compton Crook Award, and it's hard to believe this could be someone's first book because Doranna got everything right. The characterization, the action, and most importantly, the mindset of Dun Lady's Jess--a horse changed by magic into a woman.Read it. You'll love it, too."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"I read this book awhile ago, and loved it. Being an animal lover, I appreciated the care with which the author described the horses, and how much personality they had; they were an actual part of the story, rather than just beasts of burden (this is true to one extent or another of all her writing). I also appreciated the fact that while she included a romance, sex wasn't particularly present. I get tired of some fantasy authors who seem to think that if they throw enough sex in, it compensates for lacks such as plot, character development, or action; also authors that just plain write it in all the time. Finally, she had a somewhat original and creative idea; others have written about animals becoming people or vice versa, but none that I've ever read had as much realism in that description, or as much consideration of what that would actually mean for the individual involved (especially if it is an animal becoming human). All in all, I loved this book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"I don't think I have ever read a story like this one before--a rare thing in these days of multi volume fantasy series. Dun Lady's Jess is a simple story about a courier's horse. Jess and her rider are on a mission when they are attacked and accidentally transported to our world. Due to the nature of the spell used against them, Jess is turned into a woman while her rider is seperated from her and disorientated.Jess is found naked and alone by a couple out for the day. They rescue her, take her home, and finally realise they hve something very strange on their hands. Jess meanwhile is having trouble understanding that standing on her hind legs is now allowed (rearing is bad) and that she can talk just like her rider.All in all, a simple but intensely interesting read. Well worth your moneyu and time."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"I don't normally seek out books about horses, but this novel was really exceptional. I love fantasy, and the truly mystical occurences in this books just served to draw me in more completely. Doranna Durgin also introduced a few fantasy concepts concerning magic that I have never read before, and I was really impressed. If you love fantasy, horses, and really good books, by all means read this!"},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"Dun Lady's Jess (1994) is the first novel by Durgin and is unusually well written for a first work. It is also the first in a series about a horse who becomes a human. Her owner is Arlen of Anfeald, a senior wizard of Camolen, but her master is Carey, head rider of the Anfeald couriers.Arlen has discovered a spell for crossing over to other dimensions and needs help developing a checkspell to prevent unscrupulous exploitation of other continua. He sends Carey to Sherra, a member of the Wizards Council, with a full report on the new spell. Warning Carey that other wizards know of the new spell, Arlen provides a stone carrying the spell and orders Carey to use it if danger appears.Carey and Lady are ambushed and Carey is shot with an arrow, pulling Lady hard to the right. As they plunge over a cliff, Carey invokes the spellstone and they go elsewhere.Lady, transformed to a human, lands in a meadow in Ohio with her tack lying atop and around her. She is found by Eric and Dayna, who take her home with them. Since Jess is new to the human business, she is a strange, possibly crazy, woman. At first she seems to be mute -- after all, horses don't talk -- but soon learns how to make the funny sounds that she has heard all her life. She calls Dayna and Eric by name, and tells them her own, and then goes on a orgy of word learning. When Eric brings in the tack, Jess says the saddlebags belong to Carey. When she identifies herself as a horse, also belonging to Carey whom she has lost and wants to find, they take her to Jaime at the Dancing Equine Dressage Center, where Jess meets Mark, Jaime's brother.While Eric tries to find Carey by calling nearby hospitals, Jaime questions Jess and then puts her to work in the stables. A stranger shows up looking for a dun mare with black points and identifies himself as Derrick, living at the LK hotel. Jaime notices that the description would match Jess if she was a horse. Moreover, Jess displays an unusual ability in reading horse body language. Jaime is beginning to suspect the unthinkable.Jaime tells the others about Derrick at the LK hotel, where Dayna and Mark work. Using her passkey, Dayna finds Carey, drugged and helpless, in Derrick's room as well as a bow and quiver of arrows. She is almost caught by Derrick, but escapes and returns to The Dancing to tell of her discovery. They return to the hotel while Mark is on duty and rescue Carey. Then things start to get interesting.Eventually, Jess, Dayna, Eric, Jaime and Carey cross over to Camolen. They are accidentally accompanied by Ernie, a gunman hired by Derrick, and land in the middle of a siege.While the novel is fantasy, there are a few points that strain even that loose standard. The spell itself provides the ability to speak English, yet the rapidity with which Jess learns to speak and read is truly fantastic. However, Durgin provides an explanation at the very beginning: the intercontinual transients are connected to their home dimension by a thread of magic that powers any spells invoked in the other continuum. Apparently that also powers magical talents -- such as language learning -- possessed by the travelers.This is truly a horse lover's fantasy. While very ignorant of horse affairs, I feel that the horsey thinking underlying Jess's personality rings true with my experiences. Durgin really knows her horses.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"I ABSOLUTY loved the story, very engaging and powerful. I however didn't like how she wrote in a few spots, and I felt the begining was weak, but the powerful story line mostly made up for that."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"Frankly, I was surprised to only find two other reviews for this book. I first read it several years ago and have made Doranna Durgin one of the regular authors I check when entering a book store. This book is not simply for horse-lovers, although that does make it even more appealing. The characters are intriguing--from Jess and her struggles with humanity to Carey and his love of her. Sometimes you want to shake them, sometimes you want to hug them. I was sped along as I read it and couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequel. From a first-time fantasy author, Dun Lady's Jess is a solid, enjoyable book suited to readers from all walks of life."},{"Title":"Dun Lady's Jess","review":"This was Doranna Durgin's first published novel, and one of her best. She has subsequently published about ten novels, two of which are direct sequels to this one. The three books stand on their own, but can also be read as a trilogy, which isDun Lady's JessThe ChangespellChangespell Legacy.A park ranger and his partner find a confused young woman in the woods, naked except for a horse's saddle and harness, and unable to speak. At first they think she is hurt or deranged. This opinion is reinforced when, as they try to communicate with her, she picks up a few words of English and tells them that she is a horse. Little do they know that she has been sent to our world, and transformed into a woman, by a spell gone wrong, and from a magic world where she really is a horse called Dun Lady's Jess. Her struggle to make sense of her new environment is a fascinating story.Doranna Durgin knows more than a little about horses, and it shows.

Can You Find It?","review":"The last time I browsed a bookstore, I saw over twenty linear feet of shelves stocked with sudoku books. Other than the level of difficulty, there's really very little difference to distinguish one from another. But \\"The Sudoku Code\\" stands out from the rest. Not only does it cash in on the popularity of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" with illustrations from Leonardo's notebooks, but also it is actually a puzzle within a puzzle. First, you have to solve the 100 pairs of sudoku puzzles (one with numbers and one with letters), and from each pair you will extract a series of letters. Put all the letters together and they form a set of clues that will lead you back through the puzzle grids looking for the final answer.The puzzles range from easy to cruel. Be forewarned that there are no answers provided for the puzzles. So unless you are an expert sudoku solver (or unless you become one as you work your way through 200 puzzles), you won't have much chance of finding the final solution. Except for the one error in the word list mentioned in the publisher's editorial notice above, the puzzles are of excellent quality. They don't have that \\"computer-generated\\" feel to them, and in the wordoku puzzles, the preassigned letters spell out clever words or phrases.I did manage to crack the code, but will not be sending in for the prize: a button. It's hardly worth the cost of postage. But I did get an immense feeling of satisfaction from finding the solution.

It makes doing each and every puzzle interesting. And it gives you some short cuts too. Potential minus: In a book where doing every puzzle is part of the point, ranging the difficulties from very easy to very hard breaks the overarching puzzle for anyone who can't do really hard sudoku. If you aren't an expert, don't plan on solving the overarching puzzle unless you're willing to become one. The \\"Mensa Guide to Solving Sudoku\\" will do fine.

The book is very addicting, I am so glad that I am finished so I can go back to my normal life. Can't wait for the next Sudoku Code book.A couple of shortcuts I learned--I didn't solve all the puzzles completely. On the number Sudoku I worked until all the same number as the circled number are uncovered. On the Word Sudoku, I circled all the squares corresponds to \\"the number\\" in the number Sudoku first then looked at the the previous puzzle to see if I can finish the word or sentense and fill in the blanks accordingly. For example, if the previous puzzle ends with \\"the le...\\" and you know it has to be \\"the letter\\", you can then fill in the first 4 circles. This will help in solving the more advanced puzzles.I can't work with the Word Sudoku every well, so what I did was to print out blanks Sudoku Grids (with Excel), translate the letters to numbers, and work on the blank spreadsheet with numbers.

Simply list the letters in order by rows, top to bottom, not in order of each 3x3 grid. Then all you have to do is figure out the word breaks.

Can You Find It?","review":"This is an excellent addition to any sudoku junkies library. I am usually not a fan of \\"knock-off\\" products taking advantage of another product's success (Da Vinci Code in this case) - but, because of an error in a gift certificate at a bookstore I decided to purchase this.There is an intricate message woven throughout all 200 sudoku (and wordoku) puzzles. This message will reveal some directions and another code that once cracked, will provide the puzzler with an answer to send in to the publisher. The prize? A dinky little button that says \\"I cracked the Sudoku code!\\"The code is uncovered because on each left-side page (a sudoku puzzle) there is an empty box with a circle in it. Once you have solved the sudoku puzzle there will be a number in that circle. You then circle all nine of those numbers in that puzzle and then transfer those positions over to the puzzle on the right-side page (a wordoku puzzle - sudoku with letters instead of numbers). Once you solve the wordoku puzzle you will have nine letters circled and those nine letters will be a 900 letter string of words and directions. Honestly, it is pretty exciting as you continue to uncode the directions, and it is also very addictive - even more so than normal sudoku because there is something that ties every puzzle in with every other puzzle.I gave this book 5-stars dispite a few flaws. First, the directions are not exactly clear. I had a difficult time understanding how to unscramble the letters - did all nine letters unscramble?, or just the three letters in each row? I originally thought that the letters needed to be unscrambled, but after completing the first 52 puzzles I learned that you just read down row by row to get the code. See my shared picture to look at the first puzzle and the first nine letters decoded.Anyways, this book is tons of fun! This review may be a little confusing until you actually get the book in front of you, but if you enjoy Sudoku and are looking for something a little more, get this book immediately!Note: there is an error on puzzle 54.

There are a lot of similarities in the way these two persons made it to the top, but of course also differences. This book handles both. By writing the biographies of these two people who briefly met in December 1970, the authors try to paint a picture of two lives which seem to have a lot more in common then expected. For us, more familiar with Elvis than with Nixon, there were some interesting eye-openers on the last one. Although we couldn't get rid of the idea that some of the comparisons are a bit sought for. More interesting than the exact comparisons between the two man making it to the top in their own field (becoming 'The King' and the president of the USA), are the differences after making it to the top and what happened then.As we all know Elvis made it to the top and lost his spot at the top because of the addictions that led to his death. The last couple of years only his loyal fans kept him 'on top' by still buying his records and going to his shows (even if they were not the quality they once had).We also know the story of Richard Nixon, making it to the top of the (Capitol) Hill and tumbling down on the other side as a result of the 'Watergate' scandal. Both persons made a \`comeback', and we're not referring to the TV special with the same name. But there are differences. Nixon became a 'respected elder statesman' and was rehabilitated in the eyes of the general public. He lived to enjoy that. Elvis' rehabilitation came after his death. There are three moments most people remember what they were doing when it happened: the first man on the moon, the shooting of Kennedy and the death of Elvis, this does say something on the man and his achievements. Unfortunately he wasn't able to enjoy it.A great pro of the book is that describing the lives of these two people from birth we also get a lot of information on Elvis parents, something which isn't seen in too many books and a nice extra for Elvis fans to complete their \`picture' of Elvis' entire life. Another nice feature of the book is the appendix in which a lot of documents and pictures surrounding the Presley - Nixon meeting are presented...Our conclusion:'Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American Dream' is an interesting book since it goes into the backgrounds of the lives of two men we all know, the 'American Dream' is the red line used to tell the stories of these two people. These backgrounds add some interesting views on the youth of Elvis dealing with a lot of rumours surrounding his upbringing. Besides that, the view from which this book is written is different from other Presley-books which makes it also interesting. For those like us, primary interested in Elvis, we must mention there's a lot of \`Nixon' in this book about Elvis' life and achievements, but we admit to be narrow-minded..."},{"Title":"Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American Dream","review":"Although my mom wrote this book, don't take my review as biased. It is just a really good book! Anyone who wants to know more about Elvis and Nixon should read this book. Although I am not much of a non-fiction reader, I found this book to be informative, enlightening, and a little bit amusing. The reason I say &quot;amusing&quot; is because picturing either of these so-call &quot;distiguished&quot; men doing the things described in this book is enough to give anyone a good chuckle. This book is a quick read, has great information, and is very well put together. The whole experiance of reading this book is fun!"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American Dream","review":"This book gave me a great amount of insight into the lives of both Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon which I did not know before reading. The lives of Presley and Nixon, from their upbringing to their metoric rise to fame and success, had many surprising, unseen parallels which this book explained very well. The way the book is written, comparing the lives of Presley and Nixon as they grew and evolved, really illustrated to me how similar the course of events which lead to their rise and fall were to each others. This book is an interesting read as well as a thoroughly researched text which I would recommend to not only the Elvis or Nixon buff, but any person who wants insight into the climate of the late twentieth century"},{"Title":"Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American Dream","review":"This book tells of two men who made history , One in politics and the other of course in music, Both lives of these two men who met are explored into great detail with some simarlarites ??You will have to buy the book to understand that one ? This is a factual account of then President Nixon and Elvis Presley meeting not once but twice to discuss the direction of America?Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Two Friends (Classic Short Stories)","review":"'Two Friends' is one of the most sympathetic yet cruel stories Guy de Maupassant ever wrote. It is sympathetic in the portrait of the two heroes, a pair of idle bourgeoises who spend their Sundays fishing in Colombes, away, as one character says, from the boulevard, in perfect sympathy with each other. Such an idyll seems destroyed by the Franco-Prussian war, with Paris besieged, and the surrounding countryside deserted; but a chance meeting decides the somewhat inebriated friends on braving their pastoral in the midst of all the fear, hatred and carnage. The story is sympathetic in its portrait of nature, the sunset spectacle ominously bleeding the river; the vast empty paysage our fearful heroes cross, crouching behind vineyards. It is cruel in exposing the fragility of such bourgeois comfort and short-sightedness, which is really recklessness and desire; in the violent intrusion of war; in the clash between archetypal Frenchness (and the first half reads like a particularly sunny Raymond Queneau novel) and its feared opposite, the German; in the inevitable mechanics of a narrative that moves from the amiably inconsequential to the shocking. Maupassant's prose is as compellingly flat as ever, describing happiness and horror in the same uncluttered monotone."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Symbols","review":"Not nearly comprehensive enough to be a definitive reference, more of a student's guide. Strongest on Romantic and Biblical literature. More coverage on how traditional symbols are manipulated and ironized in modern and contemporary fiction would also have been helpful. Not particularly helpful for medieval or Elizabethan literature."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Symbols","review":"As a professor, I have found this book to be very helpful for my students. Let's face it, we all have to start learning someplace, and to have this guide to help that process along is a wonderful bonus. It isn't meant to be encyclopaedic--it's just meant as a decent guide. If you are just beginning to learn literary analysis and haven't quite figured out what all of those silly symbols mean and just who made this stuff up, anyway, this is a perfect book to help you along."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Literary Symbols","review":"Dictionary has everything I need as a Lit Major/Professor and many pertinent entries and descriptions. Also has a beautiful cover."},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"Usually when you read an &quot;autobiography&quot; of a Nashville musician, you just know the co-author really wrote it and let the star put his or her name at the top. This book sounds just like Bowen would sound if he were chatting with you over coffee. It's filled with great insider trivia about everyone from Little Richard to Sinatra to Garth Brooks (and, yes, that's steam coming out from under Garth's big hat). The word &quot;unapologetic&quot; in the title should be taken literally. Bowen gives us the often-outrageous, sometimes-ugly, unvarnished truth about himself and about the star's who've crossed his path"},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"It's difficult to blame Bowen for the hodge-podge nature of this book - after all, he was busy living this life, rather than thinking about and analyzing it. And with a personality as strong as his, it's difficult to lay too much blame at the feet of co-writer Jerome, either. The result of their collaboration is an interesting set of anecdotes that sketch Bowen's character (you get the sense that the writing voice is largely accurate), with occasional flashes of insight, but very little real depth.Bowen's life in music has been an unusually rich one. Having started out as an early rock 'n' roll musician (with Buddy Knox and the Rhythm Orchids), progressing through a career in the music industry that included reviving the careers of Dean Martin (Bowen produced &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;) and Frank Sinatra (Bowen produced &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;), and a string of successful engagements as a record company executive in Nashville, Bowen's path crossed that of numerous fascinating characters. There's an interesting story about each, but they often fail to reveal much about the acquaintance, Bowen or their relationship.Bowen's post-Reprise years led him through early work with soon-to-be luminaries Don Henley and Glen Frey, but the book has surprisingly little to say about their music. His tenure at MGM provides an interesting anecdote about drop-shipping around the label's regular distribution system, but fails to discuss why. Again, interesting stories, but not particularly revealing.The book really doesn't take off until Bowen arrives in Nashville. Here there are interesting insights on Bowen's studio work, his view on musicians (including an enlightening discussion of stage versus studio players), his effort to drive Nashville to digital recording, and his philosophy about constructing an album as a 40-minute performance.Bowen concludes with a nicely detailed view of Garth Brooks' rise to 400-pound-gorilla status. While there are certainly other sides to the story, Bowen's rings with a lot of truth - most especially his description of how Brooks' contract demands crippled Capitol/Liberty as a label.This is a good read, but given Bowen's life, it should have been a great read."},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"I wanted to like this book, but so much reads in a nasty tone. First he hates vinyl and I love it so that's bad to start for me. Second he hates Jerry Lee but I also love him. The guy dropped The Killer from two labels! So much for knowing talent. Also I happen to know a few people he writes about in this book. They hold no malace, but they literly cracked up when I told them his versions of the story's. Read it if you want some gossip but as for me it's very mediocre. To be fair his own singing career is delt with quite well and the only part that read without venom."},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"This is a fabulous account of the music business and the information about the singers for whom Mr. Bowen helped makes for an amazing story. This vender did an excellent job in shipping it in a very timely manner over the holidays and the book was in very good condition as listed. Without a doubt, I would buy from this vender again."},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"This book is a gold mine of stories: \\"behind-the-scenes\\" insider's look at historic musical events in the big time music / recording industry, spanning about 40 years. One reviewer here refers to Bowen as a \\"Nashville musician\\". Well, he must have read a different book! The first half of it follows Jimmy from Texas to New Mexico to New York, all over the country, then to Los Angeles, etc. then later on to Nashville. Jimmy started out as a dirt poor kid in the boondocks of Texas and went on to be the producer of some of Sinatra's biggest hit records, among many other achievements. This book is a fascinating tale of all kinds of music biz stories. It's a real page turner if you ask me, very honest, no-nonsense, extremely unique. 20 stars!"},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"This \\"autobiography\\" was most interesting, with the various tales of the woes of big-name performers we all know. The thing is, Jimmy was there when rock-and-roll began, and, to his credit, found other positions within the music industry.My complaint with the book is that he often rewrites his own history, \\"I could have told them then what would happen....\\".....\\"as it turned out, I was right...\\"....Jimmy had his hit, as did Buddy Knox, in 1957...the same year as Darin's \\"Splish Splash\\", Holly's \\"Peggy Sue\\" and \\"That'll Be The Day\\", and Anka's \\"Diana\\". Yet he claims (page 49) that HE ran them all by Hugo & Luigi at that time and they all passed. This cannot be, as Jimmy and Buddy Knox and the Rhythm Orchids were all on the hit charts at the same time..My frustrations with the book ran so high as to highlight in yellow obvious exaggerations...outright misrepresentations, and pure fiction paragraphs. Logic just yelled that these were wrong.Mixed among the memories, however, are fun stories about others. If you can get over the fact that he claims credit for practically every musician's success from 1957 to 1992, and get over the bravado accompanied with the underlying failings, you'll enjoy the book. I did, despite my criticisms here.He up-fronts his excessive lifestyle, seems at peace with his drug and booze escesses, his wife-after-wife-after-wife life, and his endless succession of jobs. He documents maybe 20 jobs in the book, most with quick, get-out-of-town-before-noon jumps from one lilly pad to another in the pond of music producing, promoting, and presiding.Behind the truth of his \\"success\\" in the music business, is the bunch of associates who had real talent in managing, scouting, producing, marketing, and holding responsible jobs working for him. They made him look good, always....for a while...then it would catch up with him, again.I recommend the book, believe it or not. If you love the music business, it will be interesting to you, but it will also annoy you when Jimmy takes leaps beyond belief in his narratives....he'll stretch his imagination along with yours...WOG"},{"Title":"Rough Mix","review":"So much of these accounts of relationships and interactions with members of the music industry ring both false and bloated. I tried hard to like this book but the basic format is so tired and cliched. Just a litany of who he straightened out and set on the right path, and how he was so far ahead of his time. Includes all of the \\"self\\" cautions: self-important, self-righteous, self-centered, self-congratulatory. And also includes one of the most wrong-headed descriptions of the limitations of vinyl as a record format. To be married to this guy, trapped on an island in Hawaii, would just be daunting. Unexamined vanity has never prospered so openly. His riches clearly stayed financial."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"To begin with, Keegan's title story is a killer, a dark classic. She's great, like the Irish all-stars (Roddy Doyle, Colm Toibin), but also some of our Americans, particularly contemporary masters like Edward P. Jones and Mary Hood, with whom she shares that that deep, rueful knowledge of place and people, and habit of telling stories that are rich as novels. Anyone who loves good short stories and/or Irish writers will appreciate Claire Keegan's Anarctica."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"This collection of stories stumbled into my notice completely by accident. I am so glad that it did. If you are a fan of the short story, pick up Keegan's book! This is writing at its very best, in my opinion, and I anxiously await her next publication."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"Some of these stories might be described as vignettes. Sharp and swift injections of reality, they are far ranging in setting and character. The collection is somewhat noir in tone, and takes the reader by surprise on every page. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"Found Claire Keegan when I read Walk the Blue Fields, one of the most pleasant books I have ever read. Loved every word and the pictures that she painted with them. Antarctica is a close second and I highly recommend reading anything Claire produces. She has a way with the written word. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"Antarctica is Claire Keegan's first collection of short stories. Keegan was born in 1968 in County Wicklow. She has an MA in creative writing. She has won numerous prizes for her short stories. She lives in rural Ireland and is a very highly regarded teacher at short story workshops.There are sixteen short stories in the collection, some of which have been previously published in literary journals. I think the best way to post on a collection of short stories is through looking at the individual short stories in the collection. I will talk about six of the stories, all of which were just great works.\\"Antarctica\\" is the title story in the collection. It is really an amazing story. It is about a woman who decides she wants to find out what it would be like to have sex with a man other than her husband so she calmly and coldly makes up an excuse to be out of the house for the night (business takes her away) and picks up a man beneath her in social status, goes back to his house and spends the night with him. The tone of the story is dead pan still but you know something terrible is going to happen to this woman and you are for sure right. I will not any more as it is such a strong ending. I will say that male readers of this story whose wives have cheated on them might relish the ending a bit to much. It is a kind of precautionary tale for the straying wife.\\"Love in the Tall Grass\\" is another story about marital infidelity. This is a story about a single woman, Cordelia, who has a very long affair with a married Doctor. The doctor has a strong sexual fixation on the woman and she is deeply in love with him, or as much as her damaged soul allows her to be. Cordelia and the doctor can spend only stolen time together, often having sex among the tall grasses. Circumstances force the doctor to tell her they must split up but Cordelia extracts a time and place for a meet ten years from now. The language of the story is wonderful. Cordelia begins a terrible downward spiral and completely cuts her self from all human contact. She never goes outside. We do not know how but she has the money to pay to have everything she needs left at her door. When the date comes there is a really wicked double deception. \\"Love in the Tall Grass\\" is a great story.\\"Ride If You Dare\\" is also about a woman cheating on her husband. We do seem to have a trend here! It helps in appreciating this story set in the coastal regions of Mississippi in the United States to know that Keegan spent some time in Louisiana, right next to Mississippi. I know enough about this region of America (here in the Philippines we call it Bubba Gump land) to appreciate the little details that make this story such a pleasure to read. I really liked it a lot when I saw the mention of Tobassco sauce! The story is about a man who placed an ad in a newspaper \\"woman wanted\\" and the married very attractive well dressed woman who responded to his ad. They meet for the first time in a seafront restaurant up on stills. I really wanted some fried shrimp with hush puppies to go with this story. Keegan puts an awful lot in a few pages and this was a great story. Keegan leaves out the right things so we have to decide for ourselves why the woman is ready to cheat on her husband with a random stranger. This is a great story.\\"Sisters\\" is the longest story in Antarctica. Betty and Louise are two seemingly very different sisters.. Louise married pretty well and went of to the big city to live and have some kids. Betty stayed behind to take care of their widowed father and when he died she stayed on and took care of the farm. The father always showed more affection for Louise, pretty much taking Betty for granted. Betty gave up the chance for a husband and family, she was after all the plain sister. Ever year Betty, her husband and their kids come for a visit. This year Louise says her husband cannot come do to work issues. As the story unfolds we see a life time of being taken advantage off come unraveled. This story is real a small masterwork of subdued emotion.\\"Passport Soup\\" almost hurts to read as it is so close to the bone. It is about a couple whose daughter is missing, seemingly having been lured away by a stranger. The wife blames the husband for making her vulnerable to the words of a stranger by filling her head with fairy tales, a direct stab at much of Irish culture. The wife is out every night looking for their daughter, the husband stays home hoping she will come back. The story brilliantly portrays the horrible consequences this has for the relationship of the couple. It is hard to see how it could survive the horrible ending but the man thinks it might.\\"Close to the Waters Edge\\" is another very good story. Like all the others it is about, in part, a less than perfect marriage. It also spans two generations. It is set in the USA, starting in Tennessee and ending next to the Atlantic Ocean in Florida with a side trip to Harvard along the way, a lot of ground to cover in eight pages. It is about two generations of women, both married to brutal uncaring men who they stay with because it is somehow best for them, or so they feel. In the first generation the family are struggling pig farmers, by the next generation the daughter of the first woman is married to a wealthy man and living in a condo on the water in Florida. There is a very interesting tie in concerning the ocean between the generations. The top Harvard student son is gay and we see how his step- father consistently bullies him in ways that range from subtle to idiotic.The other ten stories are all very good. Since Keegan published this collection she has developed into one of the top short story writers of the world."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"I was so happy to discover Claire Keegan just recently. I'm only sorry she has not written more. Like William Trevor, she can capture a life in a very few words. Wonderful and magical."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"A collection of short stories about ordinary people living what appears to be ordinary lives written in the most extraordinary prose. Here is a new author blessed with abilities that are rare; a storyteller able to use words with astonishing clarity and surprise. Intelligent and challenging, the stories linger and are slow to fade."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"Claire Keegan is a new find for me and I love her work. I had to put down the book for a couple of days after reading the opening and title story, \\"Antarctica.\\" I was simply stunned by the way it wrapped up, though I started getting a sense about where it could be going, but it went way further than I anticipated. Keegan seems to be a writer somewhat in the O. Henry style who can wrap up with a perfectly plausible, though wholly unexpected resolution. Emily Dickinson described poetry as something that should blow your head off, and these short stories will did just that to me."},{"Title":"Antarctica","review":"Some very well known writers endorse the sixteen short stories that form the debut of Ms. Claire Keegan entitled, \\"Antarctica\\". There are times these enthusiastic comments are a poor indicator of what the reader will find inside. This is not the case with Ms. Keegan's work. Not every story is memorable, however most of them are, and that is enough reason to look forward to what this writer may present readers in the future.The collection's range is as diverse as the locales they unfold in. Ms. Keegan's talent is not limited to the land of her birth. She writes beautifully of Ireland, however she also writes as competently of Mississippi. Like all good writers she not only has an eye for detail and the ability to put what she sees on a page, she also has an ear for dialects that she can reproduce with equal skill.Her stories range from the terribly sad when an event has unbalanced a person, to one who has been second all her life until she takes primacy with a set of scissors, and does so without harm. There are stories of misplaced guilt, respect for the past and those that remain as representatives of it. Her stories are not sentimental; they are uncluttered, and at times uncomfortably direct.I doubt this is the last work we will see from this lady, and I look forward to reading her work again."},{"Title":"Kodoku: Sailing alone across the Pacific","review":"Horie if nothing else certainly has a sense of adventure. This book is about his 94 day trip from Japan to San Francisco in a 19 foot plywood sailboat. The writing is not entirely smooth, perhaps something was lost in the transulation. Nevertheless, it is honestly written and he does have a sense of humor. There are lots of amateur photographs. There are some very good charts and several pages of detailed drawings of the boat (&quot;Mermaid&quot;). Good appendices on sailing and such. An accurate, almost day by day, account of a very daring undertaking. If you like true adventure stories you will probably like this one."},{"Title":"Kodoku: Sailing alone across the Pacific","review":"This is a great story. After reading it, I am amazed that he made it alive. Think about preparing for a voyage that nobody from your country has ever completed. (This was before Google and such.) His packing list is hilarious. I am not a sailor, but I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Kodoku: Sailing alone across the Pacific","review":"I was so happy to find this book. I learned about it while researching solo voyages across the Pacific. Kenichi's experience is well translated and feels very authentic in the English form. I had such fun reading about the different aspects of trip; the exciting, mundane, terrifying, and uplifting moments. The dream of just wanting to sail from Japan to the US west coast for no reason makes perfect sense to me. How Kenichi overcame the pessimistic and disapproving people opposed to him fulfilling his dream is as vital to the story as the actual logistics and skill he used to accomplish it."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Reti Opening","review":"I bought this book after I decided to drop e4, but I couldn't get my hands on Kosten's repertoire book for the English.I liked this book and it is one that can improve your chess if it is studied properly, and not just your opening play either. I did have a few quibbles with the book.The author remained true to his favored double fianchetto piece set up in as many lines as he could. Since I like to compare the similarity of plans emanating out of pawn structures, I really enjoyed seeing the subtle differences in the plans in those pawn structures. The author did a great job in making the themes from game to game really consistent - you see why in this line, he recommends this move - it aims for a type of position he has explained earlier. He discusses the alternatives, but explains that the move he presents/prefers is more in line with the rest of the repertoire he is teaching. The quality of the material in the book itself is in my opinion deserving of a 5 star rating if one is over 1600 USCF and this goes as high as GM. There are variations here as well as lots of words. There are also improvements on assessments on evaluations offered.You could play this opening comfortably if you studied the relevant line in this book. OFten, move order is not a problem and the critical play begins after a variety of typical set ups have been established. THe pawn structure play that characterises this opening suits players who are not fond of sharp opening complications. The danger of course is that you learn to play formations and not thinking chess, but I think the author presetns so many plans in this book that if you play lazy chess, he is not to be blamed. He definitely does not espouse a cookbook approach. However, he does produce positions with recurring themes.What do I think could be better about the book? Well, skipping defences like 1.. c5 and 1 ... g6 really hurt. Those moves are commonly played vs Nf3. While a good study of the book might still allow you to transpose into a line given in the book, I would still have liked to see Dunnington present plans which he liked.I think this is a great book. But the c5 omission weighs heavily against it becos it invites a Siclian transposition and is the choice of most players. As a game collection to be studied, it would improve your chess greatly - just comparing the lines and games in similar pawn structures would greatly increase your chess knowledge. If I Reviewed it solely on that criteria, it is a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Reti Opening","review":"The books in the 'Easy Guide' series differ a lot in how introductory or analytic they are. This one is introductory, but is much more thorough in its treatment of some Black choices than others. Dunnington chooses exactly the right balance in describing the Reti Gambit declined. (1 Nf3 d5 2 c4 d4/c6/e6), with several alternatives given for White. However, in the case of the Accepted line (2...dc4) he analyzes only one repertoire choice: 3 Na3. He rejects 3 Qa4 out of hand, and although it's dead level at grandmaster level, it has a lot in common thematically with other flank openings, so I'd expect a class player to get a lot out of an analysis of it. There's also a good chapter on playing against Dutch Defense formations while avoiding d4.The exclusive recommendation against the King's-Indian formation (1...Nf6 2 g3 g6 3 b4) is bizarre -- not bad, just a little extravagant for a single line. It effectively transposes later into the English Opening with 1...e5 and 3...g6 with White expanding on the queenside and Black on the kingside -- pretty much as recommended in Donaldson's Strategic Opening Repertoire book several years ago. These positions don't play themselves, and players of the White pieces will get into them very often given that the King's-Indian is so popular at club level.This chapter is too short: some of the Reversed Benoni material could have been cut in favor of more explanation and examples (and alternative move orders) here.With the publication of Davies' 'Dynamic Reti', this book may seem to have been superseded. Yet Dunnington stays truer to the hypermodern spirit of the opening -- Nowhere in Davies, I think, will you find the White queen on a1 -- so this book still has legs. In fact, the two books nicely complement each other.Is Dunnington starting to write too many books too quickly? This one suffers in comparison to his excellent introduction to the Catalan, which also deals with a tricky flank opening with many move order subtleties and affiliated lines in other openings. That that effort was so well executed underscores the patchiness of this one. I also don't see why Dunnington shies away from pointing out where transpositions to the KIA (d3/e4) might work better than the Reti c4/b3 (or b4) treatment -- since he has written a good book, now in its second edition, about the KIA. In the King's-Indian chapter, especially, White could delay this choice to good effect. I'm not saying he should have written a different book by including KIA material, just cross-reference it where it's relevant."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Reti Opening","review":"I bought this book along with Davies' \\"Dynamic Reti\\", and after trying the \\"Easy Guide\\" out in some games I proceeded to play, I was quite dismayed at the lack of guidance I was given by the different chapters in the book. Either I already knew what he was telling me or I couldn't understand why he was suggesting what he was because some moves didn't make sense to me. The other problem I had was trying to keep up with the progression of his games in between his notes and bold print. My suggestion is to skip this book and get Nigel Davies \\"Dynamic Reti\\". There is much more unique information and insight offered there in greater clarity."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Reti Opening","review":"The Reti lines are well covered but against the KI the lines recomended doesn't seem right. Black seems to be better.Besides the book does not cover lines where black replies 1.~c5. \`1.~d6 and 1.~g6."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Reti Opening","review":"But if you really want to learn the reti opening it is a good source, and an adequate guide. it is well written in many aspects. but it can leave one with more questions then answers. it delves deeply into some concepts and leaves others often the featured game concepts almost completly alone. I do think Dunnington could have done better. with an opening as sharp and complex as the reti I feel that 128 pages of material just isn't enough. but don't get me wrong here the 128 pages that are presented are packed with plenty of good examples of good reti play. course that really just boils down to more stuff I get to figure out myself. all in all I feel that a good openings book should provide a good foundation. Dunningtons easy guide to the reti opening provides about 3\\\\4 of a good foundation. but looking at the introduction think this exactly what Dunnington had in mind. mabey I should give it a four star rating."},{"Title":"Horse Fever: A Guide for Horse Lovers and Riders","review":"This is a book from my childhood that I just loved.

George Haddow and Jane Bullock are former senior FEMA officials that exerienced it first hand. And it shows.I've added this book as one of my reference texts for the Organizational Continuity sessions I conduct. I also plan to use it in an workshop series I'm developing. It would be a great textbook for any course on Emergency Management AND it's also a good read for anyone interested in getting a taste of Emergency Management. I truly wish this book was in print when I took Emergency Management in grad school.Highly recommended !!!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Emergency Management, Second Edition (Butterworth-Heinemann Homeland Security)","review":"\\"Introduction to Emergency Management\\" (Second Edition) is an informative book which provides an adequate introduction to emergency management at an undergraduate level, but contains some systematic structural flaws that detract from its stature in the field. The book was written by two former FEMA officials, George Haddow and Jane Bullock. They occupied key positions at FEMA during the Clinton administration, and obviously respect their former boss, FEMA Director James Lee Witt. For the record, Witt was one of Clinton's numerous Arkansan appointees, and was certainly one of the best. Witt dramatically elevated FEMA's stature within the government and embraced an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness and response. I applaud Witt's efforts and service.I would have expected two of Witt's disciples to have written an excellent book, and in some areas the book really delivers. Unfortunately, in others the authors use their position for seemingly self-serving feuds with the policies of other administrations, and are particularly critical of the George W. Bush administration for the obvious shift to focusing on terrorism after the events of September 11, 2001. While I actually do agree that FEMA needs to retain an all-hazards perspective, the terrorism threat is downplayed (it gets one chapter) in this book, and their views on the future terrorist threat are obviously viewed through rose-colored glasses. Their biggest issues with the Bush administration seem to be the loss of prestige of putting FEMA under DHS, and the scuttling of \\"Project Impact\\", a FEMA program that was discontinued for being a lower budgetary priority than other things (like terrorism) that the Bush administration had on their plate. Both authors were heavily associated with \\"Project Impact\\".The book was written pre-Hurricane Katrina, and that's unfortunate (presumably the third edition addresses that issue). An ironic passage is found on p. 62: \\"For a city like New Orleans, however, which is built below sea level and where relocation is impractical, levees can be used effectively to protect flood-prone areas.\\" Or not. The New Orleans levees were not well designed or maintained, but the authors gloss over the fact that disasters are very likely to happen when a city is built adjacent to the water below sea level in an area frequented by hurricanes. Certainly there were more problems with the Katrina disaster than FEMA alone can be blamed for, but the politically easy policy that has encouraged reconstruction in the same place is one that is utterly bound to fail, regardless of the levee system installed, or regardless of FEMA funding for flood mitigation. The next chapter concludes in typically obtuse style: \\"Most consider President Bush's election loss to be partly attributable to the federal government's inability to manage domestic disasters\\". What? President Bush actually won the election (twice), and even if he had lost, I would need to see concrete evidence to convince me that the loss was in any meaningful way attributable to domestic emergency response. FEMA budgets and priorities do not historically play crucial roles in Presidential elections.The book has several flaws: careful readers will note the foreshadowing of one of the larger ones if they read the Acknowledgements (p. xv) and discover that a long list of graduate students are thanked for \\"their hard work in conducting the preliminary research and draft for this book\\". Yes, it's a not uncommon problem: teachers (both authors are Adjunct Professors at The George Washington University) want to publish (\\"publish or perish\\"), but don't want to or have the time to do their own original research or writing, so they have their students do it. (I have seen this at another university firsthand.) The students may be assigned the work, compelled to do it, do it as part of a thesis or project, or do it for some other reason, but the fact is that George Haddow and Jane Bullock have their names on the cover, and if their acknowledgements are accurate, their students did a large part of the work writing this book.I certainly don't know who wrote what, but I can definitively say that the quality of the prose varies dramatically throughout the book, making me wonder how many authors the book effectively has. This is one of the primary reasons I gave the book a two star rating, though it's far from the only one. An even bigger reason is that enormous swaths of the book are essentially cut and pasted from government publications or web sites. Page after page is taken from government sources, which, unlike privately authored material, can be cited in bulk with no problems, copyright or otherwise. Some of the material was not even updated by the authors, when a quick perusal would have shown it needed to be. On p. 110, for example, in the middle of a lengthy passage credited to FEMA, the book (which was written in 2005, copyrighted in 2006) states \\"FEMA expects the [Capability Assessment for Readiness] report to be completed and distributed to the President and the U.S. Congress in the first quarter of 2001\\". That's just sloppy, and it's patently unacceptable. Unfortunately it's also not the sole issue: extremely obscure acronyms are used repeatedly without defining them, another subtle sign that the book was written by multiple people and they were not properly coordinated.The best thing in the book (pp. 319-325), is a case study written by Roz Lasker (The New York Academy of Medicine, September 2004) about readiness in terrorism scenarios, and specifically dealing with how people actually behave in emergencies versus how officials expect them to behave in those emergencies. It was extremely insightful, and I applaud the authors for including it in the book. The authors also compiled a very nice set of appendices, although Appendix D was taken wholesale from a government Internet site and Appendix E, which is a self-justifying fluff piece about Homeland Security, was taken from the \\"Department of Security Results Agenda-August 2004\\".This book does contain some good information. The basics of dealing with different hazards and mitigation strategies are well explained. Unfortunately the terrorism threat is downplayed despite the disproportionately large death (and monetary) toll of September 11, 2001 compared with the other disasters in the book (even in combination), and the book clearly contains bias (especially in the final chapter) in favor of their former employer, and against other administrations which had to deal with much different problems than they confronted. Finally, the quality of writing is not what you would expect from two distinguished civil servants; for these reasons in combination with the enormous percentage of the book that is simply a restating of information commonly available on government Internet sites and in easily obtainable publications, I cannot recommend this book.The shell of the book is strong; I hope that the third edition addressees the weaknesses of this edition and is markedly improved."},{"Title":"Introduction to Emergency Management, Second Edition (Butterworth-Heinemann Homeland Security)","review":"I found this to be a good introduction to emergency management.

This volume is pitched at a level for newcomers to the subject. One problem: Its positive evaluation of the current American system looks silly when one adds Hurricane Katrina (the book was published before the hurricane struck). Obviously, the system was not in the state described in this volume.Nonetheless, this is a nice work. It begins with a general introduction, including a history of emergency management in the US. The second chapter makes a critical point--the importance of an all hazards approach. Emergency management is not just about responding to terrorists--it is also about response to national disasters. The chapter does a fine job at emphasizing this.Then, subsequent chapters consider the key issues of mitigation, response, recovery, and preparedness. We can try to reduce the odds of disasters and their consequences--but we must also plan on how to respond if such events actually occur. There follow chapters on communication, international disaster management, responding to the new terrorist threat, and the future of emergency management.This book is quite useful for those who want an introductory analysis to the subject. As such, it performs pretty well, despite its overly optimistic view of the state of the system, at the time the book was published (recall the miserable performance of FEMA with Hurricane Katrina)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Emergency Management, Second Edition (Butterworth-Heinemann Homeland Security)","review":"For a easy flowing read, buy this book.

With the exception of cutting off extra material and drilling holes in your toothbrush, most of the info is covered better elsewhere (see Chris Townsend's \\"The Backpacker's Handbook\\") and doesn't really fall exclusively into ultralight backpacking."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"There is a bit of a know-it-all and a scold in every ultra-light backpacker, and it sometimes grates on the rest of us. Like the others, Kestenbaum believes that the ultra-light way is the best- but he'd be willing to grant that it is the best *for him*. Some of us live in situations where ultra-light is not a possibility, since we are the family sherpa on any expedition. We sherpas can nonetheless trim our packs, and this book can help you do it.Kestenbaum's book takes a helpful tone, always offering choices and explaining his thinking. The rest of us can learn from that and reduce the weights on our back, even if we're stuck carrying some things that are w-a-a-a-y off his list.Kestenbaum's book is organized by gear, with chapters on backpacks, shelter, sleeping bags, footwear, clothing,\\"other gear,\\" food, and the like. This is followed by some general backpacking chapters on health and safety and walking, which aren't really ultra-light issues at all. He concludes with a chapter on the ultra-light state of mind, and an extra chapter about long-distance hiking.The book is a lot shorter than its competitors, so if you want more detail you should get one of the longer books. His attitude is that if some bit of gear isn't light, he shouldn't even discuss it, and that cuts the length down a lot.There is an odd tension evident throughout the book that becomes most obvious in the chapter on the ultra-light state of mind (but is also evident in health, safety, and walking). Kestenbaum wants us to be obsessive about cutting weight but also to relax and mediate as part of preparing for the outdoors. Can one be meditative and obsessive?That tension is also evident in his attitude toward backpacking itself: he wants to enjoy nature more deeply -- so he doesn't pack fancy meals, books, or cards for entertainment -- but he also wants to put in 20-mile days. OK, then.These tension aside, this is a helpful book from which any backpacker can learn. He is a passionate advocate of the ultra-light way but he didn't come across as a fanatic to me."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"Almost five years have passed since this book was published, and every now then, maybe three or four times a year, I'll check back and see what people are saying about their experiences reading it and applying its content. For those of you who don't have the initial pleasure of getting a book deal and the subsequent hair-pulling that goes on once your delusions have been punctured, think twice before you dedicate at least two years of your life toward an objective that may provide you with several inches of thicker skin as well as the undoubtedly fulfilling joy of accomplishing something special. Ultralight backpacking was unquestionably a profound passion of mine at the time, and having just graduated from a Master's program in creative writing, I was fortunate to be given the opportunity of forging these two interests in a manner that I felt uniquely contributed to the existing pool of instructional literature.But much like buying a puppy based on spontaneous appeal, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. I didn't realize that an instructional book published by large corporate organization was as much - if not more - a product of the publishing house and its profusion of editors, copyrighters and marketing gurus as it was of the author. I naively thought that my recently polished skills as a writer would shine all the way through to the ultimate version of the manuscript - with perhaps a slight touch-up here and there by the editors - but what you end up reading in the published version of The Ultralight Backpacker is miles and miles, a Pacific Crest Trail away from what I'd originally submitted. I'd thought my skin had been sufficiently hardened by two years of incessant critique in grad school, but by the time the editing process was complete, I'd been rubbed raw.While I was and remain utterly thrilled to have written a book worthy of publication, one that I continue to be immensely proud of, one that I will always feel provides an outlet for those wishing to pursue an easier life on the trail, I felt considerable frustration at the degree to which the publishers were allowing my literary standard to be compromised for the sake of sparse marketability. My original manuscript shrunk by 33%. Eloquence became prosaic, evocation became anesthetized. My pride was stung again and again. My protests were to no avail, and there was more than one occasion on which I threatened to pull the plug on the whole thingYet despite my deepening realization that the world of nonfiction treats first-time authors much as the film industry regards first-time screenwriters, I believe that the essence of the message I tried to disseminate through this book can be read and felt. The art of ultralight backpacking is an art of expression, a language one speaks to affirm one's connection with the natural, unfettered, indifferent world; while human progress mounts greater complexities on our already encumbered minds, ultralight backpacking is a regression to a state of timelessness and purity. For me, there is no question that ultralight backpacking is a philosophy, far more than a specific technique or a material reckoning, and for those with whom I've had the privilege of sharing the trail, I believe that I am not alone in thinking this way. While the rest of my manuscript was being picked apart, reduced and fiddled with, I insisted that the chapter on the Ultralight State of Mind remain intact. I wanted people to understand that what makes ultralight backpacking so special and distinguished is more than just shaving off a few ounces or eschewing the use of traditional backpacking gear; for those of us that have dedicated ourselves to its pursuit, it is indeed a way of life, one that trickles into our daily living, affecting us on an irreducible level. While my life has turned to other pursuits and I find myself with little time left over for backpacking, I still approach all the matters of my existence with the benefit of living and experiencing the ultralight state of mind. If, through reading this book, you can capture a sense of that essence and power, then despite its flaws - the existence of which I freely admit - the book will have achieved its purpose. Certainly I could have written more chapters on ambiguously related material, providing the prospective reader with more bang for the buck, but to me, ultralight backapacking is about reduction, about stripping away the reliance we have on things outside of ourselves, and to believe in our deepest ability to function on a primitive, intrinsic level. I give you the essentials, bare though they may be, and send you on your way to write the rest of the book yourself, for the style and manner of ultralight backpacking is uniquely personal, providing a framework to find what is most appropriate for your own needs and instincts.I don't want to, and indeed don't have a right to, defend my book against any of the opinions offered by readers. I have my own attacks on the finished version. But I believe that the responsibility of how the content of a book is used and applied lies with the reader. If it doesn't resonate, if you're not feeling it, it may not necessarily be because the book has failed in its purpose. Ultralight backpacking has provided me with some of the most profound and life-enhancing experiences I've ever had, and this book's mission, as it came from my heart, was to share the manner in which I came to know these experiences. Even if only one in ten, or one in a hundred, readers are touched by similar experiences, my regrets and frustrations in getting this book to print are as substantive as the air I breathe.I welcome your comments, critiques, and thoughts on any topic relating to this book or to ultralight backpacking, and wish you success and enlightenment in your journey to a lighter state of mind.

The book is a nice introduction to lightening up pack load - it is easy to read and well organized into subjects. It may not have the kinds of detail that the previous reviewers were looking for, but I found it to be a great resource when coupled with research on the web. He's not too fanatical and he gives specific (brand, model) recommendations for products, some of which I've actually used. If you are new to backpacking or new to the light-weight/ultralight-weight concept, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"Review originally written March 7, 2005.John Muir spent weeks at a time in the High Sierras with little more than an overcoat and a bag of bread, and thought it was a lot of fun. Most people today, even backpackers, want more comfort than that.Backpacking is usually done by people who think a lot. It is an attempt to return to an older and simpler way of life. It is not done out of necessity. It is done for philosophical reasons.People used to walk for long distances carrying heavy, uncomfortable loads by necessity. Then we all got automobiles, and some of us started walking for long distances carrying heavy, uncomfortable loads for fun. Ryel Kestenbaum's short, interesting book is about walking for long distances for fun carrying light, comfortable loads.I have Colin Fletcher's Complete Walker III in front of me. It is 670 pages long and weighs 3lbs. Ryel Kestenbaum's is 139 pages long and weighs just under 12oz.I love Colin Fletcher's book, started with his first, a long time ago. But I find the ultralight approach very interesting. Carry a light pack, and you don't need heavy shoes. If you don't wear heavy shoes, your legs don't get so tired, so you can go farther with less fatigue. It all fits together.The gear recommendations are straightforward. Fortunately for us, the same technology that has made life in general easier for us is making it possible for us to walk more comfortably while carrying less weight. Kestenbaum's survey of gear, like the book, is brief, but to the point. His most important recommendation is to minimize the gear.I was interested by his training recommendations for long-distance backpacking trips, and his rationale for them.To end on a philosophical note, Thoreau said that the purpose of life is to contemplate. I think he was cribbing from Aristotle, who said that the goal of life is to have the leisure to think. Thoreau practiced the ultralight philosophy before his time, and would no doubt do so today. Aristotle would probably say make some objective observations, then judge for yourself. The Ultralight Backpacker is a good place to start.Update, July 11, 2005:Attempting to follow some of Kestenbaum's recommendations, I set out to find a new pair of low-top lightweight hiking shoes/boots to replace my worn-out Vasque Skywalks. I have wide feet, which has been a problem in the past, and it still is: None of the available major-brand low-top hiking shoes come in wide sizes. The local EMS had none in my size in even a regular width, let alone wide. LL Bean's \\"Mountain Treads\\" come in wide sizes, so I ordered a pair. The 11 1/2W, my correct foot size, was too small. The size 12W was a better fit, but it is made on an Italian last, so the toe was too narrow and the heel too wide, so that my heel wouldn't stay seated in the shoe. The Vasque Skywalks have served me well, so I decided to look for some new Vasque boots. REI carries the Vasque brand, but didn't have my size in stock, either in the retail store or on-line. I finally found a pair of Vasque Breeze GTX XCR boots in size 12 at Campmor that seem to fit well and are very comfortable. They are hightops - no wide sizes in the Vasque lowtops. They are lighter, more flexible, and more comfortable than the Skywalks, and the Vibram Contact outsole looks like a big improvement over the old Vibram on the Skywalks.Based on my recent hike of a New Hampshire 4000 footer, I would have had to spend a lot of time knocking gravel, water, twigs, and even snow out of my shoes had I worn lowtops. As it was, I had a fall in part due to my worn-out Skywalks, which prompted the search for new boots. It makes me wonder what kind of trails Kestenbaum hikes on - they must be easier going than the minimally maintained wilderness area trails in the White Mountains.On that same hike I tried out a pair of North Face lightweight nylon trousers, again following Kestenbaum's suggestion, rather than my usual rugby shorts. While the nylon pants were certainly better than the Levis I wore on a Grand Canyon hike many moons ago, they quickly became annoyingly confining around the knees as the trail steepened, and became very warm as the temperature and humidity rose. I soon changed into the rugby shorts, and was much more comfortable. I plan to carry the trousers with me, since they are so light, and use them if the temperature drops or bugs become overwhelming.I considerably lightened my daypack before this hike - one emergency candle instead of 6, etc., - which was probably a reasonable idea. I have also been using some of his training suggestions, which so far seem to be helpful, but I can't give a final opinion of them yet.So, of Kestenbaum's suggestions that I have tried so far, two were busts, one was OK, and one is still under investigation.I'm planning another hike soon, wearing my usual warm-weather garb of rugby shorts and cotton tee-shirt, and will try out my new high-top Vasque boots.Update, July 21, 2005:The Vasque Breeze GTX XCR's are great! Small heel blisters on first hike, which I didn't even notice until I pulled the boots off at the end of the day. Second hike didn't even produce those. Very flexible, light, good traction on difficult terrain, good support, very comfortable. No complaints whatsoever. I like the high tops, would not feel comfortable with the lowcut equivalent, even if I could find them in a wide size. I hike with a light daypack only. Perhaps these would not hold up so well under a heavier pack. Will report results in the future if that occasion arises."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I really don't plan to backpack, but need ultralight kayak camping ideas.

His methods and style were so right on, and it was clear to all of us how deeply passionate Ryel is toward going ultralight. It was one of the most enlightening weekends of my life, and it began a love affair with the wilderness that seems to get stronger all the time.That was three years ago. Today, I've refined my own ultralight techniques to fit my personal needs, and they're not far different than what Ryel spells out in his book. Trust me, ultralight is the only way to go.

Subject matter very good."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"This book was published in 2001, and in that time there have been incremental improvements to the gear that is mentioned in these pages. A large portion of this book focuses on the selection and use of gear. This information is dated, but that is not the reason for a poor review.First I take issue with the overall tone of the book. It seems to me that the author wants to speak from an experience he does not fully encompass himself. The chapters will quickly strike a reader as \\"preachy\\" and repetitive with poorly constructed clich&eacute;s sold as truth. From chapter 5 on clothing, \\"Despite what some promoters might have you believe, no clothing bestows superpowers that enable you to leap tall mountains in a single bound.\\" Well obviously. These clich&eacute;s are scattered throughout the work and when they are connected together you must wonder what the author was thinking about his audience. This combines in the book with statements that cast doubt on the authors knowledge of the subject which he is speaking.This quote is from chapter 6, \\"After I cut half of the handle off the lightweight plastic spoon I carry, I take the time to drill a few holes along the portion of the handle that remains. This might seem extreme, but its actually an important step to take if you want to completely assume the commitment to being an ultralight backpacker.\\" Earlier on in the text the author eschews using a tarp and instead opts for the use of a double walled tent. What difference will a few holes make if you are still carrying a double wall tent?The prose in this book is generally poorly constructed from chapter 5 \\"Amazingly, there is clothing that can meet all our outdoor requirements admirably.\\" From Chapter 7 on food, \\"Sure, ice cream tastes good, especially if it contains as many different forms of chocolate as possible, but is obviously impractical for a backpacking trip.\\" These are just a few examples of what litters this book.Overall I am not sure the author has a clear mind about what he is professing. There is precious little discussion on how things actually function on the trail. There are no lengthy anecdotes about how a certain piece of gear performed or failed to. The author it seems wants to direct his writting towards those who might be part of both the \\"yoga crowd\\" and the average backpacking masses. That by itself isn't the issue, the author it my mind fails make a commitment between the two. Who was he writing this text for? The work's composition is wishy-washy and a bit maddening. I would not recommend the book.A good alternate to this text would beLightweight Backpacking and Camping: A Field Guide to Wilderness Equipment, Technique, and Style (Backpacking Light)."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"If you look at it from the proper perspective, this is a great book. The author describes the extreme. I know a guy who was the opposite extreme. He brought 3 pairs of shoes to the top of Half Dome. Most people are somewhere in the middle of those two extremes, and some people are more extreme than either end.This is a good book, especially for the beginner hiker. Read what it has to offer, and find your own place in the backpacking world."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"This book has some useful information in it as long as you are reading it with a critical mind. Each person pursuing \\"ultralight\\" is going to have preferences regarding trade-offs and items that cannot be left behind. Ryel prefers to do without the extra ounces of books on the trail, but needs his double-wall tent in inclement weather. Others will carry only the shelter of a 12 oz. sil-nylon tarp and afford themselves the luxury of reading material.It's easy to see how the author arrived at his own conclusions and his recommendations do make sense, but they are not the only way. Opinions are good and the author doesn't hide his, however, a fairer and perhaps purer treatment of going ultralight should probably address more directly how to get as light as possible and then discuss the trade-offs. For example, it makes little sense to me that 4+ lb. double-walled tents should end up getting the thumbs up (because they shelter you properly in rain and don't have as many problems with condensation... everyone knows that), while well-ventilated single-wall tents are discouraged and lightweight tarps only get honorable mention toward the end of the chapter. This is just one example where the author reveals that, at the time of writing, he was ultralight in spirit, but only a lightweight in practice. I will carry a 1 lb. tarp and fuss with it a bit every night if it means shaving 3+ lbs., getting to add back a small luxury item, and being connected with nature even during a rain storm. Ryel confesses to wanting to sleep under the stars every chance he gets, hates fussing with improvised shelters, and had at least one bad experience getting wet under a tarp, so now it's \\"real tents\\" or nothing. You get my point.Even so, most areas of importance get at least some attention from the author and you get enough information to form your own opinions. This book is better than some, maybe not as good as others. Not the last word in going ultralight, but enough information to make the book purchase worthwhile, especially if you have an afternoon or two to reflect on the author's opinions and see how they compare to your own. I definitely liked this book better than Don Ladigan's \\"Lighten Up! A Complete Handbook...\\", which was far from \\"complete\\" and should have been subtitled \\"A Beginner's Guide\\".

But the annoying thing about the book is the pretentious religiosity. Evidently carrying a lighter pack into the woods automatically means you have to become a yoga master and hike 21 miles per day. Only if you do that will you become &quot;at one&quot; with nature. I don't know if it gets more pathetic than that. Lighten your load so you can hike 21 miles per day so you can get in touch with nature? Somehow it all makes sense in Kestenbaum's mind. Don't take any field guides, camera, binoculars, or a hand lens or spend time loafing on the trail or enjoying a luxurious meal or god forbid, reading a book. No sireee. The &quot;answer&quot; lies in controlling your breathing and logging miles and miles and mind-numbing bragging-rights miles. If this is truly the ultralight state of mind, it's a sad one and I personally find it arrogant for a mile-logging automaton to tell me what my relationship with wilderness is or should be. Get off the treadmill and stop and smell the roses Ryel. At the very least, take a hand lens and take a close look at the nature you've been trail-running by. There are a lot of different ways to go ultralight in the backcountry and find your relationship with wilderness. It's sheer arrogance to assume otherwise."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I think that some of the reviews here are from folks who were expecting an encyclopedia to ultralight backpacking, and were therefore disappointed. This book serves as an excellent introduction, covering all the topics relating to ultralight backpacking, but not going too deeply into any one topic.There's info on everything from cutting your toothbrush in half to getting rid of excess food packaging to getting fit for the trail to buying the right pair of shoes. If you're just getting into backpacking, and would like to see if ultralight backpacking is right for you, I can't imagine a better resource than The Ultralight Backpacker. I've been doing the ultralight thing for over ten years now, and I'm glad that now there's a way for others to see the benefits of going light.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to people eager to get into the backcountry but without the know-how."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I've been experimenting with various ways of trimming down my backpack after finally getting sick of dragging around my regular 40 pound pack, but everyone I asked for advice seemed to suggest only things that had worked for them individually.The Ultralight Backpacker does a great job of providing a complete survey of ultralight backpacking so that just about anyone can start practicing the Ultralight way and incorporating the benefits into their outdoor experiences. There's info on clothing, packs, shelter, walking, breathing, food preparation and everything else you'd find on an ultralight backpacker. There's even a chapter on the ultralight backpacking philosophy and developing the ultralight state of mind.I like this book better than Ray Jardine's books, which always seemed to me filled with a lot of information I really didn't need to know... this book just gives you what you need to know so you can get out on the trail quickly.Lots of pictures and diagrams, well written, and thorough... I've gotten my packweight down to less than 20 pounds now, and could definitely get it to less than 15 with a little more scrutinizing. If you've ever thought about lightening your load and seeing what this ultralight business is all about, get this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I purchased this book after having heard good things about it. What I got was one of the biggest disappointments of my life as far as books go. Kestenbaum has a right to hike however he wishes, but to pass off his personal ideas as the \\"one true way\\" is absolute bull!First, he talks about how no extra ounce hitches a ride in HIS pack. He religiously cuts every tag and extra strap off of every piece of gear he owns. He carefully selects his gear. Yet, he still maintains a pack of over 12 pounds. The vast majority of people who consider themselves ultralight maintain a base pack weight of UNDER 12 lbs, not over it! Kestenbaum continuously skips over gear that many ultralighters love, and gives preference to his personal selections, despite the extra weight involved. Yet remember, no extra ounce hitches a ride in HIS pack!Second, and this is the worst of the book in my opinion, is that the section on meditation (yep, there's a section on meditation) is longer than the sections on hygiene and water treatment! Please Mr. Kestenbaum, explain to me how meditation is more important to backpacking than hygiene and meditation?Kestenbaum's work has some useful information, but not much. In truth, the vast majority of the useful information is available on the internet for no money. Of the ultralight authors out there, Ryel Kestenbaum shouldn't even be mentioned. His base weight exceeds the limits of what is considered ultralight, his philosophy is pointless to ultralight backpacking, and his information is weak at best. Money spent on this book would be best spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I find the ultralight backpacking movement refreshing. Having logged quite a few miles over the past 25 years hiking under 50-70 lb packs (only do &gt;10 day trips), I can see the advantage! This book is a good intro, with a chapter devoted ot each of the major gear items (packs, tents, sleeping bags, etc). But, it's pretty short on completeness. I was disappointed not to find info of use to me beyond the very basics, except of a quick little chapter on long-distance hiking, but nothing on cross-country hiking needs or recommendations. Kind of an expensive book for just an intro. Skip this book and search the web for all the info (and more) than this book has."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"This book was recently reviewed by Backpacking Light, the Journal of Lightweight Backcountry Travel. This is an excerpt from the review, reprinted with permission.\\"The cover of The Ultralight Backpacker states: \\"The complete guide to simplicity and comfort on the trail.\\" In our view this claim is overstated, as this slender book, 138 pages long, can be read in an afternoon and is far from complete and will likely disappoint the experienced lightweight backpacker yearning for new information about equipment and techniques not treated in other texts. However, for the newcomer to lightweight backpacking, The Ultralight Backpacker will not disappoint - it provides an introduction to lightweight backpacking that will certainly put you on the right track to shedding pounds from your pack.\\""},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"This book has some useful information and guidance so I decided to give it two stars. It isn't the worst book I've seen on backpacking but it isn't very good. I understand why others don't like the \\"preaching\\". The book is loaded with it.The author recommends that you cut tags, cut straps, cut off toothbrush handles, etc. According to the author, this gets you into the state of mind for ultralight. It isn't what lightweight backpacking is about. It is about knowing the weight of everything you put in your pack. In the clothing section, the author only mentions fleece for the insulation layer. This is very out of date. There are far better insulation layer alternatives that are much lighter. In the shelter section, he doesn't cover tarps sufficiently, the only option for someone going ultralight. In the section that covers water, he recommends iodine tablets, a very poor choice with Aquamira and other chlorine dioxide products on the market.After reading lots of books on backpacking, reading the internet, and practicing it for two years, I came back and read this book again. Some books I get something of value when I read them the second time. This book was a complete zero for me the second time around. If you're interested in lightening your backpack and want to read a short book like Kastenbaum's Ultralight backpacker, I strongly recommend Don Ladigin's Lighten Up! book. It is far better."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"I liked this book more than Ray Jardine's because it was less obsessive-compulsive in tone and more often applied some common sense to ounce-shaving. Of course, there is still some of the fanaticism you would expect (and want) from a book on ultralight backpacking -- I'm sure some people really do drill holes in their toothbrush handle even after cutting it half. But, overall, I think Kestenbaum kept this under control. Although the book is short on detail, it does a good job of covering the principles and general approach to going light and I found his discussion on trail shoes vs. hiking boots especially helpful. An excellent place to start if you're thinking about trying the ultralight approach."},{"Title":"The Ultralight Backpacker : The Complete Guide to Simplicity and Comfort on the Trail","review":"This book goes over the writrers gear list of his commercially bought products that he cut the labels off of and shortened the straps to lighten the load. Most of the info in this book is stated on the internet in better wording and a more practical manner. Much of this book is just his opinion of how things might work because he never enven tried the products. From my understanding he doesn't even have any serious experience under his belt. He has hiked several hundred miles but never completed any long distance trails. His biggest achievement is that he attempted the PCT.

What changed? Perfumes are *not* made from natural sources, nor are they safe, as falsely advertised to be. They contain hundreds of deleterious chemicals, having maimed and disabled millions of people -- people of all ages. Given the fact that perfumes do no bear warning labels, I wrote this book in hopes to educate people about the truth behind an industry that has no regard for health and a government that condones it. Please read my book and demand safer products. You and you children deserve much better. Perfumes are only nice if you enjoy slathering yourself in greasy petrochemicals, neurotoxins, hazardous waste and nearly 100 carcinogens, just to mention a few of their products' contents.

Those sents truly do belong in the toxic waste dump as she says. How many people had to die from cigarettes and asbestos before those items were finally touted. Scents is a multi-billion dollar business and government agencies do not want to speak out against constituents desires; they are willing to let millions die and cost health insurance mega millions, individual costs skyrocket, pain and suffering continue to perpetuate the sale of the poison odors!

Unfortunately, half of us will refuse to accept the truth and \\"blame\\" other people for our problems. The problem is that half of us create disease in our bodies from eating the wrong foods or using the wrong \\"beauty\\" products. Products like perfumes, aftershaves, deodorants, body creams, and sprays are so poisonous to the body's natural equilibrium. I would love for this book to be advertised on TV. Man oh Man how that would cause some controversy amongst the big pharma companies who dish out all this poisonous crap! in fact, when I win big on the lottery or sell enough of my own books, I will sponsor Connie in any which way she would love to market her book.Anyhow, I too are extra sensitive to chemicals, even in foods. I use soap on my hair, body, and face, and Neem cream moisturiser from The Neem People. Ghanian Black Soap is my staple, and I make my own skin scrubs using natural coconut oil, raw shea butter, and natural cane sugar. It's wonderful and my skin smells lush. Natural essential oils fragrance my home, and I have stopped using Mr Muscle and Cillit Bang and just use basic water and 10-20 drops of lemon and lime essential oils.

One has to wonder why; certainly, our doctors can't (or maybe \\"won't\\") tell us. After reading this book, it makes perfect \\"scents.\\" I never knew perfume, cologne and products that have \\"fragrance\\" in them contain deadly carcinogens (in fact, the very same ones found in tobacco smoke). This book contains convincing and legitimate scientific and medical data confirming that fragrance chemicals are also composed of neurotoxins and teratogens (which cause birth defects).I also was educated as to why so many people have asthma, RADS and migraine headaches.The unequivocal evidence presented in this book reveals the fragrance industry has been testing its chemical products on US -- the unsuspecting consumer -- and, despite the industry's mass fortune, the results of their \\"roll of the dice\\" have been debilitating illness, disability and death to millions of innocent, unaware people. The fragrance industry has violated every federal law, including the Toxic Substances Control Act, and, as usual, our government has done NOTHING to protect the public.Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in one day because it captured my attention 100%. Immediately after reading this book, I threw away every bottle of perfume and all products that had \\"fragrance\\" listed on the label. Folks, we're talking about pure POISON -- far worse than pesticides -- and we're putting it right on our skin which makes it go directly into our bloodstream, and then we are forced to inhale it in the same manner as second-hand smoke. At least tobacco smoke can be avoided in the majority of public places, but perfume vapors are ubiquitous and completely unavoidable, especially in places where they should be banned, such as hospitals and medical facilities.I encourage every woman and man to read this book in order to protect your health and that of your children and loved ones, then share it with everyone you know who wears fragrances. After reading this book, I guarantee you will be OUTRAGED ... Contact your local and state representatives and, most importantly, the FDA and DEMAND that the FDA punish this unscrupulous industry for its heinous crimes against mankind.

If you'd like to know the truth about how dangerous perfume is, I highly recommend this book! After reading this book, it makes me think laws need to be passed to make public places &quot;fragrance free&quot; to protect the health of all of us, and especially children whose immune systems are especially vulnerable to the toxic chemicals found in fragrances. The info. in this book could save you from experiencing health problems down the road.

Gresham Machen's \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" was first written in 1923, it's still a relevant and important analysis of liberal Christianity. Machen writes with great clarity and as one who engaged with liberal Christianity (or \\"Liberalism\\") in his own denomination (Presbyterian). In fact, he was one of the leading defenders of orthodox Christianity in the early 20th century. \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" remains an excellent introduction to the crucial differences between orthodox Christianity and liberal Christianity. It's a book I still recommend to readers.In his Introduction, Machen diagnoses liberal Christianity as not an alternative form of Christianity but as a different religion than Christianity. By showing what Christianity is not, he desires to show in \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" what Christianity is. In the remainder of the book Machen supports his thesis about the nature of liberal Christianity in 6 chapters.In Chapter 2 on \\"Doctrine,\\" Machen addresses the fact that Christianity is a doctrine. This is in contrast to Liberalism which asserts that Christianity is a life but not a doctrine with certain required beliefs. Not so, says Machen, and he capably demonstrates his point from the Bible and the early Church. In Chapter 3 Machen deals with \\"God and Man.\\" Liberalism believes in a God without a moral quality and a God who is not truly transcendent. This in contrast to the orthodox and biblical view where there is a sharp distinction between God and man. The heart of Liberalism, Machen argues, is that there is no such thing as sin.Machen continues to clearly differentiate Liberalism from Christianity in his remaining chapters. These deal with the Bible, Christ, Salvation, and the Church. In every case, Liberalism is found to have a different basis than Christianity. As you might expect, the Bible is not truly the Word of God in Liberalism, Christ is not truly God, and salvation is a light matter because sin does not really exist and man is basically good. Machen also offers some instructive observations about how Liberalism has, in the guise of orthodox Christianity, taken over seminaries and universities, a process that continues in the 21st century.If you've ever wondered why Christianity can seem so vastly different, not only between denominations but even within denominations or how someone can claim to be a Christian without holding any of the historic and Bible bases for Christianity, \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" will help you understand these issues. Regardless of your religious affiliation, \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" makes clear to its readers the critical differences between two very different approaches to religion: Christianity and Liberalism."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This devastating critique of liberalism is as relevant today as it was when Machen published it. Machen demonstrates why liberal Christianity is not really Christianity at all, because even though it utilizes much of the orthodox terminology, it completely reinterprets it! This book is a must read for any Christian, especially those in the mainline church who are struggling with the legacy of liberalism."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen's Christianity and Liberalism is rightly labeled \\"a classic.\\" Though the book was first published in 1923, its relevance has kept it in print for more than 80 years now. The upcoming challenges to evangelicalism virtually ensure that the book will continue to see popularity well into the next few decades.Machen breaks ground in Christianity and Liberalism by showing how the liberal, watered-down form of Christianity is actually another religion masquerading under the Christian label. One only needs to read a pluralist like John Hick today - a man who claims to be Christian and yet denies all of the major tenets of traditonal Christianity - to see that most of what Machen warns about is in fact true.Many terrific reviews of this landmark work have been written before. I will not summarize and critique the book in this space. Instead, I will offer a couple of Machen's points that bear repeating.Machen reminds us that Christianity is dependent upon history. Our faith does not rest in subjective feelings, important though they may be. We trust in a Savior who was raised bodily from the dead in history.Machen decries the pulpiteers who preach to \\"felt needs,\\" though he does not use this terminology. Machen's desire is for bold proclamation that strikes at the heart of our sin problem and then offers us the solution found only in the cross of Christ. In some ways, it seems his critique of preaching is more relevant today in evangelicalism than it was in the early part of the 20th century.Christianity and Liberalism deserves a place on every thinking Christian's shelf."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen clearly did not believe that theology must be changed or altered because of changes in society and/or scientific advancement. Other theologians believed that believed theology ought to change because of changes man perceives the world around him and discoveries about the past in how the bible came into being. These scholars proudly called themselves liberal. The author of this book presents arguments why orthodox believing theologians ought not view the liberal theologian as Christian but more like someone who belongs to another religious sect. He argues the Liberal Theologian does not believe in the depravity of man, man's need for salvation, and to be reconciled to his creator. The Liberal theologian uses scholarship to disprove and dismiss the bible as true. Through logic and philosophy, he dismisses the concept of an all powerful and all knowing Creator. Liberal theologians deny the supernatural therefore the concept of man who does miracles while he walks on this earth must be discredited. So these theologians deny the Jesus as described in the bible. Instead they try to piece together another kind of Jesus who is not God and cannot do miracles. These philosophers present Jesus as example of what a Christian should be.\\"Concealment and Pallistation\\"Terms used by Dr. Machen to describe the presentation of their theology to their parishioners. Do these liberal theologians openly present their ideas and concepts to members of the church they are trying to be hired. When he he is hired he says he consents to the creeds and doctrines of the church, but in fact he does not. Once hired he teaches another Gospel. He uses the same terms and/or phrases but he changes their meanings to fit his theology.The author discusses what it means to be a pluralistic tolerant society. Individuals have the right to believe or reject ideas of his choosing. He has the right to form associations based on his beliefs and ideas. These associations have a right to exclude those who do not agree with their ideas or purpose. A person has has an obligation to be forthright whether he agrees or disagrees with the ideas of the group or association. An organisation has the right to cast out members who through deception join said group.Thesis of this book argues that that Christianity and Liberalism are different and distinct religions. Those who proudly state they are liberal theologians have different idea of what God the Father and who Jesus is. The Father is carefree, He loves his whole creation, and is highly tolerant of diverse behavior. Jesus is God or at least has God in Him. He is the ultimate example of manhood and is a great philosopher. He died on the cross as an extreme example. Christianity therefore is completely altered into different thought pattern. The facts in history are completely changed. The supernatural acts of Jesus are denied. Man is no longer doomed for hell. There is no need for atonement. Man does not need to repent.

Machen is a good writer and had a keen mind. This is a book, not of theology, but of doctrines explained from a fundamentalist perspective. Machen believed that Christianity was a set of infallible \\"truths\\" based on \\"facts\\" that are gleaned from an inerrant Bible. One must accept these \\"truths\\" and that's how you get \\"saved.\\" Modernists are lost, of course, since they only want to to destroy Christianity. Machen is wrong on this point, and his arguments are convincing only to those already convinced because they, too, share his ideological worldview.

This book is basically repeating Martin Luther's positions which had been largely watered down over time. But if you aren't a Protestant, this book will just irritate you. I am not Christian myself but I admire traditional Christianity as represented by Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Those branches of Christianity which emphasized works have contributed a lot to the world. Within Protestantism, it was John Calvin who added works back, which Luther had removed. Calvin insisted on works as a sign of faith. This worked fine until the enlightenment undermined faith. The result is that virtually all of Protestantism is now the most liberal religion in the world. It is the extreme dependency on faith which make Protestantism unable to stand up to Liberalism. Orthodox Judaism and Islam, which aren't so dependent on faith, do not suffer from this problem.I only read the beginning of the book and then stopped because I couldn't tolerate the misinformation. The old Jerusalem Church most certainly did not share Paul's views. Paul was basically a renegade heretic of the Jerusalem Church, but he deserves credit anyway for his success in spreading Christianity. The New Testament contains both sides of the faith versus works issue with James and Jesus clearly being on the opposite side of Paul. Paul won but reasonable forms of Christianity recognize the importance of both works and faith and embrace all views expressed in the New Testament.For a very good overview of Christianity, including what went wrong with modern Protestantism, I recommendOrthodoxy and Heterodoxy: Exploring Belief Systems through the Lens of the Ancient Christian Faith."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This was recommended by a learned professor on the Glenn Beck show, so it must be the truth.

I could also cite how Russell thought Calvinism was a &quot;gloomy creed,&quot; which is something I can say that is not true of the liberal PCUSA!

GreshamMachen's Christianity and Liberalism. Machen's classic was written in theheight of the battle for control over the Presbyterian Church USA (the mostprominent of the \\"mainline denominations\\"), and defines with brilliance thebattle lines between liberal (so-called) Christianity and the orthodoxfaith. Moreover, it points out exactly what is at stake: the true faith, asopposed to a perverse shadow of that faith, a shadow based on subjectivismwhich elevates man's sovereignty over God's and ends in believing nothing atall.It is important to understand that the liberalism Machen castigates is notpolitical but theological (although many if not most of the liberals of thelatter camp fell also in the former, numerous prominent political liberals-- such as three-time Democrat Presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan-- fought alongside Machen). This theological liberalism manifests itself inmany ways, but is chiefly characterized by a rejection of Scripture asinfallibly inspired, a denial of the doctrines of the Fall and of Hell, anda belief in man's evolutionary self-perfection (process theology, withprogress guided by an \\"enlightened\\" elite). Machen correctly asserts thatthis is not merely a different approach to the Gospel, but is in fact adifferent gospel: an exchange of God's sovereignty for man's, God's law-wordfor man's, God's eternal, unchanging standards for man's evolving, situationethics. For this reason, Machen contends that liberalism and Christianityare separate things: rival religions, permanently at war.The one problem with this book (a fault which made good rhetorical sense atthe time, but which is somewhat misleading concerning the true nature of thestruggle) is Machen's choice of categories. Machen deals with theologicalconservatives and liberals (legitimate in terms of the Bible's own dichotomybetween saved and lost), but misses the inescapable fact that there was athird faction at work in the church (a fact which eventually resulted in hisdefrocking). That third faction was the great mushy evanjellyfish middle, apietistic/mystical majority which was neither willing to accept the liberalposition nor fight for the conservative cause. As Machen had rightly pointedout two years earlier in his address to incoming students at Princeton (andagain, much later, in the last two years of the struggle), these were theChristians who said \\"'Peace, peace', when there was no peace\\", and elevatedthat \\"peace\\" over truth. As in all other endeavors, \\"peace at any price\\"resulted in defeat, and in the end, it was that great mushy middle whichdelivered the PCUSA to the left (and over the cliff).Even so, it is important to note when examining this struggle that theconservatives largely threw the game away. I strongly recommend North'sCrossed Fingers, the only definitive history of this fight and a masterfulanalysis of the tactics and mistakes of both sides.Yet at the end of the day, you must read Machen. This book is vital forChristians defending their churches and denominations against increasingliberal encroachment, and indeed more so by the day. It is as groundbreakingas it is timeless."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Christianity and liberalism is perhaps the best-known book length treatise against early 20th century theological liberalism in America. It was published as the famous \\"Fundamentalist-Modernist\\" controversy was heating up, and has since been one of the clearest contrasting descriptions of the heart of the difference between modernist liberal Christianity and historical Christian orthodoxy.The major thesis of the book is that Liberalism (modernist theology) and Christianity are diametrically opposed religions that unfortunately use the same language to describe their opposite views of things. He states, \\"the great redemptive religion which has always been known as Christianity is battling against a totally diverse type of religious belief, which is only more destructive of the Christian faith because it makes use of Christian terminology.\\" Later he states in his thesis, \\"...we shall be interested in showing that despite the liberal use of traditional phraseology modern liberalism is not only a different religion from Christianity, but belongs to a totally different class of religions.\\"Machen is interested not in necessarily proving that Liberalism is wrong as he is in explaining that it is not Christian. His burden is not to disprove the tenants of Liberalism (although he speaks some to that end), but to simply describe each clearly and make obvious the huge divergence of thinking in the two groups.Although Machen is perhaps \\"the\\" great Fundamentalists, on must keep in mind this was before Fundamentalist meant: narrow, reactionary, separatist, nationalistic, literalist, ignorant, and the like. Whether or not those descriptions have ever been fair of Fundamentalism, if one presently maintains those stereotypes the honest maintenance of them requires not reading this volume. In 1923 Fundamentalist simply meant one not willing to relinquish the fundamental tenants of Christianity. In fact Machen's overwhelming descriptive word of self identification is \\"evangelical\\"- another word quickly loosing its meaning.In terms of the place of this book now, I consider it utterly contemporary. The fact that it is more than 80 years old and still so incisive simply reveals the depth of understanding Machen had.I would then wholeheartedly recommend the book for three reasons:1. It is an important document in understanding the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy of American Christianity which is still being fought everywhere.2. It is among the best and most direct contrast of two very different views of what the Christian faith is.3. It is a scholarly and thoughtful work written in the proper spirit of Christian disagreement. I was moved by Machen's clear desire to stand directly and forcefully against what he saw to be the greatest danger to the church he loved so much and yet to do so with a great deal of humble restraint. This book should be read as an example of Machen's vision of what the doctrinal \\"fights\\" over liberalism should have looked like. His excellence in merging orthodoxy with erudition with crystal clear argumentation creates an example of Christian polemical writing that is not often surpassed.Finally, due to the permutations in liberalism and its incorporation of postmodern language and categories I think this book is all the more critical for contemporary Christians. It's hard to properly enter a conversation, or fight, that is a century old without knowing something about how it got going."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen's magnum opus, Christianity &amp; Liberalism, is a book that everyone concerned about the demise of American Christianity should read. At first one might not find the title of his book all that striking, but in its day (1923), it had a little more punch. Machen was trying to show that Christianity and liberalism were two separate plans of salvation, two separate faiths--in short, two entirely different religious systems. In his day, it was thought that liberalism was a fresh new approach to Christianity, a way of practicing the faith in the modern context. But in Machen's thinking, however, liberalism had &quot;relinquished everything distinctive of Christianity, so that what remains is in essentials only that same indefinite type of religious aspiration which was in the world before Christianity came upon the scene.&quot; Machen set out therefore to bring all the issues out into the open and make clear-cut distinctions between the two faiths: &quot;What that message is can be made clear, as is the case with all definition, only by way of exclusion, by way of contrast.&quot; But this approach wasn't always well received:\\"Presenting an issue sharply is indeed by no means a popular business at the present time....Clear-cut definition of terms in religious matters, bold facing of the logical implications of religious views, is by many persons regarded as an impious proceeding...But with such persons we cannot possibly bring ourselves to agree. Light may seem at times to be an impertinent intruder, but it is always beneficial in the end. The type of religion which rejoices in the pious sound of traditional phrases, regardless of their meanings, or shrinks from &quot;controversial&quot; matters, will never stand amid the shocks of life. In the sphere of religion, as in other spheres, the things about which men are agreed are apt to be the things that are least worth holding; the really important things are the things about which men will fight.\\"Machen was an extremely clear writer! and thinker. His insight with regard to the battle of orthodox Christianity in the liberal context of the 20's is of tremendous relevance for modern Christians of all stripes concerned about the loss of substance, meaning, theology, etc, in the contemporary church. After reading Christianity &amp; Liberalism, you'll definately want to order his other classic, What Is Faith (1925)."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"The message of this famous classic of the Christian faith is more desperately needed in the 21st century than it was in the early 20th century. Since Machen wrote, the philosophical and theological trends that generated the issues he was addressing have become more firmly entrenched in the consciousness not only of the culture at large, but of evangelical Christianity in particular. The major thesis of this books is not that theological liberalism is bad, although Machen leaves little doubt of his opinion of it. Rather, the major thesis is that theologically liberal Christianity is not Christianity at all, and that toward every one of the most fundamental teachings of historic Christianity, theological liberalism takes an antithetical stance. These fundamental teachings are expounded in seven brief chapters, covering an introduction, doctrine in general, God & man, the Bible, the person of Jesus Christ, salvation, and the church.The position of the liberal church toward doctrine is that Christianity should be an undogmatic religion, unconcerned with theological subtleties. Christianity should be a life, not a system of doctrine. Certainly at this point, liberalism could not possibly be more firmly allied with contemporary mainstream evangelicalism. Anti-doctrinalism goes hand in hand with the two most pervasive philosophical currents of our age, postmodernism with its radical relativism, and existentialism, with its radical subjectivism and distrust of objective systems in general. Machen shows that the religion of both the apostle Paul and Jesus Christ himself was as dogmatic as possible. For example, even in the Sermon on the Mount, a favorite passage among theological liberals, \\"Jesus represents Himself as seated on the judgment seat of all the earth . . . Could anything be further removed than such a Jesus from the humble teacher of righteousness appealed to by modern liberalism?\\"Concerning God and Man, Machen emphasizes the liberal tendency to break down the separateness between God and Man and to take an optimistic view of human goodness. One of the most penetrating insights in the book is that \\"modern liberalism, even when it is not consistently pantheistic, is at any rate pantheizing.\\" This is in opposition to the orthodox teaching of the absoluteness of the Creator-creature distinction, and also of the absolute moral gulf between God and Man as a result of sin, hopelessly unbridgeable apart from the work of Jesus Christ.Related to the aversion of liberalism to doctrine, or an objective summary of truth, is a corresponding mistrust of the Bible, and the rejection of the Bible's authority as God's Word. Liberalism claims to replace the authority of the Bible with the authority of Jesus Himself, but having rejected the teachings of Jesus in the Bible and through the apostles, this authority amounts to nothing more than the authority of personally selected isolated instances of Jesus' words, interpreted to conform to the liberal religion.In the person of Jesus Christ, liberalism sees an example for faith, but not an object of faith. This is because the driving principle of liberalism, anti-supernaturalism, cannot admit the historical teaching of who Jesus Christ really was. For liberalism \\"Jesus differs from the rest of men only in degree, and not in kind: He can be divine only if all men are divine.\\"Concerning salvation, liberalism sees the source of salvation in man; Christianity sees it in God. Machen also shows that what distinguished early Christianity from the pagan religions of the time was specifically its exclusiveness. Paganism, like modern liberalism, had no problem with many roads to God and many gods, but it has a very deep problem with the exclusivity of Christianity. Finally, the very concept of salvation in Christianity is concerned with heaven, or the future world and life, while modern liberalism is concerned only with this world. This is in my estimation the area in which the majority of Reformed Christians have in fact followed liberalism, specifically with the contemporary preoccupation with cultural transformation as the means to institute God's kingdom on this earth. This is precisely the idea that unambiguously characterizes unbelieving thought, from the rebellious nation of Israel, through the Pharisees, and into the Enlightenment and modern liberalism. Until the European Enlightenment, the true church had consistently affirmed that the world is not our home.The final chapter on the church is where we have the best glimpse of Machen himself. What Machen could not understand was that if liberalism was so clearly another religion, why it insisted on calling itself Christianity. As far as he was concerned, this was just plain dishonesty. It is in this chapter that he says that he has no problem with liberalism establishing itself as a separate religion competing with Christianity. But calling itself Christianity when it was clearly not, spreading its non-Christian teachings to Christians, and with liberal ministers taking ordination vows to historic confessions of faith which could not possibly be sincere, this was the liberalism against which Machen fought for his whole life, a battle which in the mainline Presbyterian church he ultimately lost. This book clearly and powerfully sets forth what was at stake in the battle, which was and remains nothing other than Christianity itself. The book is well worth reading for all Christians who are committed to their faith. It is not a difficult book to read, and the fundamental issues have changed very little in one hundred years."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"There are a great many books one can read explaining traditional Christian theology, but if you are looking for a book that explains why traditional doctrine matters, then there is no better place to start than this gem by J. Gresham Machen, published in 1923.Machen, then professor at Princeton Seminary, was writing at a time when liberalism was making headway into traditional Protestant churches. This liberalism denied the historical accuracy of the Scriptures and the Divinity of Christ, among other things. Of course, it did that while at the same time saying that it &quot;really&quot; believed these things, but just expressed in a different way. Machen exposes the agenda of liberalism quite brilliantly.What is funny is that this liberalism isn't much different than that advocated today. For example, Machen said that it tended toward pantheism. &quot;In modern liberalism, on the other hand, this sharp distinction between God and the world is broken down, and the name \`God' is applied to the mighty world process itself. . . . It is strange how such a representation can be regarded as anything new, for as a matter of fact, pantheism is a very ancient phenomenon.&quot; [p. 63.] This was years before &quot;process theology&quot; became the vogue.A particularly interesting part of this work are Machen's political insights. He saw clearly the dangers of democratic conformism and brilliantly applied it to contemporary trends to exalt public education. &quot;The truth is that the materialistic paternalism . . . if allowed to go unchecked, will rapidly make of America one huge \`Main Street,' where spiritual adventure will be discouraged and democracy will be regarded as consisting in the reduction of all mankind to the proportions of the narrowest and least gifted of the citizens.&quot; [pp. 14-15.]"},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This is one of the first books I have read out of college and graduate school. What Machen does is establish a definitive difference between the liberal and Christian movements. That demarcation is well articulated. He talks about some of the centerpieces of Christian faith and how these cornerstones are actually undermined (\\"deconstructed\\")by liberalism and then reconstructed to cater to a new set of philosophical and theological presuppositions.I would like to reiterate an earlier reviewer who noted that Machen is not trying to critique liberalism, but rather to show that it is a movement quite significantly different in almost every way from Christianity. Now if liberalism cannot survive except in fringes outside of its usage, or even usurpation, of Christian imagery; then that in itself is telling. However, Machen's primary task is one of definition: What is a liberal? What is a Christian? Given the connotations, denotations, and intensions of each definition, Machen concludes that \\"liberal\\" and \\"Christian\\" are two different entities.I admit my analogies stink, but let me put it another way. If you define a duck as something that goes \\"moo,\\" you must fundamentally change the nature of the object perceived. This is basically the philosophical idea of correspondence; namely that our definition is only as good as it actually represents the thing defined. Perhaps if enough people began thinking this way (that a duck makes the moo sound), it could become so. That's really more of a Wittgenstein thing, anyway. The hope of many liberals is to make Christianity something it has not been and maintain that change long enough so that the very definition of the faith changes. In my heart of hearts, I and perhaps Machen, want to believe they are doing this for the good of the faith. Even with the best of intentions, however, liberalism is still an attempt of some to reconstruct or revise Christianity, to customize it to their own ideological palates.Some of the book actually makes predictions that are becoming truer of the cultural climate in the U.S. today, including that the Christian character of seminary/divinity education is fading to make way for a more Unitarian way of thinking. Doctrines on salvation, the church, Jesus, and God that were indispensable to historical Christianity are being replaced by more \\"digestable\\" theologies.If you are a Christian, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"If you are looking for a book to recommend for someone searching to make sense out of the malaise of the modern (or, post-modern) church, Machen's book is an excellent choice. As was pointed out in other reviews, Christian liberalism is not Christian at all, but is rather a non-Christian religion with Christian tags. Specifically, he highlights liberal beliefs regarding the major doctrines related to God, man, Christ, salvation, and the church. He then refutes these by demonstrating the orthodox Biblical view on each.For those confused on the nature of faith and salvation, Machen, in chapter VI, makes one of the clearest presentations I have read anywhere. That alone is worth the purchase.This book is very readable and a 20th century classic on the orthodox Protestant faith. Any basic library should stock it."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Machen looks at 6 key biblical doctrines and shows how liberalism differs from biblical Christianity at each point. Reading what liberals were saying in 1923 about the deity of Christ and the atonement of Christ is frighteningly similar to some of the theology that is coming out of mainline Protestantism today. And Machen does a stellar job at debunking the myth that Christ died for us as a moral example rather than as the substitutionary lamb of God for our sins."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"A Christian modern classic, this book is just as relevant today as when it was first written. Machen (1881-1937) took a conservative (biblical-truth) stand at Princeton Seminary opposing the downward slide caused by recent-man-developed principles that were replacing long-held Christian principles based on the literal meaning of biblical texts.The relatively short book thoughtfully focuses on the definitions (biblical vs. modern alternate-definitions) of key biblical concepts such as the Person of Jesus and salvation. Machen's engaging arguments and presentations are all sound; though perhaps a bit harder to understand without a good high school education."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"There are certain men that the Lord Jesus Christ has raised-up for teaching beyond their generation. Knowingly or not, they saw well beyond their years and circumstances. They understood the Bible and the world well enough to see clearly beyond the horizon of their own time in history. One such man is J. Gresham Machen. His book Christianity and Liberalism is a book that is as poignant and relevant today as when it was first published. Written to expose how the battle of Modernism vs. Fundamentalism in the early 1900's was not merely an intramural struggle between Christians of different doctrinal persuasions. Rather, the struggle was between two separate and antithetical religions (Biblical Christianity vs. Liberalism) that while sharing a religious language and forms have absolutely nothing in common. Machen writes concerning Christianity and Liberalism these words,\\"In my little book, Christianity and Liberalism, I tried to show that the issue in the Church of the present day is not between two varieties of the same religion, but, at bottom, between two essentially different types of thought and life. There is much interlocking of the branches, but the two tendencies, Modernism and supernaturalism, or (otherwise designated) non-doctrinal religion and historic Christianity, spring from different roots. In particular, I tried to show that Christianity is not a \\"life,\\" as distinguished from a doctrine, and not a life that has doctrine as its changing symbolic expression, but that-exactly the other way around-it is a life founded on a doctrine.\\"For Machen, under the moniker \\"the church\\" there were two completely different religions. In the same denomination, even in the same congregation there were worshippers of two entirely separate but not equal religions. Though they both spoke of God, Christ, salvation, church, heaven, and hell, what they meant by these things were irreconcilably different. One spoke of a man-centered religion that calls man to be as moral and he can, while the other is a Christ-centered religion that saves man from God's wrath because he cannot be as moral as he should.What makes this book so significant is that it sounds hauntingly familar to today's Christian church. Is today's Evangelical church the step-daughter of early 20th century liberalism? Read and decided for yourself as Machen defines how the Christ denying liberals of his day defined Christ, sin, salvation, Bible and a host of other doctrines. It will sound amazingly simular. Though an easy book to read and understand, it is not for the faint of heart. If I could get today's pastors and lay church goers to read only one book this year - this would be it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Today, when most Americans consider the word \\"liberalism\\", we think of a political philosophy or party. In the late 19th and into the early 20th century, however, there was a movement within the Protestant church known as Liberalism. While this religious movement does have some commonalities with political liberalism (a basic belief in man's goodness and a strong humanitarian ethic, for instance), in their particulars they are really two very different things. It is religious Liberalism which Machen addresses in this book, which was written in 1923.The main thrust of the Protestant Liberalism movement was a supposed focus on the work and teaching of Jesus, without holding to any dogmatic theological distinctions. In other words, liberals believed that Jesus was the highest moral example for men to follow, and that we should do what he did: Care for the poor, promote peace, and preach a message of love. Doing these things, says the liberal, promotes the betterment of society, but does not require any belief in the supernatural. The Bible is treated as a moral guidebook, but is not the inerrant Word of God. The Biblical claims of Jesus' virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, and bodily resurrection from the dead are regarded with skepticism, but are ultimately seen as unimportant relative to the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Machen's main premise is that Liberalism is completely antithetical to Christianity. He then proceeds to lay out an incredible defense of orthodox Protestantism, comparing it at each point with the Liberalism that had gained so much popularity in the churches of that time.He begins the discussion with an overview of why doctrine is so important, and why inerrancy is non-negotiable to anyone who claims to be a Christian. After all, if the Bible is not true, we have no basis for believing anything about Jesus. If it is true, then we must believe everything it says about Him. Furthermore, the liberal's claim to hold only to Jesus' words and deeds is inconsistent with their denial of the supernatural, because Jesus made several indisputable claims to deity (as well as to the authority of Scripture). Essentially, Machen is making C.S. Lewis' trilemma argument (\\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord\\") twenty years before the publication of Mere Christianity.Machen then contrasts Christianity and Liberalism in the areas of several doctrines critical to Christian belief:* Our understanding of who God is* Man's relationship with God and standing before Him* The person and work of Christ* What salvation is and the means by which man may attain it* The role of the ChurchBecause the liberal teaching in these areas is mutually exclusive with the traditional, orthodox positions held by the Church for nearly 2,000 years (and, more importantly, given to us in God's Word), Machen proposes that, for the sake of intellectual honesty, liberals ought to stop referring to themselves as \\"Christians\\", and instead join or create a different religious sect that more closely aligns with their beliefs. The Christian Church was founded on certain principles, and it is dishonest to represent the Church when one does not hold to those principles.The reasons liberals are unwilling to make such a break from the Christian Church are many, but one of the primary motivations is a desire to gain control of the considerable resources of evangelical churches and use them for the advancement of liberal aims. Machen issues a call for conservative Christians to uphold the Truth of the real Gospel and to stand up against the advancement of Liberalism in the Church. This is done in four ways: (1) Encouraging those evangelists and apologists who are engaged in the intellectual and spiritual struggle; (2) set a higher standard of qualifications of candidates for ministry; (3) preach the Cross of Christ at all times, to all people, in all situations; and (4) bring about a renewal of Christian education, beginning in the home.This book is possibly even more relevant now than it was in 1923. If it weren't for the language used, one wouldn't know this wasn't written last week. Liberalism is alive and well in the Church today, though it goes by many other names now. Modernism has given way to postmodernism, but the struggle is still the same. Satan has no need to introduce new lies when the old ones are working better than ever. Read it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This is an amazing book that precisely outlines the basis of attacks that liberalism makes on Christianity, including the most subtle.

I was expecting an academic argument, but this book was a page-turner and I couldn't put it down. Machen pours his soul out to demonstrate that without the facts of the gospel (Jesus' death and resurrection) and doctrine interpreting those facts (He died for me), there is no such thing as Christianity. It doesn't matter whether we admire a historical figure named Jesus, whether we try to follow his teachings or believe in His \\"love,\\" -- those elements do not Christianity make. It is only a bloody Cross with a dying Savior that reconciles the sinner to God and can bring peace to the troubled conscience. Machen cannot tolerate liberal ministers who claim to love people but offer no remedy for the dreadful problem of sin and guilt, who offer no miraculous Savior to save them. His heart is on fire with the love of Christ and he uses stellar rhetoric in argument upon argument to show how so-called liberal Christianity is -- No Christianity at all.Written in 1923, it addressed issues slightly different than we have today, and yet is still highly relevant. Conservative churches today aren't officially denying the cross, but it has become a peripheral issue that get's mentioned for purposes of \\"getting saved\\" but then is ignored. I have been languishing in such a church and just recently moved to an Orthodox Presbyterian Church (founded by Machen) where the Gospel of Christ is central in everything that is said and done. It has brought real spiritual healing to hear the Good News of what Christ has done.

Machen was a staunch defender of Christian orthodoxy. He was alarmed at the departure from essential tenets of the faith by liberal theologians. His insights were prescient in that he predicted the dire consequences that would result from attempts to reinvent Christianity.Machen did a great job of identifying the fault lines that would widen the gulf between the conservative and liberal wings of Christian denominations. His focus was on the developments in theological academia during the Progressive Era of American history. Several universities and seminaries allowed heretical teachings to flourish in their midst during the period.

Gresham Machen, the founder of Orthodox Presbyterian denomination, also succinctly summarizes the fundamentals of Christian beliefs, and thus fulfilling his goal to show what Christianity is after showing what it is not (p.16). By fundamentals I do not mean to include subjects like eschatology, continuity of extraordinary gifts and the means of baptism and who should be baptized though it is not to say they are unimportant. The fundamentals cover the views of God and man, the Bible, Christ, salvation and the church. This is why this small-yet-loaded book could also serve as a systematic theology text in a nutshell. The gospel may seem to have become so very familiar to some that we are prone to think there is no need for reminder or refreshment of what it is. But looking at today's pluralism and globalization almost everywhere in which there are so many different beliefs and so many different denominations including the garden variety of non-denominational churches, it is not an option that every Christian; laymen, ministers and missionaries rightly understand what the gospel is and what its underlying doctrinal truths are. The reason I include missionaries here is because liberal theology is not only a threat in the west, but also has become a global threat considering it has gained ground in Africa and Asia as well, so it is important for them to understand its nature and to be able to defend orthodox Christianity against its assaults. Here it is important to distinguish between the necessity \\"to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints\\" as Jude 3 commands where matters that concern eternal life and death are at stake, and getting into foolish unnecessary squabbles; picking fights over disagreements on minor subjects elevated to an unbalanced exaggerated importance such as Psalm-singing only in the Christian worship that the apostle Paul actually warns against (Titus 3:9). Prof. Machen rightly only deals with the former; the subjects that truly matter; \\"things that are sometimes thought to be the hardest to defend are also the things that are most worth defending,\\" (p.8).The major issue with liberal theology is its abhorrence to doctrines (p.18). Doctrines divide and therefore, \\"Forget doctrines, can't we just get along?\\" This presupposition understandably leads to an erroneous view, abusive interpretations, criticisms and denial of the authority of the Bible that inevitably result in erroneous views about God, man, Christ, salvation and the church. On the other hand, it puts a premium on human experience, where facts must be based on experience, not the other way around. Moreover, among many other contra-biblical views, the gospel is viewed as a merely way of life where it seems that the general theme of the liberal gospel centers around the Sermon on the Mount, not the cross. It is an interesting yet sadly a false view on the cross where liberal theology teaches as chiefly an example of self-sacrifice or anything else but atonement for sins; that Jesus Christ is an example of faith, not the object of faith (p.113). But these principles directly contradict Christianity. Machen gives an excellent basis of the non-negotiable nature of the cardinal doctrines in the gospel when he brings up Gal 1:8 where the apostle Paul severely warns everyone against preaching a different gospel. And here is where he made it clear early in the book that what the liberal theology teaches is indeed a different gospel which is no gospel at all. Then he moves on with what the true gospel is. The gospel is an event and the Person who is at the center of that event, namely, the crucifixion and resurrection of the God-Man Jesus Christ, as well as the meaning and message of the event. These set forth the basis of the discussion on other subjects in the book; the views on the Bible, God and man, Christ, and salvation. The meaning of the cross teaches that there is a holy God who must punish sinners for their sins and therefore, there is such a reality as sin and that it is the very thing that separates man from God. The message of the cross is that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners (1 Tim 1:15) by what he did on the cross, which constitutes a promise that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life (the familiar John 3:16 passage). Here is a humble, robust, and succinct apology of orthodox Christianity Machen presents that I believe is done in the spirit of 1 Pet 3:15-16 which I appreciate greatly and have much to learn from. Walter Lippman puts it this way, that this book is \\"a cool and stringent defense of orthodox Protestanism.\\""},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Machen's book, Christianity and Liberalism, is a power-packed defense of classic Christian orthodoxy. Written in 1923, the book is perhaps more relevant now than when it was originally written, since the fruit of theological liberalism is seen more fully in our day through many mainline denominations, as well as some (but not all) seeker-sensitive and emergent expressions. Even traditional, theologically conservative churches have not been unaffected, for the cultural drift toward theological liberalism has left the traditional church uncertain and hesitant to earnestly defend the faith.In the introduction, Machen sets up the problem by arguing that liberalism is really allegiance to naturalism rather than God. He then moves on in the remarkable second chapter on Doctrine, to argue that liberalism undercuts both the historical and personal foundations of Christian faith by its imprecision and vague appeals to general principles like the brotherhood of man.In chapter 3 Machen contends that liberalism misinterprets the gospel because it misunderstands the doctrines of God and man.Chapter 4 makes the case that Christianity is based on the special revelation of God, the Bible, while liberalism is a man-based religion, based on feelings or notions or a generally accepted consensus about what is right.Chapters 5 and 6 are brilliant defenses of historic Christian beliefs about Christ and Salvation respectively.Chapter 7 concludes the book with application of Christianity in the Church.This is just an overview and could never do justice to the depth of Machen's work. I know of no better place to go to find a robust defense of biblical faith and a careful analysis of the shaky foundations of theological liberalism."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This book was a wonderful read! I quickly read this book over 4 days. I found this book so interesting because I have witnessed in the Southern Baptist Convention the battle over the influence of liberalism among its churches and seminaries. Liberal and self-described \\"moderates\\" are gaining a hearing among otherwise conservative churches by using the same doubletalk and redefinition of terms.As with all false doctrine, Christians must be so familiar with the Truth, that the counterfeit is seen for what it is. Likewise, Machen says, \\"...by showing what Christianity is not we hope to be able to show what Christianity is, in order that men may be led to turn from the weak and beggarly elements and have recourse again to the grace of God.\\" (pg 16)A. Regarding DOCTRINE...LIBERALISM believes: Certain doctrines, such as miracles, the Atonement, and heaven and hell are unimportant. Much more important are the ethical implications of Jesus as an example of right living. (pg 37)CHRISTIANITY believes: We cannot \\"attend to the Person of Jesus of Jesus and neglect the message.\\" Pg 43). The message is that \\"which makes Him ours.\\" (pg 42)B. Regarding GOD AND MAN...LIBERALISM believes: There is really no such thing as sin. Instead, there is a \\"supreme confidence in human goodness.\\" (pg 64)CHRISTIANITY believes: There must be an consciousness of Sin for true salvation. \\"Without the consciousness of sin, the whole of the gospel will seem to be an idle tale.\\" (pg 66).C. Regarding THE BIBLE...LIBERALISM believes:1.) Salvation is based on an idea, not in an event [such as the resurrection] (pg 70-71)2.) Present experience is valued over scripture. (pg 71) You should not accept the words of portrayal of Jesus at face value. (pg 77) The authority of the bible is superseded by a self-invented \\"authority of Christ\\". A liberal says he \\"depends on Jesus alone\\" (pg 76).CHRISTIANITY believes:1.) salvation is dependent on \\"the narration of an event.\\" (pg 70)2.) Scripture is inspired of God and all accounts are true (pg 73)D. Regarding CHRIST...LIBERALISM believes:1.) Jesus is \\"an example for faith, not the object of faith\\" (pg 85) He is the mere \\"founder of Christianity\\" (pg 85) Machen says, \\"the modern liberal tries to have faith in God like the faith which he supposes Jesus had in God; but he does not have faith in Jesus.\\" (pg 85)2.) Jesus Himself is to be revered as the \\"fairest flower of humanity\\" (pg 96) He is only god in the sense that he is the \\"highest thing we know.\\" (pg 111) He differs from the \\"rest of men only in degree and not in kind.\\"(pg 112).3.) The resurrection of Christ, the virgin birth and other miracles are doubted (pg 104, 108). They try to separate the \\"historical\\" Jesus from the supernatural Jesus portrayed in the Gospels. (pg 107) Resurrection is redefined as \\"a permanence of the influence of Jesus or a mere spiritual existence of Jesus beyond the grave.\\" (Pg 108)CHRISTIANITY believes:1.) Jesus was no mere example for the life of faith. He claimed to be the object of faith (pg 86). He is the Savior.2.) Jesus is to be worshiped as the supernatural God (pg 96-97) Scripture fully attests to this fact (pg 113-114)3.) We should accept the Jesus as He is portrayed in the Scriptures. He was born of a virgin and was absolutely sinless. In His resurrection, he rose bodily proving the full acceptance of His sacrificial death.F. Regarding SALVATION...LIBERALISM believes:1.) Salvation is within a man (pg 117)2.) We should rehabilitate a man, such as a prisoner, by finding \\"good that is already in them and build upon that.\\" (pg 137)3.) Undogmatic faith should be valued and it makes no difference what is believed (pg 141)4.) Salvation is obtained \\"by our own obedience to the commands of Christ\\" (pg 143) On this point, Machen says this is nothing other than \\"a sublimated form of legalism\\" (pg 143) Lliberalism, which means freedom, is in reality nothing other than \\"wretched slavery.'\\" (pg 144). \\"Here is found the fundamental difference between liberalism and Christianity,\\" says Machen, \\"liberalism is altogether in the imperative mood, while Christianity begins with a triumphant indicative; liberalism appeals to man's will, while Chrstianity announces, first a gracious act of God.\\" (pg 47)5.) Religion is \\"thought to be necessary for a healthy community\\" (pg 151) (ie. pragmatism)6.) In practice, \\"God exists for the sake of man\\" (pg 154).7.) \\"...applied Christianity is all there is of Christianity.\\" (pg 155)CHRISTIANITY believes:1.) You find salvation \\"in an act of God.\\" (pg 117) \\"He is our Savior not because He inspired us to live the same kind of life that He lived, but because He took upon Himself the dreadful guilt of our sins and bore it instead of us on the cross.\\" (ie vicarious atonement) (pg 117)2.) Man is in need of a \\"new birth\\" or regeneration...or a \\"foreign good\\" that a man naturally does not posses (pg 138) (only that Christ possessed)3.) Faith is only as good as the object. Faith is receiving the gift of salvation in the cross of Christ.4.) Salvation is obtained by Justification by faith in the Gospel (Galatians) (pg 144).5.) \\"Christianity refuses to be regarded as a mere means to an end. \\"if any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother...he cannot be my disciple\\" (Luke 14:26).6.) \\"Man exists for the sake of God (pg 154).7.) \\"...Applied Christianity is the result of an initial act of God [in Justifying the sinner]\\" (pg 155)G. Regarding THE CHURCH...LIBERALISM believes: \\"...all men everywhere, no matter what their race or creed are brothers.\\" (pg 157)CHRISTIANITY believes: yes, there is a brotherhood of man but ONLY in the sense that all men are created by a Creator. Scripture declares that there is a true \\"brotherhood of the redeemed\\" (pg 158). Those who have been redeemed from sin.

I am continually amazed at how history repeats itself - particularly in the Christian realm. It seems as though the same issues in Church history keep coming up and this book illustrates the same phenomena.Machen's &quot;Christianity and Liberalism&quot; is as valid today as it was when it was written in the early twenties. Machen addresses the creeping in of liberalism into the Church and how on the surface, the differences don't seem so striking, but underneath liberalism makes itself out to be a completely different religion. Machen stresses the importance of doctrine for preserving the orthodox Christian faith while urging for unity without compromising the fundamentals.I highly recommend this book to anyone for the means of promoting awareness and discernment in these &quot;liberal&quot; times."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Before my pastor would write me a recommendation for me to enroll at Princeton Seminary he REQUIRED me to read this book.

If we wish to remain faithful to our Lord, we cannot allow paganism to infect the church and would do well to heed Machen's teaching and counsel."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Today, when most Americans consider the word \\"liberalism\\", we think of a political philosophy or party. In the late 19th and into the early 20th century, however, there was a movement within the Protestant church known as Liberalism. While this religious movement does have some commonalities with political liberalism (a basic belief in man's goodness and a strong humanitarian ethic, for instance), in their particulars they are really two very different things. It is religious Liberalism which Machen addresses in this book, which was written in 1923.The main thrust of the Protestant Liberalism movement was a supposed focus on the work and teaching of Jesus, without holding to any dogmatic theological distinctions. In other words, liberals believed that Jesus was the highest moral example for men to follow, and that we should do what he did: Care for the poor, promote peace, and preach a message of love. Doing these things, says the liberal, promotes the betterment of society, but does not require any belief in the supernatural. The Bible is treated as a moral guidebook, but is not the inerrant Word of God. The Biblical claims of Jesus' virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, and bodily resurrection from the dead are regarded with skepticism, but are ultimately seen as unimportant relative to the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Machen's main premise is that Liberalism is completely antithetical to Christianity. He then proceeds to lay out an incredible defense of orthodox Protestantism, comparing it at each point with the Liberalism that had gained so much popularity in the churches of that time.He begins the discussion with an overview of why doctrine is so important, and why inerrancy is non-negotiable to anyone who claims to be a Christian. After all, if the Bible is not true, we have no basis for believing anything about Jesus. If it is true, then we must believe everything it says about Him. Furthermore, the liberal's claim to hold only to Jesus' words and deeds is inconsistent with their denial of the supernatural, because Jesus made several indisputable claims to deity (as well as to the authority of Scripture). Essentially, Machen is making C.S. Lewis' trilemma argument (\\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord\\") twenty years before the publication of Mere Christianity.Machen then contrasts Christianity and Liberalism in the areas of several doctrines critical to Christian belief:* Our understanding of who God is* Man's relationship with God and standing before Him* The person and work of Christ* What salvation is and the means by which man may attain it* The role of the ChurchBecause the liberal teaching in these areas is mutually exclusive with the traditional, orthodox positions held by the Church for nearly 2,000 years (and, more importantly, given to us in God's Word), Machen proposes that, for the sake of intellectual honesty, liberals ought to stop referring to themselves as \\"Christians\\", and instead join or create a different religious sect that more closely aligns with their beliefs. The Christian Church was founded on certain principles, and it is dishonest to represent the Church when one does not hold to those principles.The reasons liberals are unwilling to make such a break from the Christian Church are many, but one of the primary motivations is a desire to gain control of the considerable resources of evangelical churches and use them for the advancement of liberal aims. Machen issues a call for conservative Christians to uphold the Truth of the real Gospel and to stand up against the advancement of Liberalism in the Church. This is done in four ways: (1) Encouraging those evangelists and apologists who are engaged in the intellectual and spiritual struggle; (2) set a higher standard of qualifications of candidates for ministry; (3) preach the Cross of Christ at all times, to all people, in all situations; and (4) bring about a renewal of Christian education, beginning in the home.This book is possibly even more relevant now than it was in 1923. If it weren't for the language used, one wouldn't know this wasn't written last week. Liberalism is alive and well in the Church today, though it goes by many other names now. Modernism has given way to postmodernism, but the struggle is still the same. Satan has no need to introduce new lies when the old ones are working better than ever. Read it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"The message of this famous classic of the Christian faith is more desperately needed in the 21st century than it was in the early 20th century. Since Machen wrote, the philosophical and theological trends that generated the issues he was addressing have become more firmly entrenched in the consciousness not only of the culture at large, but of evangelical Christianity in particular. The major thesis of this books is not that theological liberalism is bad, although Machen leaves little doubt of his opinion of it. Rather, the major thesis is that theologically liberal Christianity is not Christianity at all, and that toward every one of the most fundamental teachings of historic Christianity, theological liberalism takes an antithetical stance. These fundamental teachings are expounded in seven brief chapters, covering an introduction, doctrine in general, God & man, the Bible, the person of Jesus Christ, salvation, and the church.The position of the liberal church toward doctrine is that Christianity should be an undogmatic religion, unconcerned with theological subtleties. Christianity should be a life, not a system of doctrine. Certainly at this point, liberalism could not possibly be more firmly allied with contemporary mainstream evangelicalism. Anti-doctrinalism goes hand in hand with the two most pervasive philosophical currents of our age, postmodernism with its radical relativism, and existentialism, with its radical subjectivism and distrust of objective systems in general. Machen shows that the religion of both the apostle Paul and Jesus Christ himself was as dogmatic as possible. For example, even in the Sermon on the Mount, a favorite passage among theological liberals, \\"Jesus represents Himself as seated on the judgment seat of all the earth . . . Could anything be further removed than such a Jesus from the humble teacher of righteousness appealed to by modern liberalism?\\"Concerning God and Man, Machen emphasizes the liberal tendency to break down the separateness between God and Man and to take an optimistic view of human goodness. One of the most penetrating insights in the book is that \\"modern liberalism, even when it is not consistently pantheistic, is at any rate pantheizing.\\" This is in opposition to the orthodox teaching of the absoluteness of the Creator-creature distinction, and also of the absolute moral gulf between God and Man as a result of sin, hopelessly unbridgeable apart from the work of Jesus Christ.Related to the aversion of liberalism to doctrine, or an objective summary of truth, is a corresponding mistrust of the Bible, and the rejection of the Bible's authority as God's Word. Liberalism claims to replace the authority of the Bible with the authority of Jesus Himself, but having rejected the teachings of Jesus in the Bible and through the apostles, this authority amounts to nothing more than the authority of personally selected isolated instances of Jesus' words, interpreted to conform to the liberal religion.In the person of Jesus Christ, liberalism sees an example for faith, but not an object of faith. This is because the driving principle of liberalism, anti-supernaturalism, cannot admit the historical teaching of who Jesus Christ really was. For liberalism \\"Jesus differs from the rest of men only in degree, and not in kind: He can be divine only if all men are divine.\\"Concerning salvation, liberalism sees the source of salvation in man; Christianity sees it in God. Machen also shows that what distinguished early Christianity from the pagan religions of the time was specifically its exclusiveness. Paganism, like modern liberalism, had no problem with many roads to God and many gods, but it has a very deep problem with the exclusivity of Christianity. Finally, the very concept of salvation in Christianity is concerned with heaven, or the future world and life, while modern liberalism is concerned only with this world. This is in my estimation the area in which the majority of Reformed Christians have in fact followed liberalism, specifically with the contemporary preoccupation with cultural transformation as the means to institute God's kingdom on this earth. This is precisely the idea that unambiguously characterizes unbelieving thought, from the rebellious nation of Israel, through the Pharisees, and into the Enlightenment and modern liberalism. Until the European Enlightenment, the true church had consistently affirmed that the world is not our home.The final chapter on the church is where we have the best glimpse of Machen himself. What Machen could not understand was that if liberalism was so clearly another religion, why it insisted on calling itself Christianity. As far as he was concerned, this was just plain dishonesty. It is in this chapter that he says that he has no problem with liberalism establishing itself as a separate religion competing with Christianity. But calling itself Christianity when it was clearly not, spreading its non-Christian teachings to Christians, and with liberal ministers taking ordination vows to historic confessions of faith which could not possibly be sincere, this was the liberalism against which Machen fought for his whole life, a battle which in the mainline Presbyterian church he ultimately lost. This book clearly and powerfully sets forth what was at stake in the battle, which was and remains nothing other than Christianity itself. The book is well worth reading for all Christians who are committed to their faith. It is not a difficult book to read, and the fundamental issues have changed very little in one hundred years."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This book, while certainly brilliant, is one that I wish had never needed to be written. Further, it is a book that I wish would not need to be read today. Why? Because both the initial writing of the book as well as its sustained relevance represents an atrocious and constant backsliding on the part of many within the so-called body of Christ towards a religion that is indeed different than the historic Christian faith.Machen echoes what should be common knowledge among believers today, which is that many theological liberals have successfully coopted many buzzwords within Christianese, redefined them to suit their theological leanings, and made them their own to such a degree that it is quite amazing that many who sound quite Christian in their terminology are advocating such decidedly unChristian philosophies. Contemporary defenders of the Christian faith, if they could take just one thing away from this book, should carefully note the extensive detail Machen gives to emphasizing the need for clear definitions of terms so that everyone knows what meanings and concepts everyone else is applying to certain critical words. Often, the sharp theological and philosophical differences that many try to downplay become very stark and very clear quite early on once people are respectfully asked to explain what definitions and ideas they ascribe to certain terms. This approach is of critical need in our apologetic and defense today.Machen does a brilliant job of showing that theological liberalism, no matter how Christian it sounds, denies the essence of the Christian faith by denying the infallibility of the Bible, the deity of Christ, the sovereignty of God, the process of salvation, and the proper role of the Church. Such backslidden conditions are officially commonplace, unfortunately, in many of the mainline denominations. But such backslidden views are also becoming commonplace, albeit unofficially, among many Roman Catholics and evangelicals as well. I am convinced that these results are due in sufficient measure to the sometimes deliberate deemphasizing of theological fundamentals in many contemporary church pulpits today in an effort to present a more accessible faith to unbelievers. And while I don't have a problem with the latter by itself, I believe when this goal is supposedly achieved by backburnering the basic doctrines upon which the historic Christian faith stands or falls, we should not be surprised when we see otherwise faithful believers embracing concepts that the Bible clearly and repeatedly runs in opposition to.In summary, given the continued official theological drift of many of the mainline denominations, coupled with an alarming unofficial drift among many supposed theological conservatives, I believe that Machen's work, unfortunately, should be required reading for pastors, staffmembers, and adult education students in every church in America that wants to stay true to the historic faith and says it is committed to doing so. This book, in a concise way, clearly shines a light on the lines of demarkation between theological liberalism and conservatism. And in the process, successfully refutes the bankruptcy of the former and affirming the integrity of the latter. I wish the Church was in better shape and being more faithful to the God we claim to worship. But until that happens, I think Machen's work will continue to be relevant and sorely needed as a devastating rebuke of humanism dressed in Christian linguistics."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This work is fine example of the dichotomy that is Liberalism and Christianity. He boldly stands for truth and exposes \\"Liberal Christianity\\" for what it really is, a different religion. Machen exposes the divide as seen in six specific facets of faith: Doctrine, God and Man, The Bible, Christ, Salvation, and the Church. He keeps his word in writing \\"as sharply and clearly as possible\\" through every chapter, leaving the reader informed and able to differentiate between Orthodox Christianity and Liberalism. Machen's work should be read by anyone who considers themselves within the fold of God, especially those within the American Church. His words were relevant in his time, and they still ring true today. The Church is under attack, and the body must open its eyes and realize that the enemy is within."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This book remains the standard for the presentation of post-Fundamental Evangelicalism and how it differs from the liberalism and now post-liberalism of the 20th and 21st centuries. Machen is equal parts scholar and prophet as his critiques not only address the concerns of 1923 but he anticipates and repudiates developments of subsequent iterations of liberalism. His writing is engaging and clear, his arguments are tight and lucid, and his conclusions have stood the test of time. At times he may paint with too broad a brush, missing the nuances of various liberal positions, but on the whole, nearly every word of every sentence is devoted to clearly articulating and defending his thesis. This books should be required reading for every pastor, seminarian, and interested lay person. Whether you agree with his conclusions or not, Machen's concise yet taut exploration of the divergences between Christianity and liberalism frame the debate in such a way as to alleviate much of the current confusion and contention.The new foreword by Carl Trueman, while interesting, is really unnecessary. He gives a brief exposition of Machen's main thesis and the way in which he unpacks it through the book, but such an explanation is almost superfluous as Machen's argument is so clearly presented that it is almost impossible to misunderstand him. Overall, though, this book is a classic that should be read and reread by anyone engaged in ecumenical discussions."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Very readable and rather amazing that it wasn't written in the past 5 - 10 years. Obviously liberalism and Christianity have been at loggerheads for decades. I think the insight that I appreciate the most is the emphasis on honestly defining ones theological framework and terms. If you are redefining Christian theology, don't call yourself \\"Christian\\"; rather demonstrate enough integrity to call yourself something else. Just because you disagree with the major tenants of Christian doctrine doesn't mean you're any brighter or more insightful, necessarily, but it does mean you should call yourself something other than Christian."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"John Gresham Machen was Professor of New Testament at Princeton Theological Seminary in the early twentieth century. He, along with some other professors, resigned their posts after Princeton Seminary was reorganized in such a way that allowed theological liberalism to be taught. He felt that liberalism was a distinctly different religion than Christianity, and this book is an exposition of his views on this matter. He went on to found Westminster Theological Seminary in order to continue the propagation of the Reformed Faith as outlined in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which is the doctrinal standard that the original Princeton Theological Seminary was founded upon.Machen's prose is clear and easy to grasp. There are no big words that are designed to confuse the meaning of things. In fact, he wanted this book to set forth the issues as plainly as possible. He had too much integrity to blur the distinctions, which is a large part of why he was booted out of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. The book is brimming with integrity.His main point is that liberalism is an entirely different religion, in terms of what it teaches. He felt that it was fundamentally dishonest for clergy to say that they ascribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith, when in their hearts they disavowed the central doctrines of that document. He shows that liberalism is based on naturalism, and that Christianity is based on supernaturalism.He makes many good arguments, but two really stand out for this reviewer. First, liberalism denies the substitutionary atonement of Christ for his elect. It seems to me that to deny this doctrine is to deny the heart of the Christian theological system. Machen felt passionately about this issue. The second point he makes, that really makes sense to this reviewer, is the fact that liberalism came after Christianity. Therefore, it is incumbent upon those who hold to liberalism to leave the denomination and form a different church. Past generations had left money for the propagation of the faith grounded in the Westminster Confession of Faith. If there are clergy who don't believe that system of faith, then they should, as a matter of honesty and truth, admit that, and, leave to form another religious institution founded upon liberalism. Of course, history shows that the liberals won, and the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. has strayed from anything resembling a Christian church. That denomination seems to be little more than a theologically confused, humanistic social club. In point of fact, many churches that hold to the Westminster Confession of Faith left the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. at great cost.In summary, Professor Machen makes sound argument after sound argument for his position. His arguments are valid. Whether or not the God he believes in is real or not, is another matter entirely. While I no longer believe in the existence of the supernatural, I admire his integrity."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Thorough reviews have already been written so I'll be brief but it is amazing how relevant the topics covered by Machen still are today.

Interesting how the more things change the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen has bestowed to posterity one of the finest literary examinations of the Body of Christ's internal struggle for integrity and identity. &quot;Christianity and Liberalism&quot; brilliantly deciphers the codes and illusions of the latter while illuminating the Gospel Truth that so many in modern Protestantism have confined to the shade. Doubtless, your typical liberal sees nothing but naivite and obsolescence in Machen's little maserpiece, but more's the pity. Christianity is in fact an inherently conservative theology, a point which Machen proves over and over with lucidity and a calm but impassioned literary voice. This is so simply because Christianity is based upon certain obvious facts (in particular the blessed fact of the Resurrection)and the historical creeds that were produced by those facts. Liberalism, with its insistence upon a religion which owes nothing to fact but much to the vagaries of individual prejudice, can never replace the glory of the real thing. Even so, modern Protestantism and its so-called leaders seem all-too determined to drag the Gospel down to the lowest common denominator at any cost--and have succeeded to such a point that it's unlikely more than a handful of laymembers from an average congregation could even decipher Machen's prose style, let alone make a reasonable decision about whether or not to agree with his thesis. And yet Christianity survives, albeit with whatever scars, and the voices of men like Machen continue to sound the warning-trump. There have always those in the Church who want it to be something other than the Ark of Salvation that it is. Fortunately, the Church is and has always been bigger than its sins. The reality of the Gospel still works, and it will do so until the end of the age."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"Enough has been said about the content of this book that I won't go into that.

Yet, if you stripped away the references to particular events and cultural institutions of his day, you would have little problem imagining that he was writing in our current, postmodern context. The critical issues he faced as a conservative, confessional Christian during the days of the Modernist-Fundamentalist divide were largely the same issues faced by the church today. In fact, I personally found his writing to be more engaging than many contemporary authors I've read who share his views. While some will no doubt disagree, this was a book on Christianity and culture--my category for it--that kept me reading from start to finish with great interest.As several other people who've reviewed the book have no doubt covered the essential ground, I'll keep this review relatively brief. It's also been a few months since I finished reading it, so please forgive a few lapses in coverage!The overarching thesis in the book is that modernity presents us with two separate religions that call themselves Christianity. The one is orthodox Christianity, while the other is Liberalism. Machen highlights a variety of critical issues over which these two religions differ, and as mentioned previously, one could just as easily bring those issues forward to our day and see that they still stand. I'll note a couple here.Scripture: Machen argues that Christianity looks to the Bible as the authoritative and infallible source of spiritual revelation. Modernism rejects the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture, and elevates alternatively either scientific knowledge or personal religious experience.Atonement: Christianity, Machen says, looks to the blood of Jesus as a payment for a debt of sin and a satisfaction of the wrath of God. Liberalism rejects a substitutionary atonement as immoral, and rejects the idea that God exercises wrath towards mankind.Faith: Faith in Jesus is necessary for salvation and eternal life, according to Machen. Liberalism, however, denies that personal faith in Jesus is the only way to Heaven.We don't have to look far today, with the advent of postmodernism, the so-called Emergent Church, or simply mainline Protestant liberalism to see these same issues, merely articulated with slightly more finesse. Thus, for those of us who consider ourselves, and strive to be, orthodox Christians, Machen's book serves well to define the boundaries. It will focus us on battles that still remain important, while helping us to assess our own faith and practice to correct those areas where we've yielded more to the spirit of this age than to the Spirit of God."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen lays out in plain terms his defense of historic creedal Christianity against the liberalism he saw in the 1920s. This book is often harsh, and does not deal lightly with what the author sees as heresy. This book is certainly no nonsense and forces a person to make a decision either for or against theological liberalism in many places. Machen forces the liberal to admit their divergence from historic Christianity, from a historical Jesus, and from nearly all that the Church claims to hold dear. This book unlike most railings against one viewpoint or another covers its bases well, and any reader regardless of theological position will learn much about how to make arguments using scripture and history.This truly is a great work."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen's main burden in his book, Christianity and Liberalism, is to make a clear distinction between true Christianity and what had, by that time, been termed as liberalism. It was primarily within the context of the unparalleled advances in industry, technology, and science of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century that liberalism began to take form. Contrary to what some may believe today, liberalism did not begin as a bold-faced attempt to undermine Biblical Christianity; rather, it grew out of a growing need to address serious questions confronting Christianity at a time of such cultural upheaval and change: \\"What is the relation between Christianity and modern culture; may Christianity be maintained in a scientific age (6)?\\"Unfortunately, however, liberalism, in its attempt to \`rescue' the truths of Christianity in an age where the historical and scientific accounts in Scripture where being heavily questioned and disregarded, actually began to abandon those tenets of the faith that appeared to be in contradiction with modern science. Thus, liberal teachers sought to \\"rescue certain of the general principles of religion, of which these particularities are thought to be mere temporary symbols, and these general principles he regards as constituting the \`essence of Christianity'\\"(6). For example, if a bodily resurrection seemed incongruous with a modern understanding of science, then liberalism attempted to demonstrate that such teaching in Scripture, though perhaps not historically true, was symbolic of Christ's permanent influence or a \\"mere spiritual existence of Jesus beyond the grave\\" (108). As a result, Christianity could maintain its credence within the modern age, while at the same time preserving its religious form.Consequently, liberalism inserted new content into Christian language and in their endeavor to make Christianity more believable, actually turned away from the historic Christian faith. As such, liberalism, in Machen's mind, cannot be considered merely another denomination of Christianity, or even a weakened system of Christianity, but rather a whole other religion, altogether separate from Christianity.The need for a lucid demarcation between Biblical Christianity and liberalism is especially important because, as we have already observed, and as Machen substantiates throughout the rest of the book, liberalism makes use of traditional Christian language, yet the content of that language is vastly different than that of historic Christianity. Throughout the main body of the text, Machen deals with seven areas where liberalism has departed from historic Christianity: doctrine and its attendant importance in the life of God's people, God, man, the Bible, Christ, salvation, and the Church. In each section, he examines the subject matter by first accurately presenting the liberal position, and then by contrasting this teaching over against the historic Biblical position.This is a well-reasoned and powerful treatment of the differences between Christianity and Liberalism. And despite its age, this is a much needed book today. Some questions that we might ask are: is this kind of linguistic slight-of-hand occurring today? Where and in what form? Are there movements today that are, out of good intention, endeavoring to contextualize the gospel, yet are abandoning the faith that they are seeking to proclaim. How can we expose this? And when we do find fault, are we laboring to present the opposing views honestly and accurately so that Christ will not be discredited by our devious proliferation of the truth? I believe this book will help us correctly answer these inquires."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"This book is a terrific defense of Christian orthodoxy. It is amazing to see what Machen wrote 80 years ago is still true today. He calls liberalism another religion (which it is). What is interesting to note is that the Word-of-Faith movement is a lot like the liberal movement of the early 20th century. They do not think theology matters, and they are very relative in their understanding of truth. This is the same way that the liberal movement is today, also. They are 'pratically' oriented, and not oriented by the Word of God! The ideals of the Protestant Reformers have been thrown at the window, because 'they are too 16th century.' Machen does a great job critiquing Liberalism from six different facets: Doctrine, God and Man, The Bible, Christ, Salvation, and The Church. I have already gone into his critique of the liberal movement on doctrine, namely that they do not see it's importance. They have a demoted view of God (as does the Word-of-faith). They stress the immanence of God (as does pantheism or panentheism), and do not see the transcendence of God in the same light. Then, they see the universality of the brotherhood of man. As far as the Bible is concerned they reject the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, and they remove the foundaton of the Christian faith! They see Christ as just a normal man. That He isn't actually God, but that He was a very moral man. And lastly, their view of the Church is not what it should be. They deflate the Church to become a social entity, rather than a place to worship the Holy God! Machen does a terrific job to critique this abberation. A modern day wake-up call."},{"Title":"Christianity and liberalism","review":"After reading this book I did not know whether to write a review or critique Mr. John M K's review of the book-both were equally interesting. Machen's basic thesis, as others have pointed out, is that Liberalism is not another form of Christianity, but a religion separate and distinct from Christianity. Liberals claim that Jesus is the essence of Christianity; Machens then asks them to qualify that statement, which turns out that there Jesus is about as historical, and inspiring, as Tolkien's Gandalf. Now don't get me wrong, I loved LOTR, but if the Christ of faith is divorced from the Christ of Histor, then, pray tell, what is the difference between Gandalf and Jesus? The only answer for Christianity is that there is a transcendent God who has revealed himself historically in His Son Jesus. Machen further delineates this by mandating the Cross and Resurrection as an Historical event.Mr MK claims that the PCUSA is right and the conservatives are wrong. Well, that is an interesting statement, and I grant him his right to it, but why didn't he prove it? He let me down. He challenged historic Christianity, but did not back up his challenge. He then proceeds to talk about Communism for three lines or more with no particular reason for doing so. In all honesty, I searched his review long and hard for a sentence or even a clause relating to the book at hand; alas, I could find it not.This book is the line drawn in the sand for Christians. &quot;Separation is the crying need of the hour. The things about which men disagree, those are the ones about which men ought to fight.&quot;"},{"Title":"Diccionario del estudiante (RAE) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Every intermediate and advanced student of Spanish, at some point, needs to add a monolingual dictionary to their basic arsenal of reference books, i.e., a dictionary that defines words using only Spanish, without the need for translation into other languages. Still, a good, monolingual dictionary is so much more than just a list of words with definitions: yes, it explains meanings of words, but it also provides students with extensive usage examples, addresses common dilemmas (e.g., the word listo to be used with SER or ESTAR?), and often provides synonyms of words (listo = inteligente).There are dozens of monolingual dictionaries available on the market, and unfortunately most are really bad, virtually useless, and often quite expensive on top of that. Several are quite expensive, and awkward to use. The \\"Diccionario del estudiante\\" published as a result of a joint effort between the Real Academia Espa&ntilde;ola and Santillana is the unquestionable king of the hill in this category. It is reasonably priced, big enough, so it lists most the entries that intermediate or even advanced students of contemporary Spanish language and literature may need, and it is also handy enough to be easily browsed.The range of vocabulary covered here is extensive, and individual entries are very well and clearly written; each word is accessibly explained using fairly basic vocabulary (so even low-intermediate students will understand the definitions), and each definition is accompanied by a generous amount of well thought-out (i.e., illustrative and not generic) usage examples. The listing of words uses the so-called MODERN SORT, where ll/rr are not treated as separate entries, but fit within the letter l and r, respectively. Unlike so many other, poorly designed dictionaries, this one lists the necessary syntactic information for each word, including prepositional extensions of verbs (Esto no depende DE m&iacute;.), and adjectives (dependiente DE), and often includes common collocations for nouns (la conclusi&oacute;n: llegar a ~). Prepositional extensions are one of the most difficult aspects of vocabulary, since they are arbitrary and unpredictable, and therefore are impossible to guess even for fairly advanced students. For example, Eng. \\"to look for\\" does not translate into Span. *\\"buscar por\\" - buscar requires no prepositional extension in Spanish. Additionally, prepositional extensions often change between verbs and other parts of speech derived from them. This dictionary has it ALL covered.One of this dictionary's unique features is the inclusion of the pronunciation key for words that may cause problems for learners and native speakers alike. Most dictionaries assume that Spanish words are pronounced the way they are spelled; but this rule does not hold true for many recently imported words of foreign origin: for example, \\"handicap,\\" although still spelled in Spanish with an h, is pronounced as [jandicap] and not as [andicap], which this dictionary points out. It also indicates that the word is a recently imported Anglicism, and it provides useful, and better alternatives for each of its several meanings.IN SUMMARY: The best single-volume monolingual dictionary on the market today ('09), with clear definitions, usage tips, syntactic info, and common collocations. An absolute, essential must for any serious student of Spanish, and with its clear, two-color, easy-to-read layout, it's a real pleasure to use. Oh, and unlike many others in this category, it's actually affordable for an average student."},{"Title":"Diccionario del estudiante (RAE) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I really recommend this dictionary, and not only as a resource for students of Spanish but for Spanish speakers generally. I am a native Spanish speaker, and it is currently my preferred single-volume dictionary in the market. What stands out the most is the fact that there are plenty of usage examples for each word, and in them words that are necessarily used in association with others are highlighted (think of the need to say \\"married to\\" in English; the \\"to\\" would appear capitalized in this dictionary, to signal that \\"to\\" must be used when \\"married\\" is used with such a meaning). This is a constant source of mistakes in Spanish, as the also wonderful Diccionario Panhisp&aacute;nico de Dudas demonstrates (the DPD is also a must-have for committed Spanish speakers). These two features (recurrent usage examples, and showing words necessarily used in conjunction with others), which make up some of the main strengths of the Diccionario del Estudiante, are sorely absent from the heftier Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa&ntilde;ola (DRAE)."},{"Title":"Diccionario del estudiante (RAE) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful dictionary for the intermediate and advancedstudent.

If you are not a Christian you will be turned off with the bent this book gives on every event. At the end of each chapter there is an excerpt from the Bible. There is no doubt many wonderful generous Americans in the United States but to think God is in play there is a bit neurotic."},{"Title":"Eastern European and Soviet science and technology: Capabilities and needs (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Published in 1959, Stanley Elkins' Slavery opened up new avenues of debate in the historiography of American slavery. Though a generation of historians would later prove him wrong, Elkins argued that there was little uncharted ground left to explore in our knowledge of slaves' material conditions, and that the debate should shift to consideration of the psychological effects of bondage upon slaves. Regarding the role of whites in the institution, Elkins cared less about their economic motivations than their philosophical views, arguing that the lack of a true intellectual class or established institutions exerting moral authority prevented the United States from settling the slavery debate in a peaceful manner. His approach to the subject was thus vastly different from previous historians, yet with the exception of abolitionist literature he relied almost entirely on secondary studies to reinforce his arguments, preferring to break new ground in interpretation rather than in presenting new evidence. His sources include not only historical studies, but also go beyond the field to include philosophy and psychological studies as well. To determine the effects of bondage upon the slaves themselves, Elkins compared them to Holocaust survivors and drew upon studies of mass psychology in the concentration camps, arguing that the brutality of slavery was much like that experienced by victims of the Nazis. He asserted that the horrors of the Middle Passage stripped slaves of any previous cultural values or expectations, allowing masters to completely rebuild slaves' personalities in a manner that suited them. Because masters were the dominant figures in slaves' lives, slaves became like children; dependent, lazy, dishonest but cheerful &quot;sambos&quot;. Confronted by the fact that the &quot;sambo&quot; personality was unknown in Latin American slave societies, Elkins argued that the Spanish system was less totalitarian in its treatment of slaves, allowing them legal and family rights, spiritual growth, and the chance for eventual emancipation, and therefore did not psychologically damage them to the extent that slaves in the American South were. Later historians, outraged by Elkins' comparison of slavery to the Holocaust, and his assertion that slaves were stripped of their native culture and reduced psychologically to the status of children, have succesfully disproved most of Elkins' conclusions. However, this is still an important source for the serious student of American slavery, for it was the first to consider how slaves themselves experienced slavery, and the impetus for a good deal of further research."},{"Title":"Eastern European and Soviet science and technology: Capabilities and needs (CRS report for Congress)","review":"Not the best read but for a required text it was fine shipped fast and great price!I would recommend to students needing it for civil war classes."},{"Title":"The Bugman Lives!

It was also a life-saver when I was learning General Relativity because of its clear and careful exposition. Schrodinger was doing this back when nobody was quite sure what the deal was with, e.g., index notation, and he took pains to lay out the benefits -- but also the limits -- of that system. See, for example, his discussion of the derivative operator, something that is almost always glossed over.I'm in the middle of my dissertation now, and every now and then I hit on a subtlety in GR that my advisor has missed but I caught from reading this book.Don't get thinking that this is Schrodinger's book on the unified field. It is more like the lecture notes of a very intelligent man figuring out what on Earth this truly new version of gravity is all about.In the end of course this book is too slim to live on its own as a GR text.

Then there are more and more destiny lines branching from those destiny lines, and so on and so forth. They get very complicated. Time lines are the original paths of time. Destiny lines are the lines of time determined by what happens along the time lines. Sounds confusing? Well, anything you do creates a new destiny line.

Well, my dear and beloved Zenna, it was your own fault. You somehow tapped into the deep subconscious longings (memories, even?) of millions of people, and they believed. In fact, while \\"The People\\" stories are categorized as science fiction, they're much more. The People are who we would love to be, our innermost aspirations to goodness, cooperation, power well used and a deeply ethical center. By now, most people who would be interested know that The People are refugees from a planetary disaster who evacuated their world and headed off in all directions. Some few landed on Earth and, hiding their differences, tried to fit in here. And oh, what differences! Where we harnessed the power of machines, they grew their mental powers, enabling them to fly (\\"lift\\"), see into other to help them heal emotionally (\\"sorters\\") and physically (\\"sensitives\\"). and much more. These enchanting abilities exist in the setting of very decent people you're sure to love, and believe.My introduction to the series was \\"Pottage,\\" a story of reclamation and small heroisms that become as big as sunrise. It was an apt introduction, and to this day, nearly 50 years later, I can't read it... or even talk about it... dry-eyed. Somehow Zenna Henderson taps into language in an unusual way, accessing emotions and forgotten innocence. Her characters are earthy yet somehow angelic, flawed in their way, but devoted to growth. While Ms. Henderson spent some time as a religious person, and the stories are filled with Biblical references and allusions, the only thing we know of The People's belief system is something they call \\"the Presence,\\" and that life does not end with physical death.I could go on, but what a disservice I would do to the divine prose of Zenna Henderson, who tells her story best in her own way. There is a collection of all the People stories, including several previously unpublished, called INGATHERING. Once you've read PILGRIMAGE you may find yourself wanting more of these stories, and believing more about your own capabilities and depth in this life. I cannot recommend this book highly enough except to say that, if I were to be stranded on the proverbial desert (as Earth became to the early People) and could have only one book for the rest of my life, it would be PILGRIMAGE, and my favorite stories in that are all in this first collection.

This is a *forceful* book - Lipsyte's characters are gripped and ripped by forces the writer brings alive with language that describes things words can barely contain: an apartment building full of old women waiting for death; a summer camp that mirrors, in mysterious ways, the cruel workings of concentration camps; a tele-marketer's face-off with loneliness... The subject matter can be shocking, and is often quite dark; the book is full of death, drugs, and abandoned dreams. Here's a passage from &quot;My Life, For Promotional Use Only,&quot; in which a failed rocker turned dot-commer describes his new life:&quot;Once in a while, though, in the elevator at work, someone will stop me, a man my age with a cell phone, a portfolio case.

The stories in this collection often include depressing and morbid themes but Lipyte's word acrobatics and writing flair make most a treat to read. I'm a slow reader but plowed through this book, finding 10 of the 12 stories rather exceptional. Rarely do I enjoy so many stories in a collection.Not all reader will appreciate and enjoy the characters or subject matter as they can be pretty base and gritty. But if the idea of Hubert Selby storylines told by Groucho Marx sounds like a good time, then pick up Venus Drive"},{"Title":"Venus Drive","review":"It is often said that a writer, a good writer, writes first and foremost about what he or she knows best. If that is the case with Mr. Lipsyte then I feel sorry for him. How he took the time and put in the effort to write stories such as those found within this collection makes me question him not only as a writer but as a human being. The \\"intellectual\\" will probably cry foul with this assessment and point out how his characters delve into a dark, humorous, and challenging underbelly of life that is rarely exposed.This book isn't dark, its perverted. Sam? Can you write anything that doesn't involve genitalia?This book isn't funny, because it tries entirely to hard to be just that, and fails miserably.This book isn't a challenge, rather a burden.Again, some will praise his randomness. I'd prefer to substitute \\"unnecessary\\", in place of random.I'm not sure if this book confused itself for a wartime policy, you know the one where SHOCK & AWE are used.Seriously, since when did being deep or provocative mean one has too fondle his sister(first story) or glorify the junky (every other story)?I've never thrown away a book, so this will be a first. I'm throwing it away and writing this review in hopes, although the chance is slim, that maybe Mr. Lipsyte or one of his friends will take notice.Maybe Lipsyte can redeem himself down the road, drop the act and show off his real talent.P.S. Dedicating the book to your mother, great choice."},{"Title":"Alley Urchin","review":"I enjoyed this book being the 2nd in a series of 3 and I was looking forward to reading the third."},{"Title":"Alley Urchin","review":"Great read as always good suspense not drawn out and I love. The way JC draws the story in and out to keep you hanging on the edge"},{"Title":"Aristotle and Poetic Justice: Murder and Mystery in Ancient Athens (Aristotle and Stephanos Novels)","review":"Years ago I found a copy of Aristotle Detective when I was looking for something in a history class. Doody was recommended as a \\"go to\\" lady for Greek history. I totally forgot the history and was enveloped in the mystery. Her accuracy is incredible and so is her lack of pretense...just a great story with great details. I am delighted that there are other books by the author. She really puts you in the sight and soul of Athens."},{"Title":"Hell Looks Different Now. One Corpsman's Journey Back to Vietnam. Revised","review":"I thought this book was well written and provided me with a feeling of how it was to revist some of the places where the author served as a young man. I was surprised at how well paced it was."},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","review":"Appears to have been written a la romance novel -- indulgent descriptions of &quot;my husband's Armani suit&quot;, &quot;my Mediterranean beauty&quot; and the like -- the truly heroic ones are Jennifer, who carried the child for 9 months, and husband David, who endured surgery. Perspective of Liza is self-involved and her ambivalence toward becoming a parent is insulting to those who may choose adoption as an alternative. This seems written with an eye toward a Hollywood screenplay."},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","review":"The authors were able to draw me into not only the drama of bringing Luc into this world but to the couragious story of 4 women and what they meant to each other. As someone who has experienced the rollercoaster known as infertility, I could relate to the feelings Liza expressed over her frustations with the medical community as well as her own perceived failures. I usually fear books on this subject because they can be full of self pity. Not this one...it was inspirational. Thank you to the authors for bringing hope to those of us still struggling!!"},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","review":"Your book was extremely emotional for me I cried all the way through it. I am a 34 yr. old female. I have had two ectopic pregnancies and 3 IVF cycles with no success. My sister has offered to be a surrogate, but my husband and I weren't sure about that path. Until I read your book!I don't think people understand how difficult it is to live day to day with the pain of infertility. The book is very clear regarding the frustrations of not conceiving and the insensitivity some Dr.'s and nurses display to their patients. That was a very important message to send to your readers.Your cousin Jennifer is truly a beautiful person inside and out. I think about her constantly. I loved the part about Jennifer always wearing high heel shoes, I can totally related to you La. But, you had the courage, strength, and love to not change Jennifer's ways. I admire you for that.Thank God for loving people like Jennifer and modern technology. Jennifer by the way, you look gorgeous just like your mother.. Thank you very much for sharing your family photos with us, their very precious. May you all live happy and healthy lives.Virginia Montoya"},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","review":"What an uplifting, profoundly honest story of one woman (Liza) who couldn't become pregnant, and her cousin (Jennifer), who carried her baby (Luc) for her. I was moved -- and inspired -- throughout and actually cried 5 times!"},{"Title":"Conceiving Luc: A Family Story","review":"I have never read a more ridiculousy self indulgent book about a narcissitic woman who dosn't want to ruin her &quot;renaissance&quot; looks and actually give birth. Good thing she has a sucker for a cousin!! The poor husband, does he ever get to use the bathroom mirror?"},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"This book doesn't seem to hold up to the rest of his books so far in the series. It's still a good book, don't get me wrong... I just feel that it doesn't carry the same weight as the others...."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"The ruler has died. His son, finishing his apprenticeship with the Assassin's Guild in Ankh-Morpork, must assume his rightful place. But the High Priest has other ideas. How long has that guy been around, anyway? Pratchett's outlandish plot twists and incredible cast of characters will keep you reading far into the night. The essence of religious leadership and pyramid power are stripped to the core in his inimitable and scathing manner. And you'll never look at a camel the same way again."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I loved this book. Although I wish Pratchett had done more with the assassin theme, It is great. The ending was just amazing, I had to set the book down I was laughing so hard. When the pyramid goes nuts and stuff starts happening...wow."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"I mean it, Pteppic is one of the best (and that is saying a lot). For Discworld readers, it gives a new inside view to the Assassassassin's guild (never could figure out how to stop spelling that), along with an introduction to the land of Djel. Death is in here, for all the fans, and a new cast of characters comes into the scene. The only bad part about this book is the fact that, so far, Prattchet hasn't re-used any of these characters in other books. For newbies to the land of Discworld, it isn't the best starter book; it has a lot of jokes that you wouldn't understand and references to other books. Still, it is my favorite book in the Discworld series."},{"Title":"Pyramids: Discworld #7","review":"Have you ever wondered why camels are so ungainly? The answer is in 'Pyramids' along with some of the most hilarious material ever to appear between the covers of a book. Terry Pratchett is the greatest &quot;Funny Fantasy&quot; writer in the world (disc or otherwise). I laughed so hard I nearly did myself an injury!!
