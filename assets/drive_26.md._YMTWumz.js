Set on the boom-or-bust frontier at the turn of the century, this is a timeless tale of greed, sedition, and one man's courageous refusal to compromise his word, told through the eyes of his not-so-constant son. Clue's father is a well-respected banker and keeper of the land records, but when he refuses to confiscate the oil-rich property from a couple of Indians, the specter of vast wealth is enough to incite revolt among the townspeople. Before long, Clue's home is in flames, his mother lies wounded in the street, and he and his sister are sent to live in the hills with the mysterious Indians who are at the heart of the problem, Gabriel and Keziah Jane. There are more than enough delightful plot twists to keep you on your toes, but at its heart, this is a book about the triumph of life over materialism in the finest tradition of The Christmas Box and Tuesdays with Morrie.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SsIfPQAACAAJ&dq=Gabriel%27s+Well&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional Crystal Reports for Visual Studio .NET (Programmer to Programmer)","description":"What is this book about?

Master your mental strength revolutionary new strategies that work for everyone from homemakers to soldiers and teachers to CEOs. Everyone knows that regular exercise and weight training lead to physical strength. But how do we strengthen ourselves mentally for the truly tough times? And what should we do when we face these challenges? Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results holds us back. This list of things mentally strong people don't do resonated so much with readers that when it was picked up by Forbes.com it received ten million views. Now, for the first time, Morin expands upon the thirteen things from her viral post and shares her tried-and-true practices for increasing mental strength. Morin writes with searing honesty, incorporating anecdotes from her work as a college psychology instructor and psychotherapist as well as personal stories about how she bolstered her own mental strength when tragedy threatened to consume her. Increasing your mental strength can change your entire attitude. It takes practice and hard work, but with Morin's specific tips, exercises, and troubleshooting advice, it is possible to not only fortify your mental muscle but also drastically improve the quality of your life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xkz2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sweet Thursday","description":"A Penguin Classic In Monterey, on the California coast, Sweet Thursday is what they call the day after Lousy Wednesday, which is one of those days that are just naturally bad.

It systematically explores the cultural dimension of international history, mapping existing approaches and conceptual lenses for the study of cultural factors and thus hopes to sharpen the awareness for the cultural approach to international history among both American and non-American scholars. The first part provides a methodological introduction, explores the cultural underpinnings of foreign policy, and the role of culture in international affairs by reviewing the historiography and examining the meaning of the word culture in the context of foreign relations. In the second part, contributors analyze culture as a tool of foreign policy. They demonstrate how culture was instrumentalized for diplomatic goals and purposes in different historical periods and world regions. The essays in the third part expand the state-centered view and retrace informal cultural relations among nations and peoples. This exploration of non-state cultural interaction focuses on the role of science, art, religion, and tourism. The fourth part collects the findings and arguments of part one, two, and three to define a roadmap for further scholarly inquiry. A group of\\" commentators\\" survey the preceding essays, place them into a larger research context, and address the question \\"Where do we go from here?\\" The last and fifth part presents a selection of primary sources along with individual comments highlighting a new genre of resources scholars interested in culture and international relations can consult.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x7pCMObYnjUC&dq=Culture+and+International+Relations+(Explorations+in+Culture+and+International+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABC","description":"This classic primer ranges from the familiar Antelope, Bear, and Cat to more unusual creatures D the graceful Ibis, the aquatic Newt, the legendary Unicorn, and the powerful Xiphius, better known as the swordfish.

The Octavius of Marcus Minucius Felix (Ancient Christian Writers)","description":"Does a consumer who bought a shirt made in another nation bear any moral responsibility when the women who sewed that shirt die in a factory fire or in the collapse of the building? Many have asserted, without explanation, that because markets cause harms to distant others, consumers bear moral responsibility for those harms. But traditional moral analysis of individual decisions is unable to sustain this argument. Distant Harms, Distant Markets presents a careful analysis of moral complicity in markets, employing resources from sociology, Christian history, feminism, legal theory, and Catholic moral theology today. Because of its individualistic methods, mainstream economics as a discipline is not equipped to understand the causality entailed in the long chains of social relationships that make up the market. Critical realist sociology, however, has addressed the character and functioning of social structures, an analysis that can helpfully be applied to the market. The True Wealth of Nations research project of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies brought together an international group of sociologists, economists, moral theologians, and others to describe these causal relationships and articulate how Catholic social thought can use these insights to more fully address issues of economic ethics in the twenty-first century. The result was this interdisciplinary volume of essays, which explores the causal and moral responsibilities that consumers bear for the harms that markets cause to distant others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_0bbAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A guide to Haleakala National Park, Island of Maui, Hawaii","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3Nx1PwAACAAJ&dq=A+guide+to+Haleakala+National+Park,+Island+of+Maui,+Hawaii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets from the Ninja Grandmaster: Revised and Updated Edition","description":"Secrets of the Ninja Grandmaster is a collection of heart-to-heart lessons from ninja grandmaster Masaaki Hatsumi to his senior student and first American disciple, Stephen K.

This important volume is now available once again through Paladin Press, with an all-new epilogue and a techniques section that illustrates various classical ninja fighting defenses.

In occupied Poland, the Baltic countries, Byelorussia, and Ukraine, they were stripped of property and  resettled  in ghettos. The German authorities established in each ghetto a Jewish Council, or Judenrat, to maintain minimal living standards. The Judenrat was required to carry out Nazi directives against other Jews, to supply forced labor, and eventually to cooperate in the Final Solution. Did the Jewish leaders of the ghettos, who were also victims, assist their murderers? If cooperation with the Nazi oppressors was morally defensible during the first stage in organizing the ghettos, what about later, when deportations to death camps began? Trunk analyzes situations where the Councils and ghetto police were forced to send their own communities to death. Some Council members chose suicide rather than supply lists to the Nazis; others used delaying tactics. Some handed over the lists. Some joined their families in the gas chamber. In assessing guilt and innocence, Trunk never allows the reader to forget that the impossible choices facing the Jewish leaders were created by the Nazis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D7bobfzrcCoC&dq=Judenrat:+The+Jewish+Councils+in+Eastern+Europe+under+Nazi+Occupation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captivity of the Oatman girls: Being an interesting narrative of life among the Apache and Mohave Indians","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CFoYoDvI3x8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of Serotonin: The Natural Hormone That Curbs Food and Alcohol Cravings, Elevates Your Mood, Reduces Pain, and Boosts Energy","description":"Incorporating the latest medical and scientific research, a study of the health benefits of serotonin explains how to boost serotonin levels without taking drugs, revealing how high serotonin levels can naturally curb appetite, help fight depression, alleviate migraine headaches, relieve PMS, eliminate fatigue, and more.

Forensic scientists, law enforcement, and crime scene investigators are often tasked with reconstruction of events based on crime scene evidence, along with the subsequent analysis of that evidence. The use and misuse of firearms to perpetrate crimes from theft to murder necessitates numerous invitations to reconstruct shooting incidents. The discharge of firearms and the behavior of projectiles create many forms of physical evidence that, through proper testing and interpretation by a skilled forensic scientist, can establish what did and what did not occur. Written by the world's most well-respected shooting scene and ballistics experts, the book addresses the terminology, science, and factors involved in reconstructing shooting incident events to solve forensic cases. It covers the full range of related topics including: the range from which a firearm was discharged; the sequence of shots in a multiple discharge shooting incident; the position of a firearm at the moment of discharge; and the position of a victim at the moment of impact. The probable flight path of a projectile and the manner in which a firearm was discharged are also discussed. Case studies illustrate real-world application of technical concepts, supported by over 200 full-color diagrams and photographs. This book will be of value to practicing forensic scientists (firearm and toolmark examiners), ballistics experts, crime scene personnel, police departments, forensic consultants (generalists), attorneys and judges, medical examiners (coroners), and forensic pathologists. New chapters on special reconstructive properties and value of shootings involving sub-machine guns or pseudo automatic firearms, rate of fire with special attention on shot-to-shot time intervals, human factors in shooting incidents Updated and revised glossary terms to fit with new technology and the emergence of standardization of terms by groups such as the Organization of Scientific Advisory Committees Provides clear practice standards and ethical guidelines for those involved in reconstructing shooting scenes","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E5rhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giger (Basic Art)","description":"H.R.

There the doctors faced the most intense professional, ethical, and personal predicaments of their lives. Drawing on extensive interviews, documents, and recorded materials she collected over four and a half years, doctor and journalist Sheri Fink tells the harrowing--and ultimately enlightening--story of these physicians and the three who try to help them: an idealistic internist from Doctors without Borders, who hopes that interposition of international aid workers will help prevent a massacre; an aspiring Bosnian surgeon willing to walk through minefields to reach the civilian wounded; and a Serb doctor on the opposite side of the front line with the army that is intent on destroying his former colleagues. With limited resources and a makeshift hospital overflowing with patients, how can these doctors decide who to save and who to let die? Will their duty to treat patients come into conflict with their own struggle to survive? And are there times when medical and humanitarian aid ironically prolong war and human suffering rather than helping to relieve it?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h0-VswEACAAJ&dq=War+Hospital:+A+True+Story+of+Surgery+and+Survival&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World of M.C.

Even as he grounded his narratives in the intimate daily life of Germany, Broch was identifying the oceanic changes that would shortly sweep that life into the abyss. Whether he is writing about a neurotic army officer (The Romantic), a disgruntled bookkeeper and would-be assassin (The Anarchist), or an opportunistic war-deserter (The Relaist), Broch immerses himself in the twists of his characters' psyches, and at the same time soars above them, to produce a prophetic portrait of a world tormented by its loss of faith, morals, and reason.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ljWlav3CX3YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serenity--Basket Case (Serenity (Barbour))","description":"\\"The Prayer Club's pet project is at her flaky best, dissing a health class assignment that has teens caring for chicken eggs 24/7 to simulate the round-the-clock nuturing a baby requires.

He fought many battles including Marston Moor and Naseby and was eventually instrumental in bringing Charles I to trial. After establishing the Commonwealth, he suppressed the Levellers, Ireland and the Scots. In 1653, five years before his death, he established a Protectorate. John Buchan wrote of Cromwell: 'He is a soldier on the grand scale, strategist as well as tactician; statesman as well as fighting man; and it is by this new phase of his military career that his place is to be adjudged in the hierarchy of the great captains'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a5JQPgAACAAJ&dq=Oliver+Cromwell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life of General Nathan Bedford Forrest,","description":"?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=skGjjKeIZ1QC&dq=Life+of+General+Nathan+Bedford+Forrest,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Dictionary of Quotations on Historical Principles from Ancient and Modern Sources","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1RnYAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+New+Dictionary+of+Quotations+on+Historical+Principles+from+Ancient+and+Modern+Sources&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composing a Civic Life: A Rhetoric and Readings for Inquiry and Action (2nd Edition)","description":"Promoting the examined life as an ideal that brings inquiry and action together, this text addresses the critical thinking, reading, and writing skills.

His thirst for adventure was formed by his boyhood visits to remote Scottish lighthouses, and he spent much of his life fleeing the rigours of cold climates and social orthodoxy. Along the way he canoed through Belgium and France, booked passage to and across America, and finally famously settled in Samoa in the South Seas. The walking trip that Stevenson describes in Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879) was taken when the nascent author was still in his twenties and pining for a lost love. Accompanied by Modestine, the eponymous donkey he hired to carry his camping gear, the journey proved both challenging and charming. The book is infused with all of the qualities that make Stevenson the most popular of writers: humour and humanity, poetry and perspicacity, ebullience and intelligence.\\"--Publisher's description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FNrNrQEACAAJ&dq=Travels+with+a+donkey+in+the+Cevennes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greek and Roman Classics in Translation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5OQCAAAAMAAJ&dq=Greek+and+Roman+Classics+in+Translation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters of a Nation","description":"Spanning 350 years of American history and culture, a collection of more than two hundred letters, many never before published, reveals the personalities and feelings of Americans great and small, from Amelia Earhart to Elvis Presley to Malcolm X.

This encyclopedic survey of endtime predictions looks at the history of these prophets and the religious sects that forecast the exact dates that civilization would take its final bow. Author James R. Lewis eloquently remarks that all of these doomsday fear- mongers have one thing in common: they have all been wrong. As the year 2000 ushers in a new millennium, widespread interest in the end of the world, judgment day, and the \\"return\\" of a \\"savior,\\" as predicted by many old and new groups, has spread like wildfire across the planet. Encompassing the truly bizarre, the suicidal, the homicidal, and the almost believable, Doomsday Prophecies touches on apocalyptic strains in each religion, revealing that endtime predictions reach all the way back to Old Testament writings. They have thrived for centuries, and today they find new life with New Age religions and televangelists. Included are \\"prophecies\\" from the Hindu scriptures, the Ghost Dance, Iroquois tradition, the Shawnee prophet, the Turner Diaries, Aum Shinrikyo, the Branch Davidians, the Children of God, Rael, Dorothy Martin, Edgar Cayce, Marshall Applewhite, the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord, and more. Lewis includes everything, from the longtime belief in a final battle between good and evil to the space-age belief that heaven's gate can be reached through travel with alien beings. Sometimes humorous, often tragic, this enduring book examines the questions raised by the mass appeal of prophetic movements as a theme in popular culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XQDXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Doomsday+Prophecies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pop It in the Toaster Oven: From Entrees to Desserts, More Than 250 Delectable, Healthy, and Convenient Recipes","description":"Are you pressed for time, too tired to cook just for yourself, or simply looking for something beyond a microwaved frozen meal or take-out food loaded with fat, salt, and preservatives?

Xinyuan Wang spent 15 months living among a community of these migrants in a small factory town in southeast China to track their use of social media. It was here she witnessed a second migration taking place: a movement from offline to online. As Wang argues, this is not simply a convenient analogy but represents the convergence of two phenomena as profound and consequential as each other, where the online world now provides a home for the migrant workers who feel otherwise  homeless . Wang s fascinating study explores the full range of preconceptions commonly held about Chinese people  their relationship with education, with family, with politics, with  home   and argues why, for this vast population, it is time to reassess what we think we know about contemporary China and the evolving role of social media.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iUZLDwAAQBAJ&dq=COMMEDIA+DELL%27ARTE:+ACTOR%27S+HBK+CL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Take Back Your Health: A Total Wellness Guide for You and Your Family","description":"\\"Renee Simon, a respected colleague, has done a masterful job at providing practical and useful information to help you reach a higher level of health and wellbeing.

Page examines Brazil in the context of this current crisis and the events leading up to it. In so doing, he reveals the unique character of the Brazilian people and how this national character has brought the country to where it is today teetering on the verge of joining the First World, or plunging into unprecedented environmental calamity and social upheaval. Not since Luigi Barzini's The Italians has a society been so deeply and accurately portrayed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=97KZYYi2G2IC&dq=The+Brazilians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Segundo Sombra (Spanish Edition)","description":"Don Segundo Sombra is presented as a bilingual, Spanish/English book, with side-by-side texts. This book shows how a rebellious teenager transforms himself into a gaucho of the pampas, under the guidance of Don Segundo Sombra, the image of the ideal gaucho. The gauchos loved their freedom, they were nomads who wandered through the fields, at a time when there were no fences and wild cattle abounded, which allowed them to live off the land. They only looked for temporary work in a ranch, when they needed some money. The figure of the gaucho always appears linked to the horse; they were excellent riders and wranglers. When the fields were wired and the railway connected the pampas with the rest of the country, well into the 19th century, the gaucho lost his freedom and the way of life portrayed in this book came to an end. The original edition of Don Segundo Sombra doesn't have a Table of Contents because although the book is divided in 27 chapters, they have no titles. To help readers locate easily the different parts of this book we added a TOC with titles for each chapter, but such titles are no part of the original book. There are two other English translations of this book, the 1935 translation by Harriet de On s, published by Signet in 1966, with an afterword by herself and the 1995 translation by Patricia Owen Steiner, accompanied by extensive critical materials, published by the University of Pittsburgh. Both translations, although very good, are out of print but also, they were not written by people familiarized with the gaucho culture of Argentina, which made them not very faithful to the original text. Don Segundo Sombra was written by an educated man who used the real language spoken by the gauchos of the XIX century; this complicates the translation of this book because it is full of colloquialisms and jargon. This translation is the first one written by an Argentinean, familiar with the cultural and gaucho jargon of the time. Some words couldn't be translated properly, because there are not English words for them, in such cases the Spanish word was not translated, but its meaning is explained in the Glossary. All words included in the Glossary are underlined. Also, the same words can mean different things in different places and times, those Spanish words who don't have the normal meaning in the time and place of this story (the province of Buenos Aires, in some moment of the XIX century), also were underlined in the Spanish text and added to the Glossary. We hope this bilingual translation can help English readers to understand better this classic work of the Latin-American literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mz0hzwEACAAJ&dq=Don+Segundo+Sombra+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beginning Maltese","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UIhxAAAACAAJ&dq=Beginning+Maltese&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Short Films: The Complete Guide from Script to Screen","description":"Making movies is the most exciting way to earn a living and it is not surprising that media and film studies remain the most popular courses at colleges across the western world.

The protagonists, and there are several, are all members or descendents of the family of John Ian Waters. Through Johns Scottish ancestry, which dates to a druid priest, certain members of the Waters family have been blessed with awesome (and sometimes awful) powers of the supernatural kind. As for the antagonist of this yarn, there can be no doubt: he is the despicable, sociopathic, nearly heartless Caleb Bland. His undying love for the beautiful Annabelle with the emerald-green eyes drives the story, often at a feverish pitch (readers will put Calebs Curse down only reluctantly). As Calebs corpse rots under the oak tree on the island where British soldiers have hanged him, the spirit places a curse on the treasure he had given to Annabelle before her brutal murder.There is betrayal, murder, romance, sex, courage, and humor. No pirate yarn since Treasure Island has had a more exciting climax as the hero dukes it out with the spirit of the vile Caleb.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fBZRAAAACAAJ&dq=Caleb%27s+Curse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deceptions: The Children of the Sky","description":"Deceptions The Children of the Sky Casper Perry discovers a space warp in the Grand Canyon that transports him to the famous 12th planet of Nibiru where he finds a powerful alien race known as the Guardians.

Complex investigations are more easily controlled because commanders of investigative bureaus can better monitor investigators' work. In addition, attorneys and judges can better understand cases. A single analyst charting crime cases can save the criminal justice system thousands of dollars in costs of investigations, prosecutions, and adjudications. Steps in developing a chart include summarizing source material, choosing activities to highlight, and making a visual display showing connections between each crime activity. Injured personnel, student interns, and volunteers can work on charts. Crimes suitable for this technique have one or more of the following characteristics: high complexity, lengthy time frame, and multiple suspects. Diagrams, tables, crime scenarios, and appendixes presenting explanations of each task and sample displays are provided.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lBa2GAAACAAJ&dq=Crime+analysis+charting:+An+introduction+to+Visual+Investigative+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Coming Evil","description":"During the German occupation of France in 1940, thirteen-year-old Lisette meets a ghost while living with her aunt who harbors Jewish and Gypsy children in the French countryside.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k783f2WmNMIC&dq=A+Coming+Evil&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smith and Other Events: Tales of the Chilcotin","description":"Paul St. Pierre's witty, honest writing never fails to delight, and nor does his legendary character, Smith.

England's first attempt at colonizing the New World was not at Roanoke or Jamestown, but on a mostly frozen small island in the Canadian Arctic. Queen Elizabeth I called that place Meta Incognita -- the Unknown Shore. Backed by Elizabeth I and her key advisors, including the legendary spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and the shadowy Dr. John Dee, the erstwhile pirate Sir Martin Frobisher set out three times across the North Atlantic, in the process leading what is still the largest Arctic expedition in history. In this forbidding place, Frobisher believed he had discovered vast quantities of gold, the fabled Northwest Passage to the riches of Cathay, and a suitable place for a year-round colony. But Frobisher's dream turned into a nightmare, and his colony was lost to history for nearly three centuries. In this brilliantly conceived dual narrative, Robert Ruby interweaves Frobisher's saga with that of the nineteenth-century American Charles Francis Hall, whose explorations of this same landscape enabled him to hear the oral history of the Inuit, passed down through generations. It was these stories that unlocked the mystery of Frobisher's lost colony. Unknown Shore is the story of two men's travels, and of what these men shared three centuries apart. Ultimately, it is a tale of men driven by greed and ambition, of the hard labor of exploration, of the Inuit and their land, and of great gambles gone wrong.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gjlkAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washakie, Chief of the Shoshones","description":"Washakie was chief of the eastern band of the Shoshone Indians for almost sixty years, until his death in 1900.

Washakie is seen signing historic treaties, aiding overland emigrants in the 1850s, and finally assisting whites in fighting the Sioux.

Erstwhile lifetime friends--especially the generation of parents on both sides--the two families become bitter enemies when a father of one is killed by ETA militants, among them one of the sons of the other family. Told through a succession of more than one hundred short sections devoted to a rich multiplicity of characters whose role in the story becomes clear as one reads. Homeland brilliantly unfolds in nonlinear fashion as it traces the consequences for the families of both the murder victim and the perpetrator. Aramburu alludes only obliquely to a historical matrix even as he focuses on the psychological complexity of his characters while building nearly unbearable narrative tension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AYb6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Homeland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quest for Justice: A Compendium of Statements of the United States Catholic Bishops on the Political and Social Order, 1966-1980 (487p)","description":"Contributions to Illuminations: A Scarecrow Press Series of Guides to Research in Religion provide students and scholars, lay readers and clergy, with a road map to research in key areas of religious study. All commonly constructed with introductions to the topic and reviews of key thinkers, concepts, and events, each volume includes surveys of the primary and secondary sources, with critical evaluations of their places in the canon of thought and research on the topic. Focusing primarily on the knowledge required by today s students and scholars, each guide is a must-have for any student of religion. The twentieth century saw an explosion of wars and an accompanying explosion of literature on the morality of war. Thinking among Christian clerics and scholars on the idea of  just war  shifted with developments on the battlefield. Alternatives to just war theory, such as pacifism and realism, found new proponents in the published work of the neo-Anabaptists and Niebhurians. Meanwhile, proponents of Christian just war theory had to address challenges from competing ideologies as well as ththose presented by the changing nature of warfare. Modern Just War Theory: A Guide to Research, by scholar and librarian Michael Farrell, serves as a manual for students and scholars studying Christian just war theory, helping them navigate the wealth of just war literature produced in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Farrell s guide provides an introduction to the major developments of just war theory in the twentieth century, including sections on how to research just war theory, an overview of some of the most important theorists and developments of the twentieth century, and discussions of key search terms and related topics. Farrell then surveys and evaluates key primary and secondary sources for researchers on just war theory, as well as related sources on Christian realism and the responses of just war theorists to proponents of pacifism and secular just war theories. Modern Just War Theory will appeal to students and scholars of theology, military history, international law, and Christian ethics","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yzpFlCkNLMsC&dq=Quest+for+Justice:+A+Compendium+of+Statements+of+the+United+States+Catholic+Bishops+on+the+Political+and+Social+Order,+1966-1980+(487p)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations","description":"The intellectual history of the Civic Culture concept / Gabriel A.

A passionate, compelling appeal for the protection and preservation of the natural environment pervades Grey Owls words and makes his literary debut still ring with great relevance in the 21st century. By the 1920s, Canadas outposts of adventure had been thrust farther and farther north to the remote margins of the country. Lumbermen, miners, and trappers invaded the primeval forests, seizing on natures wealth with soulless efficiency. Grey Owl himself fled before the assault as he witnessed his valleys polluted with sawmills, his hills dug up for hidden treasure, and wildlife, particularly his beloved beavers, exterminated for quick fortunes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UeY2o6zTMA4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whispers from Our Soul: The Voice of Tahkamenon","description":"The beautiful words of a higher spiritual entity teach us to choose love in every situation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ab-UBmXgbfEC&dq=Whispers+from+Our+Soul:+The+Voice+of+Tahkamenon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Judgment on Nuremburg: American Attitudes Toward the Major German War-crime Trials","description":"In this prodigiously researched study, the author concentrates on the reaction to the trials by various segments of the American public largely in terms of the legality of the tribunal, the composition of the court, the justice of the verdicts, and the implications for the future.

D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3GzoAEACAAJ&dq=THE+CATCHER+IN+THE+RYE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adolescent Drug & Alcohol Abuse: How to Spot It, Stop It, and Get Help for Your Family","description":"By offering unique analysis and synthesis of theory, empirical research, and clinical guidance in an up-to-date and unbiased context, this book assists health and social care professionals in understanding the use of drugs and substances of abuse by children and adolescents.

The Diary deals with some of the most dramatic events in English history. Pepys witnessed the London Fire, the Great Plague, the Restoration of Charles II, and the Dutch Wars. He was a patron of the arts, having himself composed many delightful songs and participated in the artistic life of London. His flair for gossip and detail reveals a portrait of the times that rivals the most swashbuckling and romantic historical novels.

Each selection is prefaced with a short editorial introduction that highlights the central themes. A concluding section outlines the main debates surrounding each school and suggests new directions in theoretical development that might arise from criticism of the theories of authoritarianism and the search for democratic processes of development. The book s usefulness as a text is further enhanced by selected bibliographies that contain additional readings on each development theory.

Nobody goes into a starter marriage expecting to divorce and trade up to something better, but like a starter home, a starter marriage can teach you a lot about what to look for, and what to avoid, the next time around. Drawing on extensive research and interviews with starter-marriage vets, Pamela Paul explores why young people are jumping in and out of marriage, and what lessons can be drawn from their failures.

This anthology of four hundred poems by more than 150 poets between the first and third centuries CE in old Tamil the literary language of ancient Tamilnadu was composed before Aryan influence had penetrated the south. It is thus a unique testament to pre-Aryan India. Beyond its importance for understanding the development of South Asia's history, culture, religion, and linguistics, the Purananuru is a great work of literature, reflecting accurately and profoundly the life of southern India 2,000 years ago. One of the few works of classical India that confronts life without the insulation of a philosophical facade and that makes no basic assumptions about karma and the afterlife, the Purananuru has universal appeal. It faces the world as a great and unsolved mystery, delving into living and dying, despair, love, poverty, and the changing nature of existence. To this hidden gem of world literature George L. Hart and Hank Heifetz add a helpful appendix, an annotated bibliography, and an excellent introduction describing the work and placing it in its social and historical context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mVdBeeiYxh4C&dq=The+Four+Hundred+Songs+of+War+and+Wisdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Common Ground","description":"For four years, Diane Hessan has been in weekly conversation with voters across the United States. What she has learned will surprise you, enlighten you, give you hope, and change the way you think about your fellow Americans. Our inability to hear each other, our suspicion, and our impatience is stressing us out and tearing us apart. It's a sickness that permeates the American culture, erodes our collective mental health, and makes us hate each other. To gain insight into how we can move forward, Hessan undertook a massive listening project, conducting an ongoing series of weekly interviews with 500 voters from every state, of every age and ethnicity, and along different points of the political spectrum. The topics ranged from race to guns, from character to party politics, from masks to rallies, from the Supreme Court to the pandemic to immigration and climate change. After more than a million individual communications, two things became clear: We have more common ground than we realize. And we are, sadly, failing at understanding each other. On issue after issue, our \\"divided\\" nation isn't nearly as polarized as we imagine. An overwhelming majority of voters believe in commonsense gun licensing and regulation. They are pro-immigration. They believe climate change is real and the coronavirus is deadly. They care deeply about their families and are willing to work hard to make ends meet. And, they believe that Washington is slow, bureaucratic, and not working in their best interests. In dozens of columns on these topics published in The Boston Globe, Hessan has upended common political wisdom. Presented together for the first time as part of this book, they reveal a unique perspective on how Americans actually think, what they value, and how we can move forward. The path to healing our divided nation is both simple and profound. We must turn down the heat. We must begin to listen, to stop presuming, to try to understand, to treat each other with dignity, and to know that most Americans are not crazy radicals. We truly share common ground. If we can pull together, we can have a much better America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dutyzgEACAAJ&dq=Our+Common+Ground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peace of Mind","description":"We can t heal with our minds alone. Thinking can be something productive and creative, but without integrating body and mind, much of our thinking is useless and unproductive. In Peace of Mind, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that integrating body and mind is the only way to be fully alive in each moment, without getting lost in our thoughts while walking, cooking, driving, and going about our everyday lives. Only by cultivating a mindful body and an embodied mind can we be fully alive. Bringing together ancient wisdom and contemporary thinking, Thich Nhat Hanh says it's like hardware and software if you don't have both, you can't do anything. Peace of Mind provides a foundation for beginning mindfulness practices and understanding the principles of mind/body awareness. By learning how our physical body and mind are inseparable in creating our own perceptions and experiences we can begin to trust and nourish our ability to create well-being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-qMtAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Message Sent: Retrieving the Gift of Love","description":"Terri Britt takes the reader on a journey to discovering a wondrous inner truth: the love you have been seeking has been there all along.

What she witnessed was a crisis of leadership rooted in a misunderstanding of what leading is all about. Not content to simply offer an opinion-opinions come cheap-she embarked on an eight-year research project to document the reasons for the rapid collapse of a global giant. That collapse, she shows us, began with one critical succession error and was compounded by a chronic failure to understand the importance of personality in the leadership equation. One wrong person at the helm turned a dream into a nightmare. In The Drama of Leadership, Patricia Pitcher shares her findings and, in the process, explodes a number of popular myths about leadership, including the one that leadership and vision are qualities that can be taught in management seminars. She refutes the common belief that leaders are in short supply and proves that the corporate talent pool abounds with potential leaders whose talents either go unrecognized or are tragically undervalued. And she explains why, at a time when vision, innovation, humanity, and passion are so desperately needed, so many companies cast in leadership roles people who possess none of these qualities, and who distrust anyone who does. But who are the good and bad leaders, and how do you identify them? In answer to this question, Patricia Pitcher identifies three types of leaders: Artists, who are people-oriented, open-minded, intuitive, and visionary; Craftsmen, to whom the adjectives \\"humane,\\" \\"dedicated,\\" and \\"wise\\" best apply; and Technocrats - brilliant and well-schooled in the latest theory, they are detail-oriented, rigid, methodical, self-centered, and, when left in control, pose a serious threat to corporate competitiveness. The power struggles between these types are dramas being played out in companies everywhere. Whether the story has a happy or an unhappy ending depends entirely upon which type gets top billing. The author also offers her wise recommendations on what companies can do to protect themselves against a technocratic hegemony and how to cultivate the talents of Artists and Craftsmen. She also tells you how to determine what type of leader you are and how to interact with other types to achieve both personal and corporate success. The Drama of Leadership is an articulate, insightful, passionate appeal to develop the kind of leaders and organizations that can take us into the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-hBD21mJwV8C&dq=Drama+Of+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place for Noah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kDWJMhwKjREC&dq=A+Place+for+Noah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The U.N.C.L.E. Tribute Book: Unofficial and Unauthorized-The Complete Story!!! : America's Favorite TV Spies!","description":"This book recovers a major nineteenth-century literary figure, the American Claimant. For over a century, claimants offered a compelling way to understand cultural difference across the Anglophone Atlantic, especially between Britain and the United States. They also formed a political talisman, invoked against slavery and segregation, or privileges of gender and class. Later, claimants were exported to South Africa, becoming the fictional form for explaining black students who acquired American degrees. American Claimants traces the figure back to lost-heir romance, and explores its uses. These encompassed real, imagined, and textual ideas of inheritance, for writers and editors, and also for missionaries, artists, and students. The claimant dramatized tensions between tradition and change, or questions of exclusion and power: it offered ways of seeing activism, education, sculpture, and dress. The premise for dozens of novels and plays, a trope, a joke, even the basis for real claims: claimants matter in theatre history and periodical studies, they touch on literary marketing and reprinting, and they illuminate some unexpected texts. These range from Our American Cousin to Bleak House, Little Lord Fauntleroy to Frederick Douglass' Paper; writers discussed include Frances Trollope, Julia Griffiths, Alexander Crummell, John Dube, James McCune Smith, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mark Twain. The focus on claimants yields remarkable finds: new faces, fresh angles, a lost column, and a forgotten theatrical genre. It reveals the pervasiveness of this form, and its centrality in imagining cultural contact and exchange.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v3XnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blade Dancer","description":"S.L.

Navigating through the urban jungles of Western cities like Vancouver and London, as well as the humid streets of Bangkok and Saigon, Daniel explores the multicultural minefields of sexuality and culture as he articulates the manners and contradictions of his desires. The politics of race, and the unspoken rules of gay Asian culture in both Western and Eastern settings, underscore Daniel's personal journey in which he recalls his teen years spent idolizing Bruce Lee and his fixation on an Asian schoolmate whose hazing becomes a sexual spectacle for him. As he enters adulthood, his desires become manifest as he explores the subcultures of Long Yang Clubs (where gay Asians and ''their admirers'' can meet) before departing for Asia, where his encounters often become transactions, and he learns the hard way that sexual desire has a human and emotional cost. Evoking the themes of Edward Said's Orientalism, The Rice Queen Diaries is as much a personal statement about culture and otherness as it is about gay desire. Traversing three continents, these diaries are a personal reckoning, a bold coming to terms with the nuances of sexuality that has relevance for all of us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xk3b0M2DD3oC&dq=The+Rice+Queen+Diaries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Here we stand: Nature and character of the Lutheran faith","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5HkHtMV3U0C&dq=Here+we+stand:+Nature+and+character+of+the+Lutheran+faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great tranquillity: Questions and answers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjBpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+tranquillity:+Questions+and+answers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures With a Microscope","description":"Embark on 59 adventures in the natural world: the structures of numerous microscopic animals; what everyday objects really look like at the cellular level; preparing specimens and slides. 142 illustrations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=74rq93Nl0nYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Missal: The Order of Mass in English","description":"A Commentary on the Order of Mass of The Roman Missal gathers the insights of some of today's foremost English-speaking liturgical scholars to aid in understanding this most recent edition of the Order of Mass and its new English translation.

Blowback, a term invented by the CIA, refers to the uninted consequences of American policies. In this sure-to-be-controversial book, Chalmers Johnson lays out in vivid detail the dangers faced by our overextended empire, which insists on projecting its military power to every corner of the earth and using American capital and markets to force global economic integration on its own terms. From a case of rape by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa to our role in Asia's financial crisis, from our early support for Saddam Hussein to our actions in the Balkans, Johnson reveals the ways in which our misguided policies are planting the seeds of future disaster. In the wake of the Cold War, the United States has imprudently expanded the commitments it made over the previous forty years, argues Johnson. In Blowback, he issues a warning we would do well to consider: it is time for our empire to demobilize before our bills come due.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZJmof-YXS60C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terror to Triumph: A Christian Perspective on 9-11","description":"\\"...so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground...\\" If you could view this world through the eyes of God Himself, how much more might you understand? How much wiser would you be? If you could know God's heart, how might your heart be changed? We are living through one of the most tragic events in world history. September 11 will forever stand as a new benchmark for evil in this world. At the first year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Dwight Vilhauer offers an insightful and reflective look at these tragic events, in his new book, TERROR to TRIUMPH; A Christian Perspective On 9-11. The events of September 11 have raised anew those challenging questions dealing with the problem of evil in the world. How can it coexist with God's love? As the author points out, \\"We continue to struggle with the problem of evil because it repeatedly challenges trust in our Creator as a God of love. September 11 is the latest, and perhaps one of the most profound examples of how evil can shake our faith to its core. We need to hear God's voice now more than ever, for strength and healing. At this turbulent and spiritually challenging point in time, when our ears have been filled with evil's threatening voice and news of terror reverberates unceasingly from every corner of the media, God still speaks. If we take time to listen to His voice, amidst all the noise and confusion, we will find solid foundational answers to our many questions.\\" In TERROR to TRIUMPH, Dwight Vilhauer leads you back to God's comforting voice where peace and rest are found. Discover how God works in a multitude of ways, through evil's great onslaught, to guide us, protect us, and lead us to ultimate victorywhenever the day of evil comes. TERROR to TRIUMPH is built upon eight insights that provide a basis for exploring how God works through the evil in this world to accomplish greater ends. Historical events from the Bible, and the teachings of our Savior Jesus Christ, are employed as launching points to explain how God's past victories over evil have direct application to victories that can be realized today. However, the book is not just about September 11. As the author observes, \\"It's really about how to deal with tragedy whenever the day of evil comes, and in whatever way it enters a person's life. My goal was to help people view the world through the eyes of God Himself and to become one with Him in understanding and purpose. I believe that is how the greatest victory over evil is realized.\\" From this vantage point, the reader is able to view issues of good vs. evil from a unique and spiritually edifying perspective. The result is an extremely refreshing and spiritually uplifting experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=titroUg4PUMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kill Now, Talk Forever: Debating Sacco and Vanzetti","description":"Principally an abridgement of the transcript of the trial as published in: The Sacco-Vanzetti case. 2nd ed.

Volumes One and Two of Keynes' classic work published in a handy one volume format. Exact facsimile of the original Edition. Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work was originally published in 1930 in two volumes. We reproduce this two volume edition in one volume. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested - which can happen if interest rates are too high - then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u4I5KQEACAAJ&dq=A+treatise+on+currency&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wildlife & Woodlot Management","description":"Great Falls, Montana, is where the Rockies end and where, in 1960, the Brinson family hopes to find a better life.

About 3 million teenagers contract an STD each year, and many will have long-term health problems as a result. Women and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these diseases and their health consequences. In addition, STDs increase the risk of HIV transmission. The Hidden Epidemic examines the scope of sexually transmitted infections in the United States and provides a critical assessment of the nation's response to this public health crisis. The book identifies the components of an effective national STD prevention and control strategy and provides direction for an appropriate response to the epidemic. Recommendations for improving public awareness and education, reaching women and adolescents, integrating public health programs, training health care professionals, modifying messages from the mass media, and supporting future research are included. The book documents the epidemiological dimensions and the economic and social costs of STDs, describing them as \\"a secret epidemic\\" with tremendous consequences. The committee frankly discusses the confusing and often hypocritical nature of how Americans deal with issues regarding sexuality--the conflicting messages conveyed in the mass media, the reluctance to promote condom use, the controversy over sex education for teenagers, and the issue of personal blame. The Hidden Epidemic identifies key elements of effective, culturally appropriate programs to promote healthy behavior by adolescents and adults. It examines the problem of fragmentation in STD services and provides examples of communities that have formed partnerships between stakeholders to develop integrated approaches. The committee's recommendations provide a practical foundation on which to build an integrated national program to help young people and adults develop habits of healthy sexuality. The Hidden Epidemic was written for both health care professionals and people without a medical background and will be indispensable to anyone concerned about preventing and controlling STDs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FWMFMzPqRCkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Character-Analysis","description":"Reich's classic work on the development and treatment of human character disorders, first published in 1933. As a young clinician in the 1920s, Wihelm Reich expanded psychoanalytic resistance into the more inclusive technique of character analysis, in which the sum total of typical character attitudes developed by an individual as a blocking against emotional excitations became the object of treatment. These encrusted attitudes functioned as an \\"armor,\\" which Reich later found to exist simultaneously in chronic muscular spasms. Thus mind and body came together and character analysis opened the way to a biophysical approach to disease and the prevention of it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ez7nNDjECOQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs, and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)","description":"As new medical technologies are developed, more and more human tissues such as skin, bones, heart valves, embryos, and stem cell lines are stored and distributed for therapeutic and research purposes. The accelerating circulation of human tissue fragments raises profound social and ethical concerns related to who donates or sells bodily tissue, who receives it, and who profits or does not from the transaction. Catherine Waldby and Robert Mitchell survey the rapidly expanding economies of exchange in human tissue, explaining the complex questions raised and suggesting likely developments. Comparing contemporary tissue economies in the United Kingdom and United States, they explore and complicate the distinction that has dominated practice and policy for several decades: the distinction between tissue as a gift to be exchanged in a transaction separate from the commercial market and tissue as a commodity to be traded for profit. Waldby and Mitchell pull together a prodigious amount of research involving policy reports and scientific papers, operating manuals, legal decisions, interviews, journalism, and Congressional testimony to offer a series of case studies based on particular forms of tissue exchange. They examine the effect of threats of contamination from HIV and other pathogens on blood banks  understandings of the gift/commodity relationship; the growth of autologous economies, in which individuals bank their tissues for their own use; the creation of the United Kingdom s Stem Cell bank, which facilitates the donation of embryos for stem cell development; and the legal and financial repercussions of designating some tissues  hospital waste.  They also consider the impact of different models of biotechnology patents on tissue economies and the relationship between experimental therapies to regenerate damaged or degenerated tissues and calls for a legal, for-profit market in organs. Ultimately, Waldby and Mitchell conclude that scientific technologies, the globalization of tissue exchange, and recent anthropological, sociological, and legal thinking have blurred any strict line separating donations from the incursion of market values into tissue economies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YfTlB2Y9QMEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A System of Logic","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EqVOAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Trail Ride: Meeting God in the Wide Open Spaces","description":"Celebrated western artist Jack Terry captures the essence of cowboy living in this collection of stories, prayers, and insights from life on the trail.

Shohat s critical method boldly transcends disciplinary and geographical boundaries. She explores such issues as the relations between ethnic studies and area studies, the paradoxical repercussions for audio-visual media of the  graven images  taboo, the allegorization of race through the refiguring of Cleopatra, the allure of imperial popular culture, and the gender politics of medical technologies.

From identity to multicultural society, new technologies to work, globalization to marginalization, anthropology has a vital contribution to make. While showcasing the intellectual power of the discipline, Eriksen takes the anthropological community to task for its unwillingness to engage more proactively with the media in a wide range of current debates. If anthropology matters as a key tool with which to understand modern society beyond the ivory towers of academia, why are so few anthropologists willing to come forward in times of national or global crisis? Eriksen argues that anthropology needs to rediscover the art of narrative and abandon arid analysis and, more provocatively, anthropologists need to lose their fear of plunging into the vexed issues modern societies present. Engaging Anthropology makes an impassioned plea for positioning anthropology as the universal intellectual discipline. Eriksen has provided the wake-up call we were all awaiting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M0UHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Singapore goes off the air,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fCQgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Singapore+goes+off+the+air,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inconceivable Danger","description":"Inconceivable Danger takes you into the world of an undercover police officer pursuing a suspect named Skyscraper, a kingpin drug dealer.

Grant's Overlooked Military Genius","description":"Ulysses S. Grant is often dismissed as a simple butcher of his troops. In fact, Grant was an inspired military leader with a genius for issuing lucid orders, maneuvering his troops adroitly, and making excellent use of his staff. Grant is unfairly maligned because of the bloody 1864 campaigns he conducted against Robert E. Lee to secure final victory for the Union. A Victor, Not a Butcher proves that, far from being a crude butcher (as he has been characterized not only by Southern partisans, but by many historians), Grant's casualty rates actually compared favorably with those of other Civil War generals. His perseverance, decisiveness, moral courage, and political acumen place him among the greatest generals of the Civil War - indeed, of all military history. Author Edward Bonekemper traces Grant's record of unparalleled success - Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Iuka, Corinth, Raymond, Jackson, Champion's Hill, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, the Overland Campaign, the James Crossing, Five Forks, Petersburg, and Appomattox - showing how Grant won his victories through expert execution of carefully planned military strategies, not the meat-grinder tactics of myth. This book also explores the paradoxes of Grant's early life and deals forthrightly with his struggles in civilian life - particularly the allegations of alcoholism and other factors that led his contemporaries (as well as historians of later generations) to underestimate him. Bonekemper identifies the key elements of Grant's success as a general. He even demonstrates that as a military strategist and leader, Grant outshone his much-lionized rival, Robert E. Lee. He examines casualty records that prove that Grant lost fewer men in his successful effort to take Richmond and end the war than his predecessors lost in making the same attempt and failing. Bonekemper proves that it was no historical accident that Grant accepted the surrender of three entire Confederate armies. (No other general on either side accepted the surrender of even one army until Sherman accepted the capitulation of the remnants of the Army of Tennessee at the war's end.) Grant's tactics are studied carefully by American military personnel to this day. Ulysses Grant won the Civil War. He was responsible for virtually all major Union victories. Bonekemper ably silences Grant's critics and restores Grant to the heroic reputation he so richly deserves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JWZ3AAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Victor,+Not+a+Butcher:+Ulysses+S.+Grant%27s+Overlooked+Military+Genius&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold: A Novel of the Sea","description":"'Whoever did this wanted to make very sure no one lived to tell the tale.'

Since they were Government property, the general turned over to the Department in 1953 these volumes and related source materials. In Army and National Archives custody these materials have been available for research although they have not been easily accessible. While he lived, General MacArthur was unwilling to approve the reproduction and dissemination of the reports, because he believed they needed further editing and correction of some inaccuracies. His passing permits publication but not the correction he deemed desirable. In publishing them, the Department of the Army must therefore disclaim any responsibility for their accuracy. But the Army also recognizes that these volumes have substantial and enduring value, and it believes the American people are entitled to have them made widely available through government publication. The preliminary work for compiling the MacArthur volumes began in 1943 within the G-3 Section of his General Staff, and was carried forward after the war by members of the G--2 Section, headed by Maj. Gen. Charles A. Willoughby with Professor Gordon W. Prange, on leave from the University of Maryland, as his principal professional assistant. Volume II of the reports represents the contributions of Japanese officers employed to tell their story of operations against MacArthur's forces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tSr4MAAACAAJ&dq=War+in+the+Pacific+Volume+VIII+(MacArthur%27s+Return)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby's First Bible Songs","description":"Ten Bible and holiday songs are presented to preschoolers in this brightly illustrated board book with plastic handle and clasp, the newest member of the First Bible Collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DN8KAAAACAAJ&dq=Baby%27s+First+Bible+Songs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge Management","description":"A straightforward guide to leveraging your company's intellectual capital by creating a knowledge management culture The Complete Guide to Knowledge Management offers managers the tools they need to create an organizational culture that improves knowledge sharing, reuse, learning, collaboration, and innovation to ensure mesurable growth.

The only book in English about the Shinsengumi, it focuses on the corps' two charismatic leaders, Kondo Isami and Hijikata Toshizo, both impeccable swordsmen. It is a historyinbrief of the final years of the Bakufu, which collapsed in 1867 with the restoration of Imperial rule. In writing Shinsengumi, Hillsborough referred mostly to Japaneselanguage primary sources, including letters, memoirs, journals, interviews, and eyewitness accounts, as well as definitive biographies and histories of the era. The fall of the shogun's government (Tokugawa Bakufu, or simply Bakufu) in 1868, which had ruled Japan for over two and a half centuries, was the greatest event in modern Japanese history. The revolution, known as the Meiji Restoration, began with the violent reaction of samurai to the Bakufu's decision in 1854 to open the theretofore isolated country to \\"Western barbarians.\\" Though opening the country was unavoidable, it was seen as a sign of weakness by the samurai who clamored to \\"expel the barbarians.\\" Those samurai plotted to overthrow the shogun and restore the holy emperor to his ancient seat of power. Screaming \\"heaven's revenge,\\" they wielded their swords with a vengeance upon those loyal to the shogun. They unleashed a wave of terror at the center of the revolution the emperor's capital of Kyoto. Murder and assassination were rampant. By the end of 1862, hordes of renegade samurai, called ronin, had transformed the streets of the Imperial Capital into a \\"sea of blood.\\" The shogun's administrators were desperate to stop the terror. A band of expert swordsmen was formed. It was given the name Shinsengumi (\\"Newly Selected Corps\\") and commissioned to eliminate the ronin and other enemies of the Bakufu. With unrestrained brutality bolstered by an official sanction to kill, the Shinsengumi soon became the shogun's most dreaded security force. In this vivid historical narrative of the Shinsengumi, the only one in the English language, author Romulus Hillsborough paints a provocative and thrilling picture of this most fascinating period in Japanese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jUzRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Love, and Romance in the Mass Media: Analysis and Criticism of Unrealistic Portrayals and Their Influence (Routledge Communication Series)","description":"Volume offers a critical examination of the portrayals of relationships in the various media and debunks the myths perpetuated there.

Whilst in a book this size not every argument can be presented, there is ample extra material to be found to encourage further engagement... At the end of each chapter, there is a very useful Further Reading section provided by the authors, which gives useful guidelines. I believe to be an extremely useful text, which addresses what has until now been a significant gap in the market. This book will be my first choice in the future for introducing doctoral students of management-related subject to the philosophical underpinning they require for their studies.

The African-American Migration Narrative (Race and American Culture)","description":"Twentieth-century America has witnessed the most widespread and sustained movement of African-Americans from the South to urban centers in the North. Who Set You Flowin'? examines the impact of this dislocation and urbanization, identifying the resulting Migration Narratives as a major genre in African-American cultural production. Griffin takes an interdisciplinary approach with readings of several literary texts, migrant correspondence, painting, photography, rap music, blues, and rhythm and blues. From these various sources Griffin isolates the tropes of Ancestor, Stranger, and Safe Space, which, though common to all Migration Narratives, vary in their portrayal. She argues that the emergence of a dominant portrayal of these tropes is the product of the historical and political moment, often challenged by alternative portrayals in other texts or artistic forms, as well as intra-textually. Richard Wright's bleak, yet cosmopolitan portraits were countered by Dorothy West's longing for Black Southern communities. Ralph Ellison, while continuing Wright's vision, reexamined the significance of Black Southern culture. Griffin concludes with Toni Morrison embracing the South \\"as a site of African-American history and culture,\\" \\"a place to be redeemed.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5bX-oS1XAXUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maternal-Infant Nursing Care, 3e","description":"A better way to learn maternal and newborn nursing!

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations. Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education. The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations. A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i-PLg2PsNd4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Covered Bridges of the Northeast","description":"A richly detailed account of bridge builders, the tools they used, and their finished masterpieces, this profusely illustrated work describes foot bridges, latticework and double-decked structures, drawbridges, and more.

The hitherto unpublished script for Viva Zapata! was written by John Steinbeck between 1948 and 1950; it is his only completely original screenplay. The film, directed by Elia Kazan and released by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1952, garnered several Academy Award nominations: best story and screenplay for Steinbeck, best actor in the title role for Marlon Brando, and best supporting actor for Anthony Quinn, who won for his role of Eufemio. This classic film and story about the part played by Emiliano Zapata in the Mexican Revolution, championing the cause of the peasants during the years between 1909 and 1919, treats themes familiar to readers of The Grapes of Wrath and In Dubious Battle. In his perceptive introductory essay, Robert E. Morsberger states that the screenplay puts into final focus issues with which Steinbeck had been concerned for the previous twenty years and  clarifies the relationship of issues to individuals and leaders to people. The conflict between creative dissent and intolerant militancy has a timeless relevancy, and Zapata deserves a close analysis both as a social statement and a work of art.   Any previously unpublished work of John Steinbeck is a welcome gift to American letters. This moving book combines two of the author s lifelong interests, his concern for the underdog and the artistic potential of the American film. Steinbeck Viva!

(Elementa 71)","description":"This book examines Heidegger's controversial relation to politics as it grows out of his understanding of his predecessors in German Idealism, most notably, Hegel. This way of developing a dialogue between Heidegger and Hegel on the issue of politics provides an important context for questioning the former's link with National Socialism. Yet the book does not simply condemn Heidegger for his Nazi involvement nor claim that his thinking is free from dangerous political implications. On the contrary, a second level of questioning asks whether Heidegger's philosophy can be appropriated in alternative contexts which permit the affirmation of democratic principles. Thus the book concludes by examining the import which Heidegger's thought has on cultivating such democratic motifs as freedom of speech and civil disobedience. The book is especially of interest to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and scholars in the areas of German idealism, phenomenology, social and political philosophy, and the history of philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uZ9PCHg_6y4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silenced voices: the 'history wars' have been conducted in the substantial absence of indigenous voices and with an exclusion of non-Western forms of ... listen anew.: An article from: Arena Magazine","description":"While indigenous peoples make up around 370 million of the world's population - some 5 per cent - they constitute around one-third of the world's 900 million extremely poor rural people.

While this movement has been characterized as a religious movement devoted to the rights of the unborn, I argue that since the early 1980s an important faction within the movement has contended that women, as well as the unborn, are victims of abortion. Drawing on textual analysis and interviews, I trace the rise of attempts to restrict access to abortion based on the claim that abortions are harmful to women who have them. The use of women-centered strategies has three consequences. First, the argument that abortion harms women has shaped scientific inquiry. Antiabortion organizations claim that abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and various mental disorders. However, these claims have been disputed by scientists and scientific institutions. Comparing the controversy over breast cancer risk with that over mental health outcomes, I show that researchers who are critical of abortion employ a range of tactics to prolong conflict and further politicize these scientific issues. Second, these strategies have led to new understandings of women who regret their abortions. These understandings are constructed within a network that includes women who regret their abortion, prolife researchers, therapists, movement leaders, and mental health researchers. Finally, women-centered strategies have had a profound impact on the policies that regulate abortion care in the United States. By juxtaposing scientific claims alongside narratives of abortion's harm to women, prolife groups have developed a framework that resonates with policymakers and federal judges. This research makes significant contributions to science studies and studies of social movements. Analyses of the process by which scientific debates end typically focus on the mechanisms that foreclose further inquiry and exclude dissenting voices. My research demonstrates that these mechanisms work differently depending on the social context and can, in some cases, serve to continue rather than end controversy. Additionally, this work expands on previous studies of the construction of identity and role of expertise in social movements as well as the impact of framing on social movement success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P_y3tAEACAAJ&dq=Abortion%27s+Second+Victim.,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poems of Childhood","description":"A collection of poems for and about children, many suitable for bedtime reading, including such classics as \\"The Duel,\\" \\"Little Boy Blue,\\" and \\"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=inbfOgmIHoIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Original Tao","description":"Presents a translation and commentary to the oldest known extant Taoist text, Inward Training (Nei-yeh), which is composed of short poetic verses devoted to the practice of breath meditation and its resultant insights about human nature and the cosmos.

Labor every day to be more humble and more low and little in your own eyes.\\" A significant concern for Brooks was how believers viewed themselves after they became Christians. After all, inheriting eternal life, gaining the riches of grace, being in favor with God may cause the recipient to be puffed up with pride, much like the Pharisees and religious leaders of the New Testament. But for Brooks, the true Christian is more willing to wash the feet of others than to have his feet washed. The believer who desires to walk in humility views themselves through the lens of Christ, who bore the cross in shame and disgrace to purchase salvation for sinners. A humble heart serves. A humble heart loves. A humble heart recognizes that not even a crumb of mercy is deserved. You are about to embark on a journey of the soul. Brooks enters every room of your heart and applies Scripture to clean out the cobwebs of bitterness, pride, and self-righteousness. You will be challenged, changed, and connected to the fountain from which all humility flows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0zBkzgEACAAJ&dq=Least+Of+All+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern spearfishing: (incorporating Spearfishing, a handbook for beginners),","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vpQIjwEACAAJ&dq=Modern+spearfishing:+(incorporating+Spearfishing,+a+handbook+for+beginners),&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinosaurs: A Global View","description":"Dinosaurs have long presented a fascinating enigma to man: What did they look like?

In exchange the merchants were provided with large quantities of silver coins or dirhams, which had a powerful influence on the merchants' home areas with little or no silver of their own. The trade precipitated the Vikings' penetration into the interior of European Russia, fostered the emergence of new towns, provided the original impetus for the formation of the Rus' and Volgar Bulgar states, and helped transform the Khazar economy and state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ymeGAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Islamic+World,+Russia+and+the+Vikings,+750-900:+The+Numismatic+Evidence+(Variorum+Collected+Studies+Series,+595)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus,","description":"Nostradamus began to write his prophetic verses in the city of Salon, in 1554. They are divided into ten sections called Centuries (which refers to the number of verses in each section, not to a unit of 100 years). The Centuries were published in 1555 and 1558, and have been in print continuously ever since. Nostradamus had the visions which he later recorded in verse while staring into water or flame late at night, sometimes aided by herbal stimulants, while sitting on a brass tripod. The resulting quatrains (four line verses) are oblique and elliptical, and use puns, anagrams and allegorical imagery. Most of the quatrains are open to multiple interpretations, and some make no sense whatsoever. Some of them are chilling, literal descriptions of events, giving specific or near- specific names, geographic locations, astrological configurations, and sometimes actual dates. It is this quality of both vagueness and specificity which allows each new generation to reinterpret Nostradamus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&dq=The+complete+prophecies+of+Nostradamus,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discoursing Sweet Music: Brass Bands and Community Life in Turn-of-the-Century Pennsylvania (Music in American Life)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zPqX35ezbR4C&dq=Discoursing+Sweet+Music:+Brass+Bands+and+Community+Life+in+Turn-of-the-Century+Pennsylvania+(Music+in+American+Life)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History and Stories of Springville, Pictou County, Nova Scotia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t6gcAAAACAAJ&dq=History+and+Stories+of+Springville,+Pictou+County,+Nova+Scotia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dogs of War","description":"#1 New York Times bestselling author Frederick Forsyth delivers an international thriller that takes readers into the darkest hearts of men and nations  In a remote corner of the impoverished African republic of Zangaro lies Crystal Mountain.

Let loose among the neglected wives of the ritzy county of Rutshire, Lysander causes absolute havoc. But it is only when he meets Rannaldini, Rutshire's King Rat and a temperamental, fiendishly promiscuous international conductor, that the trouble really starts. The only unglamorous woman around Rannaldini is Kitty, his plump young wife who runs his life like clockwork.

Kirsten Powers has given us a great gift at an urgent hour.\\" --Jon Meacham For years, New York Times bestselling author Kirsten Powers has been center stage for many of our nation's most searing political and cultural battles as a columnist, TV analyst, and one-time participant in the thunderdome of Twitter. On a good day, there will be civil disagreement. On a bad day, it's all-out trench warfare--nothing but a cycle of outrage and self-righteousness. More and more, Powers finds herself wondering, along with countless Americans: How are we to cope with this non-stop madness? In Saving Grace, Powers writes with wit and insight about our country's poisonous political discourse, chronicling the efforts she's made to stay grounded and preserve her sanity in a post-truth era that has driven many of us to the edge. She draws on lessons offered by faith leaders, therapists, theologians, social scientists, and activists working for change today. She dismantles the widespread misconception that grace means being nice, letting people get away with harmful behavior, or choosing neutrality in the name of peace. Grace, she argues, is anything but an act of surrender; instead, it is a kinetic and transformative force. Saving Grace offers a template for a different kind of America, one where we can engage with people who hold opposing views without sacrificing our values or our passionate beliefs in the causes we care about.

In 1991, the band toured North America for the first time shadowed by journalist Chris Heath and legendary rock photographer Pennie Smith. They visited fourteen cities in one month, confronting the American music industry and colliding with the likes of Liza Minnelli, Steven Spielberg and Axl Rose. This is more than a documentary of a tour; it is an unusually intimate portrait of two maverick British musicians always reluctant to compromise.  There was a time when the Pet Shop Boys seemed to exist entirely on radio, television and in magazines. This is the other world of the Pet Shop Boys in concert, travel and backstage, as they bring their art and glamour to America. It s funny too.

Widely read and quoted it has had a unique influence on teaching and research. This second edition draws on the great volume of new research - produced by Lord Briggs amongst others, since its original publication. The book stresses both the underlying unity and the rich variety of the age, and raises fundamental issues about a period of crucial change in British history - industrialisation, war, constitutional change and the attitudes of politicians towards it, political development, and, not least, society and culture. In the background are the new economic powers based on the development of a coal and iron technology; in the foreground, new social and political problems and new ways of tackling them. The author also discusses perceptions of, and reactions to, changing circumstances, the influence of religion and science on national life, and changing styles in art and literature. The story ends, not with a full stop but with a question mark. Could improvement be maintained? Could balance and progress continue to be reconciled?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UWbXAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frank Frazetta/bk#2","description":"Includes authors, titles, subjects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jwgvAQAAIAAJ&dq=Frank+Frazetta/bk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Case of the Constant Suicides","description":"Dr. Gideon Fell investigates a series of strange deaths in the Scottish Highlands.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RAIPAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Case+of+the+Constant+Suicides&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dos for Dummies Quick Reference","description":"If you aren t a proficient PC pro and you want to get answers and get going, this is your practical reference.

Post-process theorists hold that the practice of writing cannot be captured by a generalized process or a \\"big\\" theory. Most post-process theorists hold three assumptions about the act of writing: writing is public; writing is interpretive; and writing is situated. The first assumption is the commonsensical claim that writing constitutes a public interchange. By \\"interpretive act,\\" post-process theorists generally mean something as broad as \\"making sense of\\" and not exclusively the ability to move from one code to another. To interpret means more than merely to paraphrase; it means to enter into a relationship of understanding with other language users. And finally, because writing is a public act that requires interpretive interaction with others, writers always write from some position or some place. Writers are never nowhere; they are \\"situated.\\" Leading theorists and widely published scholars in the field, contributors are Nancy Blyler, John Clifford, Barbara Couture, Nancy C.

Statistics show that 50 percent of what determines divorce is genetic temperament.

Your finely tuned nervous system, which picks up on subtleties and reflects deeply, would be a romantic asset if both you and your partner understood you better. But without that understanding, your sensitivity is likely to be making your close relationships painful and complicated. Based on Elaine N. Aron s groundbreaking research on temperament and intimacy, The Highly Sensitive Person in Love offers practical help for highly sensitive people seeking happier, healthier romantic relationships. From low-stress fighting to sensitive sexuality, the book offers a wealth of practical advice on making the most of all personality combinations.

A decade later, despite having been an avowed opponent of the death penalty, Edison threw his laboratory resources and reputation behind the creation of a very different sort of device--the electric chair. Deftly exploring this startling chapter in American history, Edison & the Electric Chair delivers both a vivid portrait of a nation on the cusp of modernity and a provocative new examination of Edison himself. Edison championed the electric chair for reasons that remain controversial to this day. Was Edison genuinely concerned about the suffering of the condemned? Was he waging a campaign to smear his rival George Westinghouse's alternating current and boost his own system? Or was he warning the public of real dangers posed by the high-voltage alternating wires that looped above hundreds of America's streets? Plumbing the fascinating history of electricity, Mark Essig explores America's love of technology and its fascination with violent death, capturing an era when the public was mesmerized and terrified by an invisible force that produced blazing light, powered streetcars, carried telephone conversations--and killed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mAwVz2-CeX8C&dq=Edison+and+the+Electric+Chair+:+A+Story+of+Light+and+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mechanical Engineers' Handbook Fifth Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dv8KMwEACAAJ&dq=Mechanical+Engineers%27+Handbook+Fifth+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SMALL MIRACLE","description":"The figures in a Nativity scene come to life to help an old woman in need at Christmas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EFg_YgEACAAJ&dq=THE+SMALL+MIRACLE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Like a Dream, Like a Fantasy--the Zen Writings and Translations of Nyogen Senzaki","description":"Just as D.T.

Instead, he offends the sea god, Poseidon, who dooms him to years of shipwreck and wandering. Battling man-eating monsters, violent storms, and the supernatural seductions of sirens and sorceresses, Odysseus will need all his strength and cunning--and a little help from Mount Olympus--to make his way home and seize his kingdom from the schemers who seek to wed his queen and usurp his throne.

Members sought to challenge the prevailing social attitudes of their day by creating a society in which \\"the rights of all are equal without distinction of sex, color or condition, sect or religion.\\" This volume brings together a remarkable set of seventy-five letters written by the members of the Stetson family, who belonged to the Association for almost four years. Discovered recently by a family descendant, the correspondence documents the thoughts and experiences of ordinary people struggling to uphold common ideals in challenging circumstances. The letters re-create an extended family conversation in which news was shared, stories were told, hopes and fears expressed, and ideas discussed. We meet James Stetson, an ambivalent family patriarch with a wry sense of humor. There is Almira, his eldest child, who strove earnestly to work for her family and wrote movingly of her dreams of a career in service to her principles. And there is Dolly Witter Stetson, James's wife and the central figure in this collection, whom we first meet as she was about to give birth for the ninth time and whose relish for community life was shaped by a lively intelligence, a commitment to exploring reform ideals, and a down-to-earth view of family duties and household burdens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbIctAEACAAJ&dq=Letters+from+an+American+Utopia:+The+Stetson+Family+and+the+Northampton+Association,+1843-1847&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Watermelon Sugar","description":"Death is a place where the sun shines a different colour every day and where people travel to the length of their dreams.

By mapping the intricate social worlds of street gangs and \\"corner boys,\\" Whyte was among the first to demonstrate that a poor community need not be socially disorganized.

Why does Al Gore believe that cars pose  a mortal threat to the security of every nation ? Why does the Princeton professor known as the father of the animal rights movement object to humans eating animals but not to humans having sex with them and why does PETA defend that position? In other words, why do smart people fall for stupid ideas? The answer, Daniel J. Flynn reveals in Intellectual Morons, is ideology. Flynn, the author of Why the Left Hates America, shows how people can be so blinded to reality by the causes they serve that they espouse bizarre, sometimes ridiculous, and often dangerous positions. The most influential social movements have spawned ideologues who do not care whether an idea is good or bad, true or false, but only whether it can serve their cause. It is startling how many Americans and particularly how many media, academic, and political elites fall for bad ideas. The trouble is, their lies become institutionalized as truth, and we all suffer as a result. In Intellectual Morons, Flynn reveals: ?How rabid anti-Americans simply parrot the delusional claims of a few gurus ?How the environmental movement, spawned by a  scientist  whose doomsday predictions are almost always wrong, has bred fanaticism, stupidity, and dishonesty ?How the hero of the animal rights crowd is a crank who promotes infanticide and euthanasia ?How a scientific fraud and pervert launched the sexual revolution ?How abortion rights activists ignore (or cover up) the fact that their matron saint advocated eugenics and concentration camps ?How our universities have become hothouses of leftist ideology ?How historians and journalists have airbrushed history to turn a racial separatist into a civil rights icon Filled with jaw-dropping lapses in common sense from even our most celebrated opinion leaders, Intellectual Morons is a welcome reality check for the glaring excesses of today s political and cultural debates. \\"This is a sophisticated pile driver of a book, guiding us through the wiles of great luminaries of the netherworld. And such liveliness in the writing, and such erudition. I was quite fascinated by Intellectual Morons.\\" William F. Buckley, Jr. \\"Intellectual Morons is exceptionally aptly named. The thought of all that brainpower going down the intellectual drain is sad, but Daniel Flynn's description of it is hilariously on point. This is must reading.\\" G. Gordon Liddy \\"Intellectual Morons is a delight a wonderful intellectual history of the past hundred years. Flynn ably describes the purveyors of the bad ideas that have undermined our free society.\\" Burton W. Folsom, Jr., professor of history, Hillsdale College \\"A famous bit of folk wisdom says, 'You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.' Some of the crackpot notions now fashionable in academic circles, as here documented by Daniel Flynn, suggest that saying is an understatement.

He also declared that science would make the  remote reaches of the mind accessible  and cure psychiatric illness with breakthrough medications. We were walking on the moon within the decade. But today, psychiatric cures continue to elude us as does the mind itself. Why is it that we still don t understand how the mind works? What is the difference between the mind and the brain? And given all that we still don t know, how can we make insightful, transformative choices about our psychiatric conditions? When Daniel Bergner s younger brother was diagnosed as bipolar and put on a locked ward in the 1980s, psychiatry seemed to have achieved what JFK promised: a revolution of chemical solutions to treat mental illness. Yet as Bergner s brother was deemed a dire risk for suicide and he and his family were told his disorder would be lifelong, he found himself taking heavy doses of medications with devastating side effects. Now, in recounting his brother s journey alongside the gripping, illuminating stories of Caroline, who is beset by the hallucinations of psychosis, and David, who is overtaken by depression, Bergner examines the evolution of how we treat our psyches. He reveals how the pharmaceutical industry has perpetuated our biological view of the mind and our drug-based assumptions about treatment despite the shocking price paid by many patients and the problematic evidence of drug efficacy. And he takes us into the pioneering labs of today s preeminent neuroscientists, sharing their remarkably candid reflections and fascinating new theories of treatment. The Mind and the Moon raises profound questions about how we understand ourselves and the essential human divide between our brains and our minds. This is a book of thought-provoking reframings, delving into the science and spirit of our psyches. It is about vulnerability and personal dignity, the terrifying choices confronted by families and patients, and the prospect of alternatives. In The Mind and the Moon, Bergner beautifully explores how to seek a deeper engagement with ourselves and one another and how to find a better path toward caring for our minds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hO49EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People of the Deer","description":"In 1886, the Ihalmiut people of northern Canada numbered seven thousand; by 1946, when Farley Mowat began his two-year stay in the Arctic, the population had fallen to just forty. With them, he observed for the first time the phenomenon that would inspire him for the rest of his life: the millennia-old migration of the Arctic's caribou herds. He also endured bleak, interminable winters, suffered agonizing shortages of food, and witnessed the continual, devastating intrusions of outsiders bent on exploitation. Here, in this classic and first book to demonstrate the mammoth literary talent that would produce some of the most memorable books of the next half-century, best-selling author Farley Mowat chronicles his harrowing experiences. People of the Deer is the lyrical ethnography of a beautiful and endangered society. It is a mournful reproach to those who would manipulate and destroy indigenous cultures throughout the world. Most of all, it is a tribute to the last People of the Deer, the diminished Ihalmiuts, whose calamitous encounter with our civilization resulted in their unnecessary demise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4YnqyoM4i-gC&dq=People+of+the+Deer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New View of Society: Or, Essays on the Formation of the Human Character Preparatory to the Development of a plan for gradually ameliorating the Condition of Mankind","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r-8xAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Open Book","description":"The #1 New York Times Bestseller Jessica reveals for the first time her inner monologue and most intimate struggles.

She walked away from the offer, and nobody understood why. The truth is that she didn t want to lie. Jessica couldn t be authentic with her readers if she wasn t fully honest with herself first.

Basil, son of a father who values the family pedigree and who would not let him marry below his station, falls in love at first sight with a girl he sees on a bus. He follows her and discovers she is Margaret Sherwin, only daughter of a linen draper. He persuades her father to let him marry her secretly. He agrees on the condition, that, as his daughter is only seventeen, they live apart for the first year. At first the secret works, but then the mysterious Mannion, whose emotions cannot be read in his face, returns from abroad. On the last night of the year Basil follows Margaret and Mannion and discovers them in flagrante delicto. Basil attacks Mannion in the street and tries to murder him, but succeeds only in mutilating his face by pushing it into the fresh tarmacadam in the road. Mannion survives, recovers and swears revenge, and it is revealed that Basil's father indirectly caused Mannion's father to be hanged for forgery. Basil repudiates Margaret, but Sherwin threatens him with exposure unless he holds to his marriage. Basil confesses to his father, who disowns him, but his sister Clara stands by him. Basil's brother Ralph undertakes to buy Sherwin off, but meanwhile Margaret flees to Mannion, thereby acknowledging her guilt. Visiting Mannion in hospital, she catches typhus and dies. Basil, having been put on her track by Ralph, visits her on her deathbed.Basil flees from Mannion to Cornwall. The denouement is worthy of Conan Doyle, set among whirlpools and cliffs near Lands End... In her introduction (Oxford World's Classics Edition), Dorothy Goldman applies psychoanalytic theories to argue that Basil and Mannion, Margaret and Clara, are each like opposite halves of the same person. A further doublet is between the active Ralph and the passive Basil, as the former notes in his dialogue. Mrs Sherwin, Margaret's mother, is apparently feeble-minded and as such is the precursor of Sarah Leeson and other of Collins' deranged woman characters - though she is astute enough to suspect Margaret and Mannion's guilty secret.... William Wilkie Collins (8 January 1824 - 23 September 1889) was an English novelist, playwright, and short story writer. His best-known works are The Woman in White (1859), No Name (1862), Armadale (1866), and The Moonstone (1868). The last is considered the first modern English detective novel. Born into the family of painter William Collins in London, he lived with his family in Italy and France as a child and learned French and Italian. He worked as a clerk for a tea merchant. After his first novel, Antonina, was published in 1850, he met Charles Dickens, who became a close friend, mentor and collaborator. Some of Collins's works were first published in Dickens' journals All the Year Round and Household Words and the two collaborated on drama and fiction. Collins published his best known works in the 1860s, achieved financial stability and an international reputation. During that time he began suffering from gout. After taking opium for the pain, he developed an addiction. During the 1870s and 1880s the quality of his writing declined along with his health. Collins was critical of the institution of marriage and never married; he split his time between Caroline Graves, except for a two-year separation, and his common-law wife Martha Rudd, with whom he had three children.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H8SdDAEACAAJ&dq=Basil:+A+novel+(Wilkie+Collin%27s+novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Sermons for Funeral Services","description":"An affordable collection of simple sermons to help busy pastors prepare biblical messages for funerals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s2vQHmDMG8cC&dq=Simple+Sermons+for+Funeral+Services&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shaarei Teshuva: = The Gates of repentance (The Torah classics library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_4J9AAAAMAAJ&dq=Shaarei+Teshuva:+%3D+The+Gates+of+repentance+(The+Torah+classics+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Worst Team Money Could Buy","description":"Two sportswriters offer a close-up look at the Mets' disastrous 1992 season, explaining the failure of most expensive group of baseball players ever assembled and providing a behind-the-scenes look at the season's intrigues and scandals. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qoiNPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Worst+Team+Money+Could+Buy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Works of William Blake (Wordsworth Poetry Library)","description":"William Blake is one of England's most original artists whose works aim to liberate imaginative energies.

The facility they commandeered was more than a secret station on the ocean floor. Atlantis was an exit strategy for the corporate elite, a place where the world's Movers and Shakers had hidden from the doomsday microbe ?ehemoth--and from the hordes of the moved and the shaken left behind. For five years \\"rifters\\" and \\"corpses\\" have lived in a state of uneasy truce, united by fear of the outside world. But now that world closes in. An unknown enemy hunts them through the crushing darkness of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. ?ehemoth--twisted, mutated, more virulent than ever--has found them already. The fragile armistice between the rifters and their one-time masters has exploded into all-out war, and not even the legendary Lenie Clarke can take back the body count. Billions have died since she loosed ?ehemoth upon the world. Billions more are bound to. The whole biosphere came apart at the seams while Lenie Clarke hid at the bottom of the sea and did nothing. But now there is no place left to hide. The consequences of past acts reach inexorably to the very floor of the world, and Lenie Clarke must return to confront the mess she made. Redemption doesn't come easy with the blood of a world on your hands. But even after five years in pitch-black purgatory, Lenie Clarke is still Lenie Clarke. There will be consequences for anyone who gets in her way-and worse ones, perhaps, if she succeeds...

These accounts deal candidly with the rather remarkable array of impediments that faced travelers in Alabama in its first decades as a state, and they describe with wonder, interest, and, frequently with some disgust, the road, the inns, the travelling companions, and the few and raw communities they encountered as they made their way, often with difficulty, through what seemed to many of them uncharted wilderness.

The book is organized into four parts. The first three cover the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, integral equations, and partial differential equations of quasi-linear form. Most of the techniques are evaluated from the standpoints of accuracy, convergence, and stability (in the various senses of these terms) as well as ease of coding and convenience of machine computation. The last part, on practical problems, uses and develops the techniques for the treatment of problems of the greatest difficulty and complexity, which tax not only the best machines but also the best brains. This book was written for scientists who have problems to solve, and who want to know what methods exist, why and in what circumstances some are better than others, and how to adapt and develop techniques for new problems. The budding numerical analyst should also benefit from this book, and should find some topics for valuable research. The first three parts, in fact, could be used not only by practical men but also by students, though a preliminary elementary course would assist the reading.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mHTiBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penrod","description":"A timeless novel in the spirited tradition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn One of the most popular American authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Pulitzer Prize winner Booth Tarkington was acclaimed for his novels set in small Midwestern towns.

In a vivid account of what female primates themselves actually do to secure their own reproductive advantage, she demolishes myths about sexually passive, \\"coy,\\" compliant, exclusively nurturing females. Her lucid and compelling account of the great range of behaviors in many species of primates expands the concept of female nature to include the full range of selection pressures on females, and reminds us of the true complexity and dynamism of the evolutionary story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-t0MIGiENvsC&dq=Woman+That+Never+Evolved&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stampede to timberline: The ghost towns and mining camps of Colorado","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OZdmxgEACAAJ&dq=Stampede+to+timberline:+The+ghost+towns+and+mining+camps+of+Colorado&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hungry Hill","description":"The story of a deadly curse that afflicted an Irish family for a hundred years. \\"I tell you your mine will be in ruins and your home destroyed and your children forgotten . . . but this hill will be standing still to confound you.\\" So curses Morty Donovan when Copper John Brodrick builds his mine at Hungry Hill.

In this three-generational novel, Andre? Makine beautifully but unsparingly describes the almost uninterrupted succession of violence, misery, and horror that has been visited on the Russian people since the October Revolution of 1917. A young Russian army doctor is sent to distant shores to bind the wounds of those in Africa, the Near East, and South America who are pawns in the global political chess game during the Cold War. Recruited by an intelligence agent, he experiences the bloody reality of revolution on the ground. The book casts its eye back toward his grandfather Nikolai, a Red cavalry soldier fighting the Whites in 1920, and his father, whose story of World War II is invoked with a passion and force that bear comparison to the best writing on the subject. From the battlefields of the 1920s to the harsh African heat and dust of the desert in the 1980s, from the orphanage where the narrator spent his youth to the art galleries and chic salons of the glittering new West, Requiem for a Lost Empire has all the sweep and depth, all the beauty and insight of the great Russian novels.

Battling the Inland Sea is a powerful evocation of the losses and gains involved in battling the mighty Sacramento River. But more than this, it is an exploration of the national will as it sought to rearrange nature herself with such mixed results.

In Sarmiento Park, the green heart of C rdoba, a group of trans sex workers make their nightly rounds. When a cry comes from the dark, their leader, the 178-year-old Auntie Encarna, wades into the brambles to investigate and discovers a baby half dead from the cold. She quickly rallies the pack to save him, and they adopt the child into their fascinating surrogate family as they have so many other outcasts, including Camila. Sheltered in Auntie Encarna s fabled pink house, they find a partial escape from the everyday threats of disease and violence, at the hands of clients, cops, and boyfriends.

Drawing on a rich array of sources, the authors interweave the perceptions of medical practitioners, the mentally ill and their families, and journalists, poets, novelists, and artists. As they trace successive ways of explaining madness and treating those judged insane, Gamwell and Tomes vividly depict the political and cultural dimensions of American attitudes toward mental illness.\\" \\"Gamwell and Tomes observe telling differences in the ways in which patients of different genders, races, and classes have been diagnosed and treated. The authors demonstrate how definitions of madness figured in national debates over abolitionism, women's rights, and alternative medicine. Madness in America also considers how the boundaries between sanity and insanity have been repeatedly redrawn in such areas as sexual behavior and criminality.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Written in his own words, this history-making autobiography is Martin Luther King: the mild-mannered, inquisitive child and student who chafed under and eventually rebelled against segregation; the dedicated young minister who continually questioned the depths of his faith and the limits of his wisdom; the loving husband and father who sought to balance his family's needs with those of a growing, nationwide movement; and the reflective, world-famous leader who was fired by a vision of equality for people everywhere. Relevant and insightful, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. offers King's seldom disclosed views on some of the world's greatest and most controversial figures: John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, Mahatma Gandhi, and Richard Nixon. It also paints a rich and moving portrait of a people, a time, and a nation in the face of powerful change. Finally, it shows how everyday Americans from all walks of life confronted themselves, each other, and the burden of the past-and how their fears and courage helped shape our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pynSnGuC964C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening The Door","description":"First published in 1995.

His most recent published work is a solo piano piece, Une page d  ph m ride, written some sixty years after his first attempts at composition. The piano has remained central to Boulez's creative work throughout his career, and although his renown as a conductor has to some extent overshadowed his other achievements, it was as a performer of his own piano music that his practical gifts first found expression. Peter O'Hagan has given performances of various unpublished piano works by Boulez, including Antiphonie from the Third Sonata and Trois Psalmodies. In this study, he considers Boulez's writing for the piano in the context of the composer's stylistic evolution throughout the course of his development. Each of the principal works is considered in detail, not only on its own terms, but also as a stage in Boulez's ongoing quest to invent radical solutions to the renewal of musical language and to reinvigorate tradition. The volume includes reference to hitherto unpublished source material, which sheds light on his working methods and on the interrelationship between works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sjglDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holidays at Home Cookbook (Seasonal Cookbook Collection)","description":"Simple recipes that capture the traditional holiday celebrations we remember from Grandma's house.

He provides the revelation of what happened on the cross and in the tomb, and how that affects who and what we are in Christ today. Legendary Bible teacher E. W.

An eccentric millionaire who loathes all canines, is struck with admiration for any cat with the guts to go out and avenge his entire race and decides to adopt him. Thaddeus Whitcomb Banner (the dog-hating millionaire), charmed by the cat's pugnacious attitude, calls his new pet, Rhubarb, a baseball term for a violent and noisy altercation. Rhubarb takes a liking to Thad and his press secretary Eric Yaeger, but he is indifferent if not downright vicious to everyone else. When his owner dies only forty-eight hours after signing his last will and testament, Rhubarb is there, sitting in his master's lap. In his will, Thad praises Rhubarb for his unsparing love and solace and thereby leaves him his entire fortune, including ownership of a professional baseball team, the New York Loons. Eric Yaeger is appointed Rhubarb's guardian, and Thad's daughter Myra, a mean-spirited young hipster doofus, is summarily disinherited. Although initially reluctant to play baseball for a team owned by a cat, Loons players are tricked into believing that Rhubarb is a good luck charm and subsequently begin winning games. Meanwhile, Myra, not about to let a cat get away with her millions, begins a lawsuit to have the will invalidated, while her lawyer is part of a scheme to have Rhubarb murdered by a woman who has a mysterious connection to Myra. As for Eric, Rhubarb's frantic guardian -- well, Eric faces challenges only a fierce and concupiscent kitty cat can provide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fl1QCgAAQBAJ&dq=Rhubarb+(The+New+York+Loons)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palestinian Refugees: The Right of Return (Pluto Middle Eastern Studies,)","description":"With contributions from a range of international experts, including Edward W.

The War of 1812 saw America threatened on every side. Encouraged by the British, Indian tribes attacked settlers in the West, while the Royal Navy terrorized the coasts. By mid-1814, President James Madison s generals had lost control of the war in the North, losing battles in Canada. Then British troops set the White House ablaze, and a feeling of hopelessness spread across the country. Into this dire situation stepped Major General Andrew Jackson. A native of Tennessee who had witnessed the horrors of the Revolutionary War and Indian attacks, he was glad America had finally decided to confront repeated British aggression. But he feared that President Madison s men were overlooking the most important target of all: New Orleans. If the British conquered New Orleans, they would control the mouth of the Mississippi River, cutting Americans off from that essential trade route and threatening the previous decade s Louisiana Purchase. The new nation s dreams of western expansion would be crushed before they really got off the ground. So Jackson had to convince President Madison and his War Department to take him seriously, even though he wasn t one of the Virginians and New Englanders who dominated the government. He had to assemble a coalition of frontier militiamen, French-speaking Louisianans,Cherokee and Choctaw Indians, freed slaves, and even some pirates. And he had to defeat the most powerful military force in the world in the confusing terrain of the Louisiana bayous. In short, Jackson needed a miracle. The local Ursuline nuns set to work praying for his outnumbered troops. And so the Americans, driven by patriotism and protected by prayer, began the battle that would shape our young nation s destiny. As they did in their two previous bestsellers, Kilmeade and Yaeger make history come alive with a riveting true story that will keep you turning the pages. You ll finish with a new understanding of one of our greatest generals and a renewed appreciation for the brave men who fought so that America could one day stretch  from sea to shining sea.

We often smile and nod to each other even though deep down we could not disagree more. Whether with colleagues, friends, or family members, the tendency to paper over differences rather than confront them is extremely common. We believe that the best thing to do to preserve our relationships and to ensure that our work gets done as expeditiously as possible is to silence conflict. Let s face it, most bosses don t encourage us to share our differences. Indeed, many people are taught that loyal employees accept corporate values, policies, and decisions never challenging or questioning them. If we want to hold on to our jobs and move up in our organizations, stifling conflict is the safest way to do it or so we believe. And it is not just with our bosses that we fear raising a dissenting opinion. We worry about what our peers and even our subordinates may think of us. We don t want to embarrass ourselves or create a bad impression. We don t want to lose others  respect or risk rejection. We often associate conflict with its negative form petty bickering, heated arguing, a bloody fight. But conflict can also be a source of creative energy; when handled constructively by both parties, differences can lead to a healthy and fruitful collaboration, creation, or construction of new knowledge or solutions. When we silence conflict, we avoid the possibility of negative conflict, but we also miss the potential for constructive conflict. Worse yet, as Leslie Perlow documents, the act of silencing conflict may create the consequences we most dread. Tasks frequently take longer or never get done successfully, and silencing conflict over important issues with people for whom we care deeply can result in disrespect for, and devaluing of, those same people. Each time we silence conflict, we create an environment in which we re all the more likely to be silent next time. We get caught in a vicious  silent spiral,  making the relationship progressively less safe, less satisfying, and less productive. Differences get glossed over, patched over, and suppressed . . . until disaster happens.  Saying yes when you really mean no  is a problem that haunts organizations from start-ups to multi- nationals. It exists across industries, levels, and functions. And it s exacerbated by a down economy, when the fear of losing one s job is on everybody s mind and the idea of allowing conflict to surface or disagreeing with others seems particularly risky. All too often, the conversation at work bespeaks harmony and togetherness, even though passionate disagreements exist beneath the surface. Leslie A. Perlow is a corporate ethnographer, an anthropologist of corporate culture. Anthropologists like Margaret Mead spend years in the field studying exotic cultures. Perlow does the same, although the field for her is the office and the exotic people are us those who work in the world of organizations. But the end result is no less surprising or rich in insight. Whether it s a Fortune 500 firm, small business, or government bureaucracy, Perlow provides a keen understanding of the hidden issues behind what people say (and don t say). And more important, she shows how to create relationships where individuals feel empowered to express their genuine thoughts and feelings and to harness the power of positive conflict.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y-8J7FUVzykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Christian art in Ireland,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Maot-_DL1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Expositions and Treatises from Portions of Several of the Epistles of St. Paul (Works of Sibbes, Vol. 5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4i5MjwEACAAJ&dq=Expositions+and+Treatises+from+Portions+of+Several+of+the+Epistles+of+St.+Paul+(Works+of+Sibbes,+Vol.+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese American Masculinities: From Fu Manchu to Bruce Lee (Studies in Asian Americans)","description":"This book is one of the first scholarly analyses of the current social constructions of Chinese American masculinities.

Bianca Olthoff is here to show that our struggles and hardships may be the fire that refines us instead of destroys us, brings us hope instead of despair, and leads us right into the arms of a God who loves us. Play with Fire, the debut book by popular speaker and teacher Bianca Juarez Olthoff, is the reminder that God isn't waiting until you have more resources or a spouse or a job so he can use you. He's ready to use you now. Using the mythical creature, the Phoenix, which was also referenced by early church leaders, she parallels this story with God's work in her own life, highlighting the beauty of reinvention with fire as both the impetus and the method for change. Olthoff reminds us that we serve a God who is redemptive and can take the worst situations and use them for His glory. Play With Fire is a Bible-infused message that will help women discover: The way out of the middle is moving forward The personal and powerful nature of the Holy Spirit The power and sacrifice of transformation The unique calling and purpose of life involves transformation With Olthoff's distinct style, strong storytelling gifts, and powerful bible teaching, Play with Fire will remind readers that God has huge dreams for them. In Bianca's words, \\"He's whispering in the wind and speaking through the fire and shouting in silence the extraordinary dream He is birthing in you. His dream for you is far greater than the dream you have for yourself. It's not your identity or income or influence that will make this happen. Like Zechariah 4:6 says, \\"'It's not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,' says the Lord.\\" It's time to play with fire.

Though highly successful, and typically portrayed as a unified effort, Japan's rebuilding throughout the 20th century faced a lot of domestic criticism. This story-led account gives a voice to those who felt they didn't fit in with what Japan was becoming. It's that push and pull that made the country what it is today. This book will be a fascinating read for anyone interested in Japanese culture--whether film and literature, or pop culture and manga--as big shifts in Japanese ideology and society tend to come from culture and the arts, rather than being politically-driven. It will also be of interest to those traveling to Japan who want a better sense of the place, or anyone seeking to better understand Japan's role on the global stage. With over 100 photographs, maps and prints, A History of Modern Japan showcases the compelling story of Japan's amazing growth and its resulting struggles. For all the country's advancement, the Japanese people continue to wrestle with the notion of what it means to be Japanese in a changing world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IrQlEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adorno on Popular Culture (International Library of Sociology)","description":"Unpacks Adorno's critique of popular culture in an engagingly, looking at the development of theories of authority, commodification and negative dialectics.

Set in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, Wait Till Next Year is a coming-of-age memoir in the era of Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider, when baseball truly was a national pastime that brought whole communities together. With her radio by her side and scorecard to hand, she recreates the postwar era, when the corner store was a place to share stories and neighborhoods were equally divided between Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans. Weaved between the games and the seasons, Goodwin tells the story of a changing America  from the lunacy of the Cold War alarm drills to McCarthy and the Rosenburg trials  as well as her own loss of innocence encapsulated by her mother s death, her father s lapse into despair and the Dodger s departure from Brooklyn in 1957 following the destruction of the iconic Ebbets Field stadium. Poignant, unsentimental and deeply eloquent, Wait Till Next Year is a profound memoir about childhood and loss, baseball, and the power of sport to bind families and heal loss and reveal as metaphor the evolving heart of a nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KQkbBAAAQBAJ&dq=Wait+till+next+year&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shirobamba: A Childhood in Old Japan","description":"This is a work of modern Japanese literature by Yasushi Inoue, the recipient of every major Japanese literary award and candidate for the Nobel Prize.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8rWBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Shirobamba:+A+Childhood+in+Old+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology: Themes and Variations (with Concept Charts and InfoTrac)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yZ8sJgAACAAJ&dq=Psychology:+Themes+and+Variations+(with+Concept+Charts+and+InfoTrac)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayers for Johnathan","description":"A collection of prayers and reflections that offers stressed readers a true path for their spiritual journey and communication with God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPQR6U7uE1wC&dq=Prayers+for+Johnathan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beacon lights of history","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D1wfAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MO Burdekin","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pIwFYAAACAAJ&dq=MO+Burdekin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SmartStart Guitar: A Fun, Easy Approach to Beginning Guitar for Kids","description":"Every kid wants to play guitar, and this innovative new instructional method lets them do just that.

Sherman upends images of wealthy people as invested only in accruing social advantages for themselves and their children. Instead, these liberal elites, who believe in diversity and meritocracy, feel conflicted about their position in a highly unequal society.

He leaves that sort of work to Fred Taylor, a veteran of clandestine action in Southeast Asia who is presently working as Reed's factotum. A passionate noncollector, Fred researches possible purchases and fights for them at auction--but he is really more interested in his blossoming relationship with Molly Riley, an independent-minded Cambridge librarian. In this series debut, Reed suspects that there may be a Vermeer painting worth millions lying underneath the oils of an unexciting nineteenth-century landscape. Tension mounts as he and Fred try to keep the vultures away and their hunch to themselves before auction. Meanwhile, Reed buys an unsigned nude smacking of 1890s Paris--it could be a Whistler, something he might have titled Harmony in Flesh and Black--from a down-and-out porno photographer who is soon afterward found murdered on the floor of his filthy studio. Their success depends on keeping a low profile, but now Clayton and Fred are in danger of being implicated in a very sleazy crime--which may at best jeopardize their plans to get the Vermeer, and at worst put their lives in danger.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h2b2AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Epistles of St. Paul","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h7kWAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Fort Henry to Corinth (Campaigns of the Civil War)","description":"Struggle for the Heartland tells the story surrounding the military campaign that began in early 1862 with the advance to Fort Henry and culminated in late May with the capture of Corinth, Mississippi.

And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a  proper  family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude. John Williams s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fvlHAgAAQBAJ&dq=Stoner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and holiness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mCe4ngEACAAJ&dq=Life+and+holiness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New England StarWatch: The Essential Guide To Our Night Sky","description":"Written in a folksy, down-to-earth style, this user-friendly guide to the night sky is designed for beginner and intermediate stargazers ages twelve and up.

First they nursed him. Then they encouraged him. Then they told him to pull himself together... Finally, Badger could stand it no longer. That admirable animal, though long on exhortation, was short on patience. 'Now look here Toad, this can go on no longer', he said sternly. 'There is only one thing left. You must have counselling!' Robert de Board's engaging account of Toad's experience of counselling will capture the imagination of the growing readership of people who are interested in counselling and the counselling process. Written as a real continuation of life on the River Bank, Toad and his friends come to life all over again. Heron, the counsellor, uses the language and ideas of transactional analysis as his counselling method. Through the dialogues which make up the ten sessions, or chapters of the book, Toad learns how to analyse his own feelings and develop his emotional intelligence. He meets his 'rebellious child' and his 'adult' along the way, and by the end of the book, as debonair as ever he was, is setting out on a completely new adventure. As readers learn about Toad, so they can learn about themselves and be encouraged to take the path of psychological growth and development. Best-selling author, Robert de Board says: 'Toad's experiences are based on my own experiences of counselling people over a period of twenty years. Counselling for Toads is really an amalgamation of the many counselling sessions I have held and contains a distillation of the truths I have learnt from practice.' Appropriate for anyone approaching counselling for the first time, whether as a student or as a client, or for the professional counsellor looking for something to recommend to the hesitant, Counselling for Toads will appeal to both children and adults of all ages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P-iGAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers: Fresh Ideas for the Weeknight Table","description":"The Moosewood Collective goes back to basics with Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers to deliver more than 175 fresh, imaginative, and quickly prepared dishes for the weeknight table that are also delicious and reliable.

Then he tipped away the resultant soup to avoid detection on a  no body, no murder  principle and used his victims  property to fund his luxury lifestyle of silk ties and flashy cars.Murder number six was less than perfect. When a guest in Haigh s hotel disappeared, the police found half-dissolved body parts carelessly thrown into the yard outside his secluded workshop. But was the urbane Mr Haigh, the man brought up by strict Plymouth Brethren parents in Yorkshire and dressed like a city stockbroker, really the monster he said he was? Did he really kill six innocent people just so he could drink their blood? Using unpublished archive papers, including recently released letters Haigh wrote from prison while awaiting execution, author Gordon Lowe sheds light on whether Haigh s claims were a cynical ploy for a ticket into Broadmoor Hospital, or if he was a psychopathic vampire with a penchant for disposing of his victims in acid.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S8QSDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welcome to Wolf Country (Five Star First Edition Mystery)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Makos Men - Sewn Photos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jVGRAAAACAAJ&dq=Makos+Men+-+Sewn+Photos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Horse Called Mystery","description":"Through his experiences with his horse and relationship with a doctor whose face has recently been badly disfigured in a fire, a crippled boy gains self-confidence and wins for himself and the doctor the respect and friendship of the community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZEUEnwEACAAJ&dq=A+Horse+Called+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolf Pack (Battletech # 4) (Vol 4)","description":"When Dragoons arrive inexplicably in the Inner Sphere, they make themselves--five regiments of battle-toughened Mech Warriors--available to the highest bidder","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FBcNAAAACAAJ&dq=Wolf+Pack+(Battletech&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Book of Things That Go","description":"From a spectacular giant dump truck to a speedy little race go-cart, The Big Book of Things That Go is a visual and informative look at a subject that fascinates kids.

Gerber limns his experience as a professional racing driver, journalist, sailor, and fisherman with a poet's eye and a novelist's gift for narrative, believing, as he states in his introduction, that our truest lives must be imagined. New essays in this collection include a meditative journal on the Arctic and an in-depth interview in which Gerber discusses the relationship of his artistic life with that as an explorer of the natural world. Also included are a gripping account of his return to racing thirty-three years after his career-ending crash, a story about saving his own life in the African desert by introducing a clan of Rendili warriors to ice, a chronicle of his pursuit of the most elusive fish in the world, and the story of a clandestine sailing trip to Cuba. His classic and highly praised book on the Indianapolis 500, the World's Fastest Carnival Ride, long out of print, is included here in its entirety. Blending Thoreau's dictum that \\"a writer is a traveler who stays at home,\\" with Wallace Stevens's that \\"it is the worst of all things not to live in a physical world,\\" Dan Gerber's focus in A Second Life is the inward experience of the outer world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OqtaAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Second+Life:+A+Collected+Nonfiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Unexpected Joy: The Gift of Parenting a Challenging Child","description":"A practicing family physician candidly shares her experiences in parenting a son who has autism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kD0EAAAACAAJ&dq=An+Unexpected+Joy:+The+Gift+of+Parenting+a+Challenging+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deconstructing the Mind (Philosophy of Mind)","description":"During the past two decades, debates over the viability of commonsense psychology have occupied center stage in both cognitive science and the philosophy of mind. A group of prominent philosophers known as eliminativists argue that advances in cognitive science and neuroscience will ultimately justify a rejection of our folk theory of mind because it gives a radically mistaken account of mental life. In Deconstructing the Mind, distinguished philosopher Stephen Stich, once a leading advocate of eliminativism, offers a bold and compelling reassessment of this view. The book opens with a groundbreaking multi-part essay in which Stich maintains that even if the sciences develop in the ways that eliminativists foresee, none of the arguments for ontological elimination are tenable. Succeeding essays explore folk psychology in more detail, develop a systematic critique of simulation theory, and counter widespread concern about naturalizing psychological properties.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F7jaQXF7wkkC&dq=Deconstructing+the+Mind+(Philosophy+of+Mind)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy Magazine March 2001 - Kylie Bax, PMOM Miriam Gonzalez","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-L4uAQAAIAAJ&dq=Playboy+Magazine+March+2001+-+Kylie+Bax,+PMOM+Miriam+Gonzalez&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morning, Mr. Ted","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Baring My Soul","description":"Kenny Thomas shot to fame in 1991 with the multi-platinum-selling album Voices, storming the music charts and the UK soul scene in the process.

The creature appeared as something out of New England's forgotten past. Beside the road lay a 140-pound mountain lion. Speculations ran wild, the wildest of which figured him a ghostly survivor from a bygone century when lions last roamed the eastern United States. But a more fantastic scenario of facts soon unfolded. The lion was three years old, with a DNA trail embarking from the Black Hills of South Dakota on a cross-country odyssey eventually passing within thirty miles of New York City. It was the farthest landbound trek ever recorded for a wild animal in America, by a barely weaned teenager venturing solo through hostile terrain. William Stolzenburg retraces his two-year journey--from his embattled birthplace in the Black Hills, across the Great Plains and the Mississippi River, through Midwest metropolises and remote northern forests, to his tragic finale upon Connecticut's Gold Coast. Along the way, the lion traverses lands with people gunning for his kind, as well as those championing his cause. Heart of a Lion is a story of one heroic creature pitting instinct against towering odds, coming home to a society deeply divided over his return. It is a testament to the resilience of nature, and a test of humanity's willingness to live again beside the ultimate symbol of wildness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QOZvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lds Grandparents' Idea Book","description":"As the grandmother of twenty-four, Fay Klingler shares the desire of all grandparents-to bond more closely with their grandchildren and exert a strong spiritual influence on them.

The Conran movement (stores and style) began in 1974 with The House Book and was updated as The New House Book in 1985 and The Essential House Book in 1994. The significance of the newly added word home in the title should not be overlooked, as the author has gravitated toward LeCorbusier's 1927 statement: \\"Everybody, quite rightly, dreams of sheltering himself in a sure and permanent home of his own.\\" Ultimate appeals to this primal notion of belonging, starting with an aspirational, visual introduction before separating ideas into three distinct sections: home life, or the different stages of design, from first house to empty nest; home work, exploring all options for decorating, from paint versus plaster to remodeling versus new construction; and compendium, the nitty-gritty information so necessary to understanding and making design choices.

He knew the history of the state that led the country into the War Between the States. In a sense, he was a product of the long and agonizing aftermath of that fratricidal struggle. He was a politician and, as such, sensitive to racial problems of his state and region. But he was never a racist. On the floor of the House he supported the so-called busing amendment to school legislation. All members of both political parties recognized his unique talents. They all liked to hear him speak. Named for one of the country's great orators, he lived up to that name. He used his talents to bring his thinking to his colleagues. His fingerprints are on every major issue considered by the Congress during his time.

In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from  the good fight  and one of the foremost classics of war literature. For Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades, is attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of a guerilla leader s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author s previous works, For Whom the Bell Tolls stands as one of the best war novels ever written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-08IVs9NR14C&dq=For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mistress of the Pearl (The Pearl, Book 3)","description":"Kundala is Miina's world, created by that Goddess with the help of the dragons. But Miina is missing, and her people have been enslaved by the alien V'ornn. Now a savior has come, the Dar Sala-at, a messiah promised by prophecy yet unlike anyone's expectations: within the body of a beautiful young woman is the mind and spirit of a unique Kundalan female who is joined in mystical partnership with the mind and spirit of Annon Ashera, a V'ornn male, the last survivor of a noble family. Together the two adolescents have matured and merged into a new joint identity. Now their common destiny, and Kundala's, is in their own hands. In Lustbader's richly imagined saga The Pearl, magic and science clash on an epic scale. As in the Midkemia novels of Raymond Feist, the juxtaposition shows that neither is inherently good or evil. It is the people using magic or science who give them meaning, and Lustbader has created people you will never forget: Riane, the Dar-Sala-at; Eleana, the woman she loves twice over; Kurgan, the V'ornn usurper who raped Eleana and sired her child; Marethyn Stogggul, Kurgan's defiant sister, an artist who joins the Kundalan resistance; Marethyn's lover, chief trader Sornnn SaTrryn, who secretly helps the resistance as well; and the fabulous Krystren, the Sarakkon woman from the mysterious southern continent, who comes north on a secret mission and will change the lives of everyone she meets. All the while, the evil Sauromicians threaten the world as they seek to use banestones to bind a dragon. With each new volume, The Pearl has bloomed and ramified like a gorgeous flowering vine. The Mistress of the Pearl is the best yet, and those who have read the previous books will find new sources of excitement and enlightenment, but this is also a great place to begin catching up with the series, as the Pearl shines ever brighter.

Written in support of the recently completed Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers were intended to support the ratification process of the new United States Constitution. When the Constitutional Convention was completed on September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, the newly-agreed upon Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. As opponents of a strong centralized government began attacking the Constitution in the press, Hamilton recruited Jay and Madison to contribute articles and essays in favor of Federalism to prominent journals and newspapers. Published between October 27, 1787 and May 28, 1788, The Federalist Papers were written by the three authors under the pseudonym  Publius.  Although Hamilton wrote the vast majority, Madison s and Jay s contributions are still seen as essential works on the philosophy of American governance. Federalist Nos. 10 and 14, both written by Madison, are regarded as especially significant for arguing for the possibility of effectively governing an expansive republic. In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton argues against adding a Bill of Rights, a proposed compromise with Anti-Federalists that would eventually make up the first ten Amendments to the Constitution. Other important topics introduced or explained in The Federalist Papers include the doctrine of judicial review, the case for a single chief executive, and the purpose of checks and balances. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of The Federalist Papers is a classic of American political history reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8OEsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Better Memory Kit","description":"\\"The Better Memory Kit encompasses an innovative, clinically proven medical program to prevent and reverse all types of memory loss, including Alzheimer's disease.

Kenneth Turan s fifty-four favorite films embrace a century of the world s most satisfying romances and funniest comedies, the most heart-stopping dramas and chilling thrillers. Turan discovered film as a child left undisturbed to watch Million Dollar Movie on WOR-TV Channel 9 in New York, a daily showcase for older Hollywood features. It was then that he developed a love of cinema that never left him and honed his eye for the most acute details and the grandest of scenes. Not to be Missed blends cultural criticism, historical anecdote, and inside-Hollywood controversy. Turan s selection of favorites ranges across all genres. From All About Eve to Seven Samurai to Sherlock Jr., these are all timeless films classic and contemporary, familiar and obscure, with big budgets and small each underscoring the truth of director Ingmar Bergman s observation that  no form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul.

Not remarkable for illustrious birth, for they were of humble origin; not for scholarly attainments, for such were the conditions of their early life that scholastic education of a very high order was out of the question: but they were remarkable for character that mysterious something which exists independent of birth, education or fortune. It has become proverbial that all great movements, all reformations, all revolutions must produce their own leaders; and this is as true of the great work of the last days, the establishment of the Church of Christ on the earth, as it is of any other great movement. Leaders in established usages and institutions, political, social or religious, are very seldom converted to innovations. They usually consider it to their interest to oppose changes, especially those changes which from their very nature cast any shadow of doubt upon the correctness of existing customs or institutions with which they are connected. Hence it happened that the Jewish rabbis, the priests, the scribes, the members of the great Sanhedrin leaders in their nation did not accept the doctrines of Messiah and become the chief apostles, seventies and elders of the new church. On the contrary, this class were the stubbornest opponents to the doctrines taught by the Son of God, and His most implacable enemies. It was the common people who heard Him gladly: and from their number He chose the apostles, who, through the God-given powers of the priesthood conferred upon them, shook the old systems of morals and religion from their foundations. Nor can it be doubted that the hand of the Lord is in this matter of choosing men to be His messengers, His prophets and His rulers. Many of them are chosen before they are born in the flesh. The messenger that was to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of God, John the Baptist, was so chosen. Jeremiah was ordained a prophet to the nations before he was born. Cyrus the Great, the war prince of Persia, was selected to be the deliverer of Israel from Babylonian bondage more than a century before his birth. Indeed, we are given to understand from the revelations of God, that from among the nobler class of spirits that dwell in His presence, the Father hath chosen those who are to be His rulers. From the very nature of things it must be necessary that men whose minds are unwarped by prevailing customs and traditions, should be selected to establish a new order of religion, of government or of society. How could the Jewish priests and rabbis, bound by long custom to a slavish adherence to the outward forms and ceremonies of the Mosaic ritual, the spirit and purpose of which had long been made of no effect by the rubbish of false traditions, open their minds to receive the larger and nobler doctrines of the gospel of Christ, unmixed with the pomp and circumstance which they of that age and nation considered essential to religion? Can men educated to an attachment for despotic government, and whose interests are bound up with its maintenance, be expected to look with favor on democratic principles, or become the champions of a republic?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7QjaDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woodlands for Profit and Pleasure (Paperback)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HK3V1RZE4T4C&dq=Woodlands+for+Profit+and+Pleasure+(Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The waiting time","description":"When her husband's fatal accident leaves her the sole proprietor of their rice plantation, Abigail Allyn forges a new identity as a feminist before her time and an abolitionist before there is a way to free slaves.

Challenging their national or local institutions of authority--political or economic, social or religious--aggrieved individuals and disgruntled communities continue to wage their eternal struggles against those perceived as perverting the common good. Rebels with a Cause seeks to explain the minds, motives, means, and morality of those who espouse individual as well as communal dissent and resistance--violent or otherwise--in the name of some greater good. The ranks of political offenders vary widely: Civil Disobedients; Conscientious Objectors; Dissidents; Fanatics; Freedom Fighters; Fundamentalists; Militants; Political Prisoners; Pseudo-Politicals; Rebels; Resisters; Revolutionaries and Terrorists. The cast of characters is equally diverse and colorful: from Rome's Brutus to South Africa's Nelson Mandela. From America's John Brown and Susan B. Anthony to John Wilkes Booth and Timothy J. McVeigh. From Cuba's Che Guevara to the anonymous heroes of Beijing's Tienaman Square. From the Soviet Union's Aleksander Solzhenistzen to Burmese dissident Aung San Suu Kyi. Rebels portrays political offenders as products of three unorthodoxies. They constitute neither traditional political actors, nor common criminals or lawful belligerents. As players in the political arena, they refuse to abide by the rules and means of conventional politics--the ballot box and the rule of law. Offending against the prevailing law, they nevertheless disclaim the common criminal's venal goals to assert their own pursuit of altruistic communal and just objectives. Finally, as militant activists they act surreptiously, disclaim uniforms and insignias, proclaim allegiance to no sovereign and in their resort to indiscriminate violence they spurn the rules of lawful belligerency. This triple unorthodoxy has made the development of coherent public responses to political dissidents, resisters and rebels particularly difficult. Rebels does not only identify the actors and social forces that have caused nearly half of all countries throughout the globe to become infected with the ethnic, religious, tribal, clannish, and racial strife which now tear them apart. Acknowledging that domestic conflicts are replacing international warfare as the source of political disorder and violence in the emerging decades, Rebels also offers both readers and antagonists new insights and constructive approaches for the making of a less hostile and violent world. Rebels with a Cause will help readers address some of this era's most troublesome questions. What weight should one give to the demands of his conscience or the urgings of his or her faith? When should one reject the rules of those in power and stand up against evil laws and governments? Is one ever entitled to disobey the commands of an allegedly  democratic  regime? What means may one justly use in the struggle against tyrants, dictators, and other abusers of power? And when does a dissenter cease to be a freedom fighter and become a terrorist? Rebels with a Cause responds to these and other pressing contemporary questions with a \\"Bill of Rights on Just Authority and Just Resistance\\" as a guide for both the governed and those who govern.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1nixswEACAAJ&dq=Rebels+with+a+Cause:+The+Minds+and+Morality+of+Political+Offenders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electricity Markets: Investment, Performance and Analysis","description":"After 2 decades, policymakers and regulators agree that electricity market reform, liberalization and privatization remains partly art.

The focus of enquiry is the narrativization of these important cultural and political questions in representative texts of fiction. What are the socio political and cultural implications and underpinnings of the representation of marginalization in the medium and genre of fiction, what could be the politics, ethics and aesthetics of such narrating, how far such representations are subversive or consensual/complicit, what are the limitations and pitfalls of such intervening radicalism in fictional narration all these questions are taken up in detail in the analyses. In the greater sense this study is also a critique of modernity and its discontents as it analyses the dialectics of modernity, its radical as well as reactionary aspects. A problematic premise of contextualizing the text and textualizing the context would also be prominent in the attempt. Fictional texts from five Indian languages including English (two texts from each language ) are incorporated in the study to ensure regional and linguistic representation within the limits of the availability of works in translation. Questions of class analytical perspectives in the context of Brahmanic patriarchy are explicated and critiqued. The need for a subaltern hermeneutics and the urgency of epistemological democratization are also discussed as a political and emancipatory outcome of the study. Both the formal as well as thematic concerns of the novel in the Indian languages are found to be shaped and determined by the material realities and associated attitudes and worldviews of caste and gender hierarchy emanating from internal imperialism. Though the ten texts chosen attempt intense critique of the gender question, the more profound and specific cultural question of caste evades comprehension and critical understanding. Caste often escapes as the un-representable in narration as it is in conversion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5SKTrUWBaAC&dq=Talamurakal:+Noval&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ramona Quimby, Age 8","description":"In this sixth book in the series Ramona is in the third grade and is big enough to ride the school bus on her own.

However, this rarely happens. Good fortune is often followed by negative emotions that overtake us and result in destructive behaviors. \\"I don't deserve this,\\" \\"this is too good to be true,\\" or any number of harmful thought patterns prevent us from experiencing the joy and satisfaction we have earned. Sound familiar? This is what New York Times bestselling author Gay Hendricks calls the Upper Limit Problem, a negative emotional reaction that occurs when anything positive enters our lives. The Upper Limit Problem not only prevents happiness, but it actually stops us from achieving our goals. It is the ultimate life roadblock. In The Big Leap, Hendricks reveals a simple yet comprehensive program for overcoming this barrier to happiness and fulfillment, presented in a way that engages both the mind and heart. Working closely with more than one thousand extraordinary achievers in business and the arts from rock stars to Fortune 500 executives whose stories are featured in these pages, the book describes the four hidden fears that are at the root of the Upper Limit Problem. The Big Leap delivers a proven method for first identifying which of these four fears prevents us from reaching our personal upper limit, and then breaking through that limitation to achieve what Hendricks refers to as our Zone of Genius. Hendricks provides a clear path for achieving our true potential and attaining not only financial success but also success in love and life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Jf2iWI1xZsC&dq=El+Gran+Salto/the+Big+Leap+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"De Gaulle: A Biography","description":"'Masterly ... awesome reading ... an outstanding biography' Max Hastings, Sunday Times The definitive biography of the greatest French statesman of modern times In six weeks in the early summer of 1940, France was over-run by German troops and quickly surrendered. The French government of Marshal P tain sued for peace and signed an armistice. One little-known junior French general, refusing to accept defeat, made his way to England. On 18 June he spoke to his compatriots over the BBC, urging them to rally to him in London. 'Whatever happens, the flame of French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.' At that moment, Charles de Gaulle entered into history. For the rest of the war, de Gaulle frequently bit the hand that fed him. He insisted on being treated as the true embodiment of France, and quarrelled violently with Churchill and Roosevelt. He was prickly, stubborn, aloof and self-contained. But through sheer force of personality and bloody-mindedness he managed to have France recognised as one of the victorious Allies, occupying its own zone in defeated Germany. For ten years after 1958 he was President of France's Fifth Republic, which he created and which endures to this day. His pursuit of 'a certain idea of France' challenged American hegemony, took France out of NATO and twice vetoed British entry into the European Community. His controversial decolonization of Algeria brought France to the brink of civil war and provoked several assassination attempts. Julian Jackson's magnificent biography reveals this the life of this titanic figure as never before. It draws on a vast range of published and unpublished memoirs and documents - including the recently opened de Gaulle archives - to show how de Gaulle achieved so much during the War when his resources were so astonishingly few, and how, as President, he put a medium-rank power at the centre of world affairs. No previous biography has depicted his paradoxes so vividly. Much of French politics since his death has been about his legacy, and he remains by far the greatest French leader since Napoleon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yBxCDwAAQBAJ&dq=De+Gaulle:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Galatians (New International Biblical Commentary, 9.)","description":"New volume in a favorite Bible commentary series Writing a commentary on Galatians is a daunting task.

The field is complex and sometimes poorly defined and there are a variety of competing approaches. It is easy for the senior bachelor and starting master student to get lost in the forest of macroeconomics and the mathematics it uses extensively. Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics is a guide book for the interested and ambitious student. Non-partisan in its approach, it deals with all the major topics, summarising the important approaches and providing the reader with a coherent angle on all aspects of macroeconomic thought. Each chapter deals with a separate area of macroeconomics, and each contains a summary section of key points and a further reading list. Using nothing more than undergraduate mathematical skills, it takes the student from basic IS-LM style macro models to the state of the art literature on Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, explaining the mathematical tricks used where they are first introduced. Fully updated and substantially revised, this third edition of Foundations of Modern Macroeconomics now includes brand new chapters covering highly topical subjects such as dynamic programming, competitive risk sharing equilibria and the New Keynesian DSGE approach.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sEsrDwAAQBAJ&dq=MACROECONOMICS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation","description":"This book focuses on the causes of starvation in general and famines in particular.

Locked-down drug treatment centers. House arrest. Mandated psychiatric treatment. Data-driven surveillance. Extended probation. These are some of the key alternatives held up as cost-effective substitutes for jails and prisons. But many of these so-called reforms actually widen the net, weaving in new strands of punishment and control, and bringing new populations, who would not otherwise have been subject to imprisonment, under physical control by the state. As mainstream public opinion has begun to turn against mass incarceration, political figures on both sides of the spectrum are pushing for reform. But though they're promoted as steps to confront high rates of imprisonment many of these measures are transforming our homes and communities into prisons instead. In Prison by Any Other Name, activist journalists Maya Schenwar and Victoria Law reveal the way the kinder, gentler narrative of reform can obscure agendas of social control and challenge us to question the ways we replicate the status quo when pursuing change. A foreword by Michelle Alexander situates the book in the context of criminal justice reform conversations. Finally, the book offers a bolder vision for truly alternative justice practices.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KdCkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Malta magnificent","description":"Malta Magnificent, written by Major Francis Gerard and first published in 1943, tells of the siege of Malta, one of the epic incidents in the world s history.

This sexual initiation irrevocably transforms him and shakes his entire system of beliefs. Hasan no longer knows what to believe in nor who he is, he just knows he has to avoid the marriage his father has arranged for him. Hasan's story runs in tandem with Wisam's, a friend of his sister's, who is unhappily married and having her first lesbian relationship. Her sense of alienation from her husband, her frustration and her newfound sexuality echo Hasan's questions about religion, identity and sexuality. Hasan and Wisam will both experience frustration, doubts and ultimately liberation in different ways. Their previously held notions about religion and sexuality are dramatically shaped by their new experiences and the influence of Nadim and Kindah, the progressive intellectuals who help them formulate a new worldview.

Lenny McLean was one of the deadliest bareknuckle fighters Britain has ever seen. He had dear, powerful friends, but he also had terrible enemies. So much so that he had two bullet wounds in his back  each from a different attack. He was also stabbed repeatedly  always from behind. But Lenny was also a warm, big-hearted grizzly bear of a man, whose main weakness was an overwhelming desire to put the welfare of his mates ahead of his own well-being. In his extraordinary autobiography, he tells of how the mafia flew him to New York to take on their greatest bareknuckle boxer in a multi-million pound illicit bout. The Mafia s man lasted less than three minutes. When the IRA fronted up a London gang in a money-laundering scam, Lenny was brought in to intimidate the terrorists. The IRA, not surprisingly, backed off. . . His most serious trial came when he was accused of murder. Fighting to prove his innocence against a minimum sentence of twenty-five years, Lenny never gave up  and went on to be found not guilty. This is a tale of one man s triumph against almost insurmountable odds, in a battle that Len fought every day for himself, and to  put steam on the table  for his wife and kids.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CyGtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Promise","description":"Listen to a short interview with Risa Goluboff Host: Chris Gondek | Producer: Heron & Crane In this groundbreaking book, Risa L. Goluboff offers a provocative new account of the history of American civil rights law. The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education has long dominated that history. Since 1954, generations of judges, lawyers, and ordinary people have viewed civil rights as a project of breaking down formal legal barriers to integration, especially in the context of public education. Goluboff recovers a world before Brown, a world in which civil rights was legally, conceptually, and constitutionally up for grabs. Then, the petitions of black agricultural workers in the American South and industrial workers across the nation called for a civil rights law that would redress economic as well as legal inequalities. Lawyers in the new Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice and in the NAACP took the workers' cases and viewed them as crucial to attacking Jim Crow. By the time NAACP lawyers set out on the path to Brown, however, they had eliminated workers' economic concerns from their litigation agenda. When the lawyers succeeded in Brown, they simultaneously marginalized the host of other harms--economic inequality chief among them--that afflicted the majority of African Americans during the mid-twentieth century. By uncovering the lost challenges workers and their lawyers launched against Jim Crow in the 1940s, Goluboff shows how Brown only partially fulfilled the promise of civil rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cOssEAAAQBAJ&dq=Lost+Promise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*OP Order Book Michaelites (Engel)","description":"This book is the first monograph that provides a wholesome overview of the history of Antisemitism in Poland.

While the identity of her benefactor remains a mystery, he - or she - has left one important legal proviso: that the shop cannot be sold, only passed on to somebody who really deserves it. Rosa makes up her mind to give it a go: to put everything she has into getting the shop up and running again in the small seaside community of Cockleberry Bay. But can she do it all on her own? And if not, who will help her succeed - and who among the following will work secretly to see her fail? There is a handsome rugby player, a sexy plumber, a charlatan reporter and a selection of meddling locals. Add in a hit and run incident and the disappearance of a valuable engraved necklace - and what you get is a journey of self-discovery and unpredictable events.

Until recently, however, the treatment of prophecy has been either apologetic or expository, and prophetic themes have been developed individually apart from their relation to the whole revealed prophetic program. Much of our knowledge has been only fragmentary and unrelated. Dr. Dwight Pentecost s monumental text, Things to Come, has changed all that. In this massive, highly successful book, Dr. Pentecost has synthesized the whole field of prophecy into a unified biblical doctrine, a systematic and complete biblical eschatology. With nearly a quarter of a million copies sold, Things to Come has earned its place in the library of the pastor, the scholar, and the seminarian or Bible institute student. In addition, it offers a comprehensive and accessible study for anyone interested in the important subject of biblical prophecy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=libqyvRHbDIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War and Film in America: Historical and Critical Essays","description":"Thirty Years After: New Essays on Vietnam War Literature, Film and Art brings together essays on literature, film and media, representational art, and music of the Vietnam War that were generated by a three-day conference in Honolulu during Veterans Week 2005. This large and extensive volume, the first collection of Vietnam War criticism published since the 1990s, reflects significant cultural and historical changes since then, including U.S.-Vietnamese cultural transactions in the wake of political reconciliation and the Vietnamese diaspora; popular commodification and memorialization of the war in America; and renascent American imperialism. Contributors include well-established and well-published writers and critics like Philip Beidler, Cathey Calloway, Lorrie Goldensohn, Wayne Karlin, Andrew Lam, Jerry Lembcke, Tim O'Brien, John S. Schafer, and Alex Vernon as well as emerging Vietnam scholars and critics. Among other contributions, the volume provides important quasi-bibliographical essays on canonical American and Vietnamese literature and film, African American Vietnam war narratives, Chicano fiction and poetry, and American Vietnam war art music as well as essays on such subjects as real and digital war memorials, Vietnamese popular war songs, and Vietnamization of the Gulf War. Teachers, scholars, and the general public will find Thirty Years After a valuable guide to ongoing critical discussion of the most important event in American history between 1945 and 9/11.I highly recommend this book. Although it is almost a cliche say the Vietnam War has left deep and lingering scars on American society-Thirty Years underscores the still traumatic cultural legacy of this conflict. Attuned to the divergent voices and genres of representation--Thirty Years is an indispensable work, not only for literary scholars, but for anyone seeking to understand the enduring impact of the Vietnam War. An impressive work, Mark Herbele is commended for organizing such an insightful and gracefully written set of essays. G.

He was a meticulous observer and recorder of everyday life, yet his fiction tends deliberately towards the fantastical and grotesque. He always identified himself strongly with the early history of New England, yet spent several years in Britain and Europe, and remained fascinated by modern social and technological innovation. Contemporaries praised his sentiment and moral purity, but it is his psychological penetration, verging at times on surreal allegory, which has attracted modern appreciation. Not least surprisingly, The Scarlet Letter has become a staple of the novelistic canon, while much of the rest of Hawthorne's oeuvre goes almost unnoticed-a situation which is surely ripe for correction. This edition contains all the works (fiction and essays and sketches) published by Hawthorne which it has proved possible to reproduce. It also includes the unfinished novels, and the selections from Hawthorne's diaries and letters published by his widow after his death. All of the works have been newly typeset for this edition. Prof. Nick Lawrence (University of Warwick) has written a new critical introduction to Hawthorne's oeuvre, including a chronology of the author's life, contexts for reading his work, an overview of contemporary and subsequent reception, and a brief bibliography. This edition contains all the works (fiction and essays and sketches) published by Hawthorne which it has proved possible to trace. It also includes the unfinished novels, and the selections from Hawthorne's diaries and letters published by his widow after his death.

As a member of the generation of planners following Camillo Sitte and preceding the emergence of the modern planners of the 1920s, Unwin considered planning a design-based discipline rather than a purely technical one. He believed that artistic and practical criteria were mutually supportive and carried this out in his work by creating plans that represented a unity of art, science, and technology. Unwin is perhaps the greatest figure of the Garden City movement, which has had a tremendous impact on planning in both Europe and the United States. Although Town Planning has become the bible of neo-traditionalist planners, this book is not a nostalgic view of past planning ideas; rather, it is a useful, forward-looking book that holds valuable lessons for today's planners. Its insightful critical analyses of many towns throughout Europe and the United States are accompanied by photographs, plans, drawings, and six foldout maps. This reprint of Town Planning in Practice includes a new preface by Andres Duany and an introduction by Walter Creese.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1F5UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Town+Planning+in+Practice:+An+Introduction+to+the+Art+of+Designing+Cities+and+Suburbs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder at Fort Huachuca","description":"Take a look at our nation's illusive, imaginary borders, and the terrifying Murder investigation that identified this, long before 911 and Timothy McVeigh.

Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. \\"The Secret of the Golden Flower\\" is a Chinese Taoist book about meditation, first was translated by Richard Wilhelm, a friend of Carl Jung. Jung wrote a forward and an appendix for the book. The meditation technique described in the book is a straightforward, silent method; the book's description of meditation has been characterized as 'Zen with details'. The meditation technique, set forth in poetic language, reduces to a formula of sitting, breathing and contemplating. Sitting primarily relates to a straight posture. Breathing is described in detail, primarily in terms of the esoteric physiology of the path of \\"qi\\" (also known as \\"chi\\" or \\"ki\\"), or breath energy. The energy path associated with breathing has been described as similar to an internal wheel vertically aligned with the spine. When breathing is steady, the wheel turns forward, with breath energy rising in back and descending in front. Bad breathing habits (or bad posture, or even bad thoughts) may cause the wheel not to turn, or move backward, inhibiting the circulation of essential breath energy. In contemplation, one watches thoughts as they arise and recede.

But it is not the only one. Even in the United States, noncapitalist firms play a vital role in many sectors. Employee-owned firms have long been prominent in the service professions--law, accounting, investment banking, medicine--and are becoming increasingly important in other industries. The buyout of United Airlines by its employees is the most conspicuous recent instance. Farmer-owned produce cooperatives dominate the market for most basic agricultural commodities. Consumer-owned utilities provide electricity to one out of eight households. Key firms such as MasterCard, Associated Press, and Ace Hardware are service and supply cooperatives owned by local businesses. Occupant-owned condominiums and cooperatives are rapidly displacing investor-owned rental housing. Mutual companies owned by their policyholders sell half of all life insurance and one-quarter of all property and liability insurance. And nonprofit firms, which have no owners at all, account for 90 percent of all nongovernmental schools and colleges, two-thirds of all hospitals, half of all day-care centers, and one-quarter of all nursing homes. Henry Hansmann explores the reasons for this diverse pattern of ownership. He explains why different industries and different national economies exhibit different distributions of ownership forms. The key to the success of a particular form, he shows, depends on the balance between the costs of contracting in the market and the costs of ownership. And he examines how this balance is affected by history and by the legal and regulatory framework within which firms are organized. With noncapitalist firms now playing an expanding role in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe and Asia as well as in the developed market economies of the West, The Ownership of Enterprise will be an important book for business people, policymakers, and scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xrEYKh2_sAMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Ancient Rome (The Great Courses, 341, 342, 343, 344)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lCHAoevOP_gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","description":"New York Times bestselling author Linda Howard sets a tale of power, suspense, and passion in the savage New Mexico Territory.

Today a similar influx of new immigrants is transforming the city again. Better than one in three New Yorkers is now an immigrant. From Ellis Island to JFK is the first in-depth study that compares these two huge social changes. A key contribution of this book is Nancy Foner s reassessment of the myths that have grown up around the earlier Jewish and Italian immigration and that deeply color how today s Asian, Latin American, and Caribbean arrivals are seen. Topic by topic, she reveals the often surprising realities of both immigrations. For example: ? Education: Most Jews, despite the myth, were not exceptional students at first, while many immigrant children today do remarkably well. ? Jobs: Immigrants of both eras came with more skills than is popularly supposed. Some today come off the plane with advanced degrees and capital to start new businesses. ? Neighborhoods: Ethnic enclaves are still with us but they re no longer always slums today s new immigrants are reviving many neighborhoods and some are moving to middle-class suburbs. ? Gender: For married women a century ago, immigration often, surprisingly, meant less opportunity to work outside the home. Today, it s just the opposite. ? Race: We see Jews and Italians as whites today, but to turn-of-the-century scholars they were members of different, alien races. Immigrants today appear more racially diverse but some (particularly Asians) may be changing the boundaries of current racial categories. Drawing on a wealth of historical and contemporary research and written in a lively and entertaining style, the book opens a new chapter in the study of immigration and the story of the nation s gateway city.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s0FZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disney's Kim Possible: Badical - Books #1-4 Boxed Set #1: Chapter Book (Kim Possible)","description":"She can do anything-and you can help her!

We all know the scene: Dorothy is transported from the flat terrain of Kansas to the bizarre land of Oz. Her cry, \\"Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore,\\" may be the best line to describe how people feel about the retirement landscape. It s one teeming with challenges, from the impact of corporate downsizing on individuals to battered 401(k)s, precarious Social Security, and cuts in pensions and health care benefits for retirees. Many people are intimidated and delay thinking about retirement. That s a mistake. We're Not in Kansas Anymore is the only guide you need to learn how to deal with the Oz-like reality that is retirement planning today. Walter Updegrave shows how to cut through the clutter, assess your finances, and become your own personal pension manager. ? Get real about retirement. Neither your employer nor the government will adequately feather your retirement nest. You're on your own. Only you can take action and responsibility for your life after work. Walter Updegrave shows how to start now. ? Develop a simple, direct, empowering retirement plan. Cut through the alphanumeric soup of 401(k)s, IRAs, Keoghs, and SEPs, get a grip, and execute a personal plan that makes sense given your circumstances. ? Create a realistic investing strategy and get the most out of your 401(k) and other retirement accounts. ? Ensure that your money lasts a lifetime. The Tin Man wanted to experience life with passion and emotion. Likewise, you'll improve your chances of creating the kind of retirement you want if you bring some passion and emotion into your retirement plan and then save enough to make it a reality. The Scarecrow thought his life would be better if he \\"only had a brain.\\" It was the Scarecrow, however, who came up with the best ideas to get Dorothy out of her jams. Similarly, Updegrave shows that any reasonably intelligent person can execute a successful retirement plan and, like the Cowardly Lion, show some courage by having the discipline, willpower, and conviction to follow it through. We're Not in Kansas Anymore is the best, most thorough, and most empowering retirement guide in print today.

In this intellectually stimulating dialogue, often adversarial but always amicable, these two great men, who stand on opposite sides of the church door, discuss some of the most controversial issues of our day, including the apocalypse, abortion, women in the clergy, and ethics. As we voyage onward into the new millennium, they frame a debate about matters that have already begun to rage, always aware of the gulf between belief and nonbelief that separates them, constantly probing and challenging, but also respectful of the other s viewpoint. For believers and nonbelievers alike, the result is both edifying and illuminating.  Their correspondence,  writes Professor Harvey Cox in his introduction,  lifts the possibility of intelligent conversation on religion to a new level.

Although the tradition that traces its ancestry back to him did not flourish until nearly two hundred years after his death, today millions of Zen Buddhists and students of kung fu claim him as their spiritual father. While others viewed Zen practice as a purification of the mind or a stage on the way to perfect enlightenment, Bodhidharma equated Zen with buddhahood and believed that it had a place in everyday life. Instead of telling his disciples to purify their minds, he pointed them to rock walls, to the movements of tigers and cranes, to a hollow reed floating across the Yangtze. This bilingual edition, the only volume of the great teacher's work currently available in English, presents four teachings in their entirety. \\"Outline of Practice\\" describes the four all-inclusive habits that lead to enlightenment, the \\"Bloodstream Sermon\\" exhorts students to seek the Buddha by seeing their own nature, the \\"Wake-up Sermon\\" defends his premise that the most essential method for reaching enlightenment is beholding the mind.

A large and rapidly growing literature in political economics attempts to answer these questions. But so far there is little consensus on the answers and disagreement on the appropriate mode of analysis. Combining the best of three separate traditions the theory of macroeconomic policy, public choice, and rational choice in political science Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini suggest a unified approach to the field. As in modern macroeconomics, individual citizens behave rationally, their preferences over economic outcomes inducing preferences over policy. As in public choice, the delegation of policy decisions to elected representatives may give rise to agency problems between voters and politicians. And, as in rational choice, political institutions shape the procedures for setting policy and electing politicians. The authors outline a common method of analysis, establish several new results, and identify the main outstanding problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q3h_M3QI7OYC&dq=Political+Economics:+Explaining+Economic+Policy+(Zeuthen+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swingin' on the Grapevine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EN0eHAAACAAJ&dq=Swingin%27+on+the+Grapevine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jewel Ornament Of Liberation: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem Of The Noble Teachings","description":"A masterwork of Tibetan Buddhism providing the complete foundation for study and practice from beginning to Buddhahood.

Hidden within the battle of Jericho is the story of Rahab, a beautiful and brave young Canaanite woman who aided the Israelites by hanging a piece of scarlet cord from a window. This act of faith changed her life by placing her in the genealogy of Christ. Rahab is the youngest daughter of a Canaanite farmer, taken to Jericho for the pagan New Year so her father can find her a wealthy spouse. Sala, the Israelite boy who had once saved her from being kidnapped, is also in Jericho. When the two young people meet again they admit their love for one another, but their different religions make marriage impossible. Their love story plays out against the background of Jericho s pagan rites. It is only when the One True God of Israel comes into Rahab s life and she realizes what He is calling her to do that she and Sala can come together. Witness Rahab as a young woman determined to find her destiny as she follows her heart toward true love . . . and the One True God. \\"Wolf (A Reluctant Queen) holds our interest by skillfully conjuring up a fascinating version of Rahab s story, successfully persuading us that the story is far more complex than merely a  scarlet cord.

Through twelve years of parenting, Cathy Spigarelli has learned moms need other moms, for advice, reassurance, suggestions, and camaraderie. In her book, \\"Life as a Mommy,\\" moms find just such support. Every day for a year, Cathy wrote about life with her three, young children. The 365 compact entries have a girlfriend-to-girlfriend, conversational tone and can be read in minutes, without guilt. \\"Life as a Mommy\\" provides a window into the daily life of a mom, revealing her triumphs and struggles, her joy and laughter, and her dilemmas and concerns.

Exact facsimile of the original edition and not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The book's title refers to the legendary Seal of Solomon, a ring that supposedly gave King Solomon the power to speak to animals. Lorenz claims that he likewise achieved this feat of communication with several species. He accomplished this by raising them in and around his home and observing their behavior. King Solomon's Ring describes the methods of his investigation, and his resulting findings about animal psychology. Lorenz's findings include the surprisingly refined social system of the common Eurasian jackdaw, the uncanny behavior and bodily features of the tiny water shrew, and the surprisingly complex interactions of seemingly unintelligent aquarium fish. He interlards his narrative with anecdotes based on his unusual methods, without which he could not have made many of his observations. King Solomon's Ring dispels several common misconceptions about animals' intelligence, but at the same time points out many of their similarities with humans, although some of these similarities come from speculative extrapolations (in fact, Lorenz has been criticized for excessive anthropomorphism). King Solomon's Ring also addresses the issue of keeping pets. Lorenz praises the benefits that a pet owner derives from his pet, however, he also describes the hazards that an animal can pose to the inhabitants and material contents of a house, and the ways in which a pet's captivity can make it miserable, and explains how to avoid each of these causes for discontent. A few of the findings it presents have found their way into common knowledge since its publication, such as the phenomenon of imprinting. 'It is one of the best and most penetrating non-technical books about animals and animal nature that has ever been written ... every sensitive reader will agree that the book is a work of humanity, wisdom and balance as well as of delightful humour.' - W H Thorpe Contents: Animals as a nuisance -- Something that does no danage: the aquarium -- Robbery in the aquarium -- Poor fish -- Laughing at animals -- Pitying animals -- Buying animals -- The language of animals -- The taming of the shrew -- The covenant -- The perennial retainers -- Morals and weapons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jYqVzQEACAAJ&dq=King+Solomon%27s+Ring%3B:+New+Light+on+Animal+Ways&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cost Accounting and Student CD Package, 11th Edition","description":"Work more effectively and gauge your progress as you go along!

Travelling in unreliable boats to remote outposts to treat the sick, attending births in the most primitive conditions and teaching from standard, middle-class textbooks children who had never even seen a car, this gutsy young woman rose to the challenge. The clash of cultures Hughina experienced was extreme, but through it she developed a new understanding of the people she had been sent to teach and treat, discovering their age-old traditions and witnessing  things that should not be forgotten.

When her husband fails to gain promotion to archdeacon and retreats into isolated bitterness, and the bullying of her daughter at the local comprehensive reaches an intolerable level, Anna rebels. She takes a job in the local supermarket where she earns her own money, her sense of self-worth, the shocked disapproval of the parish and the icy fury of her husband. She also attracts the passionate interest of three very different men, each of whom was to play a significant part in the blossoming of her life...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7tYYNCr7VuEC&dq=The+Rector%27s+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Congress Of Vienna","description":"Following on from his epic  1812: Napoleon's Fatal March on Moscow , bestselling author Adam Zamoyski has written the dramatic story of the Congress of Vienna.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BvTVJjUaM40C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is My Story","description":"\\"No attempt has been made to present a critical study of Frances Jane Crosby, but simply to retell the life of the Sightless Singer as she, herself, told it to me on various occasions when visiting my home\\" - p. 11.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e8rqPAAACAAJ&dq=This+is+My+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Personal: Feminist Occasions and Other Autobiographical Acts","description":"In the era of identity politics, whose is the I of cultural criticism? And what does the invention of an autobiographical persona have to do with contemporary theory? In Getting Personal, Nancy K. Miller reflects upon the ways in which contingencies of identity and location shape the writing of academic argument and the living of an academic life. Getting Personal explores the new territory of feminist cultural studies and its connections to literary interpretation. The book is organized around a number of academic scenes in which Miller analyses the stakes of feminist critical performance. The focus on occasions, from the conference to the seminar to the professional colloquium, produces an autobiographical perspective on the mini-drama of institutional politics - whether faculty struggles over the canon in elite universities, or student strivings for self-authorization in large urban ones. Writing as a feminist critic, Miller describes the dilemmas of a responsible pedogogic practice: the contradictory demands of authority and complicity for a feminist teacher of literature. Getting Personal examines the rhetorical strategies of a feminism traversed by internal debates over its own self-representations. Working through and among quotations of voices that might otherwise not address each other, Miller assesses a crisis and offers a project for moving on.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=em24AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Checkpoint Lambda","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flirting With Trouble (Harlequin American Romance)","description":"Can A High-Society Girl Give Up Life In The Fast Lane For Love In Fairlane?

This helpful guide starts from the fundamental truth that God created everything and applies that truth the doctrine of creation to kids and their bodies. With the help of God Made All of Me, parents and caregivers can begin conversations with boys and girls about their bodies, helping kids understand the difference between the appropriate and inappropriate touch of others.

Robert Sharf opens this important and far-reaching book by raising a host of historical and hermeneutical problems with the encounter paradigm and the master narrative on which it is based. Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism is, among other things, an extended reflection on the theoretical foundations and conceptual categories that undergird the study of medieval Chinese Buddhism. Sharf draws his argument in part from a meticulous historical, philological, and philosophical analysis of the Treasure Store Treatise (Pao-tsang lun), an eighth-century Buddho-Taoist work apocryphally attributed to the fifth-century master Seng-chao (374414). In the process of coming to terms with this recondite text, Sharf ventures into all manner of subjects bearing on our understanding of medieval Chinese Buddhism, from the evolution of T ang \\"gentry Taoism\\" to the pivotal role of image veneration and the problematic status of Chinese Tantra. The volume includes a complete annotated translation of the Treasure Store Treatise, accompanied by the detailed exegesis of dozens of key terms and concepts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nD_mMy6ln4YC&dq=Coming+to+Terms+with+Chinese+Buddhism+(Studies+in+East+Asian+Buddhism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heaven in the Real World: The Transforming Touch of God","description":"Let the reality of Heaven shape your experience on Earth!

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Mersey to Missouri: A Doctor's Reflections on Life in the UK and USA","description":"Shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Best Book of the Year Award in 2011  A masterpiece.

The railroad served surrounding communities for over five generations by offering transportation, and the rail line's parent textile corporation built schools, churches, recreational areas, and a water supply for those communities. By the 1980s, modernization of the corporate structure eliminated the need for the railway and its equipment was sold off. However, part of its track bed is now a biking, hiking, and walking trail.

This greatly enlarged new edition provides the most detailed and accurate delineations of brain structure available. It includes features which assist in the new fields of neuroscience - functional imaging, resting state imaging and tractography. Atlas of the Human Brain is an essential guide to those working with human brain imaging or attempting to relate their observations on experimental animals to humans. Totally new in this edition is the inclusion of Nissl plates with delineation of cortical areas (Brodmann's areas), the first time that these areas have been presented in serial histological sections. The contents of the Atlas of the brain in MNI stereotaxic space has been extensively expanded from 143 pages, showing 69 levels through the hemisphere, to 314 pages representing 99 levels. In addition to the fiber-stained (myelin) plates, we now provide fifty new (Nissl) plates covering cytoarchitecture. These are interdigitated within the existing myelin plates of the stereotaxic atlas. All photographic plates now represent the complete hemisphere. All photographs of the cell- and fiber-stained sections have been transformed to fit the MNI-space. Major fiber tracts are identified in the fiber-stained sections. In the Nissl plates cortical delineations (Brodmann's areas) are provided for the first time. The number of diagrams increased to 99. They were now generated from the 3D reconstruction of the hemisphere registered to the MNI- stereotaxic space. They can be used for immediate comparison between our atlas and experimental and clinical imaging results. Parts of cortical areas are displayed at high magnification on the facing page of full page Nissl sections. Images selected highlight those areas which are thought to correspond with those published by von Economo and Koskinas (1925). A novel way of depicting cortical areal pattern is used: The cortical cytoarchitectonic ribbon is unfolded and presented linearly. This linear representation of the cortex enables the comparison of different interpretations of cortecal areas and allows mapping of activation sites.

Scholarly interpretation of these women often reduces them to mere stock characters who inform civic notions about Israel, the perennial underdog who, like these women, achieves against great odds. Or, they reflect the trickery and moral ambiguity inherent in their line as ancestresses of the House of David. However, when read for their gender information (and not for what they can tell readers about Israel), one finds women who employ strategies of deception and trickery, motivated by individual self-interest, in order to successfully maneuver within the system to their benefit. Such initiative can be seen as valorous: they save themselves through their own pluck and ingenuity. Thus, a close consideration of these stories finds that heroic biblical women carry their essential weapons upon and within themselves in their drive, their resolve and their cleverness. Using methods from biblical study as well as folklore, this study identifies biblical women motivated by self-interest coupled with deception and an incidence of the  bedtrick,  an instance of sexual trickery that challenges the text s power and gender dynamics. This identification puts Lot s daughters, Tamar, Ruth and Bathsheba, in league with female heroes from folk tale and legend. By contrasting and comparing common motifs and actions with traits established by other non-biblical female heroic narratives, strong heroic themes are located in all four narratives. This offers a dynamic argument for identifying the female biblical heroic. This work concludes that this new identification of heroic women in the Bible profoundly affects further interpretation of the Bible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z70wBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sheehan's mill,","description":"Irish immigrant in Nebraska loves horses, hard liquor and fighting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o1VmewAACAAJ&dq=Sheehan%27s+mill,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Restless","description":"Sally Gilmartin can t escape her past.

Their faith becomes a cherished treasure in our hearts, for they believed in the gospel that holds the righteousness of God. Therefore, we all need to have such faith urgently. Anyone who believes in Jesus must know the righteousness of God and believe in it, and he must spread it throughout the world, for only then can all others also come to know this righteousness and believe in it. And through the Word of God, all sinners must learn about His righteousness. And they must believe, for this is how they can take the righteousness of God by faith. Without the faith that allows one to attain God's righteousness from His Word, no one can accept the Lord as his Savior. We must now return to the true faith that knows and believes in the righteousness of God, for only those who believe in this righteousness of God can become His royal priests. The royal priests here refer to those who have received the remission of their sins by believing in God's righteousness.

When Navajo Police Special Investigator Ella Clah receives a mysterious package in the mail, she begins to suspect that Jimmy's death is part of something larger. Complicating the case is the fact that Jimmy's brother, Samuel Blacksheep, is also a cop, on the Farmington PD. Samuel is also ostensibly investigating Jimmy's death, but Ella wonders why Jimmy sent his secret message to her rather than his own brother. If Jimmy didn't trust Samuel, perhaps Ella shouldn't either. When even the FBI's experts are unable to figure out the dead man's message, Ella realizes that she must use Navajo lore, not cryptography, to decode it. Tantalizing clues link Jimmy's death to his military service but what could the medic have seen in Iraq that would make him a target for murder back home? Ella's personal life seems just as complicated as her case. Her mother, Rose Destea, marries her long-time beau, Herman Cloud, and moves in with him. While Ella is delighted to see her mother happy, she cannot help but worry about making sure her daughter, Dawn, is safe and cared for at all times. Dawn's father asks for a change in custody arrangements that will reduce Ella to a weekend mother a much easier fit with her workload but something that will take a terrible toll on her heart.

In the interests of this goal, the report outlines an integrated political, military, and economic strategy that the United States can pursue to inhibit the growth of rivalries in Asia and, more broadly, prevent the rise of instability in the region.

The next moment he s dead, the ground shaking in the aftermath of a deafening explosion. Months later, Deborah is still recovering from the assassination of her spouse and the collateral damage to her own body and soul. Bestselling author Judith Lamb is living with her partner of eight years in an isolated farmhouse on the Cornish moors, struggling with her latest novel. Her American lover, the tall, statuesque Joanna Verdura, is currently on assignment in Seneca. After reading about a diplomat killed by a car bomb meant for someone else, Joanna feels a strong compulsion to visit the dead man s widow. After all, Deborah is Judith s younger sister. Although she has been estranged from Judith for years, Deborah doesn t resist when Joanna whisks her off to Cornwall to grieve in peace, far from the political spotlight.

One of the most renowned figures in medieval history, Richard the Lionhearted, inspired by a vision of the Holy Land, led his knights onto the battlefields of the Third Crusade. During the years of fighting and intrigue, Richard's life was intertwined with the lives of two strong, vibrant, and drastically different women who loved him -- Berengaria, princess of Navarre, and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. While his marriage to Berengaria was ill-fated, Eleanor loved her son with a frantic, possessive pride. But it is Blondel, the king's lute player, who here steps forward from the shadows to tell this tale of romance, war, and betrayal. In her trademark style, Norah Lofts paints a complex and human portrait of a legendary king.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FPeRkHpgvJMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossing the Sauer: A Memoir of World War II","description":"A World War II veteran recounts his harrowing advance through Germany with Patton's Third Army, a harrowing and sometimes humorous tour of duty he shared with a host of colorful fellow soldiers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tPG-PQAACAAJ&dq=Crossing+the+Sauer:+A+Memoir+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death","description":"Includes essays by Nobel Laureate Dr. Norman E. Borlaug and other noted scientists and scholars The modern environmental movement began with the publication of three seminal works, Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring, Paul Ehrlich's \\"The Population Bomb, and the Club of Rome's \\"The Limits to Growth. These books' dismal visions of a poisoned, over-populated, resource-depleted world spiraling down toward environmental collapse are today's conventional wisdom. And every year we hear about new \\"conclusive\\" reports from special interest groups claiming that our atmosphere's temperatures are soaring, our air and water are more polluted, our cities are more crowded, and our global food supply is more precarious than ever before. However, according to a number of leading scientists from around the world, members of the environmental movement are guilty of twisting--sometimes manufacturing--the facts in an effort to frighten people into joining their cause. In this eye-opening book, some of the most respected researchers in the country explode the myths behind much of the doom and gloom of today's environmental movement. You will discover how the hysteria about global warming, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, biotechnology, energy shortages, and more are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. When placed beside the overwhelming facts, some of the most pervasive eco-myths crumble, including: Myth: Antarctica is melting due to global warming--threatening to raise ocean levels Fact: Antarctica has been cooling--and its glaciers thickening--for the past 30 years Myth: The global population is growing faster than our ability toproduce food Fact: Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills Myth: Modern pesticides and fertilizers are increasing the rates of cancer in humans Fact: No study has ever shown that anyone has developed cancer from the legal application of pesticides, and environmental pollution accounts for at most 2 percent of all cancer cases versus 30 percent caused by tobacco use And many more Ultimately, this book shows that uniting much of the environmental movement is an agenda that is not so much anti-pollution as it is anti-human. \\"Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths lays out the \\"true state of the planet, which, as you'll discover, is more healthy, vibrant, and clean than ideologically motivated environmentalists want you to believe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R7QQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Global+Warming+and+Other+Eco+Myths:+How+the+Environmental+Movement+Uses+False+Science+to+Scare+Us+to+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal Trouble In The Animal Kingdom","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CfHRAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Partners to History: Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and the Civil Rights Movement","description":"A visual memoir of the civil rights movement as viewed through the eyes of the daughter of the Reverend Ralph Abernathy captures key moments in the history of the struggle for civil rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZsIWAQAAIAAJ&dq=Partners+to+History:+Martin+Luther+King+Jr.,+Ralph+David+Abernathy,+and+the+Civil+Rights+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hole in the Heart","description":"\\"Midafternoon on a Tuesday, it occurred to Bean Jessup that she was forgetting her husband's face.\\" So begins this smart and charmingly written debut novel about a young woman trying to start over amid the grandeur of the Alaskan landscape and the creaky confines of an isolated fishing village and its relentless and pungent salmon cannery. A Hole in the Heart is the story of what happens when Bean arrives after accepting a last-minute elementary-school-teaching job in a town of 2500 people on Alaska's southern coast. Love and marriage follow in short order, surprising Bean, who feels that her husband is not only the best thing to happen to her, but the only good thing. Then Mick vanishes leading amateur hikers--or \\"tuna\\" as the guides call them--up Mt. McKinley. Suddenly, Bean is thrown back upon herself and into the company of Mick's mother Hanna, an arthritic woman in her seventies who believes that \\"a little larceny is good for the circulation.\\" The pair chafe at first, but eventually become partners in a road trip back to California. Mike's disappearance feels like a hole in the heart, they decide, and Hanna tells Bean to prize that hole; it's something no one can take away from her. With gentle humor, pathos, and boundless stores of hope, Marquis writes of Bean's struggle with early widowhood, loss, and moving on. An avid bird-watcher, Bean takes much of her wisdom from the Pemberton Guide to Alaska Birds. Like the globe-crossing birds she so admires, she has struggled to get aloft, but for a delicious, perhaps fleeting moment in this marvelous novel, we see her glide. Book Magazine selected Christopher Marquis as one of \\"Ten To Watch In 2003\\" for this \\"Proulxian saga.\\" With its first-rate evocation of landscape and its affectionately drawn characters, A Hole in the Heart marks the publication debut of a prodigiously talented writer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Tv6o3uoN-ewC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Threat to Justice: A Novel (Justice Riders)","description":"Ezra Justice and his elite group of special operation soldiers part ways after the Civil War, but when General Sherman calls for a team to combat the armed resistance against President Grant and his efforts to reconstruct America, the Justice Riders reunite.

In a clear voice, Maya Angelou vividly reminds us of our towering strength and beauty. Here is a poem that radiates wisdom and conviction, renewing our belief in the glory and tender mercies of our gender. Married to the extraordinary paintings Paul Gauguin, this book becomes a visionary commemoration of all that is wondrous in women. Gauguin painted women with exuberance and joy, reveling in their strength and beauty. His portraits are of women of color, women of power, women who gaze out at the viewer with the same quiet resolve and inner mystery that Angelou celebrates in her poem. Though Gauguin died twenty-five years before Angelou was born and these two artists lived very different lives in very different cultures, their work coalesces perfectly in this one glorious volume. Here is the ultimate gift for the phenomenal woman in your life--wife, lover, relative, teacher, friend. There's hardly a woman alive today who will not relate to the words of the poet Maya Angelou and the images of painter Paul Gauguin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Phenomenal+Women:+That%27s+Us!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Men/White Men: A Gay Anthology","description":"The Black and interracial gay experience in White,America is expressed through articles, stories,interviews, photos - by 43 writers and artists.,Re-issue of an out of print gay classic, with a,brilliant new cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lfRZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Men/White+Men:+A+Gay+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden earth: Travels in Burma","description":"All of the color, gaiety, and charm of Burma springs to life with this master story-teller, despite the fact that at the time of his visit much of the country was controlled by insurgents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_EUuAQAAIAAJ&dq=Golden+earth:+Travels+in+Burma&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Listener's Guide to Mozart's Great Operas (Dover Books on Music, Music History)","description":"Music excerpts are presented to show Mozart's use of tonal quality, voice interaction, and mood and melody changes in his five greatest operas","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fEzeTuKK_wkC&dq=A+Listener%27s+Guide+to+Mozart%27s+Great+Operas+(Dover+Books+on+Music,+Music+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Razorbacks: A story of Arkansas football","description":"From the humble beginnings in 1894, to the great programs of Frank Broyles, the National Championship in 1964, and Lou Holtz's Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma in 1978, and then to Arkansas's recent re-entry into the national rankings with bowl invitations--the whole spectrum of Hog football is covered in this lively chronicle.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_uVLLve1aI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucan: The Civil War (Pharsalia) (The Loeb Classical Library, No. 220)","description":"The only surviving work of the Roman poet Lucan and 1 of the supreme achievements of Augustan verse.

Jean d Ormesson also goes into the daily life of the Empire, its popular customs, and its contribution to the arts and the sciences, which, as he demonstrates, exercised an influence on the world as a whole, from the East to the West, and whose repercussions are still felt today. But it is all fiction, a thought experiment worthy of Jorge Luis Borges, and in the end The Glory of the Empire emerges as a great shimmering mirage, filling us with wonder even as it makes us wonder at the fugitive nature of power and the meaning of history itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0mA9DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+glory+of+the+Empire%3B:+A+novel,+a+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puritan Treasury of Quotations (Puritan Paperbacks)","description":"Aptly chosen quotations from the works of many of the great preachers and writers of the Puritan period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xet5NwAACAAJ&dq=Puritan+Treasury+of+Quotations+(Puritan+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algebraic Aspects of Cryptography (Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics, Vol. 3)","description":"From the reviews: \\"This is a textbook in cryptography with emphasis on algebraic methods.

Culled from nearly eight hundred pages of the author s  dream diaries  kept between 1965 and 1989, this singular journal reveals  the feverish inner life of an intensely private man, providing an uncanny mirror-image of [his] novelistic obsessions, insecurities, and moral preoccupations  (Publishers Weekly). In what Greene calls My Own World as opposed to the Common World of shared reality he accompanies Henry James on a disagreeable riverboat trip to Bogota, is caught in a guerilla crossfire with Evelyn Waugh and W. H. Auden, strolls in the Vatican garden with Pope John Paul II who s doling out Perugina chocolates like hosts, offers refuge to a suicidal Charlie Chaplin, and stages a disastrous play in blank verse for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. He also shares his headspace with Goebbels, Castro, Cocteau, Queen Elizabeth, D. H. Lawrence, and talking kittens. And the landscape is just as wide: from Nazi Germany to Haiti to West Africa to Bethlehem 1 AD and to Sweden where he seeks treatment for leprosy. Greene is a criminal, spy, lover, assassin, witness, and writer. Encompassing life, death, war, feuds, and career, and alternately absurdist, frightening, funny, and revealing, these fertile imaginings many of which found their way into Greene s fiction comprise nothing less than  an alternate autobiography . . . a uniquely candid self-portrait  of one of the giants of English literature (Kirkus Reviews).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u0RlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychological Treatment of Depression","description":"'A clear, rigorous account of cognitive behavioural methods for treating depression.' - British Journal of Psychiatry The use of behavioural and cognitive techniques for treating depression has yielded exciting results.

He is currently teaching Political Philosophy at Toronto University. 'Though like Our Lord and Socrates he does not publish much, he thinks and says a great deal and has had an enormous influence on our times'.

Conversations here means the minds of the interviewed and interviewer meet on equal terms in language that is transparently clear, informed, witty and entertaining'. Stephen Spender 'He is wise without seeming pompous, witty without seeming trivial, affectionate without seeming sentimental'.

It offers an imaginative reconstruction of the story of a man and his family who came to Iceland from Norway about AD 960. Soon after 960 Gisli, the central figure, was outlawed for killing his brother-in-law, and then, for thirteen years or more, he lived in hiding in remote parts of the northwest of Iceland until he was finally caught and killed by his enemies. Around this imaginative core the author has spun a web of conflicting passions - love, hare and jealousy between man and wife, brother and sister, brother-in-law - intricate emotional bonds which are here seen ironically patterned against a background of inevitable fate. Gisli, the hero, is portrayed not only as a man of strength and courage, but also a poet and dreamer, tormented in his outlawry by nightmarish visions which seem gradualy to sap his will to resist. The author's probing into the emotional depths of his characters, the superbly effective architecture of his narrative leading to the central climax, his sense of the dramatic, and his cool, compelling style all combine to make this one of the most memorable of all the Icelandic sagas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pxV7Cq4nFmkC&dq=The+Saga+of+Gisli+the+Outlaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MicrosoftOffice FrontPage2003 Bible","description":"If FrontPage 2003 can do it, you can do it too...

But these new versions are not only inviting and immensely readable, they also apply muchneeded consistency to key philosophical terms in these texts, lending structural links and philosophical rigor heretofore unavailable in English. Breathing new life into these originary classics, Hinton's new translations will stand as the definitive texts for our era. Perhaps the most broadly influential spiritual text in human history, Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching is the source of Taoist philosophy, which eventually developed into Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism. Equally influential in the social sphere, Confucious' Analects is the source of social wisdom in China. The Chuang Tzu is the wild and wacky prose complement to the Tao Te Ching.

In 1933, Ireland was a young state in its turbulent teens attempting to establish itself on the international stage. The people were scarred by recent memories of revolution, a War of Independence and a civil war, but they had lived through 10 years of relative peace. Two influential statesmen came to power in their respective countries: de Valera in Ireland and Hitler in Germany. Due to the latter, a large scale movement of people began. Ireland, under the leadership of de Valera, with the civil service established before him and a diverse population living there, had an unprecedented inward migratory issue to address. This book looks at the role of the civil service at home and abroad, its development and implementation of government policy and its involvement with international efforts to address the movement of German-speaking exiles fleeing the expanding National Socialist territory. It also explores the experiences of people around Ireland as they learn about the people fleeing and their responses to them.

Today most major cities have undertaken some form of sustainability initiative. Yet there have been few systematic comparisons across cities, or theoretically grounded considerations of what works and what does not, and why. In Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously, Kent Portney addresses this gap, offering a comprehensive overview and analysis of sustainability programs and policies in American cities. After discussing the conceptual underpinnings of sustainability, he examines the local aspects of sustainability; considers the measurement of sustainability and offers an index of  serious  sustainability for the fifty-five largest cities in the country; examines the relationship between sustainability and economic growth; and discusses issues of governance, equity, and implementation. He also offers extensive case studies, with separate chapters on large, medium-size, and small cities, and provides an empirically grounded analysis of why some large cities are more ambitious than others in their sustainability efforts. This second edition has been updated throughout, with new material that draws on the latest research. It also offers numerous additional case studies, a new chapter on management and implementation issues, and a greatly expanded comparative analysis of big-city sustainability initiatives. Portney shows how cities use the broad rubric of sustainability to achieve particular political ends, and he dispels the notion that only cities that are politically liberal are interested in sustainability. Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously draws a roadmap for effective sustainability initiatives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fLofEAAAQBAJ&dq=Taking+Sustainable+Cities+Seriously:+Economic+Development,+the+Environment,+and+Quality+of+Life+in+American+Cities+(American+and+Comparative+Environmental+Policy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fat Is Not Your Fate : Outsmart Your Genes and Lose the Weight Forever","description":"Offers advice on how to overcome genetic challenges in order to lose weight permanently, identifying six primary gene-based body types while outlining a weight-loss plan that can be customized to one's physical and emotional needs.

New York Times A #1 New York Times Bestseller, New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2018, and New York Times Notable Book A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs--and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \\"mental travelogue\\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vk5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ufdQAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Los Cinco Y El Tesoro De La Isla/ Five on a Tresure Island (Los Cinco/ the Five) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfcvAAAAYAAJ&dq=Los+Cinco+Y+El+Tesoro+De+La+Isla/+Five+on+a+Tresure+Island+(Los+Cinco/+the+Five)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anecdotes Of Destiny","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jjsPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Anecdotes+Of+Destiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jan's Rainbow; Stories of Hope; How those we have loved and lost stay in touch","description":"It was just one day after Lindsay Collier's wife of forty years, Jan, lost her battle with ovarian cancer that a beautiful rainbow surrounded their home in upstate New York where family members were gathered to celebrate her life. Since that time there have been many amazing experiences that have provided some very compelling proof that Jan is not very far away. And Lindsay, a former engineer (engineers always need proof), is not one who is prone to fantasy which makes these occurrences all the more believable. He also tells about some other rather amazing experiences that he and his family have had following losses of other loved ones. These stories alone will make a believer out of you. But there is much more! Lindsay also found that, as he related these stories to friends and associates, he would often find that they would frequently offer their own stories about how lost loved ones had made contact with them. The stories were amazing and revolved around everything from dragonflies to birds to lights and clocks changing to things appearing out of nowhere. There are more than twenty-five of these included in the book, all of which will leave you feeling very good - and a little less lonely for those you have lost. Lindsay made a commitment to learn as much as he could from his loss and to help others to find ways to survive their loss. He has spoken to a number of bereavement groups about how to survive loss and shares these insights in Jan's Rainbow. His suggestions and ideas on dealing with loss come from true experience. Before taking early retirement, Lindsay was the Creative Thinking Guru for Kodak so his ideas tend to be different. As he says, \\"Losing a loved one is a life-changing experience and it requires some very creative thinking to get through it.\\" There are some wonderful, and very different, tips for dealing with loss included that will ease the journey through the bereavement process. Included are ways to re-frame your thinking, how to use positive humor in your healing, and the use of metaphors to expand your thinking or finding innovative ways to survive, and much, much more. This book is a must for anyone who has lost a loved one or knows of someone who has. It is the ultimate \\"feel good\\" book for helping people to deal with losing a loved one. You'll cry, you'll laugh, and you'll be lifted to a new level of hope.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Peleliu","description":"Experience the epic saga of the McQuade family from the eve of World War II to the present.

Casey's remarkable doctrine of Visionary Activist Astrology. In this reverently irreverent mystery school disguised as a book (in which each of the planetary gods is a professor), we are invited to think of our lives as spiritual detective novels. For example, Venus teaches us that our affinities and quirks are clues to our unique mission and contribution to the world. The astrological language of the psyche is a tool for deciphering and revitalizing this sense of mission. Casey teaches you how to expand your range of intimacy with the ten parts of yourself represented by the planets, here called gods. You will learn how to use this language to reverence and feed the forces of your psyche that connect you to very real external forces. This book intends to catalyze a movement to engage the imagination of all people with a sense of humor and a desire to do collaborative good in the world. Expanding on the ideas first presented in her popular audiotape series, Inner and Outer Space, Casey explores the archetypes at the heart of human relationships, aspirations, and spiritual quests. In an engaging narrative enlivened by stories, fables, exercises, and meditations developed through her work as an astrological counselor, she provides a practical system of personal and collective liberation. Making the Gods Work for You provides us with innovative principles to live by and rituals inviting us to become active, dynamic participants in the dance of life.

Complicity is a story of the skeletons that remain in this nation s closet.  San Francisco Chronicle The North s profit from indeed, dependence on slavery has mostly been a shameful and well-kept secret . . . until now. Complicity reveals the cruel truth about the lucrative Triangle Trade of molasses, rum, and slaves that linked the North to the West Indies and Africa. It also discloses the reality of Northern empires built on tainted profits run, in some cases, by abolitionists and exposes the thousand-acre plantations that existed in towns such as Salem, Connecticut. Here, too, are eye-opening accounts of the individuals who profited directly from slavery far from the Mason-Dixon line. Culled from long-ignored documents and reports and bolstered by rarely seen photos, publications, maps, and period drawings Complicity is a fascinating and sobering work that actually does what so many books pretend to do: shed light on America s past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hax9XBAwkHkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abortion: A Mother's Plea for Maternity and the Unborn","description":"This provocative book tackles the abortion controversy including issues like \\"parental loss from a mother's perspective.\\" The book incorporates the author's personal experience that brought her to a clear moral awareness and to a desire to share her perspective on the subject.
