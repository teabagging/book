Locke is an important figure in the history of Western Philosophy. He is really the founding figure of the great empirical tradition which would go through Hume all the way up to the various analytical philosophies of the twentieth century.He is also a major political thinker whose importance for the great founders of America cannot be overestimated.Locke talks about the mind as tabula rasa as a blank slate which experience writes upon, and reflection compounds into ' complex ideas' The simple ideas come through experience. This total rejection of inherent ideas, and inherent structures of the mind is something which a lot of modern linguistic theory rejects.As to the way we apprehend experience immediately I think here too Locke is in some way contradicted by modern psychological theory which would speak in some sense about our structuring that experience through our own participation in perception. In other words Locke's model of perception is I believe a far too ' passive one'. I cannot however judge, as I do not know enough about the subject whether or not Lockean categories in these areas of perception, reflection and in general description of the way we experience and know the world have any force today.Locke's political thinking is incorporated in the Declaration of Independence with its formulation of rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. As strong opponent of tyrannical authority in the political world Locke's thinking made a real impact on the world. He is one of those thinkers at the foundation of modern democratic thought.The book is not easy reading. I can remember going back over it again and again to try and understand the difference between primary and secondary qualities- I can remember trying to understand how much of what Locke says has validity and is ' really the truth'.Parenthetically I think of how as a young person knowing the truth finding the truth was such a supreme value for me. And how I thus felt it so important to know whether Locke was ' right' or not. Time and experience perhaps have made me worse. And I see this work as yet one more effort to interpret and understand Reality . This is as if to say I at this age anyway seem to accept the idea that I myself will not know and find the truth in regard to everything, including the philosophy of Locke.Again. This is one of the major works of Western philosophy and it should be read and studied by one who cares to know the Western philosophical tradition."},{"Title":"An essay concerning human understanding","review":"The book is great, it's exactly what I need for a class I'm taking on Modern Philosophy. It appears to be an unabridged edition of Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding. It's clear and understandable as printed. The only compaint I have is that simply opening this book to read it split the cover away from the pages. The book is effectively coming unravelled. I have other books from the Prometheus lineup which have no such problem, however, they are all relatively short books of less than 150 pages. This one is over 600 pages and from what I can tell it appears that the binding just isn't up to task for the amount of pages in the book. I'm not sure if this is just a fluke or not. But to Amazon's credit they refunded me the price of the book. I'm very glad I ordered an Amazon.com product due to the excellent customer service I received and feel very safe in future purchases from Amazon."},{"Title":"An essay concerning human understanding","review":"The highest compliment I can pay this book is the fact that throughout my entire reading I found myself repeating (in my mind), &quot;I already knew that!&quot; This is evidence of how influential Locke's philosophy has been on our present-day understanding of human nature. Also, aesthetically, the book was enjoyable because of its &quot;courtly&quot; English."},{"Title":"An essay concerning human understanding","review":"The book looks like new and has good notes. And it is very cheap.

The writing is quite efficient, and with little repetition it is a useful primer for anyone studying post-colonial (or colonial) literature, especially if your studies have an emphasis on the West Indies.There are problems, however. The text is riddled with careless spelling and grammatical errors, so much so that it does not look as though it has been proof-read. Amon has some good ideas, but his writing is tainted by continual need to criticise colonial practices. Anyone reading at this level will already have formed their opinions about the merits or otherwise of colonialism and needs to know about the literature, not the politics.There are some good historical observations and local information that may not otherwise be available, and the informal style lacks the academic pretentiousness which taints so many books on this subject.A useful book, but the errors marred my enjoyment of it."},{"Title":"Tactile Values (New Issues Poetry & Prose)","review":"A searing book of poems. Honest and rigorous with a sensibility serene enough to listen to the shadows hovering below the surface of words.A stunning collection. A minor triumph of integrity and grace."},{"Title":"Tactile Values (New Issues Poetry & Prose)","review":"Scott's poems come at you like a great jazz line: at once controlled and extemporized; modulating, surprising, and honest --ever honest. You hear the poems at first reading and again when they repeat in your inner ear."},{"Title":"Tactile Values (New Issues Poetry & Prose)","review":"Mark Scott's words refuse to lie cold and aloof on the page. They rise and fall as inflections of voice, as pulses of action, as currents of feeling that leap across space to encircle the reader in a compelling embrace of memorable imagery, of imaginative memory. Scott takes everything personally - in the welcome sense of making even the abstract, intimate, and the intangible, concrete. These poems involve the reader not as a distanced spectator but as a confidante, a collaborator, a hands-on conspirator in wresting beauty from life's closely observed beasts.The volume's title describes the poet's project: to touch and be touched (and sometimes to exorcise unwanted touch). Scott's ingenious command of expression relays with palpable force his uncommon perceptions of our common vocations: our journeys through the thickets of love, loss, ambition, disappointment, longing; from the limpidness of childhood to the culpabilities of adulthood. Always, an imprint is scored - and, like the touch of an absent lover, viscerally felt long afterward."},{"Title":"One-Minute Prayers(TM) for Busy Moms","review":"I picked up this book in my grocery store pharmacy. What a fabulous place to sell inspirational gift books! With a cart full of groceries and a happily kicking two-year-old, I couldn't resist this title, ONE-MINUTE PRAYERS FOR BUSY MOMS.Is it possible to pray in one minute? If you're a mom, that may be all the time you have. Yet, the Apostle Paul tells us to \\"Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances\\" (1 Thes. 5:16). So doesn't this mean we're to keep our heart focused on God throughout our busy days?When we're overwhelmed with our to-do list, we can let God handle the details. When we're bursting to tell someone how happy or sad or excited or lonely we are...then we can lift our thoughts heavenward at any moment. We're not alone.Hope Lyda has written a beautiful book that allows us to peek into her personal relationship with Christ. She covers a variety of topics that moms face every day: how to have a moment of quiet, things we worry about, disciplining our children, finding purpose, and asking why.Each short meditation opens with a scripture from the New International Version of the Bible. Then we read a prayer from the author that we may also pray. For example, the topic, \\"It's About Respect\\" offers this opener, \\"Lord, mold me into a mother worthy of honor. I cannot force my children to respect me, but I can live a life that is fruitful, deeply rooted in Your truth, and overflowing with Your love. I vow to bring my childen up in a godly way.\\"Fresh hope is waiting for readers of this book. I know lots of mothers who could enjoy this as a gift. It would fit wonderfully in a pretty basket along with some other pampering favorites: chocolate, coffee or tea, scented lotions, etc.Moms give so much to others that it's nice when a book comes along that helps us feed our own souls first. By growing in our spiritual walks, we'll have a never-ending source for the renewal we need to keep on keeping on.--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester"},{"Title":"Executive's Guide to E-Business: From Tactics to Strategy","review":"Aimed at senior executives, \`E-Business' offers a mature look atthe competitive e-landscape, business models and e-commerce approachesbased upon 100s of PWC engagements.The well structured &amp;illustrated, unreferenced chapters span: a new business model (neitherhierarchical nor discrete steps); channel enhancement (valuepropositions for seller and buyers); channel enhancement impacts(organizations, people, processes and technology); value chainintegration (supply and customer networks); value chain integrationimpacts (organizations, people, processes and technology); industrytransformation (physcho or knowco, infrastructure, partnering,issues); industry transformation impacts (organizations, people,processes and technology); convergence (speed, strategies);convergence impacts (organizations, people); managing risk; navigatingchange; analytical framework; and a detailed view of e-nabled valuechain.Strengths include: the great structure, illustrations, tablesand sidebars; the intelligent, thoughtful, deep writing style; thedepth and breath of useful content (for executives to operationalstaff); and the frequent useful charts linking business objectives, tosuccess factors to enablers.Weakness include: the lack ofreferences (we must take the authors' words for credibility ofcontent!); the lack of case study or success story anecdotes to livenup the sometimes dryness of subject; slightly prescriptive tone; and alack of \\"interactivity\\" exercises for the reader.Otheralternatives/companion texts in this area include: May's technicalfocus \`The Business of E-Commerce' (ISBN 052177698); Hoque'sopinionated \`E-Enterprise' (ISBN: 052177487X); Cohan's draft reviewof \`e-Profit' (ISBN 0814405444); Siegel's glossy brainstorms in\`Futurize Your Enterprize'(0471357634); and Bloor's marketplacespin in \`electronic B@zaar' (ISBN185788258X).Overall,definitely one of the better books in this area, just needing morescience/alternative sources, and case studies to support youre-business change projects/ enterprises."},{"Title":"Executive's Guide to E-Business: From Tactics to Strategy","review":"Executive's guide to E-Business, clearly illustrates what strategies are neccessary to take advantage and profit of the internet's exploding growth.

Almost all are historic photo images gleaned from the files of state, county and city engineering and design bureaus. These were originally done for record purposes to document newly built structures.Several pages are devoted to each selected major structure. Yet this is more than a picture book. The author. due to his long experience with such work, is able to succintly discuss each selected structure and its hisstory.My only criticism is the omission of major bridges built from the late forties on. These innovative and spectacular post World War II bridges deserve memoirialization in this format. The new bridges built at the Point consequent to the rebuilding of a erstwhile junky and confused urban mess by parks and spectacular high rise buildings are the most obvious omission.I grew up in in the zone of influence of Pittsburgh in the forties in the city of Franklin located to the north in the Alleghany valley. ( The other close by industrisl cities of Cleveland snd Youngstown were just places vaguely located to the west, somewhere \\"over there\\") I learned to read adult publications with the aid of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. Thus I became aware very early on in my life of the rebuildng of the Point and downtown, and the elimination of the smoke menace by forbidding the burning of coal for power, manufacturing, and steam locomotives. Through the years I have kept up with developments there even after we left in 1953.Such spectacular structures as the I 79 Bridge across the Ohio just north across the Beaver County line, the accesses to the stadium on the North Side, snd the handsome replacements for the ancient junky jumble of miscelaneous railroad snd street bridges at the Point, and the replacement for the weak and inadequate, spindly Sewickley highway bridge are not included as they were all built post World War II.One may hope that the author does a volume covering the last fifty plus years continuing his excellent studies up to the millenium at least.(Just to be thorough, also do cover other major infrastructure components: the road and rail tunnels, the new busway and the light rail system to the South Hills)."},{"Title":"Everyday Creative Play: Simple Fun Things You Can Do to Help Your Preschooler Learn","review":"With this book, there are a plethora of ideas at a parent's fingertips.

I like Wilson a lot, but while he can create some great plots and interesting characters, he tends to work best in slightly more grounded worlds. It's clear from work like Sims that Wilson likes his fantasy/sci-fi driven by moral quandaries more than imaginative worlds. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that, but it definitely keeps The Tery from succeeding, as Wilson creates a world that doesn't feel natural so much as constructed for plot's sake. The politics and power dynamics of the world feel forced into making the point, and the species - particularly the titular Teries - feel like plot contrivances. The plot is missing Wilson's usual tightness, bouncing everywhere randomly until coming to a ridiculously forced climax. And none of this mentions the cringe-inducing romantic tension between a woman and her \\"pet,\\" culminating in a scene where the pet mutant bear masturbates happily over its owner. Look, I like Wilson a lot, and I even like the ideas he's attempting to play with here, even if he's done them better elsewhere (Sims). And, sure, there is a really neat twist about 3/4 of the way through the book; even though it's doesn't really change things, it's a great reveal. It's just that Wilson works better grounded in something closer to reality; his characters and situations deserve better than his ability (or lack thereof) to construct a plausible and believable fantasy world."},{"Title":"The Tery","review":"In which the estimable Dr. Wilson takes on fantasy with less than stellar results.

In \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" Wharton took readers on a trip through the stuffy upper crust of 1870s New York, wrapped up in a hopeless love affair.Newland Archer, of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May. But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Olenska, who has returned home after dumping her cheating count husband. At first, the two are friends, but then they become something more.After Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger. He starts to rebel in little ways, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and a safe, dull life?There's nothing too scandalous about \\"Age of Innocence\\" in a time when J.Lo acquires and discards boyfriends and husbands like old pantyhose. Probably it wasn't in the 1920s, when the book was first published. But this isn't a book to read if you appreciate sexiness and steam -- instead it's a social satire, a bittersweet romance, and a look at what happens when human beings lose all spontaneity and passion.Wharton brings old New York to life in this book -- opulent, beautiful, cultured, yet empty and kind of boring. It is \\"where the real thing was never said or done or even thought,\\" so tied up in tradition that nobody there really lives. And even though the unattainable countess is beautiful and sweet, it becomes obvious after awhile that Newland is actually in love with the idea of breaking out of his conventional life.Wharton's writing is a bit like a giant rosebud -- it takes forever to fully open. So don't be discouraged by the endless conversations about flowers, ballrooms and gloves. Wharton put them in to illustrate her point about New York at that time, and all the stories about different families, scandals and customs are actually very important.Newland seems like a rather boring person, since he only has brief bursts of individuality. But he gets more interesting when he struggles between his conscience and his longing for freedom. May is (suitably) pallid and a bit dull, while the Countess is alluringly mysterious and unconsciously rebellious. The fact that she doesn't TRY to rebel makes her far more interesting than Newland.\\"Age of Innocence\\" considered a story about a man in love with an unattainable woman, but it's also about that man straining against a stagnant, hypocritical society.

This book, after all, introduced me to that ballet.I could share video taped scenes of &quot;Coppelia&quot; as I showed her the illustrations in the book, and she seemed impressed. I hadn't really paid much attention to either &quot;Petrushka&quot; or the plot of &quot;Swan Lake&quot; until now, but in the nearly 20 years since I first read it, I've been struck by the sadness of those stories, and I've never forgotten how beautiful this book is."},{"Title":"The Royal Book of Ballet","review":"I remembered this from my childhood.

Both witty and penetrating it lays bare the successes and failures of some famous international campaigns. The essence, and the reason for these 5 stars, is not for his being an excellent raconteur. Instead his philosophy of dynamic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural teams must make sense to those marcomms exec's who try to scale the translation mountain.This is a book that is a MUST for those who have responsibility for putting out attractive messages internationally. Furthermore, it is an enlightening and instructive read for anyone in business, large or small, about the perils of communication on a global scale if one thinks only within one's home environment.Buy this book - you will be entertained and educated in the best possible way.Attend the next conference that Simon Anholt speaks at - you will be wiser for it."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"Author Simon Anholt, an international advertising consultant, says that the dangers of globalization can be just as formidable as the opportunities - if you fail to research the culture of your new markets. We've all heard the marketing legends of companies that embarrassed themselves by launching products into foreign markets without checking the translation of their brand names. Anholt retells several of these tales to illustrate the perils that await global firms that don't take culture into account. Meshing advertising and marketing strategy, he presents a systemic approach to cross-border product expansion.

It's a way of syncronising different points of view in one single idea.I really recommend to those professionals of global communication to read it. It's really interesting and fun."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"The whole issue of global promotional campaigns, whether in the form of high-profile advertising or the lower-profile but still significant form of marketing 'collateral', has recently gained an urgency that reflects the immediacy and pervasiveness of global, 'networked' business. In the fastest moving sectors, notably IT and telecoms, success in the marketplace is now measured in terms of global market share rather than local penetration. Of course 'globalization' was one of the buzzwords of the 'Seventies, but the characteristically arrogant approach often taken by large corporates was soon humbled by the offended and resentful response of local markets to these attempts to foist a global concept on widely disparate cultures and linguistic structures, so that the 'Eighties were characterized by an obsession with 'localization'. Came the 'Nineties, and globalization was back in favor, but this time tempered by attempts to cater to local sensibilities - what one might term a 'caring, sensitive globalization'. This approach has continued into the twenty-first century, further stimulated by the explosive success of the Internet.The true complexities masked by such facile trends are revealed in all their positively frightening variety by Simon Anholt - his anecdotes range from the merely funny to the genuinely macabre. More interesting still, though, is his clear demonstration that while many people active on the international scene claim to understand the issues involved in global campaigns, the bulk of them are paying lip service to an abstract concept rather than understanding and appreciating cultural differences in all their complex detail. Anholt's focus on the cultural rather than the purely linguistic aspects of a targeted marketing approach is laudable; his expositions are more detailed than any I have read to date, while remaining firmly and pragmatically focused on the original intention behind a campaign and the practical issues involved in fulfilling that intention. Anholt's focus on message and effective impact represents a refreshing approach to a topic that is all too often reduced to linguistic quibbling, and he amply demonstrates the dangers of such a purely linguistic approach.Anholt's rejection of translation is entirely appropriate, given the sophistication of his premises. Certainly the extraordinarily literal approach often adopted by conventional translation companies and individual translators is wholly incompatible with the objectives and intentions of effective communications, where a central message is reinforced by secondary branding and positioning that must be persuasive and pervasive in order to make the necessary impact. Anholt discusses the difficulties inherent in transplanting such requirements from one national market to another with a fast-moving, light touch, but he does not hesitate to plumb the issues involved in considerable detail.His conclusions are consonant with the increasingly popular 'network management' models espoused by the most influential business gurus - the difference being that Anholt has been successfully practising such a business model for well over a decade. I thoroughly enjoyed this enlightening work, which manages to combine in-depth analysis with a broad sweep and witty style that holds one's attention to the end."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"As marketing and branding become increasingly global, older treatments are seeming increasingly provincial and out-of-date. Anholt's book is the first I've come across that so succinctly elucidates the new global marketplace and how best to develop the mind-set to thrive within it. The breezy writing style, wit and intelligence -- and the writer's vast international experience -- make this a must-read for anyone whose business and livelihood depend upon adapting to the new rules of the game. The book should be required reading for all business schools and, perhaps more importantly, for anyone already working in marketing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"Vincent Toolan misses the point. What is the alternative to being passionate about relevant cultural messages, and where exactly is Anholt going wrong in establishing top international teams to deliver them? The arrogance and lack of comprehension portrayed in many international campaigns is alarming, and Anholt's efforts to identify and illuminate cultural and linguistic differences makes great reading."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"What has a hippopotamus got to do with the Titanic? Or what have a hippo's ears got to do with an iceberg? That's right - I am talking about Simon Anholt's book! As the creative director of a Polish ad agency, I still have to watch sadly as so called international brands confuse us Poles with Czechs. Darlings, don't think we can't tell that the housewife in the washing powder ad is actually from Prague! Apart from the fact that we know it's just a Polish voice over, we can simply feel in our bones that she's just not one of us. Nor, I'm afraid, are you. Just like Gwyneth Paltrow is just not English, even if she can do the accent! Do you know what I'm saying? Put simply, it's not only language that makes us different. Simon has written a book which can prevent companies with international aspirations from making terrible and stupid mistakes. Read it, look at your brand from a different angle, refresh your marketing view and learn about a revolutionary and inevitable new concept - smart centralisation.

There is much talk of the global village and global campaigns - and how the communications revolution will allow everyone to reach everyone else. But will the message that's delivered be understood? Is it couched in the language, culture and context of its potential market and does the concept translate to this different environment? And if it does will your message be in conflict with other cultural values?Simon Anholt is an acknowledged leader in devising international campaigns that cross cultural divides and in this entertaining and iconoclastic book he demolishes the myths surrounding international campaigns and shows how much still needs to be done to develop truly multinational campaigns. In the process he takes you on an entertaining, funny and always informative journey through his craft. This wonderful book is a manual, and a warning for all marketers who have anything to do with international campaigns: they are a minefield. &quot;Another One Bites The Grass&quot; is required reading if you want to avoid disaster and should have a warning on the jacket for would be international marketers: &quot;Buy before you try!&quot;"},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"isn't it ironic that for an industry that churns out tons of new ideas for other industries everyday, it hasn't come out with even one for itself in decades?at long last, somebody in this business is really thinking outside the proverbial box."},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"Of all the many complexities of conducting business internationally, developing advertising is surely the most intractable. How can any one manager, no matter how cosmopolitan, understand the nuances of a neighbouring country - with its own history, language, humour and (to name one example) attitude to pets - well enough to develop meaningful advertising?Anholt has a wealth of experience in building international advertising campaigns. His book is strong on identifying the difficulties, with anecdote and wisdom - the babyfood story in Africa is a favourite. But what he fails to deliver is more insight into what a successful global campaign looks like. There are a handful of examples (e.g. Nike's &quot;Just do it&quot; in French - &quot;ta vie est a toi&quot;) which whet the appetite; but his prescription, of bringing together an international team to develop advertising jointly, is more of an infomercial for his own organisation than a solution for a troubled international marketing manager.A sequel of successful case studies, with lessons learned, would be really welcome.

Most companies fail miserably in this department, and he outlines the reasons why. He also provides a model for &quot;smart centralization,&quot; which he believes international advertising agencies should follow. This model also makes a great deal of sense for the development and management of global Web sites, which is one reason I enjoyed this book. I also liked how Anholt explained the inherent tension of trying to be both global and local at the same time. Here's an excerpt:The fundamental challenges of international marketing communications are about preserving the perfect balance between sensitivity to the culture of the brand and sensitivity to the culture of the consumers around the world. If you abandon or relax your grip on the first sensitivity, you end up with fragmentation, loss of identity, and loss of control. Abandon or relax your grip on the second, and you fail to communicate effectively, and fail to build a global brand.I also liked what he had to say about the importance of translation:So when the question comes up, why can't we just use English? I always ask this question: do you think that consumers should make the effort to understand us, or should we be making the effort to be understood by them? Are we more interested in being respected, or showing respect?"},{"Title":"Another One Bites the Grass: Making Sense of International Advertising","review":"Simon Anholt, the author, has a wealth of personal experience in the world of international advertising and copy-writing.

It is a rare book, in so far as very few marketers are positioned to understand the challenge of communicating across borders with subltety, but one which could not have come out at a more appropriate moment. The inherent scalability of internet propositions is making seamless cross-border marketing a top competitive advantage and a burning priority.

Culture is never a level, a standard, a trend, but a paradox mixture of personality + social articulation. You can exchange (&quot;translate&quot;) quantities, but not values. This basic concept was expressed powerfully by Oscar Wilde (and I like to tell it an idiom that is quite far away from Irish): &quot;Il cinico &egrave; colui che conosce il prezzo di tutto e il valore di nulla&quot;. Simon Anholt is sort of a Gianluca Vialli in advertising: the modern Champions League in advertising has many playgrounds, climates, referees - and that's why his international team wins a lot.

Yet, it is packed with accurate, pertinent physiology, bringing to real life what regular textbooks can barely hope to teach from the comfort of a clean, warm, dry room. This book is very fluently written, there is plenty to learn for layman and expert alike. Several times, I realized that what I learned while reading may prove lifesaving if my own life will ever be put to the survival test. One of the most valuable assets of this book is how it re-evaluates old dogmas and official inquiry conclusions based on new knowledge and research in physiology.

This book continues where \\"Being Human\\" has left off and takes us through an interesting story about The Beings.The Beings are made of energy and can take the shape of Earthlike pseudo-Egyptian-Greco-Roman-Norse-Mesopotamian-Gods i.e. Apollo, Artemis, Thoth, Anubis, Woden, and Hermes just to name a few. The Beings need worship to derive their energy and to get the people to worship them they hand out ambrosia to guarantee continued compliance.This book continues the storyline of Mackenzie Calhoun the captain of the U.S.S. Excalibur along with Captain Elizabeth Shelby for the U.S.S. Trident as they face these god-like beings in a show down. Freedom of thought vs. total compliance and worship of a pseudo-god are what's at stake. This book takes us from the Excalibur to the Trident to the planet Danter as we read on. There are twists and turns as McHenry is in a self-imposed state of stasis and is experiencing out of body experiences. The Danteri run off SiCwan and Kalinda as the Thallonians tried to pose a government with them as the head, only to be rescued by an icon in the Trek universe.This is a well-crafted story with plenty of action-adventure to go around. The beginning of the book is a little slow going as David sets-up the story, but there is plenty of character interaction and interplay to make the story interesting as it begins to take stride. There is a good space battle scene and as space begins to open up and things happen. There are scenes in this book that take us back to adventures of Kirk and crew and the original Enterprise-1701.All in all, this was a good, fast and interestingly enjoyable read. I gave it a solid 5 stars and it is worth the purchase price. A point of fact, I have NOT read anything by Peter David that was a dud, he is a very intertaining author that writes a well-told story."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"The latest installment in Peter David's &quot;New Frontier&quot; series got a little out of hand in its plot, but was ultimately enjoyable.When we last saw the crew (or, I should say, 'crews,' since Shelby's crew on the Trident is now just as much a part of the plot as Calhoun's on the Excalibur), they were getting beaten to a pulp by the ancient gods of historical earth, and we'd learned that Mark McHenry had, in his ancestry, one of those gods - Apollo. In the episode of the original series with Apollo, he took a lady lieutenant aside, and apparently, they conceived, which ultimately led to Mark and his odd abilities.Since Mark told Calhoun not to trust the gods (including Artemis, his childhood friend and adolescent lover), the gods smacked the Excalibur to heck and back, killing eight crewmembers, including Robin Lefler's apparently not-so-immortal mother, and leaving McHenry in a strange dead-but-not-decaying state.And that's just the set up at the start of this novel. Si Cwan is back on Danter, trying to rekindle the Thallonian empire (but one of the gods is also on Danter, handing out ambrosia, and things get awkward, fast). The role of the gods, ambrosia, and the effect it is having on the quadrant is the main plot of the story, and done interestingly, if a tad over the top, and of course, the McHenry story (like he'd really be totally dead). Ditto Robin's mother.The 'B' plot is the continuing story arc on the Trident of Lieutenant M'Ress, Lieutenant Commander Gleau, and Lieutenant Commander Arex - a twisted little love and hate and potential murder triangle that leaves one a little confused at best. Kat Meuller, Shelby's XO, gets quite a bit of attention in this book, and it's a good thing, but Peter David's tendancy to make everyone lust after the wrong person is starting to get a tad trite.I was looking forward to this book, so I think I was a little let down by holding it up a little high in my expectations. It has some great one-liners (a David trademark), and the plot advances in some significant ways, so I cannot complain overmuch. It was good enough, just a little heavy on the coincidence.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"Peter David scores a home run with God's Above. This latest installment has major changes in store for many of our characters and plenty of action. The last book left us with McHenry and Morgan Primus appearing to dead. We have a unique resolution to these to characters that will leave some pleased and some and leave some a bit sad. S'Cwan finally finds out how Lefler feels about him. New information is learned about Moke and we see a major change for the better with Zak Kebron and find out the reason for his behavior in the past that will surprise many. If you disliked Zak in the past you will probably find him more to your liking at the end of the book. I for one cant wait to see where New Frontier will lead.

It ruins it for someone who has not yet read it.... now the book along with every other New Frontier book is written by a geniues.

Its not the best in the series but its far better then most Star Trek books I have read."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"This was a pretty good follow up in the series, and the continuation of the events in Being Human, in which Mark McHenry was found to be a member of The Beings (like Apollo in the TOS episode \\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\\") and tells Captain Mackenzie Calhoun that Artemis is not to be trusted, resulting in the attack upon the Excalibur by the Beings. In this one, Mark McHenry is thought to be dead, and Morgan Primus is now integrated into the Excalibur's computer system because of an energy surge during the attack. Calhoun must work with Ambassador Spock and Ambassador Si Cwan to convince the Danteri people that The Beings, who have now ushered the Danteri people into hero worship, that The Beings are not gods and should be worshipped. Eventually Calhoun angers them and forces their hand, but he soon discovers who to destroy them. All the while, McHenry is stuck in a dimension between reality and death, while Zeus helps him \`survive' a little longer. Also, we discover the true origin of Moke, Calhoun's adopted son."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"And that would be reading as many &quot;Star Trek&quot; related books as possible as well as other sci-fi works! Even though I grew up with the Original Series Star Trek, I also came to love TNG as well and, later, VOYAGER and ENTERPRISE. Being an avid fan of sci-fi in general, however, it would be an injustice on my part not to mention the many other old and new sci-fi works that both led me to Star Trek and which have forever forged my love for all sci-fi works: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"In what seemed to have taken forever to produce the next installment of the New Frontier series within the Star Trek universe was well worth the wait to readers.After developing a very interesting storyline and expanding upon it from the original television series all those years ago, Peter David re-introduced the entities known as The Beings. The Beings are god like creatures whom ancient humans wrote about as Apollo, Zues, and the like from different human mythologies.The prequel to Gods Above, had The Beings once again bring their drug-like substance known as \`ambrosia' to the people of Danter with promises of enlightenment and prosperity in exchange for worship.But Capt. Calhoun of the Excalibur and wife, Capt. Shelby of the Trident know better. Calhoun's ship suffered greatly from the powers of The Beings when he challenged their power, in order to save the misguided Danteri people. Even Ambassador Si Cwan and sister Kalinda seemed to be at the mercy of the gods in the form of Anubis, Egyptian god of death.With both crews of the Trident an Excalibur trying to devise a way to stop the rampant spread of ambrosia and influence of The Beings, other sub-plots introduced continue:Mark McHenry who \`died' at the hand of Artemis, may not be dead at all even though his corpse resides in sickbay.Kebron continues his hide shedding and metamorphosis and the results are unexpected.Calhoun's adoptive son, Moke, learns something new about himself and surprises all.Soleta is tempted by the god of truth, Thoth, and even this Vulcan \`logic' comes in question.A really interesting development with Robin's mother, Morgan Primus comes to light.A classic Star Trek Icon stops in for a visit.And many more developments to keep the reader entertained. To me, it is amazing on how easy author Peter David can keep the reader energized and continually surprised with all the different plots. The New Frontier easily and continuously fleshes out its characters to keep them fresh and up to date. More so, the New Frontier series really is the more exciting of all the Star Trek series. Think of the crew of the Trident and Excalibur as a combination of a sorority/fraternity life, seedy soap opera, and a dark comedy all rolled into one continuous space faring jaunt.And as always, just when you think things are wrapped up, in classic Peter David style, he leaves the reader with a jaw dropping cliff hanger."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"Peter David, you are a god! This book, Gods Above, was one of the best of the series and I can't wait for Stone and Anvil, the fourteenth book in the series. The only thing that was disappointing about this book was Kebron's change that he introduced in the 12th book. I'm not gonna tell you what it is, but it just led up so much to this huge thing, but what really happened is just...dissapointing, really.Anyway! This book is freakin' awsome in everyway.

It also references events from the Gateway series. As I haven't read those books, I found it annoying that more explanation was not provided.The overall plot and pacing of the story is fine. The author's sharp wit (the thing that elevates this series above all other Trek books) has lost none of its edge; several times I laughed aloud at his humour. One of the most popular characters in the Trek universe makes a completely logical guest appearance (as opposed to just being thrown into the mix as a bit of stunt casting).However, I was distracted by the poor quality of the writing/editing. There were several typos and the whole things seemed a bit underdeveloped. Although it had great potential, to me it read more like a rough draft than a polished novel.2.75 stars."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I found it very wearisome for non-humans to constantly use human colloquialisms. To single out the most egregious example: \\"The S Squad\\"? Would the letter S even EXIST in Thallonian or Vulcan languages? On the TV shows most aliens sort of have to come across as weirdly made-up humans because that's what they are, but prose shouldn't have that problem. However, smarmy anachronistic humor is unavoidable in even the best Peter David novels, so that's not a big deal by itself.However, the deal with Captain Calhoun and his crew refusing to act in anything like a professional manner got old pretty quick. \\"Cowboy diplomacy\\" gets boring after a while. The Federation lets these goofballs represent its interests with alien civilizations? Why didn't they just defrost the Three Stooges' cryogenically preserved heads while they were at it?The Starfleet officers did at least as much hostility provoking in this novel (and the preceding one) as did the Beings, who IMHO didn't act too much differently than Si Cwan would've and has acted in their place, but apparently we weren't supposed to think about that.What the author declined to think about is what it would've been like if, instead of the silly drug dealer analogies and so on, worshippers had come to the Beings the way worshippers generally come to \\"gods\\" in the real world: willingly and sincerely. The characters might've actually had to THINK or something. THAT could've been interesting. THIS...was not. The deck was stacked against taking the Beings' approach seriously; it had to be all mind alteration and pettiness.Plus, and this is back to minor-level, why would Xenexians, Thallonians, etc. regard a jackal-headed god as inherently menacing? The Federation has member/ally races with the heads of fish, snakes, cats, etc. A jackal-headed being should be just another life-form to them. Anubis's appearance should've been a total non-issue, but it was singled out time and again. I'm presuming the series has mostly non-human main characters on purpose, but sometimes it's like the author isn't even aware of it himself.No Peter David novel is a total waste of time, but this is one of his lesser efforts. IMHO."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"Like all the books in this series, it won't stand alone; if you haven't read what went before it, the beginning will seem rather confusing. But at least it (mostly) actually has an ending, which is rare for books in this series. (There is a teaser for the beginning of the next book's plot, but no major plotline left unsettled.) I suppose if I must choose between a book with no beginning and a book with no ending, I'll settle for one with no beginning, and this book is the finale to one of the best stories in this admittedly very good series."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"...to the genius of Peter David in this conclusion to \\"Being Human\\". For the devoted reads of New Frontier, Peter David continues the adventures of Captain Calhoun and the Excalibur in their conflict with the supernatural \`beings' claiming to be the gods of Earth's ancient cultures.New readers might be a little lost starting with this book but it is possible to jump in without loosing much. Peter David does a great job of bringing a user up to speed and then dive into the meat of the story. This is a great story multiple characters in totally different settings and as with every other story Peter David does, the transitions are very graceful and with extreme skills.I personally believed David felt that some of his characters need a little shaking up and made some dramatic changes, providing him and his characters new avenues and directions for development.

The crew of the Excalibur is unique to say the least...Gods Above is quite interesting--well written, fast-paced, and it carries the story of the intrepid crews of Excalibur and Trident along...some minor changes incur, though...Especially to Morgan Primus, Mark McHenry, Zak Kebron, and Lt.

Morgan's body is jettisoned into space, her memory all that is left.Si Cwan and Kalinda are adrift, their only hope a great bird; it seems the Being on Danter didn't like the Thallonian royals' attitudes.Calhoun is nursing a massive chip, and it is here where Starfleet Captain must confront Xenexian Warlord in the ultimate contest of internal wills; Calhoun lusts for revenge, and he will have it.The truth behind Kebron's change is revealed, and it is a rather startling one, which means it's pulled off in typical Peter David fashion. We also see Soleta at her most vulnerable and potentially her most dangerous.Gleau finally irritates someone enough that he winds up in a rather interesting predicament at novel's end. Plus, the identity of the one-eyed man and his ravens is revealed, and after you've completed the novel, it is gratifying to know that you don't have to wait two years until the sequel.David has done a masterful job with the New Frontier series, and with this entry he proves that he is still one of the best writers in the Star Trek pantheon.Highly recommended, even for those of you who aren't regular New Frontier readers."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"...but it's definitely worth the wait.

You have McHenry in a state of limbo in which one individual can see his specter--an individual that will likewise play an important part in things to come, I'm sure--and Morgan Primus in a state of...well, it's a state alright.Calhoun is consumed by anger and a thirst for vengeance, and at the close of the novel, there is a nice reunion between the Xenexian Warlord and the Starfleet Captain.Mueller has discovered a new reason to despise Gleau, the elven gigilo and resident science chief of the \\"Trident.\\" M'Ress and Arex have a brief and rather humorous reunion with one of their former crewmen, who is along for the ride to Danter as an ambassador of sorts.Si Cwan and Kalinda escape Danter and find rescue in the form of a spacefaring bird, and Soleta...well, here's the thing about Soleta. You really don't know what to impart at the novel's close; it seems she may have been affected by the, um, \\"Godhead.\\"All that aside, \\"Gods Above\\" is one of the best New Frontier novels yet, and the ending will leave you with questions, but in this case, at least we won't have to wait two years to see the resolution."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"Yes. This is the worst Star Trek book I've ever read.The plot was interesting because I'd never heard of this new series before...but that was perhaps one of the few saving graces. Even the presence of Spock in the story could not entice me to actually read the entire book.I'm rather astonished that the editors let this book through. Each paragraph flowed awkwardly, with jarring syntax. The author kept using some kind of \\"punch line\\" writing style. He would give just a few facts, enough to make the reader wonder what had just happened. Then in the last sentence he'd throw in a final clarifying fact so the reader can say \\"Ah, that's what happened.\\"A good example would be from one of the earlier scenes. One of the characters was being choaked to death and was saved when his sister chopped off his attacker's arm. Instead of letting the action flow, the author chose to first show that the man wasn't choaking anymore, then to show that the hand wasn't attached to the attacker's body, and then to show that the blood flowing from the severed stump matched the color of the blood on the \\"cutting instrument\\".Even so, with the backwards flowing facts, I read on, wanting to at least know what was going to happen. Up until page 26.On page 26 of the paperback version, the captain actually SAID \\"Why isn't s/he up here?\\"Ok, so the character he was referring to (Burgyone) is apparently some multi-gender person. That's fine - heck it worked for Le Guin in the \\"Left Hand of Darkness\\"... but... Really, how can ANY person actually pronounce \\"s/he\\"? Is the slash prounced as the word \\"slash\\" or is it more of \\"she-he\\"?If the author had been using proper English, he would have realized several things. First, it's physically impossible to say \\"S/he\\" out loud, and in a 'crunch-time' situation the Captain is not going to bother stumbling over phrases like \\"he-she\\" anyway, he'd just say \\"he\\" and move on. Second, it would actually be appropriate to refer to the character as \\"he\\", and then spend maybe a paragraph or two to explain that this Burgyone was both male and female and then continue with the story.At that point I just skimmed the book, skipping over most of the text just to see how it ended.Then I turned and picked up a nice Ray Bradbury book to read... because although Bradbury's plot was extremly confusing, it at least had been written with better grammer and flowing text.I am just thankful that my copy of \\"Gods Above\\" was a public copy and not one I actually spent money on."},{"Title":"Gods Above (Star Trek New Frontier)","review":"I had forgotten that in the last New Frontier book Mark McHenry and Morgan Primus die. Only in this book we find they did not. He is in stasis, young Moke can see him, and McHenry speaks often to Wotan. Morgan has become the computer. The Beings, Gods from old Earth are still offering ambrosia and eternal life in exchange for being worshipped and killing those who cross them. Ambassador Spock makes an appearance on a Romulan Bird of Paradise, basically so he can humorously compare Calhoun's and Kirk's styles as captains... Only Mac and Shelby's ships are able to beat them because they don't fear them. Wotan traps them in black hole and McHenry becomes visible long enough to tell the crew goodbye, it's now his job to watch the black hole so they don't escape. And Kebron has changed. Oh yeah, Wotan is Moke's biological father. And Gleau is discovered dead in the last sentence.In all, it was too similar to Gaiman's _American Gods_ for my tastes. Any New Frontier book is welcome, devoured, especially in ppbk, but when it's this similar it loses some savor.

In this, his first book, \\"Leadership Wipeout,\\" Bolton pens a story about Ben Stevens, a Division President, whose life is careening out of control. Stevens justifies his workaholic behavior as necessary to provide his family with a comfortable life style - a common justification for most over-achievers - and also a convenient deception masking an underlying drive for achievement at any cost.Steven's wife surprises him with a \\"get away from it all\\" ski trip to Vail...a trip which could not have come at a better/worse time. His boss tells him that he is not leading, not executing; and by colleagues through a 360 review that he uses people through a hub and spoke leadership style that kills any hope of teamwork. Then, as he walks out the door for Vail, a key executive resigns and a crisis emerges that engulfs his division and his career.While at Vail, Ben takes a serious fall while skiing leaving him feeling vulnerable and wrestling with the realization his life was upside down and needs a serious overhaul. At this low ebb, Ed Davis, a senior ski instructor enters his life. Ed, a retired public relations executive, is really enjoying life presenting a real contrast to what Ben is feeling.As they get to know one another, Ed opens up to Ben confessing he was once fired as a result of being unprepared to lead others and creating a toxic work environment. Davis then at Ben's urging goes on to share insights he gained after his own \\"wipeout\\" as a leader.Author Bolton, through Davis, proceeds to share timeless wisdom about leadership, mindfulness, and being centered. Ben is transformed by the advice and puts what he has absorbed into practice with immediate success.Bolton (aka Davis) asks us to explore what drives our way of being? Every of minute of every day we have a choice to choose between two basic human emotions - fear or love. What we choose determines our behavior. When motivated by fear, behavior is characterized by negativity and limitations, blinding us to the reality of others as we focus on ourselves. Fear does not win hearts!However, when we are motivated by love, we are enlightened, seeing others as genuine people with real aspirations, dreams, cares and feelings. And good things follow.Bolton, like all sages, also suggests we take time each morning to clear our mind and get centered. His proposed exercise includes expressing gratitude and focusing on our real purpose - enrich the lives of others by making a contribution to their life. I have followed a routine like this for years and can endorse this \\"sacred time\\" as the best way to get anyone's day started.\\"Leadership Wipeout\\" is a quick read, packed with checkpoints for all, and will serve as a good reference well beyond the first reading."},{"Title":"Leadership Wipeout: The Story of an Executive's Crash and Rescue","review":"Chuck Bolton is on target with this tale of a leader finding his way back to top form.

Does there come a point where executives feel there is nothing more to learn, that they've been at it too long? Is it really true that there comes a point where you as a leader believe that you've \\"been there, done that?\\"Having been an executive myself for more than 35 years, I can say that at least for me (and I suspect many other executives) the answer is \\"yes\\"--just as it was for Ben Stevens, the central character in Bolton's book.Stevens is stressed out, but doesn't know what to do about it. He's losing ground personally and professionally and the last thing he needs is a ski vacation. There are too many mountains to climb both at home and at the office. But it's a gift from his family, so he goes.There's an old saying, \\"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\\" And for Ben that teacher comes in the form of retired CEO turned ski instructor, Ed Davis.The lessons don't come easy and lots must happen to get his attention. It is said that fatigue makes cowards of us all. Fatigue and stress certainly cloud Ben's judgment as he attempts a double black diamond expert slope, probably on the theory that when you know how to ride a bike, you can always ride a bike. But that depends on where you choose to ride.Ben's disastrous \\"mother of all wipeouts\\" finally brings him to the point where he is ready to hear what he needs to hear and learn what he needs to learn to transform his personal and professional life.The practical lessons of personal and professional renewal will be welcomed by many leaders who truly want to add value and make a difference in their organizations--and homes, but who have been so busy that they've lost sight of what's important to stay focused on what seems urgent.Armchair Interviews says: We highly recommend Leadership Wipeout."},{"Title":"Leadership Wipeout: The Story of an Executive's Crash and Rescue","review":"From John Howard Prin, author ofSecret Keeping: Overcoming Hidden Habits and AddictionsTake a highly stressed corporate executive whose job is in jeopardy because of his ineffective leadership role and put him on the ski slopes of Vail with an instructor who surprises him with far more than ski techniques. This is Chuck Bolton's innovative premise, and it's a good one. We learn through narrative and dialogue the lessons Ben gains from Ed, his mentor on the slopes and (as Ben discovers) in the boardroom.A business leader's function involves managing and motivating people, his/her team. There's the high-pressure, fear-based approach and there's the person-centered, sensitive approach. Stuck in the former approach, Ben comes to learn the many benefits of the latter, thanks to Ed's role model and sage advice.With each ski run and its challenges, Ben learns parallel parables to his near-disaster predicament back at the office. As he gains insights into viewing each colleague as a person with unique needs, and discovers ways to use emotional intelligence and mindfulness in his leadership styles with individuals, Ben creates a superior working environment that yields far better results.As a bonus, it became clear to me that ALL relationships -- family, parental, marital, social, political -- can benefit from the wisdom in this slim, pithy book."},{"Title":"Leadership Wipeout: The Story of an Executive's Crash and Rescue","review":"Chuck's extensive experience and unique perspective allows us to see the real story underlying careers of so many executives.

I couldn't find carbohydrate powder at the local nutrition store, or just protein powder. It was all combined and VERY expensive. The mid-morning snack bars are also not cheap. The book gives excellent guidelines, but you really need to know how to create and cook or to buy the cookbook for ideas how to prepare the various food selections.

Well written, thoughtful, graphic but not gory,insightful look at the human mind and all its quirks."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"This book is not like other books, where the authors dissect cases that they never worked on. All of these cases were handled by Dr. Vorpagel personally. Then the cases are presented in the format of a classroom, where the reader experiences the same learning journey as the classmates. It's a rare and refreshing read. But you'll never look at your neighbors the same way again."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"The book started out okay and strong but then it just got lost along the way of writing. The book is a non-fiction, somewhat autobiographical book on FBI Profiler and teacher at the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. In the beginning, the author focuses on the subject, Russell Vogpagel, who is the profiler and teacher. His experience with crime over the decades since the 1950s is rich in history and is interesting in itself. Unfortunately, his book goes back and forth between his class and his experiences and studying other cases. I would have organized the book to be more effective in it's matter. I had high expectations when I read Ann Rule's introduction to the text.One of my main problems with the book is that when Russ presents a case study to his class to solve as murder, suicide, or accident is his presentation style. To the reader, we only know what we are told. But to his class, he shows pictures (even graphic) and provides probably a lot more information regarding a case. They discuss among the class as to whether it's murder, suicide, or an accident.If there is one thing to learn is that an accident and murder is a lot easier to deal with than suicide. In cases of auto-erotic asphyxiation or when a plane crashes, it's likely an accident and not suicide. For the surviving families, an accident and even murder is easier to deal with than suicide. There is a lot of guilt.This book is not an easy read neither because of it's graphic content. It's an okay book. It's a good read for those inspiring to become profilers or true crime readers like myself."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"Of all the FBI profiler books, I like Roy Hazelwood's \`Dark Dreams: A Legendary FBI Profiler Examines Homicide and the Criminal Mind\\" the most although \\"Profiles in Murder\\" comes in a close second. Profilers, Hazelwood and Vorpagel do not attempt to decipher the 'why' of serial killers in their books, but concentrate on the different types of 'how,' and what the 'how' predicts about the serial killer.Russell Vorpagel (with the assistance of Joseph Harrington) narrates his book as though he were teaching a two-week overview of profiling to law enforcement officers and lawyers. He repeatedly tells his students that they can't expect to learn all of the nuances of profiling at his seminar. He also reminds readers that they can't become profiling experts by reading his book. So, how does one become a profiler? What does it take to become part of an elite squadron that is America's last line of defense against the \\"one and a quarter million psychotics roaming free and waiting to explode...\\"?A bullet-proof ego, for starters. Profilers have to think like sociopaths without becoming one. If Vorpagel occasionally comes across as pompous and egotistical in this book, remember that he is protecting himself. The FBI used to allow police officers, \\"each with a minimum of a psychology degree and five years of field experience\\" to participate in the one-year profiling course at Quantico. \\"Then a couple of students because so stressed out they committed suicide...Now only FBI agents attend the program.\\"The gristly cases presented in \\"Profiles in Murder\\" will turn the stomachs of even the toughest true-crime aficionados. At least the reader doesn't have to watch the slides or handle the evidence. One of the first cases Vorpagel discusses is that of Richard Trenton Chase, the man who drank the blood of his murder victims in order to keep his own blood from \`turning into powder.' He started his murder spree after he was released from a psychiatric hospital, even though the nurses knew he was tearing the heads off of birds. The psychiatrist in this case seems particularly obtuse. When he asked the nurse where Chase was obtaining the blood that was smeared on his shirt, she retorts: \\"Probably from birds with no heads.\\"There is a modicum of humor in this book.One of the most interesting case histories involves the author's close brush with death on the island of St. Croix, where he was stalked and shot by a psychotic Rastafarian.If you have a strong stomach and an interest in the macabre aspects of human behavior, \\"Profiles in Murder\\" will mesmerize even as it shocks, in spite of the somewhat awkward \`classroom' format."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"A must for anyone interested in psychological profiling."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"A must for anyone interested in the criminal mind."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"Mr Vorpagel and/or Mr Harrington,I was surprised to read your book and find such a nice mention of my father included in the Horton lawsuit chapter.

However, I must take GREAT issue with the manner in which this book was authored. Apparently an editor's pen has never been set to this manuscript in that it was one of the most poorly written books I have ever had to fight through. Replete with spelling and grammatical errors, confusing and clumsy fake-verbatim dialogue, I found the writing obscured the subject more than illuminated it. All in all, this is an annoying, rambling and tangential third-person account of what should have been an exciting, concise first-person narrative. My advice: Read it for the information, but if ever you need a ghost writer yourself, avoid the one chosen by Mr. Vorpagel."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"This is one of the best profiling books I have read. It doesn't focus so much on the profiler's life as it does on actual case history, which is what I prefer. I never got bored with this one as I have with others that tend to focus on the feelings and sometimes the professional jelousies between the FBI profilers. I would love to read another book of case stories by this team."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"In this engrossing book Russell Vorpagel instructs a class in death investigation. He uses some known (and some no-so-known) cases to teach his class (and the reader) about some of the intricacies of death investigation, which include critical thinking in solving cases in profiling. One of the major strengths of this book is Vorpagel's use of a myriad of cases to demonstrate his points. His instruction to his class followed by a case study demonstrates his points in full detail. This book is &quot;must read&quot; for anyone interested in death investigation and profiling."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"A very interesting look at the way a profiler creates his profiles of murderers and other criminals (most of whom seem to be mentally-ill). There are a number of spelling, grammatical, and other editing errors that sometimes make it confusing or hard-to-read. In a book produced by a publisher known for its scientific titles, I expected more care."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"While reading this book I had mixed emotions,(kinda like watching your mother-in-law drive off a cliff in your new Mercedes). To begin with, I loved certain aspects of this book. On the other hand, the editing was horrid! This book leaves no doubt about the expertise of Mr. Vorpagel's knowledge and ability as a criminal profiler and it is written in a unique format. It is presented as if Mr. Vorpagel is teaching a &quot;light&quot; course on criminal profiling to a class of 28 students, however, he only designates 4 class members as actual participants that he communicates with in a question and answer forum that encompasses a two-week long course. He picks two women and two men. The first woman is Asian, a public defender from Fresno; the second, a Latino,works with the California Dept. of Corrections. The first man, described as pale-faced, is with the Sacramento District Attorney's Office; and finally, a young African-American patrolman from San Francisco. I assume he presents it in this manner to keep the confusion to a minimum. For the most part, it works, but I would still get confused from time to time, as to who was doing the talking. I attribute this to poor writing. Another plus in dealing with a small group of people is that you get to know the varied personalities and you feel like you are part of the class.Another thing I liked about the presentation was that Mr. Vorpagel teaches by example. I found this to be a very precise way to make his points and he took them case-by-case, one at a time. In this way, I felt that I came away from each example with the maximum amount of knowledge, understanding and retention. It also made the reading much more exciting and the book much harder to put down.As I mentioned, there are some flaws in this book, and a few are glaring, but in the overall picture, the &quot;good&quot; outweighs the &quot;bad&quot; and I would still highly recommend it. I know that I learned a great deal from reading it."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"This book is very easy to read, I couldn't put it down (I read it in 4 hours).Very useful to public defenders, prosecutors, investigative officers, coroners, psychologists, etc. It gives a view of death investigations (forensics) as an art and not a science. The author takes you step by step through crime scenes depicting details that are gruesome and not for someone with a weak stomach. Overall, the author is very good and almost feels as if you are watching a horror movie. I recommend this book to anyone who works with death scenes, criminals and law enforcement."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"I believe I've read all the books by Douglas, Ressler, and all the others writing about psychological profiling, yet I still found this an absorbing and fascinating book. Vorpagel presents a number of cases in which the crime scene is not always what it appears to be, and the unexpected (but plausible) explanations are more surprising than the rabbit-out-of-the-hat endings of 99.9% of crime fiction. The story of the training exercise in Chapter 7 alone is worth the price of the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"This book started out with what I found kind of a stagey premise....with Vorpagel &quot;teaching&quot; a class of profiling students. There were some moments of interesting reading, but suddenly, in the final quarter of the book, Vorpagel and Harrington suddenly veered directly off the track of murder and profiling and went into two incredibly boring stories that had nothing to do with profiling at all. I'm beginning to wonder if anything is being written anymore, as far as forensic profiling, that says anything new. And I am also puzzled by the sheer number of these books lately that have veered far afield of their supposed topics. I found this a VERY average book."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"This ghostwritten book uses a stagey narrative device: it consists of direct quotes of Russell Vorpagel, the \\"author\\", and students in his criminology class. The result is contrived and non-believable.Chapter 3, for example, begins with an alleged verbatim transcript of a classroom exchange:\\"'The Richard Trenton Chase case,' Vorpagel [the author] said, 'went a long way in establishing the credibility of profiling.'Gary [a student] said, 'That's the first time I've heard of a real vampire case.\\"'They are rare. Yet, at almost the same time as the Chase case, another man with bloody habits was captured.\\"'Another vampire?' Marcus [another student] asked.'A joker name Crutchley started a rampage in West Virginia that ended in Florida. etc. etc.'\\"Come on. Was the ghostwriter taping hours, days and weeks of classroom exchanges between Vorpagel and his students, then transcribing him for this book? I don't think so. This narrative device is supposed to convey a feeling of authenticity, but it comes across as phony as a three-dollar bill.Moreover, the book is not a thoughtful summary of the science of criminal profiling. It's a series of bloody stories of heinous crimes. If that's what you want to read, fine. If you want significant insights into the purported subject of the book, forget it."},{"Title":"PROFILES IN MURDER","review":"If you are interested in the whys and hows here it is. When this man decided to put pen to paper he decided to let us into the deserted corridors of the killers mind. Upfront, in your face, and right on the mark. If this is the first book you buy on this subject than you are starting with the best."},{"Title":"A History Maker","review":"How can I review a book that's essentially indescribable? For one thing, A HISTORY MAKER isn't really a novel but a Stapledonian future-history in miniature, although it's too short and succinct to fit comfortably into that rambling genre. Perhaps the closest to Gray in style, wit, and profoundly enraged (civilized) humanism is my favorite Italian, Umberto Eco -- but A HISTORY MAKER remains apart from BAUDOLINO or any other surreal, fantasy or science fiction novel I've ever read. I've devoured about 3 or 4 such books each week for the past fifty-five years, so I'm a fair judge.If A HISTORY MAKER isn't a novel, nor a full-blown future history, what is it? It certainly is not, as the London DAILY TELEGRAPH blurb has it, \\"Sir Walter Scott meets Rollerball.\\" I bought the book a few years ago because a friend recommended it, but when I got it home I did a double-take at that awful blurb, which I dare say was meant as a come-on. It turned me off so I put A HISTORY MAKER up on a high shelf till this week. I'll grant the strong possibility of Borderer Walter Scott's influence, but comparing this book to \\"Rollerball\\" is hyter-styte, as Wat Dryhope might say. So's the literary review labeling the language in this book \\"futuristic,\\" when it's nocht but auld lang syne Scots Lowland tongue.\\"Rollerball\\" as I recall pandered to the superficially grown-up but socially preadolescent male who can't deal with his own testosterone but lacks the vigor to bash everything in sight -- and therefore does so vicariously. A HISTORY MAKER starts out misleading the reader into thinking that it might just be another one of those silly \\"heroic\\" war stories. But strobblin' Wat makes an unusual and highly imperfect hero -- confused, dour, educated, ambivalent, attractive to women, hating bloodshed but a braw warrior, a natural leader. I see him as Gray's future incarnation of Robert Bruce, who was no pulp fiction cowboy hero, but one of history's genuinely great men. Bruce, too, embodied the same characteristics; they even share a preference for ponies instead of gigantic warhorses.Once we realize that Wat lives, as Walt Whitman wrote, \\"in and out of the game, watching and wondering at it,\\" Gray has begun the process of standing the whole genre of male violence and hero worship on its doitered heid, and he keeps on till any sane person would be embarrassed ever again to take The Alamo, The Somme, Rambo or Iraq seriously. At the same time the author understands that male boredom and feelings of inadequacy are at the root of it all, and he sympathizes, as should we all. None the less, the older women, not the men, are the saviors of civilization in this book.I can't really describe A HISTORY MAKER. I can only revel in Gray's use of language, the punning names, the snatches of folklore and off-color doggerel, the tweaking of asinine Thatcherism/Toryism and love of liberty, and -- in the finest sci-fi tradition -- the casual way in which his Scotland of the 23rd Century is introduced to us. The story ends like a Mozart symphony, exactly when it should. As would occur in a genuine historical document, background, a glossary of Scots words, and what-happened-next get explained in five \\"historical\\" chapters after the story's end, plus a postscript. We could compare these post-chapters to Tolkein's in THE RETURN OF THE KING, but Gray's are as hysterical as they are historical -- parodies. After such a wrap-up there can be no sequel, so enjoy A HISTORY MAKER while it lasts. It's a brief book but nigh-hand perfect."},{"Title":"A History Maker","review":"After _Poor Things_, Gray's wonderful satire of Victorian literature, sexual politics, social convention, and who knows what else, I expected even solider and more inventive structure and style in _A History Maker_. Unfortunately the book is terribly uneven, the concluding chapters so rushed that the potentially important Delilah Puddock and the licentiousness she represents are insufficiently developed, the endnotes not carrying the comic punch of those in _Poor Things_ (or Nabokov's _Pale Fire_). Not a bad dystopian novel, better than average, but not Gray's best book either."},{"Title":"A History Maker","review":"Few authors are as inventive as Gray.

It explains things in ways modern books don't. (Because so often in modern books, people will tell you to buy this or that packaged thing from this or that brand and you either can't find it where you live or it's expensive, while this book tells you how to do it with simple ingredients like grapes or other fruit, baker's yeast etc.Of course, it also has sections covering brewer's yeast and other additives, but you can virtually make your wine with very simple ingredients, as it used to be in the past.)I really like how this book delivers the explanations in a very comprehensive and simple way, and still manages to delve more deeply into it as well, just at the right rhythm so you learn instead of drowning in too much info at once."},{"Title":"Successful wine making at home","review":"It turned out surprising well.

It was truly humorous and enjoyable. I also learned about what good movies have been made over the years, and also ones to avoid. Sometimes I didn't agree but I feel better equipped to go to the video rental store."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"Richard Roeper does not have the high caliber of the late, great Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert's original and foremost partner, but he is still a very entertaining movie reviewer. Of course, he isn't in the category of \\"highbrow, arty-intellectual film critics\\" in the likes of Ebert, Siskel, Pauline Kael, and Vincent Canby to name some, but as you read this book, you will smile and laugh as Roeper composes imaginative, witty lists such as \\"Actresses Who Have Yet to do a Nude Scene\\" and \\"The Gross Out Hall of Fame.\\" Personally, as Ebert decided to have his legendary movie review show go on (and the dying Siskel wanted Ebert to continue it, it was reported), he made a good choice picking Roeper as the permanent co-host. Many of us seem pretty comfortable with Roeper, a young man who although has given thumbs up to art films, still has a special place in the heart for fun movies we the audience like to look for a good escape."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"In his usual fashion, Richard Roeper again presents information he has gathered from other sources and tries to appear to be an expert on the subject. RR may be able to compile lists, but a true movie critic takes the time to explain his views. It is not difficult to prepare a list such as \\"Worst Movie Sequels\\" and then not explain what makes them bad. Roeper is capitalizing on the celebrity status he has fallen into since he has been paired with Roger Ebert. He is not a movie critic. He's a leech that Ebert has taken along for the ride."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"As I've said before there are two types of movie critics; those who like the movies nominated for Best Picture and those who are actually worth reading. Richard Roeper is one critic who clearly falls into the first category. Now perhaps one shouldn't be too harsh about what is supposed to be very light reading, a book of silly movie lists. But one cannot ignore the fact that Roeper is not a very interesting movie critic. Consider the six films made since 1997 that Roeper suggests should join the American Film Institute's 100 finest films. None of the six is an especially inspired choice. But \\"American Beauty\\"? \\"A Beautiful Mind\\"? The first is a meretricious, selfish, misogynistic film only partially redeemed by Kevin Spacey's performance. The second is cheap sentimental Oscar-mongering trash. Consider how Roeper thinks up a list of movies that should have been, but were not, nominated for best picture, and misses both \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Brazil.\\" And consider also how the list of movies that Roeper considers overrated mostly consists of small, independent pictures while those on the list that Roeper considers underrated consist of well-publicized would be blockbusters. I haven't seen either \\"3000 miles to Graceland\\" or \\"Angel Eyes,\\" but \\"Star Wars 2\\"? No, this is not a good sign. And what this about a list of 10 documentaries that are preferable to feature films? Only ten?Other critics have done a better job of defending trash and perhaps Roeper might have done a better job if he had chosen a less shallow format. But then again, maybe not. His lack of critical judgement is only part of a larger conventionality. Consider the list that is the title of the book. We know that a character is doomed if (a) he's a police officer on the verge of retirement and looking forward to his new condo or (b) they are teenagers who decide to have sex while a vicious psychotic is running around killing people. Excuse me? Haven't we been making jokes about these sort of clich&eacute;s for a decade or two? Other lists show a similar lack of imagination: bad movies that Seinfeld characters have appeared, bad movies that the stars of \\"Friends\\" have appeared it. There is also a certain prurience involved in such lists as female stars who have never done a nude scene, or two pages of actresses kissing other actresses, or more than a page of excruciatingly bad and leering porno film puns. Also conventional is the inclusion of \\"Ishtar\\" as one of the worst movies ever made, supposedly because it perhaps the most unprofitable comedy ever made. I suppose it might be useful for trivia purposes to know how many movies Jay Leno has made cameos in, or how many movies include \\"I Feel Good\\" on the soundtrack. And there are some nasty shots at \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" But overall this is a book that is more forgettable than fun."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"This material is better suited for a website, not a book."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"Not intended as a scholarly or unbiased book, this collection of movie lists range from the hilariously perceptive - \\"13 great perks of being a movie character\\" to the wholly opinionated - \\"The 40 worst movies I've ever seen.\\" The title caught my eye and the humorous writing kept me reading. Some of the lists are, well just lists like \\"Sequels that have equaled or bettered the original.\\" No explanation or justification - just a list. And some of the lists are just self indulgent - \\"Attack of the quote whores\\" which collects those random fluff love quotes that we see in advertisement and puts them on a couple of pages for no good reason at all. Still, Roeper has taken some of that love of movies that propelled him to where he is by showing \\"5 Reasons George Baily Isn't Such a Wonderful Guy in It's a Wonderful Life,\\" and the mentioned below \\"7 movies in which Ben Affleck cries like a big fat baby.\\" If you are looking for serious cinematic writing, go look for Pauline Kael.

If you're looking for a truly quick read, this is the book for you. Just don't pay full price!I'm sure Roeper is capable of writing a good book, even a book of lists that has a little more &quot;meat.&quot; But Roeper, and the publisher, shouldn't try to pass this off as more than a brochure."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"This book's lists run the gamut from the commendable (\\"Ten movies that didn't make the AFI list but should have\\") to the throwaway (pick the half-dozen lists of your choice).

The book is padded out in the extreme, and fleshing it out here and there would have helped-- a lot (his list of in-jokes briefly discusses only 13 films, and his \\"10 movie character imitations that men can't resist doing\\" misses things like Pacino in SCARFACE (\\"Say hello to my li'l frien'\\")). A mixed bag, but there are worse ways of killing an hour or so.PS: The back cover states that this book is the result of his years of watching thousands of films, yet in his SOURCES, he states that he consulted dozens of movie websites and hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles.

I particularly enjoyed &quot;Movies in Which Ben Affleck Cries Like a Big Fat Baby,&quot; the Joan Rivers' Oscar bloopers, 10 Highly Stupid Habits of Movie People,&quot; and Pop Songs on Permanent Rotation - I'd always wondered how many movies had used &quot;Respect&quot; or &quot;All Star.&quot;And his list of the worst movies ever was spot on - given that he limited it to 40."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"Know any film buffs? Chances are you do. It seems like they like to see movies just because they are movies. They are apt to be reminded of this scene or that line from some film most folks remember vaguely. They like to draw connections between seemingly unrelated movies, and they have a strong sense of the \\"man behind the curtain\\" of moviedom: the clich&eacute;s, the stolen plotlines, the mistakes, and so on.Richard Roeper knows this audience well. 10 Sure Signs is a quite unique film buff's document. It manages to be a both a book that will please film nerds, but also one that will not alienate less devoted movie fans. This is no dry tome filled with pages of figures, dates, and unadorned quotes. It is as much a book of humor as a study of film.However, one should note that, since it is a book of lists, the readability is a little low. It is the sort of book that works well in small doses-great dipping into periodically, but not for that long evening at home. It may also become dated fairly quickly, as new films arise that belong on the list-but part of the reader's fun may be in thinking of those new films."},{"Title":"10 Sure Signs a Movie Character is Doomed","review":"I was looking though this book and it's easy to look through--large type small sentences lots of white space, and found myself reading material I know this \\"author\\" did not write, because the material was lifted whole sale from items found on the internet and in books published prior to this one (try E TAILS volumes 1-3).The essays \\"Ten Sure Signs a Movie Character is doomed\\" and \\"13 Great Perks of Being a Movie character\\" and \\"9 rules of drinking in the movies\\" were Internet forwards. The man known as Roeper didn't write this, and I suspect, much of the rest of the book was swiped from the internet.I never did like this guy as a movie reviewer.

None of the lists are particularly illuminating, but many are funny and that's really all this book is aiming for. Unfortunately, this book is also so thin that it takes less than an hour to read.

Yet this book (which was written in the 1940s for advertising people) is just as relevant to my work as it is to anyone else who is a knowledge worker. This little book is one of the simplest summaries of commonsense---and articulating common sense is this book's greatest virtue. The book lays out a five step process for generating novel and not-so-novel ideas, articulating them, and giving them a life of their own. There are no examples, no case studies, just crisply articulated common-sense that you can put to immediate use. Everything that he says is stuff that you likely already know, so this is not one of those books that talks the lofty talk about \\"retraining your mind\\" and such obscure, undoable things. The idea in this book that most resonated with me was his comment that novel ideas are simply unusual connections among things that already exist and you might already know. The book takes about an hour to read from cover to cover (and I'm not even a fast reader).Although Mr. Bernbach probably never intended this book for consumers like me in the scientific research profession, I'd bet my money that this little gem might be just as \\"duh\\" or \\"aha\\"-evoking to people in any other knowledge-intensive line of white-collar work. The only note of caution: This book was originally written in the 1940s and the gender bias (\\"the creative man,\\" \\"he\\") is pervasive throughout its 48 pages.If you are in a profession where your \\"wealth\\" is measured in intellectual output, this is some of the best seven dollars you can invest in your education.

The Foreword to the edition I have (published by Waking Lion Press in 2009) was provided by William Bernbach (1911-1982), one-time chairman and CEO of what was Doyle Dane Bernbach, then renowned for many of the greatest ads in the 20th century. The booklet's author, James Webb Young (1886-1973), added a \\"Prefatory Note\\" in 1960. His first publication, How To Become An Advertising Man (1963), focuses on core concepts that every ad practitioner and copywriter should know:o Knowledge of Propositionso Knowledge of Marketso Knowledge of Messageso Knowledge of Message Carrierso Knowledge of Trade Channelso Knowledge of How Advertising Workso Knowledge of The Specific SituationToday, these core concepts continue to provide the \\"basics\\" on which all effective marketing depends when attempting to create or increase demand for the given product and/or service and multi-media advertising is without doubt advertising's most powerful resource. However, for at least the past 75 years, everything begins with a compelling idea.In A Technique for Producing Ideas, Webb offers what he characterizes as a \\"simple, five-step formula anyone can use to be more creative in business and in life! \\" Although the process itself is indeed simple, completing it to achieve the given results is a wholly different matter. Webb's focus is on the process by which to generate ideas. \\"They appear just as suddenly above the surface of the mind [like a lovely atoll above the surface of a deep blue sea]; and with that same air of magic and unaccountability. But the scientist knows that the South Sea atoll is the work of countless, unseen coral builders, working below the surface of the sea.\\" Keep in mind that Webb developed or encountered this insight decades ago.The details of the five-step \\"formula are best revealed in context, within the narrative. I will suggest now, however, that (a) this booklet is by no means relevant only to advertising or even to business in general, and (b) it can help almost anyone to develop more and better ideas when seeking a solution to a problem or an answer to a question. Because Webb thinks and writes so clearly, the booklet offers the additional benefit of helping its reader to reduce (if not eliminate) all the \\"clutter\\" in the mind that accumulates relentlessly over time."},{"Title":"A technique for producing ideas,","review":"This work presents a five step process for producing creative ideas in simple easy to understand terms.

Years ago, too, I attended a great class through UCLA Extension on the Creative Process. Taught by a psychologist, he outlined over the course of weeks, what this book distills in a few pages. Not that I didn't like that class (I did, a lot), but reading a short book beats weeks in a classroom every time.The most important part of this process, as far as I can tell, is what I'd call the incubation period - where you take your focus off your problem or issue and just allow the creative process to work. That's really hard for many of us because we don't trust that this process CAN work or WILL work for us on our problem or issue. That strikes me as normal and human and yet, because I have a hard time with this too, rather sad in a way. One way I try to overcome this is to keep some sort of meditation habit in force which just helps me calm the part of my mind that doesn't believe in either the benevolence or at the very least, neutrality, of the universe. Which it seems to me, the creative process, is a big part of.This book closes with a truth - people reading this will be enthused at first and then not use the process. Oh, maybe once or twice, but over time they'll forget it. I agree with this, but I'm determined to be more active in inviting in the muse to help me creatively.

However, it's a rousing good sea-faring book. As is true of many novels of the period, the book is told in first person narrative and almost diary form. Arthur Gordon Pym is a young man who through a series of extraordinary events, finds himself a stowaway on a whaling ship. However, that's just the beginning of his adventures, as he finds himself repeatedly thrust into the most unbelievable of situations.\\"Narrative\\" sometimes reads like a series of tall tales and requires a complete suspension of belief, but if you're able to do so, then it's a terrific story. I read most of the novel on a long train trip and it held my attention completely. I'm not normally a fan of \\"adventure\\" books, but \\"Narrative\\" is an exciting, brief read. Adults of all tastes are likely to enjoy this book as well as older youngsters who enjoy sea-faring stories and adventure. Finally, the introduction, by Richard Kopley, does a great job explaining the novel's subtext, which adds greatly to the reading experience."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"This story, Poe's only novel, is an endurance test for both reader and characters. I believe it was originally serialized, and reads like a collection of incidents rather than a complete story. However, it is a captivating tale, astounding in it's detail and casual horror. Arthur Gordon Pym was born under an unlucky star. He survives in the most inconceivable circumstances, from a drifting, overturned hulk to the frozen waters of the Antarctic. Each page turned piles more horror in his path, described with a growing clinical distance. Pym himself becomes more desensitized to each incident, until he views the irrational with a casual curiosity. The language is beautifully detailed, and some feel this story is the inspiration for &quot;Moby Dick.&quot;Altogether, a delightfully disturbing story. One of the best I have read."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Arthur Gordon Pym was a young man who had dreams of great adventure. He defied his family and stowed away on board a whaling ship. Doing this lead him into all sorts of exciting adventures. He confronted things like mutiny, near starvation, and altercations with different cultures.I'd have to say that this story is &quot;classic Poe&quot;. If you are a fan of Poe's short stories, you'll definitely like this book. I only had a few problems with the story. There were times that the story dragged, but this is far outweighed by the times that the story was very exciting, and I couldn't put the book down. I won't go into the ending, but it left me unsettled.I found that the explanatory notes were very helpful. I'm not a great scholar on any level, nor will I ever claim to be. The explanatory notes were very simple to understand, and it helped me understand portions of the story that caused confusion, particularly the end."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Poe's only novel reminded me of Gogol's \\"Dead Souls,\\" in that, in both, the story seems to take a weird turn toward the end and shuts down rather oddly. Gogol's excuse is that he became a fire-breathing convert to Christianity midway through writing his book, and so had no use for the book's initial cynical tone (instead we get a character rant on in socio-religious mode for awhile). I don't know what Poe's excuse is, but the effect of his end-of-story turn is remarkable, and I won't spoil it for you (unlike other reviewers below - warning!). There is a vivid, dreamlike, unsettling quality to the whole book, and (with the exception of a few dull pages of sailing life detail - not unlike \\"Moby Dick,\\" but with nowhere near as much page-filling excess) there is rip-roaring action from start to finish. Poe's yarn is full of incident, and every bit of it counts. So at midnight, lock the door, sit back, put your feet up, and soak up this book in the dim light of your hurricane lamp. It's, after all, one of many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore!"},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Suspense and horror pervade Poe's full-length story of entombment, mutiny, shipwreck, cannibalism, and more--a veritable catalog of all the human fears and foibles that Poe depicts in his more widely read tales of mystery and imagination.The novel opens with a prefatory episode, in which Pym describes a truly harrowing night at sea when he and his best friend Augustus, after having far too much to drink, went sailing during a storm. Instead of curing Pym of his wanderlust, the experience and Augustus's anecdotes about sea life fill his head with abnormally romantic visions of \\"shipwreck and famine; of captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some grey and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown.\\" It's an accurate summary of what ensues, and although it may sound a lot like Defoe, Poe livens things up with his own special brand of horror.After this preview, the rest of the novel feels like two main stories patched together around a central character. In the first adventure, Pym stows away on the ship owned by Augustus's father and emerges to discover that there has been a mutiny. The second half imagines a sort of \\"lost horizon\\" in the midst of Antarctica; instead of ice, there are temperate islands populated by devilishly affectionate natives.It's rip-roaring fun, and it slows down only in between, when Pym travels through the Galapagos Islands on the way to the South Pole. These chapters, paraphrased and plagiarized rather shamelessly from contemporary travel accounts, abound in longitudinal measurements (a map will come in handy) and summaries of previous real-life explorations of the South Seas. The interlude as a whole is remarkably similar to Poe's unfinished (and languid) novel, \\"The Journal of Julius Rodman,\\" published two years later, which also purports to be an account of unexplored territory--in this case, the Rocky Mountains. The fact that Poe had never been to either location doesn't help his fiction.But don't let these skimmable chapters put you off. Readers who enjoy such classics as \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" or \\"Treasure Island\\" will find \\"Arthur Gordon Pym\\" a thrilling contribution to the adventure genre. It is also one of his more accessible works for young readers, often resembling a yarn of the high seas, without the ponderous metaphysics that bog down some of Poe's shorter pieces of fiction. And fans of science fiction, fantasy, and horror will be interested in the novel's obvious influence on later writers such as Jules Verne (who even wrote a largely forgotten sequel, \\"The Sphinx of the Ice Fields\\") and, of course, H. P. Lovecraft (most notably his story \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\")."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"when it comes to things to shudder about, poe pulls out all the stops here- being buried alive, starvation, overwhelming thirst, ritual murder, cannibalism, insanity, etc.mixing factual and fantastical elements, this rich little novel is on the surface a gothic tale of seafaring adventure. but it is so filled with haunting images of suffering and amazing, fantastic discoveries it burrows into your subconcious.the wonderfully inconclusive termination of the narrative further adds to the feeling of awe."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"This is the dark narrative of the misadventures of a young man from New England. Pym has a big illusion of going to the sea, and so, secretly, he embarks in a ship. But the ship suffers a mutiny on board, led by ruthless and cruel men. After several days of storms and hunger, there is a shipwreck. The three survivors are rescued by another ship, whose crew is in search for the South Pole. Many adventures follow, and the end of the book is really horrifying.Beyond the plot, the importance of this novel is in the anguished and hair-rising mood it conveys. The relatively realistic beginning becomes a sort of magical horror gradually. It's like some Verne novel told in a hallucinated tone, feverish, tense, absolutely Poe. It will keep you constantly in tension, without pauses nor calm episodes, crossing the border of sanity."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Obviously I am the first reviewer to give this story only a 3 star rating. Why? I love and enjoy Poe's shorter stories and also his poetry. Yet the novel clearly is not his metier. Young Pym goes to sea in order to find adventure - and he truly finds it. One grotesque adventure is followed by an even more grotesque occurence and so forth. Thus the book gives a feeling as if a series of scenes were shown, the only connection between the individual parts being the narrator. Yes, many immages of beauty can be found, inspirational images. But these do not yet make for a good book. And at the very end Poe also realizes that he does not really have a novel on his hands. Thus he ends abruptly, claiming that the final chapters have been lost.Stylistically this novel is also far more uneven than the short stories of Poe, maybe because his wild and fertile imagination has to match each and every picture in the book with its respective style. Yet this being a narrative, I would have expected that Arthur Gordon Pym tells it, with his characteristica - and not a new kind of Pym on every other page. Thus the style adds further to the feeling that the book is merely a disjointed heap of images, thrown together into a novel rather than individually being developed into short stories or poems."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Claiming that this is the true narrative of a sea voyage by Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, Edgar Allen Poe records the strange, unbelievable events aboard the ship Grampus in 1827 and on a voyage of discovery to the Antarctic six months later. Published in 1838, Poe's fictionalized narrative, supposedly penned by Pym, a young man from Nantucket, describes Pym's experiences beginning in July, 1827. Stowed away in the hold of the ship and aided by his friend Augustus Barnard, whose father is captain of the Grampus, Pym endures more than a week alone and in almost total darkness before he discovers that a mutiny has occurred onboard.Macabre details of ghastly deaths and unrelieved bloodlust, the massacre of the crew, and the casting adrift of the captain presage even more gory events. A countermutiny, equally bloody, leaves only four men alive on the Grampus. A gale, a gruesome death ship which passes them, circling sharks, and additional deaths leave only two men alive when the brig capsizes.The second half of the account details the trip of discovery taken by Pym and the other survivor, along with an English crew from a passing ship, south to the \\"Antarctic Sea,\\" a voyage in which they go \\"more than eight degrees farther south than any previous navigators.\\" On this journey they encounter a monstrous \\"Arctic bear,\\" more than 15 feet long, a cat-like animal with red teeth and claws, warm water with Galapagos tortoises, a series of islands inhabited by canoe-paddling natives, the Aurora Borealis, hot and milky water, white ashy showers, and a huge human figure in white, not the sights reported by later Antarctic explorers.Poe's only novel, in the romantic tradition of sea adventures, presages the publication of Melville's Typee, which is a true story. In this case, Poe plays with the reader's sense of reality, claiming that his fictional narrative is true and that the fictional Pym had \\"refused\\" to publish it because he thought no one would believe his tale. Ironies abound, matched only by the romantic embellishments and imaginative \\"discoveries\\" in Antarctica that make this fast-paced narrative as full of tense drama as any soap opera. The abrupt \\"conclusion\\" remains ironically inconclusive. Breathless excitement and near death experiences, combined with mystical visions and inexplicable events, make this exciting narrative fun to read. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Written in 1838, this is the only complete novel written by Edgar Alan Poe. It is written as a first person narrative and describes in grisly detail the story of a stowaway on a whaling ship. I must say that I learned more about life at sea in those times than I ever wanted to know, especially the horror of near starvation, cannibalism, mistreatment and death. Every sentence seems to bring another repulsive incident and life at sea seems a serious and perhaps too realistic description.Good thing the book was short because it was difficult to read even though there was no doubt of the writer's skill.

Hence, I was in no hurry to pick up a novel-length story what was reputed to be one of his less successful and accessible works.Too bad. I have finally read it and it is by far the most fun I have ever had reading Poe. The story immediately caught me and kept me turning pages, chuckling with evil glee, every step of the way.

Now, 50-something years later, I still get the adrenalin rush. But for real, keep-the-lights-on-all-night terror, there's nothing like Edgar Allan Poe.But after all the anticipation, in the case of Poe's only full-length novel, \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,\\" I was disappointed. The book takes forever to tell the story; and when it does, the \\"narrative\\" is disjointed and spotty. I wonder if Poe got paid by the word to serialize it. I found my mind wandering as I read it.I even tried reading it on the Internet and it wasn't any better.As to the details, they are myriad and confusing.Young Arthur Gordon Pym and his friend Augustus devise a plan to run away to sea on the Grampus,a whale ship. Pym stows away (with his Labrador retriever, who mysteriously appears out of nowhere) andhides in a cubby deep in the ship. His friend Augustus tries to keep him supplied with food and water but is captured by mutineers. The crew divides into two armed camps. They drift for miles, run out of food, and are reduced to cannibalism.They find themselves in Antarctica among penguins and albatross and encounter bizarre tribes.

This is Poe's only full length novel and it is truly terrific. It's got darkness like only Poe can deliver, yet it is also very reminiscent of true narratives that relate the tales of violence and cannibalism in extreme circumstances.This novel has been accused in the past of not being realistic but I've got two things to say to that:1. It's fiction, and therefore has license to be fantastical in order to excite the reader2. This account was inspired by a real newspaper article Poe read and is truly reflective in many ways of narrative exploration history.The book is 200 pages and a fast and fun read. It's a classic you can sink your teeth into!"},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Poe only wrote one novel, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. The novel is a series of amazing adventures that happen to the young Pym. Pym hides in a casket-like box in a ship, along with a rotten ham and several bottles of liquor and a cask of wine. While trapped under the deck, Pym finds that his dog has also joined him in his misadventure. The book takes you through Pym's experiences of being trapped under deck without food or water. He also experiences a mutiny where a faction of the crew take over the ship and kill many of the other crew members before putting the captain and a few honest sailors into a small boat with now paddles or compass. Pym, his friend the Captain's son, and a super strong sailor who participated in the mutiny stick together for survival sake, especially around the African blood thirsty cook who beheads other sailors. The sailor who mentors Pym is half black and half white, which Poe calls a 'hybrid'. They undergo a range of adventures with a death ship full of corpses, and storms so violent that the ship is reduced to ruins. They are reduced to cannibalism and draw straws to determine who will be dinner. They find and eat a dead polar bear. They pass many icebergs until the water becomes warm and tropical as they get near Antarctica. They find a tropical island full of black men who become very treacherous to our heroes. They escape the island and get caught in a giant whirlpool that is going into the center of the earth, where they see a gigantic white glowing figure. Then Poe pulls a fast one on us and tells us that the final 3 chapters of Pym's narrative have been lost and unfortunately young Pym has recently died.What do we make of this crazy tale? This novel influenced Borges, Melville, and Jules Verne. Yet it is an odd novel, with an abrupt and truncated ending. In some ways it is a series of short stories strung together, each short story meant to give impressions of horror and adventure. Yet, I could not get over a distinct impression that Poe had written himself into a corner with no escape (after all what can possibly come after going into the center of the earth on a whirlpool at the south pole and seeing God or a giant angel?) and thus he wraps up the story in a very untidy manner.At times, Poe's descriptions of horror are extremely beautiful and masterly. The ghost ship description is especially well done. At other times he develops a careful plot of intrigue and betrayal. The sections about the tribe of black men is very well constructed. At other times he is very abrupt and shocking, such as the immediate stabbing death of the poor man who was sacrificed so that the others could eat him and survive.This brings up the topic as to whether a good novel must tie up all lose ends for the reader in a tidy plot resolution package? If this is what you seek in a novel, Arthur Gordon Pym is not the book for you.

I believe this story is a wonderful spine-tingling tale by the popular author Edgar Allan Poe. This story would be a wonderful addition to anyone's horror story collection, especially anyone who loves Edgar A.

In fact, I got so bad around 5th grade that, having torn through the stories and poems, I was even reading biographies about him. But somehow, even with all of that, I think I had missed this longer work. I'm sorry I did, because while this wildly overstuffed adventure is enjoyable now, I would have really loved it as a kid.When Arthur Gordon Pym stows away on a whaling ship, he little dreams that he'll encounter tyranny, mutiny, biblical storms, cannibalism, shipwreck...and Poe's just getting warmed up.I've read that he cobbled together this semi-novel from several shorter pieces he'd written. It has a somewhat uneven feel to it; episodic, even disjointed. And as the episodes are piled one on top of the other it becomes a tad much. But it is always fun, often thrilling, and the mayhem that lurks on the surface guards layer upon layer of allegory and allusion. As you read you find yourself saying, &quot;Hey, Melville borrowed that scene and Jack London got that idea here and Lovecraft cadged this plot...&quot; If you have any doubts about how influential a literary figure Edgar Allan Poe was, this melodramatic masterpiece will put them to rest.

It contains many helpful footnotes and insights into many nuances of the story I might not have noticed otherwise, as well as much history of the work and an assessment of its allusions to other texts.This book in general is admittedly not my favorite of Poe's works, but it does contain Poe's typical perversity. There is a good bit of adventure thrown in as well. However, it doesn't come off as well executed as most of his short stories. Some parts feel a little to long, and as a whole it didn't seem as packed with meaning as his shorter works. This is somewhat to be expected of a novel versus a short story, but nonetheless, I was a touch disappointed."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"Combine Robert Louis Stevenson with Jules Verne and you have Edgar Allen Poe's classic adventure tale of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket . In some ways this sole novel of Edgar Allen Poe is an extraordinary shipboard adventure filled with pirates and mutineers and in others it is a glimpse into fantastical imagined worlds similar to ones we have seen in works of Jules Verne and it is no wonder as this work has influenced writers as Jules Verne and Herman Melville and more recently Pym by Mat Johnson.It starts out as an adventure story as Pym and his buddy Augustus conjure up a scheme in which Arthur will stowaway on Augustus' father ship to set out on a seafaring adventure. As one might expect with Poe things don't go quite as planned and the book is a diary of young Arthur's improbable misadventures.Surprisingly Poe gives detailed accounts about the dynamics and structure of the ocean vessel. I had to wonder if he might at one time have fantasized about being a sailor or explorer. It does seem his fancy was caught by the tale of two seafaring survivors and thus he wrote the book.While it does have the dated feel, it is still a wonderful adventure read, fast paced and entertaining throughout."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"The cumulative horror this work builds is almost unimaginable.I had incredible feelings of anguish throughout. There were times I really didn't think I could bear to read any more. The more detached the narrative gets, the more haunting the story becomes.I can only give it 4 stars because I'm amazed a piece of writing could make one so uncomfortable and so disturbed. This is not by any means psychologically appropriate for a young person to read. Even for an adult, I would not sit down to read this unless you're sure you are prepared to face the literary equivalent of torture. Of course, it's not that it's not well written.

It's a great story, but you must bear in mind toward the end that at the time it was written Antarctica had not yet been explored. So when, in the story, they are still sailing in open water, the coordinates given place them squarely on land if one looks at a map. There are also other events that take place in the story that today we know are impossible, but when the period of writing is taken into consideration it makes the story even more enjoyable, because we get to see how people imagined still undiscovered places."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"America's literary fascination with the sea has created a wonderful collection of historic works. This is one of the best because it mixes the gothic with the working man. Poe's only novel is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"When the titular character of this book stows away aboard a vessel piloted by his friend's father, he expects to find only a bit of ocean-going adventure and a break from his life in a quiet sea-side town. Yet, Arthur Gordon Pym's experience at sea is anything but a good time, as he's confronted with every nightmare a sailor could possibly conceive of: mutiny, cannibalism, shipwreak, hostile natives. In this, Poe's longest work, the terror quickly mounts to a fevered pitch as bizarre, unfortunate and violent events plague Pym and his fellow seafarers throughout their journey. The reader can't help but be pulled along through this gripping narrative, where one catastrophe tops the next and new horrors await with every turn.In other words, this novel is a must-read for any Poe fan and certainly a great entry into the catalog of 19th century American fiction. Yet, although I hate to criticize an author as talented and universally respected as Poe, Pym isn't without it's flaws. For one thing, some descriptive passages - related to nautical architecture and equipment, the habits of certain species of wildlife, the geography of islands in the South Pacific, etc. - go on too long and may distract the modern reader (Poe's contemporaries may have found such details more interesting). Also, at times there is a certain stitched-together feeling to this work, as if two or three shorter works were blended together to make one long piece (the novel's ending will make this point clear). Yet, this was still a pioneering work and the above criticisms are not meant to dissuade anyone from reading this book.\\"Pym\\" may have been written 170 years ago, but it still has the power to shock modern readers.

The power of tension Poe reflects on the near of the whole plot is remarkable and admirable; it doesn't gets painful-like tense, but rather giving space to a crude sense of judgement. This novel doesn't only gets short in plot, but it is always extremely interesting and specially questioning, to the point of even asking the sanity of the own author (which generally happens with each of his narrations). The story is set on a classic sea environment, in which the protagonist is caught up on a terrifying scene of encagement, mutiny, canibalism, sea roughnes, insanity, and finally the arrival to a mysterious land of madness possesed by a number of merciless aborigeans. And all at the end, the former capitan and Arthur see themselves caught into a myst and...puff! the plot dissapeared and a number of \\"literary excuses\\" are given to reduce it's incompleteness. You see, the work is literary weak, even for a somewhat amateur but undoubtly base author like Edgar Allan Poe, but it gets delightful and even musical for it's extended themes and awkward situations; where the points of even comedy vs horror is set harshly (as you may notice to confuse some of Poe's comedy stories like the spectacles with sick suspense). An adventure tale of deception, thoughtful explanations, passages of philosophy, representation, and uncanny suspense matter is the whole that The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket gives off, but yet making it a complete novel, I stick to Poe onto terms in which \\"writers write novels because they can't make a good short story\\".

G. Pym who, with the help of a friend, becomes a stowaway on the whaling ship Grampus. While he is hidden, a mutiny occurs and Pym finds himself isolated. With two friends, he is able to overcome the violent mutineers only to be left adrift in a gale. They are rescued by another ship and set sail to find the South Pole. In this fanciful half of the novel, the South Pole contains a warm ocean surrounded by an icy barrier and is populated by an unusual people. The novel is filled with allegorical detail and has influenced a number of other writers. I recommend it highly to any serious student."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket","review":"I finally got around to reading this - Poe's only novel. Published in 1838, the prose is often awkward. I frequently was forced to re-read the convoluted, ran on, heavily segmented sentences. Getting past that . . . .A fabulous tale, told in high detail. From youthful protagonist Pym's New England home/family - to a near fatal sailboat accident - to stowaway on a whaler - shipwreck - cannabalism - trading vessel to uncharted waters in the Antarctic - stranded on an island of savage hostiles - and drawn into a seemingly hopeless excursion by canoe toward the south pole. Very high detail, much of it bordering on survival horror, but made very believable. Interesting style, with many loose ends left unaccounted . . . intentionally I think. The reader never suspects how the voyage ends (did Poe know?). The tale is told in first person by Pym. But did Pym really survive to tell this in person, and if so, how?A very engaging and a darn fine read once you adapt to the early 19th century syntax.

It is a plain account of design principles and ideas that fill almost all gaps that an avid DIYer could have, as well as showcasing three proven designs for those on a strict 1 way trip to ESL ownership. Like most, Mr Saunders strong opinions about the field, (Lovers of magnetic bass in Acoustic Suspension, Infinite Baffle, Bass Reflex and Passive Radiator Encloseures will be downright furious! ), but he does make some effort to seperate fact from his own preferences. The book features an overview of electrical theory (Dust off your high scool text books!),a logical flowchart of design methods which could easily be applied to other fields, discussions of materials and methods, and clear instructional help. A few small gripes. There are no photographs in the book. Although the illustrations are good, a photo of some finished units would be helpfull and photos could replace some of the more vague drawings.(Many DIYers would like to see a photo of a finished product before committing time and money).Curiously the front cover (Aust.Issue) does not even feature an ESL ,but the design for a magnetic TL enclosure. My final gripe is that the list of compatible parts and manufacturers needs expanding. There is very little use telling someone that the part they need is easily available in downtown NY if the book is published under licence in Aust.(Publishers Take Note! )Gripes aside this book is rightfully seen as the best in its field and is ESSENTIAL for those considering building an E.S.L."},{"Title":"Electrostatic Loudspeaker Design Cookbook","review":"This book not only teaches you how to design the ultimate sounding electrostatic speaker, but also gives you three ways to do it, using tweeters and woofers as needed.You also learn all about amps, crossovers, transformers, equalizers etc. And learn all the theory you need to know about woofers and tweeters. All what you are shown is given from an unbiased point of view.This book does need some work on it though. One small complaint is that it has no photo's. Another is that Appendix A: Sources, is missing. The worst complaint is that the diagrams are only top, bottom and side views. No exploded views until chapter 11.

He'd been murdered 1-1/2 years earlier by his then-current girlfriend.My loss sparked an interest in reading about lost and reconnected loves. This book is recommended by several psychologists who specialize in this particular field.The recommendation is a good one. The stories are mostly, but not all, happy endings. The age ranges of the reunited couples range from 20s thru 70s. It includes regular folk and some celebrities, like Suzanne Pleshette, the late Tom Poston, and Carol Channing, who reunited with someone from grammar school.Donna Hanover intersperses her own story of reconnection with the chapters of the book, which are broken down by particular topics of interest. The book was well organized and well written. I enjoyed every page of it. The photos are superfluous, but are, of course, easy to skip.If you need more material on the subject of lost and found loves, Nancy Kalish, a psychologist has written several books on the subject."},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"This book touched my heart.

The stories are well written. They captured my interest and brought tears to my eyes.I have recommended this book to many of my friends, married and single.

And it is reassuring for many to know that second chances are real. BUT, there is a chapter on people whose spouses left them for former sweethearts--and it seems like many of the people who reconnected with former loves were married or in committed relationships at the same time that they started reaching out to their exes.I mean, do you want people who are currently married to start looking back at these previous relationships whenever things get a bit difficult in their current situations? In many cases, these old loves haven't had to go through the trials of raising children, job losses, illness, etc. which is part of the reason that they are able to start afresh. These reunited couples don't seem to have a lot of shared baggage, which can be liberating.Also, it's not really right to marry someone if you haven't gotten over someone else is it? Because then when you reunite with the person was was/is your first choice, where does that leave you--and where does that leave your current spouse/partner?"},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"I expected this book to be about Donna Hanover's life but it is actually a collection of other people's lost and found love stories and advice on how to find a lost love. The format is very similar to \\"Lost and Found Lovers - Facts and Fantasies of Rekindled Romances\\" by Nancy Kalish, Ph.D. The stories are charming but after the first few become rather repetitive. Ms. Hanover's attempt to discuss the lost love phenomenon is unsatisfying and incomplete with only random references to research and comments from friendly psychologists. She is advocating that single women/men look up their old boyfriends/girlfriends without fully addressing the deeply emotional and complicated dilemmas that might arise if such a reunion doesn't work out."},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"A fun read, well written by an interesting author.

We had read Kalish's research in Lost & Found Lovers and bought several copies for friends. So I thought this new book would be good too. I was all set to like it. But I didn't. It was so disappointing.It's just a few light stories, and some interviews with therapists. What did she have to contribute herself? Her story was fun to read, but that could have been a nice, short magazine article. There's not enough here for a book. I finished it in an hour and a half.DH interviewed Nancy Kalish - she says so in the acknowledgements - and this sure sounds like the kalish book without the research that made that first book worthwhile.I think the people who give it 5 stars just haven't read any other books on this topic and so they don't know the difference. It's a fun topic but it is not a good book."},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"I picked this book up thinking it might be a fun, light read.

I wrote to him just to say a friendly hello, assuming he was happily married like he used to be before he left our home town thirty years ago. I was so surprised when he wrote back to me and said he has been divorced twice, and would love to come back to our home town to see me. I told him I was very busy (it was around the holidays) and I would contact him in a few weeks. He wrote back literally begging me to call him sooner than that so I did and we got together.To make a long story short, we had fun talking about old times, and he said he couldn't wait to see me again, promised he would call the next week and come to visit, sent me e-mail saying to call him anytime, etc.So guess what happens? I leave him a voice mail about getting together and he e-mails me that he doesn't have time for me right now because of business problems and he will try to call soon! So far the call hasn't come, but I'm not sitting around waiting for the phone to ring.It became apparent to me that he has some financial problems, and in addition, he asked me two or three times when we were together if I had money because I was talking about a trip to Vegas! I'm sure if I told him I owned a five million dollar house in Beverly Hills, Ca. he wouldn't have been too busy to call me!My point is it's easy for middle aged women like Donna Hanover, Suzanne Phleshette, etc. to snare an old flame because they are wealthy and not middle class like I am. Even though I am still very attractive (even my old crush told me I was very pretty), it doesn't matter in the real world, the bottom line is most middle aged men are looking for wealthy middle aged women or the young Barbie type for a trophy wife (his second wife fit this category and left him after eight months when he lost his job).Beware before you look up an old flame, you might just get what you ask for, and all the problems that come with him.As for me, he will always occupy a small place in my heart and I told him the last time we spoke that I always wish the best for him, but I'm going to leave high school ghosts buried from now on!"},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"This book is a disappointment.

And I enjoyed a lost love book by Nancy Kalish, so I thought I'd read this one too. But Donna Hanover's book is just a collection of other people's work and ideas, including Kalish's, and the stories are ordinary. So I'm glad I had the opportunity to read the Kalish book first, so I could see the difference.Celebrities shouldn't write books on topics they don't know anything about. I'm married, but that doesn;t qualify me to write books about marriage. Just because Donna got divorced from Rudy and married her lost love doesn''t mean she's become an expert. This book annoyed me."},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"I was initially attracted to this book because I'm a hopeless romantic. I've always considered Donna Hanover a very intelligent and charismatic personality and found the whole idea of her reconnecting with her first love life affirming. I wanted to know more.While this book does address her rekindled romance and subsequent marriage, her purpose in writing this book appears to be a primer for those people who have considered reconnecting and a great read for all of the hopeless romantics out there. While the case studies she presents chronicle the positives and negatives of first love renewed and places them in a sociological framework, the real hook here are the storiesthemselves.For the most part this is a feel good book. It is hopeful and positive and it is a great contrast to the cynacismand negativity is a part of modern life.If you loved When Harry Met Sally, you'll love this book. It abounds with happy (or at least hopeful) endings, and absolutely does not rehash the Rudy Giuliani thing."},{"Title":"My Boyfriend's Back: True Stories of Rediscovering Love with a Long-Lost Sweetheart","review":"Donna Hanover's, My Boyfriend's Back is a remarkable, touching tribute to renewed love.

But it's completely the opposite! It's warm, charming, witty and very well written. A delight from first page to last. I couldn't have been more surprised...or more pleased. I bought a copy for my sister (who likes uplifting, hopeful stories). I'm sure that she will love it, too."},{"Title":"Arouse Suspicion (Berkley Sensation)","review":"This was a good book, though what confounded me was Nick's character. This is an ex-Army Ranger who is totally obtuse in some instances where our herione, Danni, has to fill in the blanks of the mystery. His Army training doesn't seem to be a apart of him until - oh it's that time! - he absolutely needs it in the end. He went into the Army after high school. Those eight years would have shaped him, molded him, into a harder, more intelligent man than presented in this book. Not to give anything away, but Nick apparently was the last surviving member of his team during some secret mission and he feels guilty. Well, if he had the same intelligence level on the field as he had during the investigation, it's no wonder his team died! The writer only hints at what happened, gives you enough information to be interested in this tragic event that shaped Nick's life, but she never finishes it. It's dangling out there without a resolution at the end of the book. The author did wrap up the emotional turmoil involvingI hated that the characters had so many casual relationships in their past (that's a personal thing though, so it really won't affect every reader)."},{"Title":"Arouse Suspicion (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Former Army Ranger turned writer Nick Sirocco meets with private investigator and former cop Danni Hawkins because he believes that that someone murdered her father and cleverly disguised it as a suicide. He says he was close with her dad Paddy who was helping him on a police procedural; Danni is jealous because her father never had time for her when boobs began to appear on her chest as he was to busy helping male teens in trouble. Nick admits he was one.Nick persuades Danni to help him investigate who killed Paddy and why. The police believe Paddy took his own life because the evidence points overwhelmingly in that direction and insist the motive was his inability to accept retirement. As the duo works closely together, they fall in love, but someone believes they know something and not only trash their homes, but tries to kill the pair.AROUSE SUSPICION is an entertaining romantic suspense investigative tale that contains two wonderful protagonists whose conversations are amusing as each unsuccessfully tries to get the other to shut up when they are in their respective milieu. Readers will appreciate the tense story line as the duo struggles with their feelings for one another and for her father, a killer and the attitude of the police who believe case closed. Having Rick as an ex-Ranger makes him to conveniently capable, fans will appreciate the strong yet vulnerable heroine as she and her temporary new partner make inquiries into her father's death and a second so called suicide.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Arouse Suspicion (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Ms. McKade is known for her historical westerns and these are reads that I have gobbled up in the past. She has now taken a shot at the sub genre romantic suspense and she has nailed it!!This story has it all...fast paced suspense, great characters, and great chemstry between Danni(our heroine) and Nick (our YUMMY hero).Danni has just buried her father Paddy. Their relationship has been bad and now they will never have the chance to make things right. She is doing the best she can to get on with life when Nick Sirocco comes in and shakes her foundation by claiming he things her father was murdered rather then having killed himself.Nick was close to Paddy. Paddy helped to turn his life around and he was the father that he never had. He can't believe that he would kill himself and he is going to prove it. Now he just needs a little help so he contacts Danni. Danni is everything he knew she would be. Tough, strong-willed, and beautiful. The promise of beauty as a child came true. Now the two of them are investigating a murder and having to stay close to each other since the killer is now after them. They don't know who to trust. Could the killer be a policeman?This was a very fast paced read. The storyline although not \\"new\\" was done in such a way that it was fresh and kept the reader engaged. The chemistry between Nick and Danni was great. There was a true push and pull that added not only to the growing relationship, but also played a large part with the plot.

Being a compilation of short stories, the truly picky reader might say it does not track well as a whole. While I disagree, it might be due to the fact his editor rushed Bunch when he proofed the gallies. They wanted to get the book out on the market as quickly as possible.The true Bunch fan will appreciate each chapter for the little jewels they truly are! Bunch always hoped he could correct some of the minor mistakes in a second edition. As he is now deceased this probably will not happen. We can always hope, as his \\"literary heir\\" would certainly be amenable. Moderan never got the build up and publicity it should have because it was brought out the first and only time in paperback. A 2nd Edition in hardback would garner a whole new generation of fans for Bunch!On the whole the book hangs together well. It is divided into three basic sections. These are cohesive in themselves. Bunch is not an easy read. You have to work at Bunch...his style, use of language,and content. This will be a book you read more than once. Each time you read it you will notice something different. Bunch makes you think!!!!He was a very under appreciated writer in his time. He was a contempory of Bradbury, Asminov, and Ellison when they were publishing in the little mags. He was the only writer to have two stories in the same issue of \\"Dangerous Visions\\". He also wrote occasionally as Daryle Groupe. Bunch was not without humor.Bunch is just now beginning to be appreciated as one of the greats that he truly was, because so much of what he was writing about fifty years ago has or is coming to pass. Plus he is just an exceptionally good read!!If you enjoy \\"Moderan\\" this author also wrote \\"BUNCH\\" . It is a collection of his later diverse and some darker short stories. He also wrote \\"The Heartacher and the Warehouseman\\". This is a collection of Bunch's poetry over the years. It is a fabulous collection of early poems and poems he wrote for this book. It showcases his evolution as a writer and poet. It is difficult to find this book but well worth the trouble.It had only one printing in 2000 which was the year this great great light went out!(May 29,2000)He is no doubt beaming star frowns down at us for the current \\"bad bad\\" situation we allow in the world! Bunch was nothing if not political and of his times, even as he wrote about the future he envisioned if we did not change course. This is why so many editors and publishers didn't know what to make of Bunch's writing. It was not the Science Fiction of \\"Martians and Monsters\\" as he liked to say. The other greats such as Ellison, Bradbury, Asminov, and many others however, recognized his talent and that he was one of their own."},{"Title":"Moderan","review":"David R. Bunch was a poet and short story writer from Missouri whose work appeared in a variety of literary \\"little\\" magazines, fanzines, and professional science fiction magazines, most frequently _Amazing_ and _Fantastic_. Bunch was always a controversial writer, with many readers protesting his experimental style, his heavy-handed messages, and his pessimism. But he has also had a circle of defenders as well-- most noteably Harlan Ellison, Barry Malzberg, Ted White, and Brian W. Aldiss. They have called attention to the tight construction, individual style of writing, and complexity of his tales._Moderan_ is a collection of 47 loosely connected stories about a future world of steel and plastic, populated by citizens who are gradually replacing their flesh (that is, their humanity) with strips of metal and who engage in an almostconstant state of war. The stories are treated as documents that have been assembled by an unnamed historian in the society that has emerged after the fall of Moderan.The major problem with _Moderan_ is its structure. It consists of three main parts: \\"The Beginings,\\" \\"Everyday Life in Moderan,\\" and \\"Intimations of the End.\\" The first and third sections are the most structurally unified. They are both about Number 10, the warlord of one of the fortresses. The first part chronicles his rise to power. The last part, populated with apocalyptic figures, depicts his growing sense of mortality until Moderan itself is destroyed.The middle section, however, is much more incoherent. There are several stories that are clearly stories about Number 10: \\"To Face Eternity,\\" \\"In the Innermost Room of Authority,\\" \\"The Problem,\\" \\"Sometimes I Get So Happy,\\" and \\"The Flesh-Man from Far Wide.\\" But there are other stories that were apparently not originally written as Moderan stories. \\"A Little Girl's XMas in Moderan\\" was originally entitled \\"A Little Girl's XMas in Modernia.\\" It features an innocent child named Little Sister and is told from the point of view of her cold but human father living in a modernistic bubble house rather than a fortress. The characters in the story have an awareness of holidays such as Christmas and Easter that would be alien to Number 10. One of the Little Sister stories, \\"It was in Black Cat Weather,\\" is set in in an earthen cemetary rather than the solid plastic ground of Moderan.Other Little Sister stories included in this section are: \\"Playmate,\\" \\"A Husband's Share,\\" \\"The Complete Father,\\" and \\"Was She Horrid?\\" It is not just that these stories do not mesh well with the other Moderan stories; they don't go together well with one another. In \\"Black Cat Weather,\\" Little Sister's mother is unearthed from a cemetary. In other stories, both before and after, she is alive. Most of the Little Sister stories describe her as being all flesh, too young to have artificial parts; but in \\"The Complete Father, she is described as having steel hands. Most of the stories depict the father as somewhat more human, more emotional, and more peaceful than Number 10; but in \\"Wasn't She Horrid?\\" the father is portrayed as the ruler of a stronghold, essentially the same as Number 10. In \\"A Little Girl's XMas in Moderan,\\" the father asks the mother if he can visit her on Easter. That visit is described in \\"A Husband's Share,\\" but the story comes _before_ \\"A Little Girl's XMas.\\" The reader may be forgiven a feeling of confusion while reading the middle section.Brian Aldiss argues that less worthy novels have garnered more attention than _Moderan_. And he is quite right. It is an original, imaginative, and literate work. But it could have been better. If Bunch had taken the trouble to rework his original magazine material into a more coherent structure, it would have been dazzling."},{"Title":"Moderan","review":"read a lot of skyfry in my day & most of it is long forgotten, simply did not leave a lasting impression - this little gem, OTOH, is most memorable, indeedread this book & get you some ohjoys!"},{"Title":"Moderan","review":"I found David R.

I got my frayed copy from a garage sale and have replaced it through Amazon so it will last longer. Rev. Dawley is a prominent figure in the Anglican church and Chapters in Church History is the story of the formation of the church from the very beginning all the way through to the founding of the Anglican Church and its offshoots in America. This is like sitting down with a grandfather who is interesting to listen to. He is very comfortable with his subject and makes writing history and making it interesting look easy.He covers a lot of topics I have never seen handled before - the schisms in the early church over the Gnostic beliefs, the schism over apostates, the various councils and how the Creeds got started (like the Nicene Creed),the move of the Catholic church to Avignon, the drowning of the Anabaptists, and the beginnings of other protestant religions like the Wesley's involvement with the Moravians and how his followers came to be called Methodists. He also goes into depth to explain how the Anglican church derives it authority and how that was communicated to the Americas in the Episcopal tradition. It was the first time I understood the concept of the eucharist.Very interesting, very informative, very good buy."},{"Title":"Chapters in church history","review":"\\"Chapters in Church History\\" by Powel Mills Dawley is part of a series called \\"The Church's Teaching.\\" It's an excellent little historical introduction to Anglicanism that's aimed at the educated layperson, and not at the clergy or scholars. Dawley's main concern is to tell the story of Anglicanism against the broad sweep of Christian history, and the book is a very readable history of Anglicanism filled with excellent insights. In fact, it's a testimony to Dawley's skills that he was able to present as much information as he has in such a relatively small space. He has a knack for making church history simple and readable.The structure of the book is a little odd, but understandable. The first two chapters give a general history of the Church until the time of the Reformation, while Chapter 3 discusses Christianity in England in particular. Chapter 4 then covers the crisis of the Reformation, and the book concludes with Chapter 5, concerning Christianity in the modern world. While I understand that Dawley is trying to put Anglicanism into its historical context, I would have preferred that he discuss Anglican history in more detail and offer less information about the development of Christianity in general. Context is certainly necessary to understand Anglicanism, but in a relatively short book dedicated to Anglican history, more time on Anglican history would have been better.Having said this, Dawley manages to say a lot in a short space. While most of the information in \\"Chapters in Church History\\" is well-known to me as a student of Anglicanism, Dawley's book is a good starting point for someone who wants an easy historical introduction to Anglicanism. Even though Dawley is aiming at the layman, I was glad to find that some of his insights put things in a new light, even for someone already familiar with Anglicanism.While the book has limitations due to the nature of its intended audience, its size, and its date (it was published in 1950), \\"Chapters in Church History\\" makes for an enjoyable introduction to Anglican history. More advanced students have many equally excellent works available should they wish to delve deeper into Anglicanism."},{"Title":"Tables of integrals and other mathematical data, (Series of mathematical texts)","review":"If you are a undergraduate or graduate Physics Major, this is a must-own.

The integral tables are extensive and quite helpful; I agree that this is a must-have for physics majors. It's a pity this book is no longer in print, but it is still worth taking the trouble to buy a used copy.FYI, my professor recommended both theCRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulaeand Dwight's Tables of Integrals, but said that if we only bought one or the other then the CRC would be preferable.[UPDATE] Fast forward another four years or so, and I am still finding this little book extremely useful. It has most of the \\"main\\" integrals, and by that I mean the ones that don't evaluate to special functions like the Error Function or the Exponential Integral. Yes, you will need to know how to use u-substitution and exponential and trig identities to get the integral into a form that's in the book. But even the latest edition (7th) of the massive Table of Integrals, Series, and Products by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik requires you to do this, and then you must search through over 1000 pages of integrals to find the form that you need. There was only one time I faced an integral that could only be found in that thing; for most of the rest I was able to use the pocket-sized book by Dwight.If this book were still in print, I would not hesitate to recommend it. As it stands, it looks like prices for this book are about twice that of the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae. Dwight's has the benefit of being a smaller size and easier to stuff in the backpack every day, but there really aren't any integrals in there that the CRC doesn't have.

One of the priests had a nice motor boat and if you were there at the right time they would give you a ride in it. The boat probably belonged to the camp; but it looked like it was his.In fact, I became a priest, and remain so to this day. Since I was the youngest my brothers would not let me go on the roofs to get pigons which were fed to our hawks, nor on apple raids because some farmer had a shotgun filled with rock salt.

She keeps us in the mood for more, and even though her book, Safe Pasture, is fully resolved by the last page, we could happily contemplate a sequel.Safe Pasture is about Susanna Parker, a widow struggling to raise a son and grappling with issues that confront all single women - employment, relationships, deeper meaning on the spiritual journey. It's clear that the author is a religious seeker -God plays an essential role in her book. In the course of this well constructed novel, the heroine is converted to a significantly serious kind of Christianity that won't let her relax, even when she is angry at the Creator, even when she'd like to stray from the path.In fact, the man in her life, Zeke, has to compete with the Lord, and that doesn't come easy to someone not used to being subjected to the whims and dictates of another, even the Almighty. But Susanna's inner strength, and her grasp on the true meaning of prayer, win him over.In between there is a fascinating and carefully crafted story, with admirable and often humorous good guys and some nasty villains. There is Zeke's little girl, who refuses to speak, and Rusty, the fatherless boy whose disappearance becomes the focal point for Zeke's conversion. In the background there's Mark, darkly handsome and seductive, whose treachery and callous machismo are a counterpoint to Zeke's gentle, artistic and honorable male power, power that ultimately sways Susanna and gives her reason to believe that her loneliness is at an end.Set on a cattle ranch in Wyoming, where Susanna learns to appreciate the quiet of a sunset and to respect the hard work of the ranch hands for whom she cooks and cleans, this novel has a wide lens, focusing out on the life of a cowhand in rich detail, and in on the personal fears and foibles of a youthful widow whose sorrows threaten to keep her from seeing the love that's there for the taking. One can believe that the author has had experience with much of the subject matter, herself a Texan and mother of two boys.Gilbert's book will be an attractive offering for Christian women who can deal with classic romance and heart-felt religion mixed in the same well plotted tale. Susanna and Zeke are credible three dimensional people and Susanna's love of God is more than just a device - it's central to the story."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"This book is one that a person wouldn't mind their very young teenage daughter to read.

She uses natural, flowing, complex sentence structures that pulled me along in the story, yet made me want to stop, re-read and relish a turn of phrase. Her writing is full of lush yet efficient description that manages not to get in the way of the story. I enjoyed wandering along through paragraphs with plenty of rich details but no unneeded snags to trip me or distract me from the plot. It's good literature and a good story in a perfect fit.

It is a clean, lovely story about a young woman with a child striving to do the right thing in the eyes of the Lord."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Susanna Parker, the main character of our story, is a young widowed mother. At the onset of the story Susanna is fired from her job and decides to take up her Aunt Ora's invitation and visit with her for a while in Wyoming. Her son Rusty is overjoyed and can't wait to begin the adventure, but Susanna is only looking forward to some quiet relaxing time.Aunt Ora is a believing woman, setting her hopes on the Lord for her everyday existence. Susanna loves and respects her aunt but does not share the devotion and commitment to the Lord that she does. However that would soon change. And you know, without being told, that Aunt Ora was inspired by a higher force to invite her niece to spend time with her. Realizing this, you are aware that God has a plan for this young woman's life and you await to see it unfold before you.On Aunt Ora's insistence Susanna and her son accompany her to church where Susanna meets and is befriended by Beth O'Connor. She also meets Mark, a man she finds quite appealing despite Aunt Ora's disapproval of him, and is one of our colorful sinister characters in this work. The author did a good job using this character to show how the enemy sends counterfeits along our path to sway us from God's ultimate purpose. But the Lord is at work in Susanna's life and things are about to change as he turns her to him.Her conversion takes place when her son is missing and Susanna promises the Lord that she will change if he is returned safely to her.We are introduced to Zeke McCall, a rancher that is in need of a cook. Aunt Ora thinks this would be the perfect opportunity for Susanna to pick up some extra funds and for Rusty to enjoy ranch life for a while. Susanna is not so sure but agrees to at least meet the man and discuss the possibilities. Their meeting does not go well and instead of making Susanna pick up and leave she decides to prove to this man that she can indeed take on the responsibility of cooking for the likes of him and his men.Zeke is a widower with a young daughter named Laura who has not spoken since the tragic death of her mother in a car accident.This is where the true meat of the story begins as the author introduces you to colorful ranch hands that challenge Susanna to battle for her acceptance as one of them; you will smile at their playful antics towards Susanna, but you will alsocringe as the author has woven in some very distasteful characters that almost destroy Susanna's life. Good mix.The author takes you on a journey in this read of this woman Susanna, this man Zeke, both struggling with their inner hurts and fears. Both feeling the force that is drawing them together and both battling against the tide. Susanna's faith is growing and Zeke has not yet accepted the Lord, this is not acceptable to Susanna who could never have a relationship with a man who does not have the Lord in his life.The story takes you through many trauma's, from a near rape of Susanna, the near loss of the ranch for Zeke, to the desperate search for the children during a blinding blizzard, which leads to Zeke's acceptance of the Lord. The author shows through each and everyone of these the saving grace of God.Safe Pasture is a work that takes the lives of two people and shows how God is able to intervene to bring them to the place he wants them to be. It is a work that is filled with raw emotions, tender love, nail biting suspense and deep inward faith all interwoven in a great storyline. One that will keep you reading, and will encourage you in your walk as you see how the steadfastness of one believer can indeed move mountains and change lives forever.Very highly recommended.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Sue is a widow and single mother.

And, thus, God leads a woman who doesn't really know Him into a &quot;cowboy&quot; adventure that she'll never forget.-RELIGIOUS CONTENT: The path that God uses to lead Sue to Him is as wonderful and varied as the means that He sometimes uses to bring real people to Him.Sue's aunt, Ora, is a devout Christian who thanks God for everything. The widowed wife of a preacher, she has taught the children who live in her neighborhood how to pray and feels like a grandmother to them. She cares for them all very deeply. She is there for a neighborhood boy whose mother is rarely home. In this way, a distinction is drawn between a loving, supportive family and a neglectful one.After accepting Christ, Sue refuses to marry an otherwise good man, because he isn't a Christian.-ADULT LANGUAGE/CONTENT: Sue runs a red light to get to work on time. The word &quot;hell&quot; is used as a swear word. Urinating is referred to as &quot;a leak,&quot; prompting Sue's son, Rusty, to ask her what the speaker meant.It is noted that one girl has moved to Texas to be with a man that she has just met and has been divorced four times. This is not glamorized, however.Sue and one romantic interest kiss passionately. She pushes him away when she realizes that he wants more.Some characters drink alcohol, but drunkenness is vilified.-VIOLENT CONTENT: Sue is nearly raped. This is shown to be the horrible experience that it is. A fight breaks out between the attempted rapist and the man who saves her.-CONCLUSION: Safe Pastures is one of those books that makes me wonder why I like it. I'm normally a Science Fiction/Fantasy/Action/Adventure type of reader. A western romance really doesn't fit into my normal reading preferences. But I just couldn't put this book down. I grew to care for Sue as a person and was overjoyed by the ending of the book. You will be, too. That's not to say that this is a children's . . . Or even a teen's . . . book. This is a well-crafted story that adults, however, will treasure."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Love the story! Ms. Gilbert's writing drew me into her character's world. As I read the last page, the last paragraph - I realized my journey with the characters I had come to know and love would no longer be part of my daily experience. It's my hope Ms. Gilbert continues to write - I enjoy her style and the characters she creates!"},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Donna Chapman Gilbert's \\"Safe Pasture\\" is a so real you can feel it. This book will renew your faith in the power of prayer. Susanna Parker goes through so much in a short period of time. It begins in Dallas and takes us to a rural community in Wyoming. Safe Pasture reconnects you with the impossibilities of life. Susanna is dealing with raising her son after the loss of her husband. Susanna also has to deal with independence, becoming vocal regarding workplace issues and a unique workplace romance. Susanna is wrestling with taking a leap of faith and doesn't know how much of a blessing her God-fearing Aunt Ora will be to her life. Thank God for the gentle and attentive spirit of Aunt Ora, she knows exactly what Susanna needs. We should listen to those praying people in our lives more often. Susanna reaches within herself to give to others. My heart went out to Susanna as she connects with George, the quiet child that needs to know that someone cares. Sometimes we are so focused on our own problems that we do not realize that others are also hurting. This book pulls at the heart strings and reminds me of Anne Tyler's work. This is a great title for a female book club. A must read!"},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Mrs. Gilbert weaves a beautiful tale about a how young, city-wise, widowed mother's search for hope leads her to the last place she ever expected to find herself: cooking for a team of swarthy ranch hands on a failing cattle ranch in Wyoming. The pastoral imagery is stunning and vivid. The family scenes will make you laugh and cry and feel emotions you've long forgotten. This book will transport you to a place so foreign, yet so familiar.. a place you've longed to be your whole life. No matter what age you are or what your background is, YOU. WILL. LOVE. THIS. BOOK."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Ms. Gilbert creates a believable world and crafts a lovely story. She takes us from urban streets to majestic mountain vistas. A beautiful story of faith and redemption. I can highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"Rarely do you come across a book so well-written that the characters become your friends. While I read, I laughed, I cried, I held my breath and signed in relief as the characters vividly faced life's challenges."},{"Title":"Safe Pasture","review":"This book grabbed me right from the start. I felt like I knew the characters. Ms. Gilbert paints a picture with her words in such a way that, even having never been to Wyoming, I felt as though I had. This book took me on a journey that made me feel good. It brought up spirituality in ways that made me pause and consider my own faith and what role it played in my life. I highly recommend this book and I can't wait to read her next one!"},{"Title":"Handling the Big Jets: An Explanation of the Significant Difference in Flying Qualities Between Jet Transport Aeroplanes and Piston Engined Transpor","review":"Despite its age, this is still the definitive book on handling jets. Comprehensive coverage of the widest range of topics, and to the deepest depth needed to satisfy any technical enquiry. Davies has an unmatched writing style that is highly readable, and right up there with the likes of Bill Gunston. If you prefer reading fiction more than textbooks, then this book is just about as readable as fiction.Excellent sections on landing and takeoff. Davies makes full use of his background as Chief Test Pilot of what was then the UK Airworthiness Authority. He puts all the topics into the context of proper engineering and aviation fact, shows how the rules evolved from there, and generally gives you complete confidence that you've mastered the full range of the subject. PPRUNE Tech Log has always got one or two side references to this book.Chase it up hard - it's still around - and keep it at the front of the bookshelf.

Not in a great way though, you could easily read through this book without really grasping what the IS-LM curves actually do for example, but if you realize when they are doing a poor job of explaining, just read again or read up elsewhere.Also, if you have done Microeconomics, too much of this book is pure repetition. Too much of this book pretends a large part of the overlap between macro- and microeconomics is purely macroeconomics, so it explains it all. I guess that is a symptom of a sketchy subjectarea, Microeconomics is a far better defined area of study, Macro seems to be Micro, Finance and a lot of guesswork in the middle. An exaggeration for sure, and it COULD be through errors of this book that I got this impression, but I don't think so.Maybe the worst thing though, is that they have done a spectacular job of managing to get just about every box (Sort of minicases the embellishes the text) and figures/tables on a different page than where it is referenced. This means you constantly have to flip the page as you read through the reasoning and at the same time try to follow it in the figures. It may sound trivial, but after a while I can assure you it is not. Mabe they should have printed this book in a larger format, getting some ideas from american textbooks where they usually allow for a little more space in order to match figures and text, instead of trying to save on papercost."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics: A European Text","review":"This book, intermediate in level, is a great textbook for european students or students interested in European economics.

Its great for any age kids or adults."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"This book is the best! I'd say that it is. L. Frank Baum is an absolutely terrific writer. I've read this book so many times (I don't know the number) and I still like it. It's just too good to read just once. I recommend it highly! Anyway, it's about a girl named Dorothy from the great Kansas prairies. One afternoon (or earlier than that), her house (with her inside it) is blown to the Land of Oz by a sudden cyclone. There, she finds strange people and surroundings. Strangely, all the people think she is a sorceress. She also meets the Witch of the North, who tells her to go to the Emerald City in the center of the city to ask Oz, the terrible wizard, to help her get back to Kansas (which is what she wants than to stay in Oz). She listens, and goes off on the Yellow Brick Road that leads to the Emerald City. What else happens? Find out by reading the book!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I think that the book, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, is one of the greatest books ever written. I found that the book and the movie that we've all seen are very different. The book tells of many more events that were never added into the movie, possibly due to the violence that occurs in the book. One of the violent acts was when the tin man chopped off the mountain lions head. You don't usually see that kind of violence in Shirley. Another event happened when forty or so wolves were killed. I think that if the movie were to be made exactly how the book was wrote that it would be an interesting movie. The Wizard of Oz was a very exciting book to read because I've seen the movie a million times growing up and it kept me in suspense the whole time. The book was always telling about things that I did'nt expect to happen. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age to read because I think that it's a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"Baum's 14-book Oz series is classic American fiction. The tales can enchant and allure audiences of all ages, and his storytelling is lighthearted and thoroughly enjoyable. I grew up with the Oz books, and even now, at over 20 years old, despite the considerably more complex novels I now read, I can still pick up any one of the Oz books and find myself swept away with Dorothy and her companions. A world of magic, witches, beauty, and aspirations that the child in all of us can strive to achieve.

Frank Baum's classic novel as a simple children's story, but it has a deeper significance. Baum lived in the Great Plains of the American West during the Populist uprising of the 1890s, and the characters and events of the Wizard of Oz are based upon what he observed. For example, Dorothy represents the innocent midwesterner who must contend with the wild nature of the West (the Wicked Witch of the West) and the deceptive idea that all solutions can be found with money (following the path of gold, or the Yellow Brick Road). The Scarecrow represents American farmers, the Tin Woodsman represents American workers (his transformation from human to tin man represents industrial accidents), and the Cowardly Lion represents Populist presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan (a great orator but a pacifist, hence the cowardly lion). Following the path of gold leads Dorothy and her companions to the Emerald City, which represents Washington, DC, and the corrupt influence that money has on the city. The Wizard is the President of the U.S.--a weak and powerless humbug who nevertheless manages to convince the inocent Dorothy that it is he and not the moneyed special interests that control the land. Anyway, there is much more, but in the end Dorothy conquers nature (the Witch of the West), and with the help of the Silver Slippers (the Populist Party's Free Silver issue), finally finds her way home to truth and happiness. A wonderful book when read in the proper context."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I believe one of the reviews earlier said it best when its writer explained the true context of the entire novel. The novel was not really meant to be a fairy tale for young children, instead it was a Populist book on the issue of bimetalism and argrarian discontent with Industrial Tycoons and Robber Barons. The movie really did a horrible job with this book, changing the &quot;silver slippers&quot; into ruby slippers to show off the impressive Technicolor. The book however is a classic, for its subtle references to politcal issues and the immagination of the mind. The oddity of the book; however, lies in the fact that Baum portrays the Farmer (the scarecrow), the eastern laborers (the tin man) and Bryan (the Lion) as characters who really had what they needed all along, slashing the idea that agrarians really had something to complain about."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"See the item photo to the right?

The play \\"Wicked\\" whets one's appetite for the original story, and this little classic is well done...Quick and easy to read, good type face and good leading between the lines (something we didn't worry about in our youth). There may be other, better illustrated editions, but this one gets the job done and gets it done very nicely if you want to re-read or remember something we should remember from our youth--the book, not the movie!! Suggest reading it after seeing \\"Wicked\\"...That allows more creative license in the play, thus more enjoyment and capitivation with that story rather than continually comparing it to the original Oz.\\"I'm a good man, just a bad wizard...\\" What a line!!!

It helps to free your imagination, and experience adventures beyond your boring humdrum life. I would say that the book is not like the movie from many aspects. It has more adventures and yes a little more gore. But you can't expect it to be like the movie because it was writtem first and the movie producers decided to make The Wizard Of Oz a sort of Happy Go Lucky musical.

Safely surrounded by the deadly desert, and overseen by Glinda the Good. This is not an insipid story for seven year olds, not an interaction of a child with adultoids, nor is it the call of the populist party for free silver. It is the gate to another place, the first ticket to a land that I have spent many hours gladly wandering in. To read the wizard without going on to Glinda, and tik tok, and the wogglebug, is to deprive yourself, and your children of a path, not unlike the path through the wardrobe into Narnia. Baum didn't set out to write &quot;Alice&quot;. He wrote an American fairy tale. And Ruth Plumley Thompson continued it, leaving us with a rich set of figures which reach out of our own national heritage and which have, as all great liturature does, reached back and thus formed us. Escape liturature of the highest caliber."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I have read and watched the Wizard of Oz a bunch of times. A classic for sure. However, I have not read it quite like Mr. Baum wrote it. What I mean is in this book, the shoes that Dorothy gains from eliminating the Wicked Witch of the East are \\"silver\\". Yes, you heard me the original shoes were silver and not \\"ruby\\".So, I checked it out to see why the change and the reason is:In the original 1900 book edition of 'The Wizard of Oz', the slippers of the Wicked Witch of the East were silver in color. But in the beloved 1939 film version, they were ruby red. According to those involved in the making of the film, a silver color washed out in comparison to the beautiful, riotously rich colors of the dream sequences in the enchanted, magical land of Oz. In the search for a more photogenic alternative. ruby red came out the winner.What I liked about reading the original story as the author wrote it is that he really went into detail about the characters and the land and story. Like who the Tin Man really was prior to becoming the Tin Man. He was a man who had fallen in love. A witch put a curse on his axe and every time that he would go out to chop wood, he chopped off a limp until he was nothing more then a Tin Man.The illustrations that Mr. Sieben did were great. They were quirky but colorful and really portrayed the characters and the story nicely. So whether you are a fan or just want to read this book again, you need to pick up 2 copies. One to keep as a treasure on your bookshelf and another to read."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The true American fairy tale!

I do not want to mention any of the differences because that is where the fun lays in reading the original version.

They will lead your child into a world of magic, discovery and all-around good morals! I recommend the entire series of books to anyone with an imaginative or even not so imaginative child! :)"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"Like many, perhaps most, adults, I had only been familiar with L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz from the classic 1939 movie. It was therefore an interesting exercise to read the original version of Dorothy's story--the first book, published in 1899, of what came to be a very lengthy series--and compare it with the film version. There are some substantial differences between the two. In the film version, Dorothy's journey to Oz is an unreal episode, an elaborate dream experienced after being hit on the head. Her dream world and her real life, meanwhile, were symmetrical insofar as some of the principal characters from Kansas were translated into characters in Oz. There is no such symmetry in Baum's version. The witch-like Miss Gulch and humbuggy Professor Marvel, the farm hands Hickory, Huck, and Zeke do not appear in the book. Further, Dorothy's house really is transported to Oz in the cyclone, and when she returns to Kansas Dorothy does so bodily: that is, she travels from Oz and does not merely wake from a dream. Smaller differences between the book and film versions are numerous.On the whole, I think that the movie tells a tighter, more interesting story than does the book. The Wicked Witch of the West--whose demise in the book is strangely anticlimactic--plays a much bigger role in the film. This holds the story together nicely just as does the symmetry between Dorothy's real and unreal worlds. The movie also omits a good many of the less interesting episodes included in the book, such as Dorothy's adventures among the Dainty China people. What the book has to offer, in turn, is more on the characters' back stories, in particular those of the Tin Woodman and, of all creatures, the Flying Monkeys--much maligned, misunderstood beasts that they are. Who would have guessed their sad plight from the Monkeys' nightmare-inducing depiction in the movie?While some of Baum's book could have been excised without losing anything, and though the movie tells an arguably better story, Baum's writing is pleasant and his characters well-developed and interesting. It's not surprising that the book has inspired so much affection over the years.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a well-made children's literature and very American fairy tale.Oz's answer to Dorothy and her companion is quite a right one.To win \\"hearts\\", \\"brains\\" and \\"courage\\" and \\"returning to home\\" they should make efforts and do something worthwhile. Unlike European fairy tales use of magic power is quite restrained or limited. Even Dorothy wearing her magic boots and hat, the writer made her unaware of the effect. Power, strength or ability you need to make a living is not something automatically confered upon from the witch nor wizard. Through a number of adventures they eventually earn rights to claim what they desire.The storyline and the moral of the story quite fit the founding principles of America and presented to the child in such a charming manner. The movie in 1939 based on this story is also impressive and can be recommendable."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The well written, enduring children's tale of OZ deserves a place in our cultural history.The oft told tale of OZ is known to all of us... mostly through the 1939 Technicolor film masterpiece. Dorthy like Christian in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS travels through space and time on a trip of revelation. Perhaps Oz' odyssey is a continuation of the trip in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS long before Baum.The two tales diverge towards radically different destinations relevant to both secular and Christian readers. The 1939 movie differs from the book for reasons of brevity and perhaps fear: The porcelain church broken by the Lion and deemed unimportant by Dorthy does not appear in the movie. Indeed the porcelain society with its frailty and weakness is excluded perhaps for brevity...too abstract.The Wizard is a projection in the movie, but a series of hallucinations specific to the fears of each character in the book. Baum's OZ is a bogus God. The green hue of the Emerald City is a figment of Dorthy's imagination created by green eyeglasses in the book but a real city in the movie. Is capitalism and prosperity merely an illusion created by paper wealth? This book had populist roots as well.The heaven of PILGRIM'S PROGRESS becomes the humble Kansas earth of Dorthy's childhood...Dorthy's destination.OZ is a circular land which has at its centre the Emerald City surrounded by desert. Jerusalem of yore was often portrayed as the centre of a circular world surrounded by a desert. The Emerald City becomes a bogus Jerusalem, colored by shaded eyeglasses,in a tale which many have identified as an occult PILGRIM'S PROGRESS loaded with dark symbolism.It is likely that the screenwriters of 1939 saw the corrosive anti-God symbolism of Baum's book and wisely took heed to erase it. The real question readers should ask is why this tale was written at all. L. Frank Baum was an ardent racist who advocated,in two editorials, the genocide of Native Americans. Baum's descendants later apologized on National Public Radio for the thoughts of Baum.Shortly after Baum's outbursts, the massacre at Wounded Knee occurred. The army murdered native american children at Wounded Knee and honestly documented the horrible act. The dark question posed by this book is why a mind which so callously disregarded the lives of minority children would want to speak to other children in a fantasy?It is as if a NAZI war criminal would find it necessary to write children's books after the War. Should you honor Baum's thoughts by buying this book? Judged in the context of history this book should be avoided by secular as well as Christian parents.Baum's book is worthy of historical and psychological analysis but belongs in the libraries of academics. THE WIZARD OF OZ does not belong in your child's library. Sorry for the negatvity... but while I recognize the value of this book I can not give credibility to the author.Ephesians 5:11... And having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reproving them."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I love the Wizard of Oz books....

That happened to Auntie Em because she was a pretty, young wife but the sun and wind took the sparkle from her eyes and the red from her cheeks. When Dorothy came to live with Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, the only thing that kept her from turning somber was her dog Toto. Toto gave her laughter.When a cyclone came, Dorothy was in the house with Toto and got whisked away. She fell onto her bed and fell asleep. When the house landed with a thump, Dorothy awoke. She opened the door to a beautiful and colorful land. There were Munchkins, the little natives, and the good Witch of the North. They told her that her house had fallen onto the Wicked Witch of the East and killed her.Because Dorothy wanted to get back to Kansas, she asked if they knew how she could get back. The good Witch of the North told her to go see the Great Wizard of Oz. To get to Oz, you follow the Yellow Brick Path. First the good Witch gave Dorothy a Kiss that protected her from Evil and Dorothy took the Silver Shoes that the Wicked Witch of the East left behind.On her journey, Dorothy met the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wanted a brain because his head was stuffed with straw. The Tin Man wanted a heart because he was in love with a Munchkin girl and she could marry him as soon as he had wood for a house. But the old woman she lived with traded two sheep to the Wicked Witch of the East to prevent the marriage. The Wicked Witch enchanted the ax, so each time he cut, the ax would chop through his body and each time the Tin Man went to a tinsmith that would repair his body... until he was all tin and didn't have a heart. The Cowardly Lion was supposed to be King of the Forest, but was a coward. The Cowardly Lion needed courage to be the true King. So all of them continued on the journey to Oz.When the group arrived at Oz, the gatekeeper let them in because the Kiss of the good Witch and the Silver Shoes. Then they put on some green spectacles to protect their eyes from the brightness. Each one saw the great Oz, but each saw him differently. Each time he told one to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West.So Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion set off to find the Witch. As soon as they stepped onto her land, the Wicked Witch sent wolves, crows, bees, and Winged Monkeys after them. Do you think Dorothy destroyed the Witch? You should read The Wizard of Oz to find out. It was a well-written book that was intriguing and had fun characters."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I was a reasonably big fan of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" when I was a kid. I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the \\"Return to Oz\\" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a \\"cyclone\\", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, \\"Tin Woodsman\\" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?It's rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\".All in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there's amazon!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The movie based on this book has so eclipsed the novel in the mind of the general public that it's difficult to review the book on its own.The book isn't a musical, obviously, and it has spectacles and scenes which could never have been brought to the screen at the time it was published. Also, the land of Oz has more of a culture and political atmosphere than the film makes note of.That being said, this book is a wild ride through the imagination of Frank L. Baum, with elements from our world transformed in bizarre ways that could never have been anticipated. The entire idea of a talking scarecrow is brilliantly imaginative, if you think about it, as is the cowardly talking lion, the winged monkeys, and the magical field of flowers which puts the adventurers to sleep.Oz is a wonderland unlike any other, and children will delight in the magical surprises that lurk around every bend in the yellow brick road. The special magic of this extensive series is that despite the magic suffusing every nook and cranny of Oz, there are familiar objects and creature from our world that keep us grounded.However, the older you are, the less you will enjoy this book, because it has some pretty serious flaws by modern standards.The language has become quite dated, and the goody-goody dialogue can be jarring to someone who has grown used to a more modern approach. If this book were released today, I don't believe it would ever enjoy the type of success that it did then.Luckily, this book is written for the children, who can generally forgive the fact that characters talk a little strangely (as long as it's consistent, which it is), and the sometimes clunky plot turns.For a child, the focus will be on the King of Mice, or the terrible Kalidah, just two of the magical creatures that escaped the screenplay for the movie. Baum's flights of fancy are so eccentric that children will be fascinated by the wonders they encounter."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"This is a wonderful book by the famous author, L.

This version, by far, is the best. The reader actually travels to the Emerald City and beyond as its author L. Frank Baum intended. Mr. Baum put up the money himself to publish the first edition of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; because no established company would touch a &quot;modern&quot; American fairy tale. As a result, few books were actually produced, but rarely has an author had such control over his finished product. Here's your chance to own a reproduced copy of his original vision!

America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true &quot;fairy tales&quot; than Europe. And though Americans could enjoy the old stories, simple and universal as they are, we needed new ones with the distinctive qualities of our land. &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, American tall tales, and the comic book creations of the 1950s and 60s are what we have produced to fill the gap. When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S. Lewis built a cousin-world to Oz with much more imagination and style in his far better Narnia books.

Somebody must have forgotten to tell that to Frank L. Baum! With The Wizard of Oz, Baum single-handedly challenges the greatest works of British fantasy without blinking.At first glance, one can see the influence of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland, on The Wizard of Oz. But what separates The Wizard of Oz from all other fairy tales before this time, is that this fairy tale is uniquely American both in mood and setting. The characters in The Wizard of Oz are as enchanting as anything the Grimms wrote about. There's Dorothy, Toto the dog, The Scarecrow who wants a brain, the Tin Man without a heart, The Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, and of course, The Mighty Wizard of Oz who rules Emerald City.When the story begins, a fierce cyclone descends on Dorothy's house in rural Kansas and transports her to the magical Land of Oz. No sooner than she arrives in Oz, Dorothy discovers that her house has fallen on and killed The Wicked Witch of the East. By so doing, Dorothy has freed the people of Oz from the tyranny of one of two evil witches. Even so, Dorothy wants to return to Kansas and is instructed by The Good Witch of the North that only the Wonderful Wizard of Oz can send her home. Thus, Dorothy embarks on the Yellow Brick road to seek the wizard and along the way encounters many strange and wonderful creatures. Little does she know that her quest is ill-fated, for an unexpected surprise awaits her at journey's end.What truly distinguishes The Wizard of Oz from preexisting fairy tales, is that Baum intentionally sought to create a contemporary American fairy tale that discarded all of the terrifying and gruesome aspects of the fairy tales of European tradition. Baum succeeded beyond his wildest imaginations and created an unforgettable classic that went on to spawn a number of popular sequels.Anyone who loves traditional fairy tales and hasn't yet read this book should grab themselves a copy of The Wizard of Oz. A wonderful tale of enchantment and excitement awaits. All you have to do is to follow Dorothy on her magical adventure and travel the Yellow Brick Road!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The Oz books were a huge part of my childhood. I never really got into other series that other kids my age liked: Hardy Boys, Box Car Children, Encyclopedia Brown. For some reason, I always preferred the more fantastic stories, which probably heavily influenced my later choices in fantasy and science fiction.My wife never read the Oz books, and so I talked her into reading them with me. We have no children, but we both still enjoy children's books, and have a collection that we look forward to one day sharing with our children. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" tops that list, for both of us now, with a few caveats.It is obvious on reading the books that they are from a different world and a different time. I'm not talking about some fictional land somewhere over the rainbow; I'm talking about a time when children were not supposed to be protected from any nastiness or unpleasantness. Anyone who has read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales knows what I'm talking about: beheadings, wars, violence, betrayal, abuse, etc. Some of these are found without apology in the land of Oz, which may shock people whose only other introduction to the world was through Judy Garland. The Tin Woodman is constantly chopping the head off of something, (to protect Dorothy, of course), not to mention the Scarecrow breaking the necks several dozen nefarious crows. Many other differences from the musical are discovered when reading the books: The Cowardly Lion isn't really cowardly, the Tin Woodman has always had a heart, and the Scarecrow is without a doubt the cleverest one in the bunch. I've never understood why the movie ignored these facts, or why the MGM's wizard didn't do as the great Oz in the books, and just give the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion exactly what they asked for: brains, a heart, and courage. This is to say nothing of the annoying fact the \\"Good Witch\\" in the movie knew the whole entire time Dorothy could have gone home whenever she wanted.People who feel children should be protected and shielded at all cost to the \\"uglier\\" side of make-believe would do well to stay away from Oz. But individuals who feel a little fantasy, a little humour, and a small pinch of moral make for a fun story enjoyable by kids of all ages should enjoy Oz."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a story about a girl named Dorothy.

The next-door neighbor hates Toto because he gets in her crops and chases her ugly cat.

Dorothy also goes places that are completely unknown to her. Toto is black and very small. She spends most of the time with Toto because she doesn't have any friends in Kansas.I relate to Dorothy because she's very outgoing and is always in mischief just like me.

I have personal attatchments with it because I played the wicked witch of the west in a school production of the musical and I am very partial to the her character. The witch in the book is no where near as interesting as the movie. However, I love some of the extra twists in the book that the movie doesn't include. Such as: the green tinted specticals that Dorothy and her friends have to put on in entering Oz, the queen of the mice, the winged monkeys' story, and Dorothy's experiances in the witch's castle. I also think that this book has its limitations. The charqacters are mostly rather shallow and the writing is simple, in the way that most books for young children are. Instead the authers spends his time writing histories for most of the characters, even the winged monkeys, and adding creative twists. Did you know that the ruby slippers were really silver?I would say that this is definately a children's book but that if you're a big fan of the movie, it's worth reading.

At the height of the anniversary comes this lively audio book.I feel that this 'radio theatre' adaptation did the book justice. Monterey Soundworks did a great job of transfering Baum's fantasy world to an audio book, giving listeners a new interpretation to the story, yet retaining some of MGM's inescapable influence.The cast is wonderful, bringing new life to the characters, though the Cowardly Lion and Wicked Witch characterizations sound similar to the MGM Bert Lahr and Margaret Hamilton interpretations. In a world where the Judy Garland movie overshadows the original book, it is virtually impossible to not think of at least some of the MGM characters while listening to this adaptation.The adaptation also includes many adventures in the book that are not found in the MGM film, such as the journey through the Dainty China Country, the Hammerheads, the Field Mice, etc. Other differences are that the color of Munchkin clothing is blue, an indication of that country's favorite color. The Wicked Witch of the West is melted not by setting the Scarecrow on fire, but after tripping Dorothy to get the silver shoes and making Dorothy angry (the 'Ruby Slippers' are an MGM creation). Glinda has a british accent, as does the witch of the North.Listening made me realize just how much more to the original 'Wonderful Wizard' book there is, and that MGM cut out a huge chunk of adventures that kids can now enjoy listening to here.I recommend this audio adaptation to any teacher, parent, or child who enjoys reading (or hearing) the magic of Baum's tale. It will transport you 'Over that Rainbow' to the world as Baum originally wrote it."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"It took me 29 years to finally make it to Oz, and I can't wait to go back again!Of course, I'd seen the movie many times.

If you're getting through life only seeing the movie and singing the songs, pick up the book sometime!I want to live in Oz!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I have to admit, until this year I didn't care much for the Wizard of Oz. It was my wife's favorite movie (and she even has checks with Oz scenes on them), but it never was \\"fantasy\\" enough for me. I had been an avid modern fantasy/sci-fi reader until this year when I started reading classics like the Hobbit, the Chronicles of Narnia, and ultimately I picked up the Wizard of Oz.This book is a wonderful read and I fully intend to finish the entire series. There is something so pure and simple about Baum's tale that I find myself entranced and wanting more. This book enchanted me, and immersed me in a world I wished I could visit. I love feeling amazed when I read a book, and this book amazed me.The only thing I didn't care for in this edition is the time spent by Eloise McGraw in the forward addressing the writing style and prose of Baum. For those of you concerned that this is not the Grapes of Wrath, well...is isn't. It also is everything I need in 2006 and the world is heavy with war and hatred: a fantasy tale that takes me away from my troubles and sets me sailing into Oz. I am very glad this isn't classic literature...very glad. I hope you understand that statement as a comment of praise for Baum."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"In this classic, Baum describes the tale of poor Dorothy, who is hurled by a cyclone away from her uncle and aunt in Kansas into a strange and magical world of wizards and witches. Fortunately Dorothy has the help of several companions that she meets in this new world - a stuffed scarecrow who wants brains, a tin woodsman who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who wants courage. Together with Dorothy - who wants a return trip to Kansas - they travel to the emerald city where Oz is wizard, to ask him to make their wishes come true. Their journey is fraught with adventures, and when they finally meet Oz they discover a terrible truth, that leads them into even more challenges and adventures. The magical fantasy of this tale has pleased readers of all ages for a century, and it's not hard to see why. Baum spins a wonderfully enchanting tale that includes wicked witches, flying monkeys, talking mice, and other fantastic creatures.Is this book more than just a fantasy thrill? Some literary critics have proposed that Baum - a strong believer in individualism and self-confidence - is working with themes about self-esteem and self-reliance. This is quite plausible, especially considering that the brains, heart and courage sought by the scarecrow, woodsman and lion are abilities that they clearly already possess - they just need to recognize them and use them. And Dorothy herself discovers that when the wizard can't help her, she must and can rely on herself. Other literary critics have claimed that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; needs to be read as an elaborate political allegory where the various characters represent various social classes and financial structures - a not impossible suggestion, but one that's somewhat difficult to defend. Ultimately, however, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is best enjoyed as a wonderful story. That doesn't mean it is any less of a contribution to English literature, because when appreciated as a brilliant story, you're sure to come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren. It's precisely this universal appeal that makes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; a true classic."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"It is unfortunate that most people know The Wizard of Oz only by the movie. To be perfectly honest, I found the movie bland compared to the book. For those who have read the book, many don't know that there was thirteen other Oz books written by L. Frank Baum. People who have read the first fourteen probably don't know that five other authors wrote more Oz books after Baum's death, making a total of forty books in the original series. The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful book for anyone no matter what age you are. Just remember to forget every thing you saw in the movie. Most people are surprise when the story doesn't end where the movie ends. When you,re finished the book try the other books in the series. I think you would enjoy them all."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"It's amazing how little people know about this book. I've seen only one review note that this story is an economic parable, not just a fable for children, and the reviewer who mentioned it made it sound like this was a wacky, unrealistic modern interpretation of a simple children's tale.Not so!Baum wrote this story as an analogy for the bimetallic standard, an issue that people actually cared about around the turn of the century but now hardly know ever existed, since we don't back our money with anything anymore. But there was a time, and The Wizzard of Oz (short for ounce, as in an ounce of gold, as in the issue of price-ratios) was written during that period, when the hottest issue on the political plate was that of the bimetallic standard--how and if it should be used. Baum, incidentally, was an enthusiastic political participant, was, in fact, probably present during William Jennings Bryan's famous &quot;cross of gold&quot; speech.But no one knows this anymore. The film is much to blame. Replacing the SILVER shoes of the wicked witch of the east(ern financial establishment) with ruby slippers is inexcusable, even if people don't know or care about these issues now. The silver shoes (silver standard) on the yellow brick road (gold standard) is a vital immage. Ah well. Still a good story."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"A foul, evil stench has blown into Munchkin Land.....After a hundred years in print \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" has been drastically changed by one Suzi Alexander. She has added her name as an author to \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" which was written long before she was ever born. So, what has she done to deserve the co-author credit for a book that sold millions worldwide before she ever heard of it? The \\"Great and Powerful\\" Suzi of Oz has judged that L. Frank Baum didn't know what he was doing and thus his great novel needed to be condensed and adapted by her for modern audiences. The original, best-selling Oz needed Suzi to save it.Tell us Suzi, Who died an made you Wizard?This is an outrage made possible because the copyright for \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" has expired and so anyone can do anything they like with the text. Yes, by law it is now in the public domain. Anyone, anywhere can publish it.I have many fine editions of the original novel published by divergent companies that loved the story so much they wanted to keep making it available to more and more children as well as the child in all of us. The Suzi Alexander version, however, seems to be written not by someone who loves the the original but instead by a person who thinks she can make a better version than the one who sold all these millions of copies before she got her hands on it.May the children of the world throw a bucket of water on her and watch Suzi's wickedness melt away.As a child who carefully memorized every single word of the original, I find the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander, altered and condensed work to be nothing less than an abomination.Keep your hands off our priceless treasures! These silver shoes do NOT belong to you!Don't be fooled by the cover. It may say \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" but the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander version is NOT the original novel that L. Frank Baum wrote. It is not good enough to be used in fireplaces or in landfills. Suzi should attempt to write her own terrible books rather than messing with our established American classics.Suzi, If you had enough heart to love the original, you'd have had the courage to bring it to us unblemished, but sadly you haven't got a brain and you can never go home again."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ,L. Frank Baum's 1899 copyright,Kindle edition, 2012-01-09One summer day in 1937, my sister and I took a trip to Oz. Unlike Dorothy, we didn't have a cyclone, we had to roller skate a mile to the library. I was ten, my sister seven. The effort was worth it. We discovered L. Frank Baum's many Oz books and spent hours at a time in Oz. It is one of my most cherished memories from childhood.Alan Pearce's Kindle Edition of Baum's original 1899 book is beautifully done, and very faithful to the book. It's also a real eye-opener when compared with the MGM movie. Baum had four people greet Dorothy, three Munchkin men and the Witch of the North. MGM's myriad Munchkins were little people gathered from all over the world. Dorothy's \\"ruby slippers\\" in the movie were silver in the book. Admitedly, these are nit-picking examples, simply to show how MGM messed up the book. Only someone who has seen the movie, and now reads the book, will notice the major differences.This is the most beautiful e-book I have ever seen! If you decide to read it, please do it justice. Black and white will kill the many original illustrations. They really need a larger color image than given by an ipod or cell phone.

Kindle Edition."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"The Wizard of Oz is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I still have to say that I like the book better. Why? The book has more weird stuff in it than the movie does; probably because of theatrical limitations like time, budget, and technological contraints. For instance, the Wicked Witch of the West in the book has only one eye. Nowadays computer graphics could make that possible in a film, but back in the day, most movies couldn't pull off effects like that.The book and the movie deviate from each other quite a bit, but both include essentially the same story. I'm glad the movie didn't try to copy the book directly, and changed some parts to not only fit the limits it had, but to make the whole story more movie-esque - like really jazzing up Munchkin Land and making it smaller than the book implied it was. (Dorothy is of the same height as the Munchkins in the book.)One thing in the book that I thought was really cool was that the Wizard of Oz shows himself in multiple forms, not just the big head. He's even a lady at one point. Also I like the hammer-head guys at the end of the book. L. Frank Baum really showed me his creative abilities there.On a side note, there are some violent scenes in the book, particularly involving multiple beheadings at a time.I really think that if you only see the movie and don't read the book, you're missing out. This book contains the REAL Tinman, and the REAL Scarecrow. The ones from the movie are just copies. Darn good copies, but still copies. Oh, the things a good book from a good author can inspire!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"This story all started when a farm girl from Kansas named Dorothy Gale, and her little dog Toto got sucked into a tornado and landed in a fairyland named Oz. In Oz she meets a bunch of strange characters, a scarecrow, tin woodsman, and a cowardly lion. Together they go on a mission to see the wizard of oz by following the yellow brick road. Each one wanting a different wish. On the way to the wizard they come across multiple things. And when they finally got to Emerald city the wizard told them that they must first kill the wicked witch of the west if they want him to make there wishes come true. Eventually they succeed in doing that along with multiple hard things to do. After all that they find out that the wizard is a &quot;humbug&quot; and he grants everyone's wishes. Except for Dorothy's wich is for her to return back home. So now Dorothy and her friends go on another adventure to find the Good Witch of the South. Well they found her and Dorothy got back home along with her dog Toto, and she had what she needed all along in order for her to return home. Personally in my opinion I enjoyed the book better then the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone with a good imagination, because I kept imagining the story as I read it. The book has some drawings in it wich makes imagining things a lot easier, it has drawings of the main characters, villains, and some of the scenes in the book such as there journey on the yellow brick road. I would also recommend this book to anyone if the ages of 10 and up."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"In his introduction to the first American fairytale that went on to become one of the most famous and beloved movies of all time, author L. Frank Baum says a rather extraordinary thing. Discussing the purpose of the old fairytales by Grimm and Andersen, Baum tells us that such tales existed both to entertain children and provide a moral by means of \\"horrible and blood-curdling\\" incident. True enough, but Baum goes on to say that his book falls outside this typical definition of a fairytale, telling us that: \\"the story of the Wizard of Oz was written solely to pleasure children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairytale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\"Reading The Wizard of Oz for the first time made me wonder if Baum was even aware of what he'd written, or if perhaps someone else had written this introduction (someone who hadn't read the book), for The Wizard of Oz is positively jam-packed full of beheadings, monsters, witches, deaths and other terrors, all focused on a character that embodies the quintessential childhood fear: that of being lost and unable to return home. Indeed, with his description of Uncle Henry in the very first chapter, Baum writes: \\"He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\" Not quite the cheerful fairytale Baum promises, is it?But of course, this isn't a bad thing. If we want to enjoy the light, then there has to be some shadows, and throughout Baum's story there is a perfect blend of happiness and pain, wonderment and horror as Dorothy Gale traverses the Land of Oz in her attempts to get home to Kansas. I just find it rather bemusing that the author was apparently wholly unaware of this!Inevitably, one can't help but compare Baum's original story with the movie-version, and it's interesting to compare the areas in which the two differ. There's still a little girl called Dorothy who lives with her Uncle Henry, Aunt Em and her dog Toto, and she's still caught up in a cyclone that whisks her away to the Land of Oz. On waking up, she finds that her house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, much to the delight of the diminutive Munchkins, who have been slaves under her rule. Rewarded with the Witch's Silver Shoes (*not* Ruby Slippers, which were an innovation of the movie in order to make the most of Technicolor), Dorothy is told to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and the Wizard of Oz, a mysterious figure who holds the best hope of getting her home again.And of course there are the familiar and beloved figures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, stalwart friends to Dorothy on her journey, and all desiring some internal quality (a brain, a heart and courage, respectively), completely unaware that they already have these traits in abundance. There's also the surprising Wizard of Oz, the evil Wicked Witch of the West (not as prevalent here as she was in the movie) and the good witches of the North and South (who in the movie are combined into the singular character of Glinda).But there are plenty of things of Baum's creation that the movie left out, such as a community of talking field mice and their Queen, a city of tiny china people, and a whole range of other bizarre inhabitants that would have been entirely impossible for the movie to recreate. The book also gives us more background into certain people and places. For example, I was delighted to find that the book gives us background on the Tin Woodman, detailing how exactly he came to be made of tin, which is a rather poignant tale of lost love. And as it turns out, there is a lot more to those creepy flying monkeys and the Emerald City than the movie shows us.In the movie, marvels are introduced one after the other in quick succession, making Oz a rather abstract and random place, much akin to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland in the \\"Alice\\" stories, (which makes a sort-of sense considering the film presents Oz as a dream that takes place in a concussed Dorothy's mind), but the literary Oz has some semblance of order and symmetry to it. The country is divided by color and direction, with the yellow-clad Winkies in the west, the red-clad Quadlings in the south, the blue-clad Munchkins in the east, and of course the green inhabitants of the Emerald City.Apologies if this review has ended up more like a comparison piece between the film and the book, but having been brought up with fond memories of the film, and approaching the book for the first time in adulthood, it was rather inevitable that the two would be held up against one another. In any case, reading the original story served to convince me that both the book and the film are necessary to appreciate each one, and any childhood would be all the richer for having been exposed to both!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"you have got to read this book i love it absolutly loveit it is great trust me you would love it you have just got to read it most people dont really think about reading this book its all about Harry Potter dont get me wrong i like harry potter but everyone knows about them nobody knows about this book that is why im posting it on the internet so please please reade it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THanks by"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"DOROTHY AND HER DOG TOTO GET CAUGHT IN A CYCLONE AND IT CARRIES THEM TO OZ!OZ IS A PLACE WHERE ANYTING CAN HAPPEN,ALMOST EVERYTHING DOES.I'M SURE WHOEVER READS THIS BOOK WILL ENJOY IT LIKE I DID."},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I did not grow up with the Oz books. I first read this story when I was about 11. And I WAS surprised at how DIFFERENT it was from the MGM movie. So many things were changed, added and cut. This story is both delightful and charming. A living scarecrow, a woodman made of tin and a lion that is cowardly all go searching for wisdom, love and courage that they all already have. But in this ORIGINAL story it talks a lot about DEATH, and there are some VIOLENT and SCARY scenes that I am GLAD that MGM either ommited or just didn't put in. Especially since most of those scenes involve my dear Tin Woodman. I am having so much trouble accepting my dear Tin Woodman being once a man of flesh and bone and having a REAL name (Nick Chopper) and being the King of the Winkies and especially not seeming to have a REAL heart. Especially since Denslow's illustrations make him look so positively CUTE!"},{"Title":"Wizard of Oz","review":"I thought that the Wizard of Oz was a totlly awsome book.very interesting. I was very surprised that it had alot of deaath and other things like that in it. But, the book was nothing like the movie. The mmmovie talks about Toto the dog getting lost, but in the book Toto stays with Dorthy the whole time. My favorite paart inthe Wizard of Oz book, was when the characters go talk to the Wizard one by one and the Wizaaard was always a different thing every time. Dorthy asked the Wizard to go back to Kasas and he said to her that she had toget ride of the Wicked Witch of the East. Then the lion goes in and he has to hellp and then the rest of the things go in and they all have to help them all had to help Dorthy. They had to do alot but they finlly all go back and say that they wanted what they asked for and he helped them all. But to find out if Dorthy goes back to Kansas, read thhis book. the only thing that iI didn't like about this book was that they shouldn't have put the lion in it.

But for someone familiar with and fond of the movie (and aren't we all?) this is quite a disappointment. Generally, I find the book version to be superior to the movie, so, given how much I love the movie version of this story, it was with great anticipation that I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions in which the movie is vastly superior to the book. The book is written in a style not too different from the fairie tales of Hans Christian Anderson (definitely more his than the Brothers Grimm); that is to say, it's very straightforward, with little or nothing in the way of style to embellish the basic story. The dialogue is bland, the plot without nuance or embellishment, the characters only a little better than wooden and one-dimensional. Which is okay for a book that is intended purely as a children's story, but given the humor, nuance, and characterization found in the movie which was based on this story, I'd expected more; I'd expected it to be one of those \\"children's stories\\" that was still entertaining to an adult.

As a book, a play and a movie, there's something about the Phantom story that powerfully endures (albeit in different ways) in each of the media.Yet there are some stories uniquely known for their appearance in book form, as a stage play or alternatively as a movie.Though Caine Mutiny rightly won Wouk a Pulitzer, history nonetheless still seems to record the movie (starring a more mature and gutsy Humphrey Bogart in the title role) as the definitive telling of this story.For those who've had the pleasure of either the Pulitzer prize winning book or the equally estimable movie, I would heartily recommend this play...also written by Wouk.As stage plays necessarily must, it reduces the story to its dramatic bare bones and I think in so doing elevates the theatrical version of this story over its cinematic and novelistic brethren.If nothing else the play is an interesting precis on just what Wouk considered to be indispensible in this story.I highly recommend it, in fact even over both the book and movie, which in this case is really saying something."},{"Title":"The Lost Jews Last of the Ethiopian Falashas","review":"The immediate impetus for Louis Rapoport's &quot;The Lost Jews&quot; was the plight of the Ethiopian Falasha tribe during the 70's. They were faced with genocidal policies of a new Marxist regime, centuries-long bigotry from the ruling Christian Amhara tribe, and what amounted to criminal negligence on the part of the Israeli government in regard to recognizing the Falashas as Jews and rescuing them. Rapoport spells this all out in the first chapter, and after this, moves beyond advocacy journalism into the realms of ancient history, folklore, Biblical and rabbinic traditions, and anthropology. This all makes very fascinating reading, as well a strong case for the Falashas legitimate, longstanding claim to being Jews. Along the way a lot of unusual information comes out about Jews as pariah metalworkers, about intercontintental migrations through the centuries, as well as the numerous non-rabbinic, Torah-based Jews in Africa and Asia. The book ends more or less where it begins, with the modern discovery of this remote tribe. Now I wonder how it all turned out, since this book was written 20 years ago."},{"Title":"The Lost Jews Last of the Ethiopian Falashas","review":"What on earth is the point of inventing Jewish roots concerning these deceptive Ethiopians when everybody knows too well why they became Jews: only because it was the only possibility for them to immigrate to Israel only for economic reasons (to flee their undescribable poverty).Were these Ethiopians Jews in Ethiopia? NO! NEVER EVER!! They were Christians! A significant number of them in Israel returned to their Christian faith even though most of them decided to keep being Jew because they felt it was safer for them to do so in Israel (despite the fact that there is freedom of faith for Christians and Muslims)!!In the history of the Jewish people, there has never ever been members of the Jewish people who were black. Never! Blacks can become Jews today through conversion if they convert without inventing false stories but there is not a group of Jews in the history of the Jewish people who were black Jews!

To invent false stories in order to convert renders the conversion process completely invalid!!To have converted Jewish Orthodox these Ethiopians do not make them Jews in any way simply because they used deception to convert to Judaism with the goal of immigrating to Israel ONLY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS. They converted only to flee their awful poverty that they were suffering in Ethiopia where they were living in mud huts and nearly all of them, except their leaders, were completely illiterate (they could not read nor write and they did not have access to the simplest books or writing items!!). Later on, these American Jews who have pushed them to convert gave them books, taught them how to read, and more.Why did they become Jews? American Jews who did not want to move to Israel felt guilty by their lack of willingness to move to Israel. They were working on outreach projects in Ethiopia and saw that these people were potentially ready to convert in order to move to Israel with the only goal of fleeing their poverty. They made them Jews by teaching them Judaism, giving their leaders Old Testament books to read and so on. Worse, they invented for them Jewish roots, telling the Jewish world that these Ethiopians were Jews!!! What a shame!!Then, they showed movies of them with Jewish items and praying and they told the viewers of these movies that they have kept Jewish traditions for centuries!!

What starts out as a boring (and hunger filled) ride for Barbara becomes intrigueing when coincidence lands her(along with the humorless officers) at the evidently burgled home of her former employer. In true Simons fashion, Barbara finds herself smack in the middle of a murder scene, and very soon thereafter running a sideline investigation into the sudden death of her former boss at the behest of his not visibly bereaved widow. As with PERILOUS FRIENDS, readers of PERILOUS RELATIONS are in for a romp as Barbara wise-cracks her way among the rich and famous of Montreal. The dialog is witty, the characters are fun, the relationships are real, the mystery meshes well with the side plots, and the food and fashion are out of this world. For all the laughs (and there are plenty)the darker subtext of the book addresses the on-going tensions between the French and English speaking sections of Montreal. I hope Barbara Simons is around for many more Perilous adventures."},{"Title":"Perilous Relations (Barbara Simons Mystery)","review":"Former public relations expert, Barbara Simons is wealthy enough to remain unemployed, at least for awhile. However, she does not remain idle for very long. When her former boss, Walter Whitestone, the ex head of an airlines, is murdered in his home, the egomaniacal Barbara begins to investigate over the objections of the local police.She immediately concentrates on the family, who she knows very well and concludes that almost everyone of them is capable of murder. Barbara also questions business associates of the deceased and his lovers. Her inept interference seems to alienate every person she speaks to and even manages to unite the French and English speaking factions against her. Still, for someone who hates to see her clothing soiled, Barbara risks her own life to satisfy her curiosity.Though not quite at the caliber of the fantastic premier novel (PERILOUS FRIENDS), the second Barbara Simons novels is a very good who-done-it due to the clumsy investigative techniques and antics of the arrogant, at least in her mind, female Sherlock Holmes.

Ever inquisitive, Barbara comforts the widow, talks to the deceased's sister, goes to the wake and then to the funeral.WHAT I LIKED:There are several elements in this book that make the story fly along faster than the previous book in the series (Perilous Friends). There are fewer sub-stories distracting from the main plot, and the streamlining makes for a more coherent story. The writing itself is better as well, and the new characters are fleshed out where appropriate. Most importantly, there is the reintroduction of romantic options for Barbara in terms of the handsome cop Greg, as well as a not-yet-defined relationship with a new male sidekick.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:There isn't anything big that I didn't like in this book, just a couple of small things. First, the relationship-cliffhanger from the end of the last book is not a major part of this book, and is instead left sitting there in limbo for a good portion of this book (until pg. 121). One of the reasons I tracked this book down was the ending of the last book -- I didn't like the cliff-hanger aspect, but I had to know what happened (normally, my To-Be-Read pile is so big that I never take the time to search for a specific book). But, her out-of-town bf had been coming to visit her in the last book for what she thought was going to be a big weekend with some important announcement or question, and I expected some sort of resolution here. It doesn't happen. For this book, the ending is a little weaker than the rest of the story, and it all comes together a little too quickly for my tastes, but that seems to be a factor of the sub-genre rather than the writing or this particular book -- in fact, it is handled rather well here, except for a small problem of logistics in terms of the bad guy transporting a gun around Montreal (can't say any more than that without giving away the ending). A little unrealistic, but not enough to affect the ending.THE BOTTOM LINE:If the next book in the series is as good or better than this one, sign me up for a copy! 4.25 lilypads out of 5.00Other Information:- Source: Library- Original date of review: March 2001, updated November 2011- Series: Barbara Simons (#02)- Recommended by: Dorothy-L- Tags: Amateur Detective, Crime, Fiction, Mystery, Police, Prose"},{"Title":"On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century","review":"I love Stephen Coonts for his fiction and for his compellations... &quot;Combat&quot; and &quot;Victory&quot; were excellent. This book lacks the redeeming trait of those tomes: new material. This is a collection of classics, but the selections from the modern authors- Coonts, Brown, and Peters- are all republished works, too. Granted, they are from wonderful novels themselves, but this collection would be that much better if there was some new material in it... pity.If you do like the selection from &quot;The War in 2020,&quot; buy some more of Ralph Peters' works; he is one of the most unappreciated thriller authors out there."},{"Title":"On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century","review":"I have many books written by Stephen Coonts. I enjoy the way he writes and compells you to keep reading to see what happens next. He is amoung my favorite Authors. &#34;On Glorious Wings&#34; The book has many storys on avaition which is one of my first loves.He calls it the best flying stories of the century. I just started to book and am only a few chapters in, however like other books by Stephen Coonts , I am hooked again. If you love avation this book is a must buy. Enjoy."},{"Title":"On Glorious Wings: The Best Flying Stories of the Century","review":"It's clear Coonts has a passion for flight, which can be appreciated by all those who love the genre. Some of the most entertaining parts of the book occur when he introduces the next excerpt; he speaks wonderfully and weaves fantastic images to express a longing for flight. Overall, though, I have to say this book was really only so-so.It's made up of several excerpts from books Coonts has decided are the most intriguing regarding flight (written in the past 100-150 years or so). They cover a wide range of concepts (reflecting the time period they were written in), ranging from hot air ballooning across oceans to a dogfight in outer space with the Soviet Union (obviously, techno-thriller 80s stuff). You're likely to recognize a few of the authors, such as Poe and Dale Brown.In many ways, this book can be seen as a demo disc. I ended up reading it less like a collection, and more like a sampler for other books/authors I'd like to read. Personally, I found some of the excerpts to be rather boring. I did, however, especially enjoy \\"The War in 2020,\\" even as short as it was. And that brings up another point- the excerpts can be rather short. Of course, I understand Coonts was merely looking for the best parts of great novels. However, I still feel that some excerpts could have gone on a little longer, or have been replaced completely by other more flight-indulging ones. I have looked over all the excerpts, but have really only been interested in three or so. All others have more or less failed to capture my imagination.In the end, this truly is only a so-so book. If you are interested in collecting books of the flight genre, I recommend you buy the actual novels then this brief preview of them. I must say, I'm partial to \\"The War in 2020.\\" If you're interested in near-future air tech I highly suggest you look into that book! But back to Coonts. If you're trying to decide between this or something else, I'd say to pass this one up for now."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I loved Ramona SOOOOO much. I wanted to be her. I read every book in the series probably 6 times (and Ramona Forever, probably about 12...) Recently I started my 5 year old cousin on the Ramona books (she reminds me so much of Ramona - funny and wild and creative and cool)- of course Ramona the Pest - and she loved it. I must say that reading it aloud it seemed a bit dated (and certainly was not as exciting, or as good, as Ramona Forever, which I read recently to make sure it was as spectacular as I remembered it). Still, I think that Ramona is a GREAT friend to have growing up - and I still consider her a friend (and idol :) This book - though not the pinnacle of the series - is a great way to start kids off (and is probably easier for a 5 or 6 year old to associate with than an 18 year old)."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona always gets in trouble.

Beezus and Ramona focused on Beezus and her inner thoughts, and Ramona was just an antagonistic presence that Beezus had to endure. For the first time, we get to be inside Ramona's head. Up to this point, all Ramona did was cause trouble for Beezus, and Henry and everybody else on Klickitat Street. But this book gives us the chance to see things from Ramona's perspective, and you know what... it makes sense. Suddenly, Ramona ceases being the neighborhood pain to a little girl who really wants to be noticed and loved. (You can even see it in the earlier books that Ramona is the youngest child in her neighborhood, hence her refuge in television and make believe). rereading thsi book as an adult, the scene with Ramona in kingergarten are so real, as are the descriptions of Miss Binney, the first year teacher who occasionally doesn't really know what to make of her students. Clearly, these were things that college didn't prepare her for. This is a great introduction to the MIND of Ramona, and prepares for lots of enjoyments of the ups and downs in Ramona's life in the years to come. It also introduces many characters who are integral later down the road, including arch-enemy Susan. Of particular note are the still enjoyable drawings of the late Louis Darling who perfectly captures the innocence of kindergraten, and the feelings of a little girl who just wants to be seen as special."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona Quimby of Klickitat street is starting kindergarten.

I recently acquired sets for my niece and nephew, and this book in particular had both of them laughing aloud - not a small feat when kids are, respectively, 12 and 6, and the former is not without a marked similarity to Ramona in some respects. I myself nearly choked at &quot;sit here for the present,&quot; and the Mike Mulligan dilemma.Besides a vivid and delightful writing style, Beverly's books undoubtedly have a wide appeal because the incidents described are comparable to what children would have in their own lives or in those of others they know. The characters seem like close friends ... or, at the very least, friends one wishes one had."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I am in second-grade.

As a bit of a nerd from the very beginning, I just couldn't relate to Ramona's exuberance that always got her into trouble, and I more or less thought of her as a bad girl. But I still carried memories of the book with me into adulthood -- especially Ramona's enchanting way of writing \\"Q.\\"Fast-forward to parenting a spirited daughter. I re-read the book and decided that I absolutely had to share it with my daughter. I now see Ramona in a whole new light; as the author herself states, Ramona never (well, rarely) really means to be naughty. Most adults just don't understand her -- the way she cannot resist the temptation to boing a beautiful curl, her need for shiny new girls' boots and the glory of stamping through the mud the first day she wears them, her need to know that her teacher loves her.My five-year-old was indeed caught up in Ramona's story, frequently asking me to read another chapter when I had finished one. Ramona became so real to her that she covered her ears when it was clear that Ramona was headed for trouble -- she couldn't bear to listen to the consequences. I may have been too much of a goody-goody to fully appreciate the book earlier, but I certainly enjoy it now and am glad that my daughter enjoys it, too."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona, the Pest is a book about Ramona Quimby, and herkindergarten adventures. Ramona doesn't understand why her sister,Beezus, always calls her a pest. Her thoughts are that sometimes there is a need to be a little bit louder and more noisier than others because that is what it takes for little people to be noticed sometimes. She loves everything about kindergarten. She loves her teacher Miss Binney, boinging Susan's long red curls, chasing Davy on the playground for a kiss, being the naptime wake-up fairy, and seat work where she practices making her Q's into cats. Ramona also gets excited about being the \\"baddest witch\\" at the Halloween Parade, wearing her new boots in the mud, and loosing her first tooth. She plans to dropout of kindergarten when her stubborn behavior makes Miss Binney send her home until she can promise to be good. Don't miss this delightful story's ending. I liked this book because it was humorous, and was told in a believable manner. The things children think we say and how they perceive them are shown in the \\"dawnzer song.\\" This is one of my son's favorite books, now I see why. I think the author captured the stubborn, independent, and somewhat impulsive behavior of a kindergarten age child. I am sure kids would enjoy listening to this book, and probably many could relate to Ramona's feelings of wanting to be a big girl. I think boys will identify to the story with characters like Henry, Howie and Davy. I can't wait to read the other Ramona books by Beverly Cleary. Everyone will enjoy this book.

She tells everyone in the class that Miss.Binney is going to give her a present and no one else. The class goes outside and Ramona finally figures out that Miss.Binney just meant to sit in the seat for now. Ramona was a little upset about it but she moved on.

Also she has an older sister and I have a younger brother.I really enjoyed this book because it was funny and I was able to sit down and enjoy it and get into it.

I realized that the dust jackets were different when I ordered them; I don't like it, but I've learned to live with that. Then I opened Ramona the Pest and realized that they've replaced Louis Darling's marvelous illustrations, with those wild, exuberant, inky pictures of a Ramona who practically leaps from the pages, with drab, dreary, bland, anodyne, pallid and uninteresting things. What an awful thing to do to wonderful books. (And I know all the arguments about \\"Oh, children today are *different*, and they must have new new new pictures that look like everything else they've ever seen because otherwise they might not read the books...\\" Bilge.)The story deserves five stars. I've removed four of them for crimes against illustration."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I'll begin with a confession. I never read the Ramona books as a child. Certainly I'd heard about them (I had a couple friends who wanted to \\"Boing\\" my own curls more than once) but I never found a chance or an opportunity to read them in any depth until I reached the ripe old age of 25. Reading them now, I'm sorry I wasn't introduced to them from the start. In this classic story Ramona is a fully realized character. She is a little girl in full bloom. She has good qualities and she has bad qualities, but through it all she seems incredibly \\"real\\". Seeing things from Ramona's point of view gives you a better understanding of some of the problems she has in her daily life. Kids will be able to relate to Ramona when she feels she's being teased and wants to feel sorry for herself. Her anger is always understandable, and the fact that the grownups in the book are not always perfect (probably a fairly radical notion in 1968 children's literature) will appeal to all readers. This book instantly reminded me of a book that I did read as a child, \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\", by Judy Blume. Some of Ramona's less charming qualities (such as her obsessive compulsive desire to \\"Boing\\" her classmates hair) will possibly remind reads of Joey Pigza as well (though the leap from Ramona to Joey is a very large one). This is an ideal book to read aloud to children in class or other group situations and the original illustrations by Louis Darling (if you can locate an edition containing them) are delightful."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona Quimby, youngest child in the household, is finally going to kindergarten, an event she has looked forward to for . . . well, maybe as much as a full year out of her five-year-old's life.

When her teacher will no longer tolerate Ramona's hair-pulling, Ramona has a big decision to make: does she want to continue kindergarten, which means not pulling Susan's hair. Or does she want to stay home, which means being isolated from her classmates. A kind action from her teacher helps Ramona make the right decision.

The theme of the book seems to be \\"what kind of trouble will Ramona get into next?\\" It is a hilarious and well written story about young Ramona Quimby and her journey through kindergarten. Her experiences in kindergarten is what makes the story; chasing down Davy to kiss him, pulling Susan's curly hair, quarreling with her neighbor Howie and becoming the scariest witch in kindergarten. The story takes place for the most part in either Ramona's home and or her kindergarten classroom. Ramona loves kindergarten and her teacher Miss Binney but manages to still find trouble at every corner. From being sat outside of the classroom on the first day to deciding she is going to drop out of kindergarten Beverly Cleary keeps readers entertained with Ramona's drama.The main character in this book is Ramona. The story makes her out to be a trouble making wild child, however it is impossible not to love her once you start reading. Her logic is exactly what you would expect from any typical kindergartener and it really gives the older readers a chance to reconnect with their youth while the younger readers can relate in so many ways. Ramona is a very relatable character and any reader will want to continue reading her books just to find out what happens next.This book would be most appropriate for students in the later part of their elementary career. However people of all ages would enjoy Ramona The Pest. Beverly Cleary has a way of telling a story through the eyes of a young child that is superb and intriguing. The book has been around since the 1960's so generations of people have been able to enjoy it, and it would be a great way for parents or even grandparents to connect with their children and grandchildren.This book would be a must have in any classroom. The fact that the book has withstood the test of time and is still popular today speaks volumes for it. Most children these days have a trouble getting interested in reading. Reading has become more of a chore.

From the first page to the last I enjoyed every single part of this story! It was very interesting and made me want to read more!

Reading this book made me want to read all the other books in the series!

Along with all the other Ramona books (Beezus and Ramona, Ramona the Brave, Ramona and her Father, Ramona and her Mother, Ramona Quimby Age 8, Ramona's World, and Ramona Forever). My students love the book and you will, too!"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Beverly Cleary has a real gift. Although her books span a period of decades, they all read as though they were written today. There's a few odd details in some of them, but mostly they rely on good storytelling and... well, very real-seeming children.This is the story of Ramona's kindergarten year. It can be hard to find chapter books that are worth reading to kindergarteners, but this is it - Ramona actually seems like an actual child who is actually, really, truly in kindergarten! When she's told to \\"sit here for the present\\" she does, waiting for her present. When she struggles to refrain from pulling perfect Susan's curly \\"boingy\\" hair, you can feel how hard it is. And it's easy for all small children to understand why Susan's trying to act like a grown-up is annoying for Ramona.I would really suggest this as a first read-aloud chapter book for a young kid."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This book is about a girl named Ramona. She's starting kindergarden, and unfortuntly for her, people thinks she's a pest. This is a good book!"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I sent it to a friends daughter and I like the page of the kids wearing their boots, raincoats, and rain hats."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona Quimby has started kindergarten and is learning new things each day. Ramona is not only learning how to write her name but is learning life lessons. She is also making new friends.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous. Ramona's reactions to her teacher and peers were funny. They reminded me about times when I was in grade school, such as girls chasing the boys they like or girls admiring other girls long hair. This a a great book for those who love humorous stories."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I think this was a good book for little kids to read. It was funny how she was always anoying someone and how she was always starting trouble."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Today is the first day of school for Ramona and she is in kindergarten. Ramona has an older sister named Beezus. One day Ramona had a substitute so she ran away. At the end of Ramona the Pest, Ramona can\`t go to school, she got kicked out. If you want to find out how she got kicked out of school and the end of the story than you should read Ramona the Pest. I liked this book because it is funny but sometimes odd."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This book was really funny. I gave it five stars because Ramona didn't want to go back to school and her teacher wanted her back at school by giving her a note and giving her her tooth and she showed it to her mother and said to her mother\\"I am going to school tomorow!\\"but it was Saturday."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Picking up right where she left off, my favorite little girl has just started half-day kindergarten. She must deal with her older sister making fun of her, not being allowed to pull a little girl's curls and walking to school with Howie (the boy from down the street whom Ramon could do without).Ramona is just like any other 5-year old. She gets confused and throws fits. She is such a loveable character because a most wonderful author creates her so deftly and realistically.The text is appropriate for students in grades 2-5. It also works well in a read-aloud setting with this age group. These students (and teachers and parents as well) will get a kick out of remembering how confusing a time kindergarten can be. I recall hearing it read to me in 2nd grade and now have done the same with my students. A good laugh was heard everyday from our room.Why 5 stars?:Cleary repeatedly made young people reflect upon their own days as an even younger person with a string of books about experiencing the world through the eyes of a curious little girl with a will all of her own. This book is the second in the series that predates Junie B. Jones and was much better written."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"when ramona starts kindergarten, she's super excited. in school, her teacher is miss binney. there is also a little mean girl in her class. her name is susan. she has \\"boing, boing\\" curls in her hair. ramona pulls it. not to be mean, just to see if her hair is springy. earlier in the story, misss binney said to ramona \\"sit at your desk for the present.\\" she thought it was a gift present. what the teacher meant was past, present, and future. ramona almost sat the whole day there. and during rest time, the quietest one will be the wake-up fairy! ramona did a tiny snore.....her tiny, tiny, tiny snore made the class do loud snores and giggles! susan was the wake-up fairy. and ramona got in trouble! during halloween she pulled susan's hair again! she was also a kindergarten dropout! she didn't really be a pest. i loved this book.i loved this book.i loved this book.i loved this book.i loved this book.i loved this book.i loved this book. it's cool."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona The Pest by Beverly Cleary,I think is one of the best books in the United States!It's all about a girl who goes to kindergarden andsomething happens and Ramona doesn't like it.

I really had a laugh when I read this book and that's why its my favorite Beverly Cleary book."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I read this book several times since I was 8. Beverly Cleary gives a realistic picture of a 5-year-old girl who is misunderstood. To onlookers, she is a pest, but she doesn't mean to be. It is funny as well as real and is one of my favorite books. From Ramona trying to kiss Davy to her affection for Miss Binney and her anger towards Susan, the girl with the curls that Ramona loves to &quot;boing&quot;, this book is one of Beverly Cleary's best yet. The ages for the book are 9 to 12, but I also recommend this book for adults who write for kids or are around kids a lot. It is enjoyable for all."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Beverly Cleary is the master of creating timeless characters and Ramona Quimby is a timeless character. I read this book when I was a little girl, I fell in love with it, and now I am reading it to my 4 year old son, who begs for a new chapter every night.Ramona isn't really a pest, but just a curious child, but that leads to all kinds of trouble as she starts kindergarten. Because of her new found troubles she almost decides she doesn't want to be there anymore.Beverly Cleary really knows how to realate to children. It is simply no wonder that she has surpassed at least two generations with her work as an uncomparable author. She makes you laugh and feel all at the same time."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"When I picked up Ramona the Pest, I wondered if Ramona was really a pest or if she was simply misunderstood . I found this book to be a thoroughly enjoyable realistic fiction novel. This \\"Ramona\\" book reminds me of another one in the series called Ramona Age Eight.Most of the action takes place at the Quimby's household and at Ramona's elementary school. Cleary really describes her characters well. I felt like I could pick Ramona out in a crowd and know exactly what to say to her. She made me feel like I was just hanging out with a new friend.It is Ramona's first year of Kindergarten. There is a conflict between Miss Binney and Ramona. On the first morning of Kindergarten, Miss Binney tells Ramona to sit in her seat for the present. Ramona takes her literally and she sits in her seat for a very long time because she is waiting for a present. Finally, Miss Binney tells Ramona that the kind of present she is describing means, for a period of time. Later that day, Ramona finally gets up and goes outside to play \\"Gray Duck\\". When it is Ramona's turn to run, she gets distracted on the way back to her spot. She doesn't mean to cause a problem, but she just has to pullone of her classmate, Susan's luscious curls. Susan lets out a huge wail and Ramona has to sit on the bad girl bench.I think a fourth or fifth grader would enjoy reading this book. It would also be a great novel to read to younger children because they could so easily relate to Ramona's problems. Out of five stars, I would award this book all five. If you can handle some drama, temper tantrums and a whole lot of humor, Ramona the Pest would be a great choice I had so much fun reading this wonderful book, I could go on and on retelling the funny events. But if I did that, you might not have as much fun being surprised by all that Ramona has to offer. Read Ramona the Pest for yourself. You will love it!!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"When I picked up Ramona the Pest, I wondered if Ramona was really a pest or if she was simply misunderstood .

I would be very surprised if anybody who read these Ramona books could not look back on their childhoods and relate to Ramona's innocent thoughts. Cleary has one heck of a knack with these books, and I recommend them for EVERYONE, even adults. No matter what age you are, you can get a kick out of little Ramona Quimby and her unpredictable antics, and throughout it all, you get a beautiful and innocent glimpse at childhood."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This book is FUN FUN FUN!!!

I recommend this book to all young readers, especially girls."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"When it comes to children's literature, Beverly Cleary's books are among the best. Anyone who has ever been a child can relate to and appreciate these Ramona books. Cleary doesn't just understand how children act--she understands how they THINK. She knows how young ones feel in certain situations, and I have a lot of respect for her as a writer. \\"Ramona the Pest\\" is the hilarious story of Ramona's kindergarten days. \\"The dawnzer lee light\\" is perhaps one of the most endearing, most hysterical perceptions that Ramona has. (Read this book and you'll know what I'm talking about.) Determined to earn her teacher Miss Binney's attention and affections, Ramona does everything in her power to make herself look good--but she usually ends up doing the exact opposite. There is no character in literature quite like Ramona Quimby. These books are a great way to cheer yourself up when you need it. If you have yet to discover Beverly Cleary's remarkable Ramona stories, all I can say is... now go and get them!!!! =)"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona is not a pest!

There might just be one ...."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This Beverly Cleary classic is great heard on Audio Cassette Unabridged. It is read by Stockard Channing. (She played Rizzo in Grease) It is finally time for Ramona to start kindergarten. She likes it even better than she thought she would. Her teacher promises her a present on the first day. There's show and tell, singing time, games of Gray Duck. Yes school is fun, until Ramona almost becomes the world's first kindergarten dropout."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Other reviewers have said that this book is a beloved masterpiece of children's fiction, which it is. I'd just like to add that Stockard Channing's unabridged recordings of it, and the other Ramona books, do justice to them completely.Channing is magnificent; like Cleary, she captures Ramona without ever patronizing her. The tapes stand up to repeated listening, which you can expect, without becoming precious or annoying. I'd like to see CD editions of these recordings become available."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I think the pest is great I Like It because It Is Funny.

She's constantly running around, and older kids see it as annoying, when really she just wants everything to happen quickly.In this book, Ramona is entering kindergarten. The problem is is that it's not all fun and games. Ramona likes singing, playing with her doll Chevrolet, and pulling snobby Susan's hair, but that's it. Then Ramona becomes upset when something (I won't tell you what) happens at school, and Ramona drops out.This is an excellent book, and any fan of Ramona should read this."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This fun and cheerful book was Ramona the Pest.

This book was first read to us by our third grade teacher, after which I read it and other books by Cleary. It reminds me so vividly about the sweet innocence of being a child and the many challenges and expectations presented by the dynamic world of adults.I think this book would be enjoyed by anyone wanting a good laugh and a healthy reminder that we were all once kids.

Well, it's more than that. The author does take us into the mind of a kindergartener, but Beezus (the oldest sister) has a reason for calling Ramona a pest. She is! First of all, Ramona is spoiled and thinks that everyone's against her, and anytime she wants something, she knows--if she cries--her mother will listen to her. Ramona Quimby is a brat and I'm glad to see she's grown-up, because Ramona Quimby is nothing but a whiner and spoiled brat! Consider this before handing it to your child. I'm 13...I know these things. My little sister agrees with me.(Remember, this is just an opinion)"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I remember reading this as a little girl, as a mom, BAD CHOICE!!

(Another reviewer said it was intended for ages 9-12... cripes, was I THAT precocious?)I'd really recommend this book for any child, but especially for children who are always in trouble. It really is therapy for a pest.I think it's also therapy for precocious readers - this isn't something adults often think of, but a kid who's ahead of her age can get very sick of reading books about much older children. I absolutely fell on the Ramona books because she was the first heroine I could really relate to. :)"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona Quimby is a timeless character. I read this book when I was a kid (too many years ago to mention) and this has to be one of my all time favorites.Beverly Cleary is an author who really knows what kids are like. Now that I am a kindergarten teacher, I see a room full of Ramonas most every day and each character in this book, from Susan with the &quot;boinggg&quot; curls, to Davy, to Howie, and, of course, Ramona herself, are real!This is a book that I pull out and read again from time to time when I need a laugh! I would highly recommend it to readers of all ages!"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I waited until I was 38 to read my first Ramona book, and here's what I thought:On writing alone, this book deserves more than 3 stars...it's clear, memorable, and interesting. My rating is more on content, and because the last chapter made me so frustrated (which, once again, could just be good writing) that I had to offer an angle.Ramona's parents are distant and clueless. In my view, sometimes \\"spirited\\" children just need some loving, strong absolutes and swift, fair punishment; neither of which Ramona's parents were prepared to offer. So, everyone suffered for a week trying to figure out what decision this 5-yr-old was going to make, when it could have been over in one day. I don't know about you, but it's never okay in my house to kick your bedroom wall...not when you're happy, not when you're mad... so the fact that there was no stronger guidance for Ramona here bugged me.Having said that, I totally understand that this is a fictional, fun book & should not be taken too seriously. It should, though, be explored together, so you don't suddenly get more tantrums from your kids and wonder why. Also, SPOILER ALERT for younger children who still undeniably believe in the tooth fairy... that is brought into question in one of the chapters, so just be aware. Otherwise, cute read."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Didn't everyone feel like Ramona Quimby at some point in their childhood? Beverly Clearly is able to connect with her young readers simply by remembering what it feels like to be misunderstood. The Ramona series is still enchanting children, as well as adults, more than fifty years after the character made her debut in Henry and Beezus. If you have not had the pleasure of meeting the imaginative, impatient child who feels as though no one understands how hard being a kid is, please read this series. My personal favorites are Ramona the Pest, Ramona the Brave, Ramona and her Father, and Ramona and her Mother."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I love all the Ramona books. I read them to my children and I recently bought the kindle version to read to my granddaughters on vacation. A note of praise for Kindle. If I hadn't had one, I wouldn't have had access to the book on the spur of the moment. Anyway, I think Ramona reminds me of myself as a child. She thinks a lot. She is eager to learn. And she's definitely in the 'mythic/literal\\" stage. So life keeps tripping her up. On the other hand, she's delighted when Henry takes a wheel off her tricycle because now she has a 'two wheeler' and she rides it without self-consciousness. It is a delightful book for children who have to navigate the increasingly adult world of school. Lots of laughs and lots of empathy."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Hilarious all the way through. I have most of Beverley Clearies Ramona books, but Ramona The Pest is my favourite. It brings back memories of my own childhood because I was a mischievous pest just like Ramona, plus I had an older sister. Now my grandchildren read all the Ramona books and laugh as much as I did. I think my granddaughter is a bit like Ramona too.Rascals Sing at The Opera House: Adventures of Rascals, Polly and Gertie"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"In Ramona the Pest, Ramona starts kindergarten. She loves school and her teacher but still manages to get herself in quite a bit of trouble.Beverly Cleary gets little kids. There is a scene where Ramona is throwing a tantrum in her room in which Ms. Cleary does a wonderful job of explaining the (irrational) thought process that is going on in Ramona's mind during the tantrum. I think little kids will find comfort in knowing that they are not the only ones who feel out of control at times. She also understands that children can be very literal and this often leads to misunderstandings and embarrassment for them. This whole book serves to help young readers know that they are not the only ones overwhelmed by the world and new experiences.My six year old son and I loved this book and we're looking forward to the next Ramona book in the series."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"It's finally happened! Ramona Quimby is old enough to attend kindergarten! She can't wait to do big kid stuff like learn to read and participate in show and tell. Parts of school are confusing, like the song about the dawnzer. But she is making new friends, like Davey, her first crush, and Susan, whose hair is so curly it just cries out to be tugged. But when things go horribly wrong, will Ramona ever return?I had read this book before but had forgotten just how wonderful it was until I reread it recently. Author Beverly Cleary expertly captures the emotions and reactions of a 5 year old. Heck, I think at times Ramona is more honest then many adults are today. While some of her behavior isn't acceptable, it is understandable. And absolutely funny. There are so many wonderfully funny moments here that anyone will relate to.The story itself is more episodic then a true novel. But that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I certainly didn't want to put it down.The book was originally written in the late 60's, so it might be slightly dated, but this really is a minor issue. The heart of the story is Ramona and her new kindergarten world.Beverly Cleary has a wonderful pen for writing. The book works well for mid to late elementary school students to read to themselves. Or it can be read aloud with absolute ease.If you haven't discovered the joys of kindergarten with Ramona, pick up this book today. You'll laugh and smile as you are carried away to a world that was simpler."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Five-year-old Ramona Quimby is tired of being called a pest. It's not her fault she doesn't know as much as her big sister Beezus, or that she's always so eager to get things done, is it?This year, Ramona is finally starting kindergarten. After what felt like years of waiting, she's excited at the idea of learning to read and write like Beezus.But kindergarten is full of its own problems. As much as Ramona loves her teacher, she isn't always sure that Miss Binney loves her back -- or what she's done to make her unhappy. Ramona also quibbles with Howie, a neighborhood boy who alternates between being her friend and being so exasperating he makes her furious; longs to pull the curls of her classmate Susan, and to kiss shy little Davy.As always, Ramona is a believable character, likeable and just like any other child readers might hope to meet. After becoming introduced to Ramona, young readers will clamor for the other books, eager to find out what happens to the irrepressible girl next."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Among all of Cleary's books, this one may be the most dear. The mischievous titular protagonist is surely the author's most beloved character, and she serves as a vessel for Cleary's uncanny comprehension of juvenile experiences and perceptions. Ramona's joys, adventures and trials are not merely the stuff of fiction; any child or adult who retains a clear memory of childhood will be able to relate to them. Inceptive conflicts with peers, tumultuous relations with authority figures and that first loose tooth are all explored, and both the significant and trivial experiences that Ramona endures all seem as genuine as reality. Many of Cleary's other principal characters figure prominently in the story's proceedings: quintessential schoolboy Henry Huggins and his adventuresome dog, Ribsy, older sister Beezus and Ramona's patient parents. But the focus on the sometimes bratty, well-meaning kindergarten-age child and her exploits is what drives the narrative of this book, and has preserved it far better than many of Cleary's other older titles. Over four decades after its initial publication, this is still as charming and relevant as it ever was.As in all of his collaborations with Cleary, Louis Darling's numerous illustrations for this book are excellent. Every black-and-white image is rendered with vigorous flair, perfectly portraying the childish excitement and humor of Ramona's world."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"How I missed this classic growing up, I'll never know. But my son has discovered the Ramona books, and they are wonderful and very true to life. Ramona's thought-processes and antics are so real, I now know that my son has been behaving like a normal kid! Cleary is so accurate in rendering the child's perspective and writing about it in a way that young children can identify with, that this book can't fail to appeal to everyone, now and for years to come. It hasn't dated, and the humor holds up well. Don't miss this series--your little reader will be eager to pick up the entire series."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Although it was first published in the 1960s, \\"Ramona The Pest\\" still speaks to the lives of children today, as a five-year old Ramona Quimby enters the world of \\"big kids\\" and goes off to kindergarten. Funny, heartfelt and honest, this book centers on Ramona's eagerness to please her new teacher, Miss Binney, and the difficulties of a headstrong little girl trying to mind her temper and get along with other kids in a complex social situation. This was the first solo Ramona book (Henry Huggins and Ramona's older sister Beezus make appearances, but they are not central to the story) and was the start of a series of Ramonacentric adventures. It includes some classic Cleary gags, such as Ramona getting the words to the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" wrong (\\"by the dawnzer lee light...\\") and Ramona's brief career as a \\"kindergarten dropout\\". Great stuff - still holds up today. (ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"I really loved this book. It was a lot of fun to read!

I love the way Beverly Cleary has of handling children's mistakes with sensitivity. We laugh at Ramona but we also understand and are \\"pulling\\" for her. I admire all of Cleary's books but if I had to pick a favorate, this would be it."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Beverly Cleary has presented us with a delightful, funny story about a naughty young girl named Ramona Quimby and her experiences in kindergarten. This book was first read to us by our third grade teacher, after which I read it and other books by Cleary. I became hooked to this great children's author and one of her contemporaries, Caroline Haywood. It reminds me so vividly about the sweet innocence of being a child and the many challenges and expectations presented by the dynamic world of adults.I think this book would be enjoyed by anyone wanting a good laugh and a healthy reminder that we were all once kids. Ramona Quimby might be fictional, but her life can be an accurate portrayal of any middle class subarbanite in the United States."},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"When deciding to revisit a few favorites, I mistakenly started with a newer Ramona book entitled \\"Ramona's World\\". After feeling a bit lukewarm upon finishing it, it made me sad. I thought that perhaps Ramona hasn't aged as well as I'd hoped she would. However, I decided to check out this book, an older Ramona title, and all of those worries were put to rest.At first, I thought I hadn't read this title before. However, a few pages in, I realized that I certainly had read the book as a child and loved every minute once again. Forgive me if this sounds harsh, but I suppose I had forgotten I had read this, because really, the Ramona books are pretty much interchangeable. Each book documents the antics of Ramona Quimby, a beloved character to all. It's wonderful to see her grow and mature in each book, but it's easy to forget that you had read a particular title, because they all have the same idea to them. This isn't to say I don't love these books to pieces, though!In this book, Ramona starts Kindergarten. I absolutely love how Beverly Cleary gets into the mind of this little girl. It's easy to simply label a girl like Ramona as a \\"pest\\", but Cleary beautifully illustrates her thoughts behind her actions. Then most people will realize (if one cares to admit it) that there was a little bit of Ramona in all of us. I remember myself as a child, resisting the temptation to kiss a boy, pull a girl's springy curls, children calling others \\"kindergarten babies\\" and accusing other kids of \\"acting big.\\" Hehe. There, I admitted it!I can also admit that I (at age 30) was genuinely excited to return to this book each time I put it down. \\"Will Ramona go back to kindergarten? I'd better read on!\\" I love this book because I love all of Ramona's thoughts, how Beverly Cleary portrays her as an active little girl who is misunderstood to be a pest by grownups and other kids. I also love Ramona's interactions with her parents and her teacher, Miss Binney. I wish I could be more like Miss Binney myself! I also love how it somewhat reminds me of my own idyllic childhood in Canada. Like many other Cleary novels, it's almost as if it's a portrayal of the past. I'm looking forward to revisiting the other Ramona books and encourage anyone else to do the same! Go Ramona!"},{"Title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"This is a wonderful book! I read it to my class of second graders, as a read aloud every school year. Even though the protagonist in the story is a little kindergarten girl. The \\"aged\\" 7 year olds in my class still love it! They seem to really identify with this character... who am I kidding I identify with her too!Who among us has never felt excited about a shiny new pair of boots... or some other piece of clothing?Who among us has not felt embarrassed when we mistake a song lyric?Who among us has not been swept up in the moment wanting to squish, squish, squish in fresh mud?Ramona, just like you has experienced all this and more. This book in Beverly Cleary's Ramona series, is full of priceless childhood moments. In fact it is not difficult to picture our own selves in all these moments.Ramona is a priceless kid... and this book is full of priceless moments of childhood reflection.Adults to Kids should exerience this one. It is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Hawkman: Allies & Enemies (Book 2)","review":"&quot;Starman&quot; by James Robinson was my favourite comic for many, many years. In fact, it was the book that introduced me to the fascinating world of DC Comics' &quot;Golden Age&quot; and its colourful characters. I was genuinely distressed when it ended some years back (and I'm not alone, check out the reviews on the many &quot;Starman&quot; TPBs to see that). Therefore, I am genuinely thankful that James Robinson is continuing his magic (with Geoff Johns, another of my favourite writers) on the newly revived &quot;Hawkman&quot; title.While the first volume (&quot;Endless Flight&quot;) helped to introduce us to the characters and the city of St. Roch, this second volume is where the book actually takes flight. Those who loved &quot;Starman&quot; for its many &quot;Times Past&quot; storyline will be pleased to know that the same thing is happening here in &quot;Hawkman&quot; with its &quot;Lives Past&quot; (the first of which is reprinted here with Hawkman/Hawkgirl in the old West). This volume also reintroduced the &quot;Gentleman Ghost&quot; Jim Craddock, a Golden Age villain who bears comparison to the great character of The Shade in &quot;Starman&quot;. All in all, like &quot;Starman&quot;, we again have a book that is truly modern and yet is rooted in history - paying homage to the work of &quot;Times Past&quot;.Further bonus: The Atom guest stars in this book, Hawkgirl discovers the truth behind her parents' murder and we see some real developments in the relationship between Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Finally, the whole package is presented to us by the breath-takingly beautiful art of Rags Morales (inked by Michael Bair) and Don Kramer. The equally gorgeous painted covers by Andrew Robinson and John Watson are included in the back of the book.This book is heartily recommended to everyone who loves the romance, chivalry and rich history of superhero comics."},{"Title":"Hawkman: Allies & Enemies (Book 2)","review":"Hawkman and the Atom work well together, and a surprise betrayal that you don't see coming. Robinson's artwork is very nice, too. This is more of the eternal triangle of love, death and assassination that Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and their enemy Hath-Set have been trapped in for thousands of years. This time it comes from a very unlikely source."},{"Title":"Hawkman: Allies & Enemies (Book 2)","review":"Reprinting #s 7-12 of the current \\"Hawkman\\" series, \\"Allies & Enemies\\" covers a lot of ground, the various issues within taking on different ideas and being different kinds of books while still maintaining the coherency of the series.Number 7 is the 'Past Lives' issue, covering a pair of Hawkman and Hawkgirl's previous incarnations in the DC Universe, those of Nighthawk and Cinnamon in the Old West, two characters who actually previously existed in the DC Universe but, I believe, hadn't been used for years and years and who I don't think ever had any connection to the Hawks until this current series. It's amazing how the Hawkman creative team is taking old and seldom-seen characters and making them into big parts of this series. Great issue for Hawkman fans, great issue for those who bemoan the scant existance of Western comics (once so plentiful on the scene) on the scene today, great book period. My only complaint is I would have liked the 'Past Lives' thing to run a few more issues, each book tackling a different period and set of incarnations. There's so much to the backhistory (spanning thousands of years!) of these eternally reincarnated characters yet to tell - just one more reason to hope the series makes it to # 500 and beyond, to have room to fit everything in.Numbers 8 and 9 are both 'junction' issues (tying in a number of plotlines - pre-established ones and hints of upcoming ones) and interpersonal issues, with The Atom getting feature treatment along with the regulars in # 8 (very fitting, since he and Hawkman once shared an ongoing title on a regular basis and Dr. Fate joining the stars on center stage in the ninth. Both are dramatic, moving and exceptionally well done. Number nine is also getting into increasingly disturbing territory, as details of Hawkgirl's harrowing past (in this lifetime) begin to come out. Neither is going to over well with readers who prefer for every issue of each series to be all fighting and action, all the time. I love the mammoth battles as much as anyone, but I love the kind of thing we get in these issues too. Neither would be as effective without the other; the different atmospheres and different tones within a series play off one another and make the whole much better.For numbers 10-12, there's less one can say without giving away plot points of earlier issues, both those in this book and in the previous 6 issues (aka the \\"Hawkman: Endless Flight\\" Trade Paperback). Suffice it to say they're more high adventure-oriented, they continue the trend of taking the Hawkman series to locales less seen in the DCU by going to the Himalayas and yes, the yetis are here. Some of the best-looking yetis ever drawn, ensorceled by evil magic into a deadly fighting force.Needless to say (if you're familiar with the series at all) the art is impeccable. The supporting cast continues to grow and come more and more alive with each issue. And the Hawks are becoming as integral a part of the overall DC Universe as Superman and Batman.Outstanding; extremely recommended."},{"Title":"The Times Atlas of the World","review":"Although the concise edition of the Times Atlas of the World was once just a smaller version of its biggerbrother, this is no longer the case at all. The seventh edition is released with completely new mapping in arenewed style, where advanced computer techniques have played an increasingly important role. This atlasgives a reasonably balanced mapping of the world, although Europe gets still too much credit in a worldwhere the role of Europe is decreasing in importance.Whereas the previous edition attempted to attain a rather uniform pattern of scale sizes (i.e., 1:6M, 1:3M),this edition moves toward the philosophy of the National Geographic, meaning that for each area to bemapped, an individual scale is chosen that fits the page best. The typefaces have improved considerablysince the previous edition, although they could have been smaller and thus create space for more entries.

(1968), Cabaret (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), Tommy (1975) and Evita (1996), Hollywood has essentially turned its back on a genre that this book re-captures in all its glory. The images are superb, the color and quality are sublime. Though the book is straightforward, a thread of sadness runs subconsciously from its first to its last pages, as one ruminates about what this genre was all about, what it could have been and why it is, for all intents and purposes, dead except on the New York, London and Toronto stages. From Astaire and Rogers to Gene Kelly, Streisand and even the Beatles, it's all covered here. Though it seems awkward to most of today's audiences to see a person in the middle of a scene break out into a song with no band playing behind him on screen, this was the accepted norm and was often the the portion of a film that had an audience soaring in their seats. That such a feeling has all but disappeared makes this book all the more precious, preventing this genre from fading into the wisps of memory. The beautiful thing about this book is the unexpected. Rather than delve into the expected great musicals with the standard American images (which are included in great detail nevertheless), this book includes artwork from other countries, art that is more &quot;in your face&quot; and thought provoking. Who can forget the image used for the Polish version of the 1972 release of &quot;Cabaret?&quot; (Joel Grey's face in the center of four stocking legs bent into the shape of a swastika?) This is the kind of thing that you would never have seen printed or distributed in the U.S., works of art that can only be bought for thousands of dollars today at many of America's biggest auction houses. If you are the least bit interested in the jaw-dropping beauty of what has become a lost art -- the exercise of drawing images associated with the advertising of a Hollywood film -- this is the book to have. This book is part of movie poster maven Bruce Hershenson's exhaustive multi-volume series of books highlighting the history and beauty of what much of mainstream America has only in the last ten years begun to recognize. And that is movie posters are a &quot;popular art&quot; form that can stand proudly next to all other styles of art from gothic to modern, from expressionist to impressionist. Great film art borrows from all of these styles and this volume, which focuses only on posters associated with musicals, illustrates innumerable examples whereby despite the restrictive nature of the genre (musicals), not all posters went in the same direction in terms of style and presentation. From Shall We Dance to A Star is Born, from 42nd Street to Yellow Submarine, Hershenson and Allen have built an incredible archive (and legacy) of images in all of their books, capturing a period (when all posters were drawn by hand and then printed, as opposed to today's method of using photographic stock and manipulating them digitally and printing them by the thousands) that would otherwise be lost forever. A fine book for any collector (get the hardcover edition if you can, it's harder to find; if Amazon doesn't have it, it's available from Mr. Hershenson directly at mail@brucehershenson.com)."},{"Title":"Musical Movie Posters","review":"For lovers of film, film history, and specifically, poster art, Bruce Hershenson's series of full-color books is the cream of the crop!

Truly an Oscar winning performance! The book is printed in good quality paper and images are very clear and of good size on each page. Of course it's impossible to include a poster from every musicals in any given year, but the selections Bruce Hershenson made are excellent.

The most recent surge has been in response to the use of composite materials. Reading the literature one will see that Dr. Dewey Hodges and colleagues have been at the forefront of this new area. They have published many of the seminal works and their theories are amongst the most rigorous. Thus, their work is of very high quality. This book essentially compiles all these contributions into one volume.Another truth about engineering is the law of diminishing returns. A simple and basic theory will describe 90% of the behavior well, double the complexity then you can simulate 95%. The material in this book is on the complex and comprehensive side of things. I recommend this for applications where basic theories break down. Those applications being:+ Where material anisotropy is dominant (e.g. carbon fiber)+ Where various coupling effects are of interest (e.g. elastic bend twist coupling)+ Where geometric nonlinear is important (e.g. geometric bend twist coupling)+ Where high-order effects are important (e.g. warping, shear, Vlasov and trapeze)+ Where accuracy is very important (e.g. force response of a lifting surface)Aside from the practical applications, this book also provides some theoretical insights. The approach taken here departs from that of classical beam theory. The most interesting aspect is in the cross section analysis. Here a variational is developed then simplified through asymptotic analysis. This gives a first approximation to the solution. Second, the next order of terms is included to develop a correction for this approximation. This iterative process continues until one gets the accuracy they desire. The theory also departs in the development for the equations of motion. A Hamiltonian approach is taken using generalized state variables (deformation & momenta) allowing for a geometrically exact compact equations.This book is recommended for graduate students, engineers and scientists working in fields that require the leading edge theory for nonlinear composite beam applications."},{"Title":"Nonlinear Composite Beam Theory for Engineers (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics)","review":"This book gives a method of analysis of beams that is suitable for a wide variety of applications. Beams are defined as slender structural members and may be made of virtually any material. Beams may be very large as in components of buildings, aircraft wings, or bridges, or quite small as in shafts or turbine blades.The theoretical foundations of this book have been inspired largely by research conducted to meet the need for accurate analysis of helicopter rotor blades made of composit materials. Rotor blades are extremely complex beams that must function under a wide variety of conditions and loads. They are also a subject that has received a lot of attention because of Government funding.This book is based on helicoptor rotor analysis, but other beams can be analyzed using the same techniques, and probably somewhat easier because most other beams are significantly simpler in design.This is quite an advanced book. It could be used for a graduate level course in mechanical engineering or more likely for use by a reseacher with real problems to solve."},{"Title":"Prisoners and Pawns","review":"Despite Mister Weinstein's warnings about not having seen any episodes of the series, he still had the framework from both original television series to pull out an entertaining little novel that one could easily see as an episode of the series.

I found Huxley's account of his trip round Guatemala, Mexico and the Caribbean boring. For him, Indians are uncivilized. \\"The village Indian can read, but his mind is so conditioned that he cannot understand what he reads,\\" he says. Still, it seems Huxley doesn't think much of the masses in general; \\"The intrinsic and congenital stupidity of the majority is as great as it ever was. Universal education has created an immmense class of what I may call the New Stupid.\\"After reading this, I would classify Huxley among his ranks of the New Stupid. He states on page 152 that \\"to civilize primitives may be impossible\\". He seems to have been influenced (brainwashed?) by D.H. Lawrence's book The Plumed Serpent. According to Huxley, \\"No-one has ever written more forcibly than Lawrence in The Plumed Serpent of the hopeless squalor and stuffiness of human beings who have not yet reached the spiritual and mental stage of consciousness.\\" In an Indian colonel he sees \\"a profound, hopeless melancholy\\". Huxley's explanation: \\"He had, I suppose, enough of our education to make him aware of his own Indianness.\\"After reading this, I suspect that people like Huxley and Lawrence had reached the stage of hopeless stuffiness, although it's not clear if Huxley shared Lawrence's view, as expressed in vol 3 of the Letters of D.H. Lawrence, that \\"To learn plainly to hate mankind, to detest the spawning human being, that is the only cleanliness now,\\" but it seems he was at least on the way to such a perspective."},{"Title":"Currents from the Dancing River: Contemporary Latino Fiction, Nonfiction, and Poetry","review":"This is a grand collection of writings by some of the best writers, who happen to be latino, in the United States today.These are the tales of an emerging group of people whose experiences are as diverse as the ethnic groups they come from. There are Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Mexicanos, all different , all Americans with a common thread, their Spanish heritage and a new found country. The collection of essays, fiction, non-fiction, excerts from novels and poetry are splendid echoes from the souls of Americans. The cultural differences aside, the homogenous nature of these offerings are in their portrayl of people who want to be recognized for what they are, Americans, who just happen to have different experiences from those in the dominant culture. These experiences give validity to the lives of many who may feel disenfranchised just because they are different. The words are so powerful, so funny, so sad, so real. This book is a favorite of mine to share with students. I read from this book yearly at a read in for middle school children and always get the class thinking, maybe reflective, but always roaring with laughter in the end. The students invariably ask me where I found the book and where could they get a copy. Mine is worn out, like an old glove that fits perfectly after years of use, it is still serviceable, full of dog eared pages but I continue to break it out yearly for the students benefit. What is nice about this book is that it can be read in sections, as the format of short stories lends itself to frequent endings. This is a great collection of writings that will not disapoint, in fact it will inspire you and make you greatful for what you have and who you are.

You can tell they love what they do and they are good at it.I want the same environment for my staff. While we have terrific people in our Group, they just need serious help in the correct way to deliver customer service. This guide provides easy to understand concepts and examples.The only thing I wish was different would be less food focus type advice. (Yes, I know Zingerman's is a food operation) If you're going to write a book on customer service, it would be helpful if it was easier to directly apply examples like \\"x-tra mile\\" ideas to general business.If you're ever in Ann Arbor, be sure to visit Zingermans for the full experience -- it's so worth it!"},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"Zingerman's guide is an outstanding primer on a businesses approach to service.

He attributes his success to vastly superior customer service and wrote this guide to help teach others his \\"secrets.\\"Zingerman's is a hugely popular place to go and when you come to visit this area, that's where you go! It's always packed, the service is impeccable, and the experience is always positive for the customers. Nobody ever has anything bad to say about it. So, it makes sense that Weinzweig, the engine behind this fabulous institution, would be sought-after training on customer service.Though I found the book itself to be a little slow going, the message is one that I think is right on the money. You can't deny him the credit for taking his 1,300-square-feet deli and growing it into this huge business - without turning it into a chain and remaining solely in Ann Arbor! This is an incredible story and there is something there. Anyone interested in learning more about how a small company can accomplish extraordinary things will really enjoy this book.The book could have benefited from some more specific examples - service stories, if you will - but Weinzwig did provide very specific and practical advice on how to deliver better service. The book teaches the keys to better in-person experiences with your clients and that can be useful in all industries. The tips even drill down to such basics as how to be polite, how close to stand to someone when speaking with them in different service situations, and how to answer the phone professionally.One thing I really appreciated, as a business owner, was being reminded that measuring your service performance is really important. How do we measure up today? This week? This month? This year? Did we do better than yesterday? Without measurements, it can be hard to track progress and recognize where you might be dropping the ball.Overall, I thought the book was repetitive, but that's mainly because Weinzwig is so passionate about service he really wants to reinforce the lessons. He loves what he does so much that it just hops off the page to you. It's undeniable...and that's what I ended up taking away from the book.Even more than his commitment to service and the endless hours he's spent studying it, teaching about it, and guaranteeing that his business is run to that higher standard, his passion is what has led to his success. He hasn't written a book about passion, but that is the lasting message of his story.Loving what you do will make you more successful and make you feel more successful and people - employees and customers - will want to be around that! That enthusiasm is probably an even bigger factor in Zingerman's success than the service. And we could all use more lessons in that!"},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"A refreshing approach to running a business and how to provide top-notch customer service.

Zingerman's is an instititution in Ann Arbor and this book gives us the secrets behind the success -- great service.After reading this book, I can see exactly where other businesses fail -- lack of eye contact, slow service, not being open to suggestions.I hope Zingerman's comes to Boston (where I live now), and I hope all the business in my area, buy and read this book.Sincerely,Terry Burnham"},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"After purchasing Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating, a wonderfully informative book about cheese, bread, olive oil, chocolate and many other artisan foods, I had high hopes for this book. On the positive side, it contains many excellent ideas on providing truly distinguished customer service, which are presented in a succinct, easy-to-read style. However, this book would have been more compelling if the author had illustrated these ideas with specific examples of how Zingerman's staff have provided superior service to customers or how they have handled difficult or unusual situations with customers. On the very last page of the book, Mr. Weinzweig writes: \\"Tell service stories. The knowledge of things that staffers do to provide guests with great service needs to be shared. People like to hear stories.\\" Too bad that he didn't take his own advice when putting this book together."},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"I am an unabashed Zingerman's devotee. A friend of mine introduced me to the Deli more than twenty years ago and it immediately became my standard by which all other Deli's are judged. It is a very high bar.Over the years, the Deli has done ever more interesting things. Making its own bread, improving the meats and cheeses as well the best of the world's artisan vinegars and olive oils. What was once just the Deli has grown into a community of businesses. You can read all about them and all they offer at www.zingermans.com.This book tells the story of one of the three Zingerman's bottom lines (Great Food, Great Service, Great Finance) and how it relates to the other two. If you are interested in business and how it works this is a fascinating book because the story it tells is so clear that it is a wonder so many miss it. The answer has something to do with the fact that this is not a recipe book about how to do this and that with a pinch of something else to succeed. This is very much a book of principles, beliefs, and how they translate into action. Ari and Paul declare affirmatively that the experience their companies provide for their employees is the kind of experience their employees will provide the customers.How many businesses are willing to live up to that? I wish more would.If you have ever been to a Zingerman's company you likely had a great time. While the food was great, just being there was even better. If you have gone enough times, you probably experienced a time where something didn't go as well as you had hoped. Maybe it was a terrible experience. If you let anyone know you were unhappy, you probably experienced an overwhelming effort to make it a great experience and they let you know, many times, how grateful they were you spoke up.They were serious. They want you to tell them if your experience was great or less than you had hoped. They want you so happy that you can't wait to get back to one of their stores or eateries. Go ahead, take them up on it!And that is the kind of spirit that fills every Zingerman's company. Their service level is asymmetrical. That is, no matter how much you give as a customer, the service level makes you feel so appreciated and special that you feel like it is gift. It works.So, read the book. Think about it and challenge yourself and your company to do better.Oh, and I also recommend taking the ZingTrain classes. They are quite a bargain for what you get and this book will come alive for you.http://www.zingtrain.com/"},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"Really creative, practical and efficient.

For many year I have enjoyed their great food and great service. As a buniness man, Ari is a great one. When Zinggy's was a little store they made millions.

Author Ari Weinzweig has the credentials to deliver first-hand advice since he actually worked at the counter of Zingerman's Delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan (and is the co-founder of its group of eight businesses). We recommend this jazzy little book and the restaurant, with its good reputation and good food. It's also as expensive as any famous deli in Manhattan, which - coupled with great service - could explain how it expanded. Who can argue with success? Weinzweig's book, which is very literate despite its purple cartoons, covers the tactics he used to cultivate customers and to encourage staffers to deliver great service. He examines the obvious features of memorable service. And, in the course of retracing the basics, he often provides new insights and refreshing ideas about making customers feel special. Small business owners, service managers and human resource managers and staffers should all order a copy. Read it with a side of slaw and a big dill pickle to get the full effect."},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"Attention. This is a review of the audio not the book. The packaging of this CD leads one to believe that it is really going to be good. The content is good. But I suggest you just buy the book. The author reads his book in the most monotonous tone ever given on an audio book. I am thinking of asking for a refund. It is disturbing that a book that focuses on customer service does just the opposite by having it read so poorly. It would have taken so little effort to have had someone else read the book well. Note to non-fiction publishers: if you are reading this, please stop having your authors read their books on CD unless they are outstanding orators."},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"All I have to say is that this book teaches all there is to know about customer service: the customer is your business.

He practices what he preaches."},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"I listened to the audiobook and I wasn't really impressed. I was expecting a new approach to customer service but much of the advice was common sense: Be nice to customers, exceed their expectations, etc, etc. I guess the unique thing about their approach was they took a lot of time to put their plan in writing and execute it.I also thought the audiobook was extremely boring without any life or excitement. The author, who did the reading, seemed like he wasn't very excited by his approach. I felt like I was in a college classroom being taught by a uninterested professor. I got the impression that the audiobook was just another way to generate revenue for the Zingerman brand. I suspect Zingerman's has a unique product niche and great customer service is a by product of it. Now they're presenting great customer service as if that's why they are so successful. They should have skipped the audiobook because there are charts and other illustrations that couldn't be captured in the audiobook and the author who did the reading did a poor job."},{"Title":"Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service: Treating Your Customers Life Royalty","review":"Easy to read with good examples.

The book refers to the Zingerman's group of business located in Ann Arbor MI, which are service based businesses. But, with a little thought and creativity the lessons taught in this book can easily translate to other, non-service, businesses. Additionally, there a few references in the book to systems and forms that Zingerman's has used successfully for years.

How did a mystical French priest, Father Joseph, become a leading politican and war leader during the 17th century? What are the perils of bringing intense religious beliefs into earthly politics? How did this modest monk, who considered wearing shoes a sin, inspire King Louis XIII to continue a war that lead to millions of deaths?Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World and Doors of Perception, wrote this complex biography of Father Joseph while German bombs were being dropped on London and he was a Hollywood screenwriter. A committed pacifist and spiritual seeker, Huxley sought to understand the barbarism of Nazi Germany and offer a parable for his own relucance to get involved in World War II br tracing the tragic career of a hermit turned Forign Minister. Father Joseph, according to Huxley, was born to be on the side on angels, but found himself hated as warmonker and religious fanatic. Sensitive souls, Huxley warns, should not be forced into public affairs because they destroy their higher selves and place impossible demands on mere mortals.As always with the polyglot philosopher, Huxley's poignant narrative illuminates the connections between history, theology, and psycholgy. Armed with a lethal wit, Huxley brings this forgotten religious leader to life with absorbing details and shocking absurdities. A compelling, if disturbing, biography to read as the Christian Right continues to grow in influence and power. Can you get Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed to read this?"},{"Title":"Grey Eminence: A Study in Religion and Politics (CN82K)","review":"Aldous Huxley's little book &quot;Grey Eminence&quot; has the brilliance of the protracted essay, brevity of the vast historical exposition and the breath of coverage which embraces 400 years of recent European History. &quot;Grey Emmince&quot; is a spiritual and historical biography of Franois Le Clerc du Tremblay, a French nobleman of the 17th century who as a Capuchin monk became a contemplative, advanced enough in the world of spirituality to became a founding farther of a new monastic order. At the same time he was a right-hand man and a designated successor of Cardinal Richelieu. As Huxley claims, Farther Joseph's policies contributed to the protraction of 30 year war and immeasurable suffering of the population the Holy Roman Empire whose lands were devastated during this generation-long war.Father Joseph is thus an enigmatic figure. A man of God and an original power politician. How is that possible? According to Huxley, father Joseph was able to convince himself of the doctrine of the divine rights of Kings and of the divine origin of the French monarchy in particular. What was good for France was desired by God. And more, if the acts of power politician are practiced together &quot;active annihilation&quot; of those acts in the contemplation of divine Godhead, then they attain a moral power and meaning. Curious doctrine, but perhaps not so distant of the realities of the contemporary power politics.Huxley historical exposition on which background the biography is plaid out are vivid, interesting and accurate. Huxley also devotes some time to the compare and contrast of Catholic contemplative practices of the time of the Counter-Reformation and modern Buddhist practices (which the author himself indulged in). This will be of interest to the modern reader, one would hope.The conclusion of the story of Father Joseph is bittersweet. At end power politics destroyed the former contemplative life, and the union with God became more and more problematic. And so the partise of active annihilation, and thus justification for the actions of the politician. He became one of the most hated people in Europe of his generation. At the same time, if one looks at the achievements of the &quot;Grey Eminence&quot; France was actually much better off for it.At the end it is appropriate to quote pope Urban VIII who said the following about Richelieu - &quot;If there is a God, Cardinal Richelieu will have much to answer for. If not, he has done very well&quot;."},{"Title":"Grey Eminence: A Study in Religion and Politics (CN82K)","review":"Who is actually interested in the obscure Christian mystical practices and depressing court intrigues of 17th century France? I certainly wasn't, until I picked up this book. I've read quite a few of Huxley's books but I really thought this was the best, rather surprisingly, as \\"Brave New World\\" and others I found to be incredibly good.'Grey Eminence' follows the life of the French Father Joseph, a Capuchin monk and mystic until circumstance (and perhaps his own vicarious lust for power) drew him into the power politics of the 30 Years' War in Europe. Working essentially as the lackey for the powerful and heartless Cardinal Richelieu (or perhaps as his puppetmaster, as this book shows), Father Joseph remained a monk to the last, eating one meal a day and basically walking all over Europe (and barefoot!) to accomplish his intrigues and lay seige to various strongholds of heathenism (as Pere Joseph perceived it, at least). If only all history could be written so well, I'd be reading a lot more of it.However, above and beyond the history (very well done) and biography (also excellent), the themes Huxley brings up throughout the book fascinating and tie in very well with much of his life's work. A central idea is the Christian mystic practice of \\"active annihilation,\\" that is, destroying one's own will utterly so that one acts merely as an instrument or conduit for God's (or ultimate reality's, as Huxley prefers to look at it) will or intention. This idea is examined magnificently - its ultimate benefits if successful (Huxley considers such an attainment the highest form of spiritual realization, and makes a good case for this assertion) and its horrible, horrible consequences if unsuccessful (with the life of Father Joseph as a case study in this kind of failure). Pere Joseph's mistake was to assume that France, too, was but an instrument of God's will - and therefore anything he could do to increase and maintain French hegemony, and by implication to ruin and destroy its competitors, was God's will. Big mistake, as Huxley so sympathetically points out. Father Joseph's and Richelieu's policies greatly exacerbated the 30 Years' War and led directly (and indirectly) to untold suffering not only of France's enemies, but its own people. Rape, pillage, destruction, cannabalism, and so on...If I'm not mistaken this book was written during WWII (published, it says, in 1944) and it can also be seen not only as a parallel of that contemporary madness, but as Huxley's Apology for his own reluctance to engage in politics and the war. Huxley, we can assume, is Father Joseph the younger, a well-intentioned mystic seeking to align himself with the true will or purpose of this universe. Humbly admitting that he has not nearly arrived at that point, Huxley defends the idea, in this long parable, that one who believes unflinchingly that right is on their side and acts with this resolve (not to mention deafness to criticism) will only sow hatred and misery in the world --- unless (a big if), they truly have achieved active annihilation.The prose shines here, the people come alive, and the insights and arguments (as above) are intriguing reading. It's great to see this appears to be still in print. Highly recommended. In fact this book is so good I wanted to steal it from the library of the monastery I borrowed it from and just let them keep my 'lost book deposit' - as I feel though that I haven't quite completely 'actively annihilated' my own will, it's probably best to stick to conventional morality for now and just return it!"},{"Title":"Grey Eminence: A Study in Religion and Politics (CN82K)","review":"Who is actually interested in the obscure Christian mystical practices and depressing court intrigues of 17th century France?

It's a crying shame that there are people in our society that will put their ignorance out there for all the world to see.A previous reviewer made the comment that the publisher had made a typo by misspelling the name of one of Santa's reindeer. If this reviewer had not been so arrogant, they would have checked their facts.The original poem, \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore, although the claim has also been made that it was written by Henry Livingston, Jr., was the first time that the concept of Santa's reindeer being named. And in the original poem the poet does in fact name one the reindeer Donder.If it was an error, and not literary license the error was made by lyricist Johnny Mars, who wrote the song Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or Gene Autry who recorded the song and has been perpetuated for 51 years. In his lyrics he used the name Donner and not Donder as in the original poem."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This is an inexpensive, but beautiful book.

My expectations were not super high, but when I opened the package, WOW! This is a georgeous book and the AniMotion was totally, unexpectedly impressive. This Christmas book will be used all year round as my 6-year-old is always asking for it. Price for value? -- I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"Sticking closely to the text as originally published, Spirin retells the familiar old poem that we all know and love. The use of \\"Dunder and Blixem\\" instead of \\"Donder\\" or \\"Donner\\" and \\"Blitzen\\" may be strange for some people since the newer names are much more familiar in popular culture. But otherwise, the book is what you remember.The illustrations are very beautiful and intricate. Each page is really a work of art. Besides the main pictures, there are also emblems on every other page. These are small, Christmas-themed designs that have all sorts of fun detail.My only gripe is that the poem is supposed to be the recounting of Santa's visit by the family's patriarch, but the drawings clearly show a young boy watching Santa with wonder. The disconnect is lost on the children reading the story, I'm sure, but I found it a perpetuation of an incorrect reinterpretation of the poem.Even still, so what? The story is classic, the drawings are beautiful, and the book binding is sturdy. You won't go wrong with this version of The Night Before Christmas."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This was not a \\"special\\" Night Before Christmas book....and I have seenmany that are.

I would not buy thisbook again...or recommend it."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"i was looking fo the version I had when I was a kid with beautiful illustrations -- the cover on this one looked close so I got it. Well, what we have here is a good artist who paints Santa as if he was a bit tipsy. Honest to goodness: Sleepy-eyed, a bit dopey looking, rummy? I don't think my daughter notices but it bothers me.Also, the poem is very specific and little children look for that same specificity to be IN THE ILLUSTRATIONS. Not here. While Santa is still being whisked to the top of the wall by his coursers, the picture shows him already on the roof, off the sleigh --next page he is back on the sleigh. That sort of stuff throughout the book which my daughter picked up immediately. The story is pretty simple and well-known, its not like it needs a college professor to explain what is going on and what the scene is. So how does the artist forget the ashes, soot, and the pipe?"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"Jan Brett does a great job with an old favorite.

They LOVED it! I had to do a little happy dance.A lot of people seem to be complaining that the book can't tell what page it is on, keeps repeating page one, ect... If you actually RTFM, it says the book must be in a well-lit room. Along the inside of the page there is a row of holes, with each consecutive page having one more hole than the last. After the last page there are light sensors, and the number of sensors detecting light is how the book determines the page. The book doesn't need it to be super bright, but it does need constant light. My overhead light worked fine, but if you trying walking to a different room the book will get confused. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, just a little patience.The battery compartment is secured with a small screw, and any small to medium Philips screwdriver can open it. It took me about 30 minutes to record the book, and I read every page 2-5 times.Overall a great product, and I will be purchasing the others for future birthdays / Christmas. Just remember that it detects the current page by light and you shouldn't have any issues."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I loved the retro pictures displayed in this version of The Night Before Christmas. I watched my 2 year old granddaughter and her 4 year old brother's eyes light up with delight as I read and they starred at the pictures! Santa and his 8 reindeer are quaint. Santa is just plain adorable. The children so sweet! I highly recommend this version to all Grandma's and Grandpa's!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"Do not buy this product. I guess I was too excited thinking about my grand children getting to hear grandma and grandpa's voice reading them the story for Christmas that I did not read the reviews. What a piece of junk. I recorded the first book and it seemed to record fine. My husband and I listened to the whole story after we recorded it and were very satisfied. We boxed it up and shipped it off to Florida from California. My son and daughter in law finally got the book to play after very much manipulating the pages but how is a child supposed to do that? The second book we could not even get it to record properly after resetting the book twice. It would not read on some pages, and read page 4 when you were on page 6. Amazon was nice enough to refund my money and I called the publisher to lodge a formal complaint. My next step is the BBB and Facebook. Anyone who bought this crap should Google the publisher, and call their own complaint in. This made my Christmas not as nice as it should have been. I am going to try and purchase this book from Hallmark who state they publish it themselves and do not have many returns. I hope theirs is better than this crap because the concept is fabulous."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"thankfully I bought this at the holiday special price as it is not worth the $6.

They both sat on my lap and it was just as I had wanted it to be. They got distracted about two thirds of the way through and I was OK with that. I'd like to make it a tradition. We'll see. The art work in the book is nice but for small children it is busy and difficult at times to pick out all of the detail. Than is hard to see till you have the book in hand."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This was a great value buy. There are illustrations on most pages. They are a little smaller than I would have desired, but my kids were captivatied by the details in the illustrations.

Everyone seems to have their own take on this classic poem! The reason I love this one is that it is so delightfully kid-friendly. The illustrator has managed to infuse the book with such a sense of coziness it literally begs to be read all snug under a warm blanket on a dark snowy night. All of the sparkly things in the pictures have been overlaid with glitter, giving the snow, tree garland, and the stars in the night sky a twinkle along with a texture that kids will love to run their hands over.All of the pictures are brightly colored, and the mice characters are very expressive, from Santa wisely smoking his pipe, to a young mouse's curiosity as he peeks over the stairwell. Even though these characters are mice, they remain true to the poem. Mama is still in her kerchief, and Dad is in his cap. This is a very nice version for families with very young children. Save all those artistic and pretentious versions (beautiful as they may be), and stick with this fun one. Your kids will love it. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"The book overall is very good. The illlustrations are great. However, two of the animotion pictures did not work.

The animation in the book is really cute!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"Why buy yet another copy of Clement C. Moore's Christmas classic? Look for something different from a great illustrator. Christopher Wormell offers gorgeous yet simple, beautifully shaded woodcut scenes that leap off these pages. If you have seen Wormell's alphabet book, you will know that the reindeer are a highlight. If you like warm, clean, brightly-colored pictures, you will want to own this \\"Night before Christmas\\". The varying sizes and styles of print are interesting as well. A truly unique addition to a Christmas tradition."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I bought this for nieces who are just three years old.

We own several versions of this story, from picture books, to pop-ups, to sesame street characters, but this version is the one we read on Christmas Eve.The pencil drawings are beautifully detailed, and the combination of the artwork applied to the original text of the poem, really give the story back some of it's old world charm. Even the size and texture of the book (Oversized hardcover with fabric-like binding) give it the feel of tradition.Definitely worth adding this version of a classic story to your holiday library."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I saw this book in a grocery store but got it for a much better price, even with the shipping, from this site.I thought it would be nice to start a yearly tradition of reading this classic story on Christmas Eve.We could have probably downloaded it for free, or borrowed a copy from the local library -- a rather good idea considering that every dollar counts these days -- but the \\"Animotion\\" was so appealing we thought it would be worth an actual purchase.And we were right! There is a moving image on nearly every page, and each of them are fantastic. Our son is five years old and absolutely loved it. I recommend this version as worthy modern version of a timeless classic (the wording of the poem itself is unchanged as far as I know, the \\"update\\" is simply the technology that gives the images their life). The cover is lovely and the artwork, even the pages without the holo stuff, is quite beautiful. Very well done.A wonderful book to read with your loved ones . . ."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This book is simply a beautiful thing. The illustrations bring Clement Moore's poetic story to brilliant life. Santa, the elves, the reindeer all seem so real one begins to feel like one is flying through the night sky with twinkling stars right with them. I never realized before what a perfect poem is Mr. Moore's. Not one word ill-chosen, not one phrase that doesn't belong, it glides along to the finale of the story. One only wishes one could return to the North Pole with this entourage, and that the book would keep on going.The illustrations are truly breathtaking. We again have the Jan Brett trademark of the framing of her illustrations, done so naturally that the framework seems to be part of the story and pictures as well. I especially love her depiction of the marvelous reindeer - all so spirited and intent on their purpose.Though they say nary a word, there are two stowaway elves on this nighttime sky journey. They assist in the packing and the distributing of various and sundry colorful gifts (into stockings, of course, waiting by the chimney to be filled). Oh what happy children there will be in the morning. Santa and his helpers, the elves, did their work well.I can't think of a more perfect gift for any child age four to eight at Christmastime, or any other time for that matter, than this lovely, lovely book."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I have several versions of this wonderful old tale---even those saved from my own childhood. But when I saw this for sale at Union Station, I had to have it. The illustrations are breathtaking! Look for the shadows that Mr Spirin, a prize winning Russian artist, paints into his scenes. Have you ever seen the underneath of Santa's richy embellished sleigh as it is \\"parked\\" on a rooftop? Look for the cats who are also coming downstairs to \\"see what was the matter\\". My kids are teens now, but I bought it for them for when they have kids. It is the very essence of the Spirit of Santa's yearly wintertime journey!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This book is by far the most colorful, beautiful to look at, and detailed of any we have found for the Night Before Christmas.

This will probably be a great stocking-stuffer for one of your children, or maybe a clever table card for everyone attending your Christmas Eve dinner; a hanging bookmark with someone's name will add to the beauty of the table set before the guests. You might even slide a thin festive cord around the book, and hang it as an ornament on your family Christmas Tree; I did just that!The illustrations look Victorian, and the text is done in calligraphy.

Having written Ms. Brett a letter a few years ago, I was excited to relize that my sister's name is also included. Putting 2+2 together, I relized that smattered throughout the book were hundreds of names of children, most likely fans who wrote Ms. Brett.

It's poor battered body disappeared some time after the last of my little ones went off into the adult world. I am so delighted to see it back again, though this time as a nicely affordable soft cover. Clement C. Moore's enchanting story poem already provides an atmosphere filled with warmth and joyful expectation and with the addition of Tasha Tudor's quaint, nostalgic water-colors from an antique New England the Christmas magic is complete!The winter landscapes fill our senses and Tasha's own gray tabby cat and Welsh Corgi welcome us into this charming world.Tasha's Santa that you will meet in this book has been portrayed as the poem describes him...a right jolly old elf. He's not that much larger than the corgi and his team really consists of eight &quot;tiny&quot; reindeer. His pointy ears and his Eskimo mukluks add to the delightful ambiance of the book. He dances with the toys and with the happy animals and we can truly believe it will be a happy Christmas for all.I hope this book becomes a Christmas Eve tradition for many, many more families."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"As I always read the reviews before I buy something, I was so surprised when I received this book the other day and it was not at all what I expected. Of course the story is great, but the quality of the book is atrocious. The cover pictures are stickers! The back cover sticker that tells about the story is already peeling off. I guess being an heirloom edition and the high reviews led me to expect more. I have fairly realistic expectations when it comes to books, and even a dust cover over a plain cover would have been fine, but this is just cheesy and I will be returning it.

The main pictures don't match the story, and the illustrations that do go with the words are shown in the small side panes.

Part of that love was looking at beautiful pictures with words written in such a way to enhance the story telling.But, in being 'kindle-ized' part of the enjoyment is lost as so much of the experience does depend on illustrations and formatting. The introductory text describes the illustrations in loving detail, but needless to say, they are not well depicted on the non-color eInk display. Turning the orientation to landscape and enlarging the font helps, but that can only do so much. The words themselves are just 'there', no artistry into their placement on the pages.Oh well, it was what I expected, not a fabulous choice for a Kindle version. I did appreciate the introductory commentary however as it was a nice (and brief) look into to the background of the original author, Clement Moore.Overall, nice to have, but not a great Kindle book, hence the three stars. This is a keeper but in tree book form. In my case, the 99 cents was worthwhile, but not something I would automatically recommend to others.JTGEDITED TO ADD 12/18/11--it appears Amazon has gone and done some 'lumping' again. When I wrote this review it was only associated with the Kindle version, and now sadly it is in with all the other versions. I gave it three stars based on the Kindle formatting. I have seen many gorgeous illustrated versions that deserve a full 5 stars (PLUS) given the wonderful poem and beautiful production. I've also seen cheap paper versions with adequate drawings I'd give 4 stars to. I leave my 3 stars where they are as there is no way to distinguish versions the way they are now lumped. Suffice to say the poem is timeless and wonderful but it is the various production quality in terms of paper, manufacturer and, of course, artwork, that make this a 'total' package type read. Please look for a beautiful paper version (or a Kindle version that has better artwork and can be read on the Fire or a Kindle app).Edited again 1/3/13---Just to be clear, the poem/story is a 5 star one when beautifully illustrated. The Kindle version (Amazon's Children's Digital Publishing, December 2009) is the 3 star version."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"What a beautiful book!

Betraying the golden rule -- If it isn't broken, don't fix it -- Brett inserts in to additional characters. Nearly a third of the book features two unnamed elves who play with the toys and generally cause havoc on the roof as Santa fills the stockings.Instead of enhancing Clement Moore's poem, the illustrations scream for attention. The effect drowns out the lyrical quality of this classic story. Often on facing pages you are bombarded with two full-page illustrations bookended by six additional panels, three on each side. Your eyes can only skip and stutter across the pages or risk losing any semblance of a storyteller's cadence.This book was especially disappointing because earlier during that same bedtime reading session we enjoyedChristmas Magicby Sue Stainton and illustrated by Eva Melhuish. That book is an excellent example of how the marriage of story and illustrations can work magic for children.I wrote a 5-star review for a beautiful version of Clement Moore'sThe Night Before Christmasillustrated by Douglas W. Gorsline and recommend you buy that book instead. Don't give up hunting for an out-of-print copy, if necessary.

There are options to watch the movie in it's entirety or read the story yourself with the words that come up along with pictures...my son really enjoys this option as well as watching the movie; complete with the Santa in the sleigh that flies up to the rooftop, and then continues on his way to the other homes.

There are so many pull outs, like a naughty and nice list, a letter to Santa, a letter FROM Santa, snowflakes, etc...Not only are the pages gorgeous, but they are filled with things like presents, sugarplums, candy canes, Santa and his reindeer, toys, wreaths, stockings, etc...Lastly, I'm very picky about what Santa looks like in books, because let's face it...sometimes they make Santa look scary and creepy, but not this book!

My parents read it to me as a child and then I read it each year as I was growing up, cherishing it as a tradition, like my favorite Christmas carols.Over the years I've seen many versions. The illustrations by Jane Daniell are works of art, sure to become classics. They are so rich in detail! I was sucked into each illustration, fascinated by the mood of each and her obvious love of the holiday. I notice something else each time I look! I love the details, like the girl looking at the tree ornaments while keeping her prized teddy bear in tow. I'm a cat lover, so I was delighted with all the wonderful cats I found peeking out; and the sweet sleeping mice! I loved all the rich decorations, good food cooking, candle light, and the homey feel. Added to that were the elves, visions of sugar plums, shop windows, and the vision of Santa with his elves on the sleigh making their rounds!I bought this book for myself, to have a beautiful version of the poem to enjoy each holiday season. I'm not yet lucky enough to have grandchildren, but you can be sure this book will be shared with them every year when I do! LOVED IT and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This is a beautiful version of the classic poem. The illustrations are amazing.

I read it to him and he points out things in the pictures. Very nice!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I bought a used copy of this book, Hardcover 1999 edition, from a seller on Amazon for a great price! It came without a dust jacket, but the description from the seller was right on, and it was beautiful and like new inside.The book has beautifully painted illustrations inside, and was truly wonderful to look at. I will admit, however, the other reviewers claims of \\"scary Santa\\" are partly true. There's a closeup shot of Santa winking that looks kinda odd, and when he comes down the chimney, the angle makes him look almost super villian-y. My 2 year old daughter didn't seem to mind either of these, however, and thoroughly enjoyed having the book read to her. The almost photo-realistic illustrations helped her to realize that Santa filling the stockings in the book looked just like our stockings, and a little more of how Christmas and Santa works \\"clicked\\" with her. Was a very cool moment :)As far as those saying the reindeer were scary with \\"rolling eyes\\"... like I said, it's almost got a photo realistic painting style about it, and if you've ever been around animals such as horses or deer, you know the expressions they make, especially if something kinda spooks them (said scene in book is the reindeers crashing through autumn leaves). It's not scary or wierd, and I thought the depictions of the reindeer were awesome (and one of my daughter's favorites).Overall, I am very happy with this book, and it will be something I can share with my child for years to come!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I have a 2 year old son and I really want to start some Christmas traditions with him. I originally was looking for a classic pop-up version to this book, hoping to find some beautiful illustrations and pull outs/flaps that he would adore for years to come. It looks like the classic pop-ups are phased out (I only found non-traditional versions in pop-up format)This book is wonderful! The illustrations are vivid and traditional, and the binding is durable. The animotion is a bit dark, but that is ok, as it is detailed and there are some on almost every page. I plan to read this with my son every Christmas eve and store it with my Christmas decorations (unfortunately it will not survive on my son's bookshelf LOL).Great deal at $11 with free shipping- the book was original priced for $18!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"This is a good quality book, with pleasant illustrations, but the \\"AniMotion\\" takes away from the quality.

I'm so glad I found it! I love its authenticity. The illustrations are so incredibly beautiful! Tavares' drawings are full of light and magic. Most other versions I saw were so overly colorful, busy, and comical that the illustrations overwhelmed the text. In this version, the illustrations draw me into the text and make me realize how truly beautiful the words are too. The combination makes for a soothing bedtime story.

After dinner Christmas eve turn out all the lights, light a few candles and have someone read The Night Before Christmas with lots of feeling, it will be special. I feel this bright red book IS Christmas to be read every year. The print is large enough for candle light."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"I'm now on a fifth edition of this poem and, to keep them straight, the ISBN of each edition is at the start of its review. The first review, of'Twas the Night Before Christmas (Candy Cane Books)began with a sentence I'm going to copy and paste here: While there's no question that the original poem by Clement Moore is a five star piece of work, there are so many versions of this poem in print that any review has to be of the entire book, with more weight on the illustrations, the only difference between them. I suggest potential customers pay attention to which reviews apply to which book, as there's quite a difference in quality.The classic poem, wherein the narrator hears noise on the lawn on Christmas Eve and, responding to it, sees Santa in his sleigh land on the roof, come down the chimney, etc. The narrator, the father of the family, watches Santa place gifts under the tree and, when done, hop in his sleigh and fly away.ISBN 0785313648 - (3 stars) The cover illustration, by Linda Graves, is the best of the lot here. The illustrations inside the book, by Susan Spellman, are average and some are even a bit clumsy. You should certainly have a copy of Moore's poem on hand - there's no childhood complete without it! - but this is not the most worthwhile version out there.ISBN 158845374x - (4 stars) - Part of the Santa's Little Library of Christmas Stories series. This is a very small book, and the story is quite abridged. At 2 x 2 inches, it's great for small hands and fingers and is a wonderful introduction to the longer poem. The illustrations are very cute - the enormous open mouths accompanying \\"I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.\\" cracked me up!ISBN 0307637506 - (5 stars) Illustrator Cyndy Szekeres and Golden Books measure up to the standard set by Moore. Szekeres's family is one of mice, which always makes for some fun illustrations. The \\"wreath\\" on the family's door is one leaf and one holly berry; the parents' bed is a sardine can; Santa sits on a single die to review his list and the endtable is a thread spool while a large family photo has a locket for a frame. These little touches of whimsy are fun and cute. All ages love the poem, children in particular will love the mice and their adorable adapted furnishings.ISBN 0307119564 - (3 stars) Illustrators Greg and Tim Hildebrandt did an okay job, just nothing special. The Santa on the cover looks a little bug-eyed, which makes him seem to be leering... which, in turn, makes it an unattractive cover. The inside illustrations are on the old-fashioned side, and they complement the poem well. The detail is nice and the decorated tree is one of the best images - although the decorations on the tree change from page to page. Not bad, just not the best.ISBN 1556702744 - (5 stars) Joyce Patti's illustrations, paired with the unique 3D shadow box pages set this edition apart. The book is small, about 5\\" x 5\\" and just over 1/2\\" thick, which makes it a good take along book, but the delicate-ness of the shadow boxes makes it a poor choice for a child to handle much. As each page is opened, the shadow box will pop up and display a beautiful, multi-layered image. The images are small but remarkably detailed. The trick, by the way, is to make sure you're holding the page edges down with your right thumb, or the effect is lost. A nice presentation of a classic.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas, The (Wee Books for Wee Folk)","review":"Everyone must have a copy of \\"The Night Before Christmas\\"!

I looked through a copy I found at warehouse store, and sure enough they had edited out the part of how St. Nick's pipe was blowing smoke wreaths round his head. I'm sure there are those who will argue with me about the PC of editing this piece out since smoking is bad for you, but I am equally sure that there are those out there who believe that there are certain classics that should be left alone, and that the parenting of children should be left to the parent. So if you are a parent or grand parent who loves this classic &#34;as is&#34;, who believes it's not going to send kids into a smoking frenzy, who believe that the Cookie Monster's love of cookies will not create vegetable-hating-cookie-addicted children, and are tired of being treated like complete idiots who cannot be trusted to raise their children properly, then you will love this age-old version.

I wanted a book that I could read to my son (5 mths currently) for his first Christmas (yes I am thinking ahead!) and that I could start a tradition on Christmas Eve, we could cosy up by the Christmas Tree and read, but nothing caught my eye, I read the previous reviews and decided on this book. I thought it would be a standard sized book and fairly decent at the for the price...

First where I think there probably was pictures they wrote words, I'm guessing to describe the pictures, right in the middle of the poem which is distracting.

However there are many typos, including double capital letters at the beginning of nearly every sentence. The spacing between paragraphs is large and leaves one and a half paragraphs on every page.

Until a couple of years ago when I really took it seriously (was tired of losing) I didn't know why my sister (who always won) would tell me I was wrong when I said \\"had just settled down for a long winter's nap\\". This version has the correct \\"had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap\\". I'm wondering if the clatter rose or arose now since this version uses rose instead of arose. The ending in this version however is the updated \\"Merry Christmas\\" instead of the original \\"Happy Christmas\\". Still wonderful to have it on my kindle for free.

However, as is again typical of the AT guides, the scope is quite ambitious, as is the content. The pieces are rare and pricey, and there is too great a variety at the expense of thoroughness. It's a good book for getting a basic range of the different price levels and styles of artists and manufacturers, but if you want to seriously collect or deal in any specific pottery line, you'd do better to find a book devoted to that particular pottery."},{"Title":"Prehistoric men; (Chicago Natural History Museum Popular series: Anthropology)","review":"Men first became men when evolution has carried them to a certain point.

You could spend a bunch of time rounding up the maps to navigate the Colorado outback, but you'd still be shooting blind in many ways. Not only does Charles Wells give you detailed and accurate directions, he clues you in to the difficult spots on the trails and offers you advice on how to surmount them. This book picks up where Volume 1 of his Colorado guide leaves off, and between the two books, every trail worth \`wheeling in Colorado is documented. The only ones excluded are those that might have been opened after the book was published and a couple of the most hellish that are best left to rock buggies. As is usual for Wells, the book is easy to carry, easy to use and as accurate as a sharpshooter's rifle. I've four-wheeled Colorado extensively and when the opportunity came to review this book for a magazine story, I figured I could give this book a thorough &quot;test drive.&quot; I did, and it passed with flying colors. It actually got to the point where I left all my other printed navigation aids behind when I went \`wheeling in Colorado and simply threw in my dog-eared copies of Colorado Backroads and 4-wheel Drive Trails, volumes 1 and 2. Consider these &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for a useful guide to the Colorado \`wheeling hotspots."},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"I planned my entire Colorado vacation around the information in this book. It allowed me to see the Colorado that is not visible from the highway. The author's advice and trail difficulty ratings gave me the opportunity to explore a great number of ghost towns in a time frame that would not have otherwise been possible. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering leaving the road to see the real Colorado."},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"&quot;Colorado Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails&quot; is a must-have for 4-wheeling enthusiasts heading into the back country of Colorado. Charles Welles is a conscientous author that provides a &quot;no surprises&quot; description of Colorado trails. The desription of trails in this book have proven very accurate in my trips to Colorado trails. This book gives the reader a great awareness of the trail conditions and hazards. Charles Welles adds historical information and scenic attributes valuable for trail selection. The only improvement would be Mr. Welles leading the way!"},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"I wasn't sure whether to order volume 1 or 2.

We've used the Moab book as well as the original Colorado book, and we greatly appreciate them all."},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"Wow what a thrill ride Chucks new book provided us this past summer. I have been using his books for 7 Years and have found all of them have given me an opportunity to learn and not to get in over my head by progressively working my way up the ladder of difficulty. We used our new Jeep Rubicon and drove most of the Hardest Difficult Trails in the New Northern Book. As usual Chuck is completly accurate on what to expect and has one well prepared for what is encountered. We especially liked the Miller Rock, Plane Crash and IronClad trails and feel that all of them will provide plenty of excitement for even the most experienced 4-Wheeler. I constantly look forward to each new book or revision since great new challenging drives are relealed. I plan to retire in the next couple of years and will spend most of each summer driving the trails in all of Chucks books. The new Northers Colorado revision should be in Every ones 4-wheeler when driving in Colorado."},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"Charles A Wells does it again. This guide as well as his others I have is a must for your four-wheeling adventure. It has all you need to know when planning an excursion or just fun finding out what's in your area. The GPS coordinates are especially useful for finding parking areas and leading you down the right trail. My ageing eyes also enjoy the bright maps and larger print.

We started with Charlies book of So. Colorado with the easy and Lower Medium difficulty trails. This past summer we used his newest book for the Northern Colorado Trails a great deal. We now like the challenge of the hardest trails in all of his books, and have purchased a highly modified Jeep Rubicon Unlimited to be better able to meet some of the difficult challenges found on these trails. Several of the more difficult trails in the Northern Colorado Book (Miller Rock, and Plane Crash for example) will provide plenty of challenge for most 4-Wheel Drivers. What we like abouth this book and all of Charlies books is that the trail descriptions are very accurate and tell you where the difficult spots are. With the addition of the GPS coordinates it is now difficult to get lost. We would not attempt a trail with out one of his guide books to show us the way, a lot of these trails are difficult and can be dangerous so we like to be able to know what to expect B-4 hand. This or any of his books are a good investment.Paul Robbins"},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"Although we had lived in Colorado for 10 years and had traveled all over the state, I don't think we really saw the magnificence of the state until we bought our first book by Charles Wells and started exploring the backroads of Colorado. It is really quite a simple concept: The interstates run in the valleys and the backroads run up on the ridges and up to the mountaintops. You can see a lot more from there!This second edition of the Northern Colorado book is the best yet. The maps are improved, the photography is better and there are several new routes described that we can't wait to try. These books give you all the information you need to select a trail suitable for your vehicle, find the trail, and navigate it. Each trail is rated for difficulty using a system that will be very familiar if you have skied in Colorado. Easy trails have green circles, moderate are designated with blue squares, and the difficult trails are marked with black diamonds. Each trail description includes a difficulty assessment, features found on the trail, distance and driving time estimates, a turn-by-turn description of the trail, history of the trail and other activities to do along the way. The photos give you an excellent idea of the views you will see, the trail conditions and obstacles you might encounter. Each trail article includes a map that indicates road surface type and GPS waypoints for every turn. Each map is loaded with icons to indicate the locations of waterfalls, campsites, picnic areas, wildflower fields, ghost towns, gold mines, the best picture spots and even restroom locations.These books are full of sound advice and contain all the information you need to start your adventures. There is a chapter that describes driving techniques, trail etiquette, and what to bring along for safety. It even describes how to ford a river. I can tell you it is quite a thrill to cross a river with bumper deep water as depicted on the cover of this book. Possibly most important, he describes how to assess your vehicle to determine what trails you can safely run. He even includes a section on how to use your GPS. The book includes an amazing number of references including other books, maps, and websites. The author maintains a website that lists any trail updates and condition changes on the trials. He lists the address and phone number of every forest ranger station and state park covered by the book, so you can call ahead and get trail conditions.If you have reservations about taking your SUV into the backcountry, I can tell you we have been amazed at the capability of our Jeep Grand Cherokee. Try a few easy trails and you will quickly graduate to the moderate trails. If you have a modified 4 x 4, this book has several difficult trails to challenge your driving skills.If you are concerned about damaging the environment as we are, I can tell you that every trail we have followed from these books has been designated by the forest service as legal trails for motorized vehicle travel. The author appears to go to great lengths to get these books reviewed by the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park System. If you are looking for a ringing endorsement of these books, we have seen them for sale in every ranger station, state park and national park store we have visited in Colorado.So get off the Interstate and see the Colorado you have only seen in calendars and photography books."},{"Title":"Guide to Colorado Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails, Vol. 2","review":"Just got it as a holiday gift.

The same goes for driving. Take one of these trails and experience true silence, serenity, beauty, solitude, etc. Don't let the 1 star review dissuade you, there must be ulterior motives at work.

It covers the main topics and bring you to speed quickly."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"This book has very good instructions and examples on how to use Visual Age for Java and develop Servlets, JSP, EJB, etc. The problem is the organization of the book and its relationship to what's on the CDs and when to look at 'what' is terrible.The initial chapters' titles (1 - 4) do not describe what is actually included in the chapter.If you are a designer, developer or application programmer and just want to know what you need to know to get the job done, you will be reading a lot of unnecessary information that will do more to scare you off and overload an already overly difficult set of development tools.Skip to chapter 5, (see page 226 to learn how to install the case study, and do it [also load Visual Age]). Then proceed from there. Starting with Chapter 5, read all of each chapter THEN go back and do the examples from the case study.This can be a valuable book if you need to learn how to develop systems using J2EE, you just need to work at it (i.e., how to read this book)!"},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"Though IBM recommends this, DO NOT buy this for the Test 158.

It's also the VisualAge for Java Enterprise Edition developers dream getting started guide for serious web application development. It delivers in an amazingly straight forward and readable way all the information you wanted to get from a one week server side Java class costing $2500! The book is not a WebSpere reference, but a quick start into the &quot;wise mans&quot; best practices of web application development with Java and WebSphere. Rather than just showing you how to get JSP/Servlets to work with the tool, it demonstates how to build and design complex large scale applications -- with all the design background on why you should follow certain practices. I wish this book were available a year ago. It's also a great resouce for both the senior architect and the novice developer. Excellent all round, and an astonishingly good value for the price."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I am a book maniac, so I know them all.This one is very good. It doesn't cover the topics in depth, but it's what makes it a very light reading.

I use JBuilder 4 (and I already know EJB basics) so this book was not useful to me. There is no information on how to write and deploy EJBs using shell scripts or any tool other than VAJ or WebSphere Studio.Furthermore, this book does not address writing advanced applications for WebSphere. Its samples are all very simple and do not exercise WebSphere to any significant degree.

In version 3.5 the administration was done using a windows GUI but in version 4.0 web administration was introduced so all menues are gone, the examples are useless!. OK, the desing patterns presented are good but maybe not worth the money."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I had the good fortune to be given a pre-release version of this book. I have found it a great guide for coming up to speed on WebSphere 3.5 and VisualAge for Java 3.5 and for understanding the design and architecture issues of J2EE. As a consultant, I will highly recommend this book to any of my clients using WebSphere. I will also encourage clients using J2EE with other tools to read the technology and design chapters of this book.The book's core value goes far beyond the WebSphere and VisualAge specific content to provide application architecture and design guidance for J2EE applications. The book winds it's way through the complexity of J2EE to highlight the key issues and choices in designing a JSP, Servlet, and EJB application. It provides clear examples of various complexities that can provide a starting point for developing your applications. Of particular value are discussions on when to use EJBs, scaling considerations in handling client session, and design patterns for multi-tiered applications.The book provides clear, concise introductions to the key technologies you need to build J2EE applications: HTTP, Servlets, JSP, client session management, JDBC, and EJB. It teaches the reader how to use the key aspects of VisualAge and WebSphere to build applications. The authors made excellent choices on which aspects of VisualAge and WebSphere to focus on.No one developing WebSphere applications should be without this book!"},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I reviewed the pre-publish version. The book's examples and tutorial thread are built around the IBM WebSphere toolset -- a huge advantage for those who've made the commitment. Kyle addresses many common issues in web development by proposing &quot;best practices&quot; solutions, plus rational behind other alternative approaches. This &quot;why is this the better way&quot; style appeals to me, avoiding the simple &quot;here's how you do X&quot; approach so prevalent in today's technical litterature.I've made this book a must-read for my WebSphere consulting engagements. It certainly saves me LOTS of time explaining how to use the WebSphere products -- and most importantly explaining *WHY* its suggested approaches work best!"},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I've been doing Internet development for years and have been waiting for a book that describes Websphere application development thoroughly. The only worthwhile resource until this book was IBM's redbook &quot;Servlet and JSP Programming with IBM WebSphere Studio and VisualAge for Java&quot; which I rate as 4 stars. This book, however, describes a recommended approach for application development using the IBM toolset. It shows you how to install and configure the WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Studio, and VisualAge for Java with its WebSphere Test Environment. It shows you how to develop servlets and JSPs in VAJ, how to test them using VAJ WebSphere Test Environment, and how to deploy on the WebSphere Application Server. All this information in one place. If that weren't enough, the author then provides architectural recommendations showing an effective and maintainable way to build a J2EE site using JSP, servlets, and EJBs. He even references design patterns from the Gamma book and everything. This book and the IBM Redbook together are must haves for serious J2EE developers using IBM technologies."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"This book had several problems that made me want to put it down. First of all, the organization of the chapters of the book is quite confusing: the different chapters don't seem to fit together or leverage each other. Perhaps due to several authors involved in the book or bad editing. It makes this book *very* difficult to read.It also merely scratches many important details about the WebSphere server. If you're writing a J2EE book, that is one thing, but there are so many much much better books available for that. One that specializes to a single server should show how that server works in detail. This book seems to completely miss its target and audience: neither a good generic J2EE book, nor a solid WebSphere book."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I have been developing, teaching and architecting WebSphere solutions since WebSphere 1.0 days. Often I am asked the question what is the best WebSphere book. I did not have an answer in the past. Now I do. This book would help both beginner and intermediate developers.I would recommend this book in the following situations: 1. As a book for beginners getting started with VisualAge and WebSphere development 2. As supplemental reading material to IBM WebSphere classes 3. As a good source of websphere best practices 4. As a reference book for all intermediate WebSphere developersI wish this book was published one year ago. It would have helped a lot of developers. Especially with the release of WebSphere 4.0 and the new set of development tools, some of the material covered in this book is not applicable anymore.If you are developing for WebSphere 3.5 or if you would like to know how to design multi-layered J2EE applications, read this book."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"Since the IDE has changed considerably from v3.5 ( to an IDE built on eclipse ) - this book would really only be useful for learning how to apply good design practices ( MVC, UML etc ) in a WebSphere development environment.

This is more than an academic book, showing actual code examples.A few annoying typing mistakes leaves the impression of a hastily assembled book. The inconsistent use of the UML also makes it difficult to use. Why have a UML and not use it properly? A diagram containing both association and generalization relationships is very difficult to read if both types of relationships are shown using the same notation."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Programming with IBM WebSphere","review":"I bought this book for the following reasons:* Seemed to cover J2EE including J2EE, including EJB development for WebSphere* Included a chapter on WSAD (Websphere Studio Application Developer)* High customer reviews* Low price (for used book)My biggest mistake was not to realize that the book was based on Websphere version 3.5 and the chapter on WSAD is based on version 3.5 as well, so this book was barely useful for me.It does have a good overview of J2EE, EJBs and Websphere, so I think that's what explains the high ratings: it is a good book if you're looking for introductory material on how to develop J2EE applications on Websphere, as long as you're developing on version 3.5. If you're using version 4.0 I recommend staying away from this book."},{"Title":"Travel Light (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"This slender book, first published in 1952, should be of interest both to the curious reader and to Naomi Mitchison fans. This is a story about magic, transformation and quest. In some respects it resembles Mitchison's much earlier novel, The Corn King and the Spring Queen, though more through thematic similarities than the style of writing. Both books have an engaging central heroine and both involve travel between various lands, actual and invented by the author herself, and both deal with religion and mystical forces. Travel Light, however, is suitable for young adults as well as grown-up readers. It is written in clear, precise English (which, admittedly, does come across as somewhat old-fashioned now). The tone of the writing is tinged with a certain sadness. But Travel Light it is not an even vaguely depressing book - the story is full of magic and mystery! The references to bears and dragons made me think of the sagas of Norse mythology (there are many fairy tale elements too) and, as ever with Naomi Mitchison's historical novels, the reader finds him or herself fully immersed in a captivating alien word. Travel Light a charming book which offers an easy read full of many pleasures."},{"Title":"Travel Light (Virago Modern Classics)","review":"The new Queen took one loathing look at her dead predecessor's daughter and informed her spouse the King that the infant must go.

As a new religion based on the teachings of the Christ begins to move across the continent, Halla's adventures continue. these enabling her to become human and more than human.Fans of Potter will enjoy this excellent reprint of a 1950s young adult fantasy starring a wonderful heroine and a terrific support cast who makes shapeshifters and dragons seem real. The story line is more a coming of age series of vignettes in the life of Halla with her fifteen adventures fun to follow especially soaring with dragons.

Audrey Glassman Vernick and Ellen Glassman Gidaro's language is both deceptively simple and wonderfully rich. Tim Brown's folk art is as scruffy as Bark himself, and is all the more real for that.Bark and Tim gives us rough-hewn truth and timeworn beauty. It gives us piny woods, soft grass, and shiny mud. It gives us the early-dark days between Halloween and Thanksgiving, the cloudy mist of Christmas dreams, the sweet air of Spring, and the warm summer sun. It gives us a boy, his dog, and all the seasons they spent together.Bark and Tim gives us love. Not the some idealized, syrupy, slicked-up version of love. It gives us real love. And thank goodness for that."},{"Title":"Bark & Tim: A True Story of Friendship (Based on the Paintings of Tim Brown)","review":"I originally bought this book for myself. There is something about this book that pulls you in, and makes you want to own it. The combination of the author's story and Tim Brown's artwork is magical. After reading Bark and Tim to my daughter for the first time, she took over my copy and now likes to keep it beside her at night. She says she wants to sleep with Bark. It definitely has both adult and kid appeal.Would also make a great gift to anyone who loves art, dogs, picture books, or just a good, unique story.When you're done enjoying the book, don't forget to read the author's note at the end. The story of their collaboration with Tim Brown is worthy of its own book. It's a fascinating story."},{"Title":"Bark & Tim: A True Story of Friendship (Based on the Paintings of Tim Brown)","review":"this heartwarming story about a boy and his dog is even more special, knowing it's based on the artist's own childhood and illustrated with his paintings.

After their mother abandoned the family and their father traveled to Canada in search of work the two sisters were forced to live with various family members until it became to much of a burden. They were then turned over to an orphanage to wait until their father returned for them.Unfortunately, the two sisters were accidentally separated by the British Adoption System. Simone (the authors mother) went to live with an aunt and uncle, and she had no idea what happened to her sister other then that she was eventually adopted. All efforts to obtain information on her sister were fruitless, and eventually Simone immigrated to Canada, married and had a family. But she never stopped looking for her little sister Catherine.Meanwhile Catherine, thinking she was abandoned by everyone, was adopted by a pair of women. She found out years later, after their death's that she had actually been taken illegally from the orphanage. She also found out her sister had been searching for her the entire time.After a sixty-five year separation Simone was able to finally reconnect with the sister she never thought she'd see again and reaffirm her promise to never let go of her hand, ever again.On reading this book, I found that the author was able to accurately convey the sense of loss experienced by her mother and how this life changing event affected every aspect of her life for decades to come. A must read for anyone that is either looking for someone or have found someone after years of separation.Marianne CurtisAuthor of Finding Gloria, Moondust and Madness: a collection of poetry, Behind Whispering Pines, Finding Gloria ~ Second Edition and Brian's Last Ride"},{"Title":"Sisters Torn","review":"This book is absolutely captivating.

It was very well written and quite objective, for being written by someone personally involved.

Well done Cynthia."},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"I think this easy to read book is a must for all the industry sectors. It illustrates visual management (or visual communication; VC) as a very important issue to boosting the factorys' or companys' productivity through increasing the effectiveness of the employees' from head management to the shop floor workers by the effective sharing of information and by encouraging the workers to participate in developing these information. In addition; VC helps in building a sense of belonging to the factory or company within the workers themselves which will work in the factory (company) best interest.The book introduces guide lines for applying the VC. I think that the real cases covered along with the many different graphs and pictures really helped in clearing out many points."},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"Michael Greif has written a book on lean principles long before the MIT study resulted in \\"The Machine the Changed the World\\".The foundation of lean is generally agreed to be the 5Ss, kaizen, and visual communication. This book, while focused on VC, does adequately cover the others. Consider this... the book was written in the late 80's, when Lean Manufacturing as a term had not yet been coined.And now, the review... this is an excellent study on visual communication. Although limited in scope (most practical examples were of western European factories), it is a study that should not be limited to factories; rather, one that has application in many aspects of daily life.Practical examples, diagrams, drawings, and checklists abound. Definitely user-friendly, and as the subject matter demands, visually communicative."},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"This is a very readable and credible work. Chapter six on visual process indicators is my favorite. It was an a-ha moment for me!!"},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"Michael Greif has written this book based on a deep insight in chemistry between people working within a factory. This insight is based on his experience that visual communication can be a benefit or be a disaster! So read this book before you start some guru-communication-show in your plant.Already in his foreword he clearly mentions: 'every company that introduced visual communication was also pursuing significant changes in its modes of management and organization.'Reading this book will take much time. The essential parts of his book are not so visual and the photo's/drawings are a little bit oldfashioned now. But the content is very strong: how to build a 'village-community' within your factory with entrepreneurial thinking of all co-operators and sustained by visual communication. Do not expect a book with visual examples that you simply can copy-paste. If you expect this, you better buy a other book. But if you want to invent your own communication-style based on your mission / targets then dig into this book and you will learn/understand how to do it."},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"it lacks of what it preaches no visual book at all. very few examples much history. might be good for school but not for lean manufacturing professionals"},{"Title":"The Visual Factory: Building Participation Through Shared Information (See What's Happening in Your Key Processes--At a Glance, All)","review":"Pro:-Interesting introduction to visual factory... for a few chapters-Coverage of the most popular visuals, including a description of kanban, andon, etc.-Some unique perspectives that I had not seen before which was very refreshingCon:-Verbose at times... descriptions are eloquent but overly (and unnecessarily?) lengthy-Virtually no visuals.

Basically, it tells what happens to Nemo during a day in school. Other than that, there is no plot. The illustrations are not the quality of stills and shots from the film, but are recognizable. This is a decent book for young children who have seen the movie and also makes a decent gift for any fan of the film."},{"Title":"Fish School (Finding Nemo)","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewers. This book contains cute parts geared toward kids, less of the adult humor that the movie contains that a child might miss, and small tidbits of tie-ins to the movie. In other words, it's just brought down even more to a kid's level with simple wording. And did you ever notice that animation movies never really cross over well to the world of short story books? People want Nemo manga, I guess, but how much of the original story can you present in a kid's book? Not much, or you lose their attention. I heart the illustrations because they are not your typical Disney- I cannot explain it..they are just different, as you can see on the above cover. It is just a simple story that definitely gets overshadowed by the movie in an adult's eyes, but to a kiddo, it's pure gold.Plot: Nemo has fun at school in various ways.

A student of mine brought it in during a lesson and my god was I impressed! This book and CD spell it all out-Jazz, Rock, R&amp;B, Latin and Carribean, you name it. The author, Jeff Strong, can play and he can also teach it well.The book covers set as well as hand/stick drums-which is where the eye teeth come in. Nearly every drum a drummer would want to play is covered in this book. He's got every little Brazilian thing from the Surdo to the Pandeiro, and goes on to Latin with the Clave (which confuses so many people), the Congas, and on and on-you name it it's all here.It's easy to read, the instructions are clear, and the CD is a big help. It's gonna turn a lot of drummers out there into very good drummers. And for those drummers who want to explore beyond the set, this book's like a candy store of sweet, sweet options."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"It's not reasonable to expect to learn a musical instrument from a book, much less a single book. This is a useful book for anyone just starting out or thinking of starting out, to help explain the lingo, to show the variety of drums one can choose from, to provide some advice on how to choose drums, and how to tap out a few basic rhythms. It would also be useful for music directors, band teachers, or composers who are not drummers but want some basic understanding of what drums can (and can't) do. Beyond that, to be a drummer one needs a teacher and many hours of practice -- there are no shortcuts.This book, unlike the \\"Idiots\\" competition, devotes a lot of space to all sorts of drums, not simply rock kits. It also covers basic drumming patterns for a number of different styles. A demo CD is included. If you can't read music, you should plan on supplementing this book with enough study to be able to."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"This book is great! Not only does it cover the drumset it also has instructions on how to play a bunch of other drums including congas and bongos and quite few that I'd never heard of before. It also has rhythms and techniques for playing cowbells and shakers and other percussion instruments.I like that this book gives me so much great information on how to play more than just basic beats. I learned about song structure and how to use fills and licks and there's even a section on playing solos! The CD that comes with this book makes it really easy to learn the drum beats.This is the best drumming book that I have."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"Jeff Strong has put together a wonderful book on drumming. &quot;Drums for Dummies&quot; is packed with good information, suggestions, and techniques to help you become the best drummer you can be.

But listening to the accompanying CD inspired me to brush the dust off my hand drum and learn some new rhythms. I highly recommend this book for kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"Drums for DummiesIf any of you are drummers that want to learn how to play the drum set or just wont to master your training. I thank this book is good book for you. Its called Drums for Dummies. It doesn't just try to teach you the drum set; it tries to teach you how to play other percussion interments as well. It comes with a CDROM to let you hear it so you know if you are doing it right. It adds on just little at a time. I will admit it is a little confusing, but I am twelve years old and I cane understand it. It taught me how to play now let it teach you."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"PROS:Jeff Strong provides this extremely organized book that will benefit everyone from the beginner to the expert. He covers the majority of percussion instruments with details down to their history, tuning, and maintenance so that you don't have to only be a kit drummer. I like his personal suggestions on practicing techniques which usually can only be found in expensive drum lessons. These practice tips are essential for not developing bad habits that will hold you back from getting as good as you can get in the shortest amount of time.CONS:Could use more practice technique detail like what he meant about, \\"Singing the rhythm before playing it\\". He also decided not to cover the rudiments of the Tablas because they can be daunting but instead listed his website for more info. The CD covers numerous rhythms that are written out in the book but only two measures of each so you can't practice along with them. The rudiments cheat sheet is not organized very well, lists only the 26 American rudiments, and has small print making it hard to practice from a music stand."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"This book was exactly what we expected.

Most of it was \\"after a while, you will find what you like\\" with very little \\"here is a good starting point\\". The author is very modest, which is refreshing, but I expected more words of wisdom. I found more relevant and useful guidance on an internet site. I often read books and wonder who is the \\"target audience\\". This book does not seem to have one. It neither inspires to try and take up the drums (the author presumes you are already chomping at the bit) nor offers sound step by step guidance once you have made the jump. Additionally it seems poorly laid out. Too much of a brief and not very useful sentence about how to do something with an explanation that you will find it in another chapter. Almost like much of the first chapters of book were created as an after thought. It just didn't seem like he had any clear directionIn all fairness, I have no other learn to play the drums guides to compare this one, so it very well may be the cream of the crop.The accompanying CD is less than stellar. The layout is poor and seems like it was a few random files copied to a disc and the sounds in a separate folder. If you don't have the book in front of you, the sounds are so poorly labeled that you search in vane for what you want. Would it have been so difficult to have a better naming convention and maybe some separate sub-folders? Also, there are files that have multiple uses. Why not just have a separate file for each demonstration? It's just a few extra bytes on the disc.Having only bought one other book '4-Way Coordination' as a guide for later on, I have nothing else as a reference, but frankly I would call you local library to see if they have a copy, rather than spend the money."},{"Title":"Drums For Dummies","review":"This book is great! Not only does it cover the drumset it also has instructions on how to play a bunch of other drums including congas and bongos and quite few that I'd never heard of before. It also has rhythms and techniques for playing cowbells and shakers and stuff.I want to play in a rock band and I like that this book gives me so much great information on how to play more than just basic beats.

I am so thrilled to have found this book (and a dummies book at that!)-because as my women's group learns these authentic rhythms, our meetings will be graced with the delicate detail and complexity of this wonderful music.But don't assume this book is just for lightweights. When we want to really get down, there is plenty in the line of heavy hitters with rhythms for djembe and conga and doumbek, too. It goes from African to Brazilian to Cuban and beyond.

The author bemoans the state of contemporary poetry as too often &quot;timid, derivative, academic,&quot; and his own work is as opposite from this faint-hearted approach as one can imagine.This latest compendium contains some 25 years worth of his best work from 6 previous volumes, including his first major book DAMNED UGLY CHILDREN, which was a Pulitzer finalist in 1966.That book's title poem, as well as &quot;A Letter to David Matzke&quot; are invigorating manifestos of the role (&quot;bard and prophet,&quot; as one reviewer has described it) Glaze envisions for writers in our society. And such gems as &quot;The Trash Dragon of Shensi,&quot; &quot;I Am the Jefferson County Courthouse,&quot; and &quot;Ice Break&quot; are alone with the price of this powerful collection."},{"Title":"The Gospel according to St. John: The Authorized version with introduction and notes","review":"Okay, why is this book out of print??!!

I have bought (and returned) Brown, Morris, Carson, Barret, Bruce and none met my needs or stimulated meditation for me.Westcott does an indept exegesis on many sections. You have to read it over and over again. There is no way reading it once would do. His depth leaves you breathless and captures your attention and mind. John 3:1-12 on Nicodemus was amazing, he provided great insight for me. His opinions may be different for some people but he is no follow the crowd and yet they are very objective views when your really sit with the Spirit of God to examine the word. John 16 on the Holy Spirit is a must read. he combines the greek with an expositional light on the scripture.It will challenge any theological student or any lay person seeking a deeper insight into the word. I used the 1958 Erdmanns edition, I would assume the newer editions haven't changed.A pity it is out of print, my advice is to buy whatever copy you can find out there whether from 1919 or 1970, it is a treasure you shouldn't miss out on."},{"Title":"White Wolf Woman (American Storytelling)","review":"i have own this book for several years, given to me by my grandmother (i'm Beth's daughter, her mother gave the book to me) and i recommend it to anyone who adores hearing about the Native American stories, or wants to compare these stories to European books.

There is barely any analysis or narrative. After a tedious introduction that didn't give much insight into how Native Americans used herbs, the author presents the various native woodland plants in a format like most field guides. After each plant, she lists historical quotes about the herbs and puts tribal names in caps. There are some great quotes. It's a pretty cool reference, and as a lover of native plants, I will keep it. However, I really wanted more on how different tribes used the herbs in everyday life. If it were an e-book or in some digital format, it would be much more useful, because you could search it easily. The index only lists plant names, not tribal names. The Peterson Field Guide is much more to the point and better edited. I'm bummed. Based on the title and reviews, I was expecting an historical, ethnobotanical account of native plant use by Natives. You can get some of that information out after a lot of work and doing your own analysis.*** OK, after having this book for a few weeks, I'm really glad I kept it. It's an amazing reference for identifying and learning about woodland plants. Also, the line drawings are really nice for identification. The author put a tremendous amount of work into this book, and I've been enjoying it. Some of the historical quotes are hilarious. Also, as a note, this is not intended as a guide to making herbal remedies or using native plants as herbal remedies."},{"Title":"Medicinal and Other Uses of North American Plants: A Historical Survey with Special Reference to the Eastern Indian Tribes","review":"This book really interested me.

Available in paperback, it is a readable, engaging, well-researched discussion of the practices that make for great teaching.The book illustrates that learning occurs when we discover meaning and that we discover meaning when we connect new information with things we already know. Aimed at helping ALL student achieve excellence in the classroom, &quot;Contextual Teaching and Learning&quot; explains how the human brain learns. It explains why certain teaching methods are brain-compatible and thus benefit students of all abilities. It explains that used together, these teaching methods constitute a holistic system that links lessons with students' daily lives, filling lessons with meaning.Parents should read this book to understand the kinds of instruction they should seek for their children. Teachers should read the book to get concrete ideas about classroom practices. Those interested in the history of ideas should read it to find out why &quot;context&quot; matters to the human brain."},{"Title":"Contextual Teaching and Learning: What It Is and Why It's Here to Stay","review":"Written for professional educators yet comprehensible and practical in its presentation toward non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject matter, Contextual Teaching And Learning by education and business consultant Elaine B.

It provides a clear, easy to follow explanation of how the brain learns. It offers practical examples from classrooms around the country, of brain-compatible teaching. It shows that the brain weaves patterns and makes connections in its search for meaning. Because the brain learns best when it makes connections to find meaning, teaching needs to place lessons in the context of students' own lives and experiences. When teaching occurs in context-is contextual-students will excel."},{"Title":"Contextual Teaching and Learning: What It Is and Why It's Here to Stay","review":"I just finished reading the paperback version (considerably less expensive)of Contextual Teaching and Learning. I found it extraordinarly helpful in understanding how to really facilitate learning both in and out of the classroom. Dr. Johnson clarifies CTL (Contextual Teaching and Learning) for all of us, and explains how to put it to use with students. The concept of CTL, because it is based on current brain research and uses biology and physics as well as psychology, carries the potential to revolutionize teaching practices.Unlike most books on education, this one goes much deeper, getting into universal principles that govern the activities of every living thing on the planet. Nevertheless, it does not bore readers with complex theory or elevated scientific language. The book is accessible and exciting for anyone who is searching for new ways to motivate and excite students. Johnson, a teacher herself, communicates the science in understandable terms and constantly relates them to teaching experience.A major premise of the book is that all learners learn best in an environment reflecting three foundational, universal principles: 1) interdependence, 2) differentiation, and 3) self-organization. She translates these principles into eight components of a rich learning environment; each one is given a chapter, fully explaining how each works and providing real-life examples.The book is a gold mine of ideas, presented coherently and with a great deal of love for the process and the people who make it work."},{"Title":"Make Health Happen: Training Yourself to Create Wellness","review":"Erik Peper, Professor and Director of the Institute for Holistic Studies at San Francisco State University is an international authority on biofeedback and self regulation. He recently co-authored with Katherine Gibney and Catherine Holt, &quot;Make Health Happen, a book essential for health care professionals and their clients in learning how to optimize self healing and wellness.&quot;Make Health Happen&quot; provides necessary, theoretically grounded information for developing a holistic program. Chapters in each of the 4 sections progress logically and sequentially towards the learning of essential foundational theory and relaxation, imagery, and cognitive skills. Each chapter introduces and builds upon holistic concepts and strategies that are then reinforced with practice exercise sessions. Daily log keeping and group discussion formats are provided to further facilitate self awareness and experiential mastery of content. The ultimate goal is to develop ones own unique, meaningful, healing program towards wholeness. Nursing students have used this book's first edition (Creating Wholeness) as a main textbook for a university holistic nursing course; several students reported: &quot;I now have a variety of ways to relieve stress.&quot; &quot;This awareness has allowed me to intervene earlier and to stop some of the general overload.&quot; (Stetson, 1998)Nursing students (in one holistic nursing course) quickly and successfully learned and applied the holistic, healing principles and methods into their own lives as well as with clients in various health care settings. For example, students helped reduce clients' pain, stress, and anxiety by remaining calm, creating relaxing atmospheres, and teaching stress reduction techniques from the textbook's relaxation scripts and/or use of relaxation audio tapes. Stress reduction techniques were especially helpful in reducing anxiety for clients on ventilators (Stetson, 1998).Learning self awareness and inner skills were reported by students as rewarding and fun to do, particularly when learning more advanced self regulation skills such as hand warming. On the average, students learned to warm their hands 5.70 degrees Fahrenheit in about 5 minutes.Nursing students rated the Creating Wholeness book highly. Students reported being able to reduce their self reported stress with these techniques, from an average of 4.29 to 1.95 rating, on a scale of 1 (no discomfort) to 5 (maximum discomfort).&quot;Make Health Happen&quot; can be used by health care professionals in many ways. The book chapters can be assigned selectively according to what the professional deems important to learn, and can be taught on an individual or group basis. This book is definitely a &quot;how to&quot; manual and easy for professional use.The first half of the book teaches fundamental relaxation skills that incorporate relaxation theory and principles. The reader is introduced to relatively easy relaxation exercises which progress to more advanced skills. Practice sessions include relaxation scripts and exercises; also, audio tapes (duplicating the text's relaxation scripts) can be purchased for additional learning. The last chapter of the relaxation section requires the reader to write a personal relaxation script. Nursing students reported particular enjoyment using this exercise since it individualized their relaxation and stimulated them to creatively recall and write beautiful, healing images of special places promoting their own inner peace and relaxation. Personalizing relaxation also helped to integrate and master previously learned inner skills. For example, student comments in their summative papers half way through the course were: &quot;I have become more focused and aware of myself and the environment.&quot; &quot;I've channeled my worries from frustration into relaxation.&quot; (Stetson, 1998)The second half of the book focuses on the development of cognitive balance and use of imagery. Many students reported the cognitive exercises to be useful in helping them recognize and change their own negative thought patterns and less assertive ways. Learning of imagery continued to deepen the journey of self enlightenment. Positive changes in these areas reportedly helped increase student self esteem and confidence.&quot;Make Health Happen&quot; is an essential, consciousness raising book for all health care professionals, students, and clients, particularly relevant in caring for self and clients in our rapidly changing health care system today."},{"Title":"Make Health Happen: Training Yourself to Create Wellness","review":"A book that is real as real gets, it uses case study examples from previous students.

I got so angry at him, and then he would do it just to make me angry. This book needs to have a teacher-proof method for always making the teacher play the exercises in the right key!"},{"Title":"MUSIC FOR SIGHT SINGING","review":"Typically, music students resist their music theory courses and enjoy the sight singing exercises associated with them even less. My experience as a student and as a teacher leads me to believe that this is usually because by the time the students first get around to learning this skill, they are already confident musicians on their instruments or have learned to sing some other way. To have to learn a new skill from scratch is disturbing and seems unnecessary to them. However, learning to sight sing brings many benefits.Singing music helps one internalize the music more fully. One also develops a greater confidence with pitch than having it done in an instrument. It also helps one learn to sing through one's instrument - that is, to play even more musically. And by developing strategies to sing chromatic music, one has to think through the relationships within the piece. Once the skills are more fully developed, one can learn to come to terms with a new piece of music quite quickly. Therefore, one becomes not only more professional, the whole of one's musical experience deepens.We used the second edition of Ottman's book when I was an undergrad in music in the late seventies and early eighties. This seventh edition is a much richer and more useable book. There are more than a thousand melodies, all nicely arranged to teach something specific. They are actual melodies from the literature rather than some abstract theoretical nothing. And there are lots of rhythmic exercises, so the student can gain skills in becoming more precise in rhythm and especially in rests (you know, letting the silence be silent). A new chapter with melodies from the 20th century is also a nice addition. The new edition also adds some exercises with structured improvisation for the student to experiment with his or her own melodies.The spiral binding actually makes the book more durable and useable. It lays flat on your piano or music stand and the spine won't break and the pages won't be falling out. The print is crisp and clear which makes reading easy. This is important for a book you will be using in your theory courses for several terms.Not only is this great for college students, I think high school and private music teachers would do well by their students to use this as part of their regular music lessons. Their students might fight it a bit (they always seem to), but they will become better musicians and more musical students if they develop the skill to sight sing."},{"Title":"MUSIC FOR SIGHT SINGING","review":"This is a wonderful compilation of singable melodies from the folk and art music repertoires.

The best of the Wheel of Time by far"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I had a few problems with this book. First of all, there are some scenes that are just plain repetitive. Every chapter about Elayne and Nynaeve is just them bickering about each other for wearing skimpy clothes, like a book for 13 year old girls. I think this book gets better reviews because the end is extraordianary. The last 200 pages or so are top notch, but the rest of the book is just uneventful. I mean the first time Jordan said that Nynaeve showed too much \\"pale bosom\\", it was fine, but if you pay close attention he says it dozens of times throughout the course of the novel. I stopped at about page 600 to read another book, and after I returned I liked the rest of it, but it is just too long and drawn out (kind of like the series in general). Definitely the worst book in the series, but you have to read it to appreciate the later ones. It is a necessary evil."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Mr Jordan first started the style of branching out new sub plots from the main ones in Book 3. At that time, I was quite impressed that he could actually compile the various little storylines into 1 book and all seem to be interconnected.However, in Book 4 &amp; 5 (esp. 5, The Fires of Heaven), he definitely overstretched his limits. No longer do I see the clearly defined links between those little plots. The storylines revolving around {Rand} and {Nynaeve + Elayne} have absolutely no connections at all. It's just like reading 2 completely different short stories compiled together in a book. Those meetings in dreams between Eqwene and Nynaeve seem a feeble attempt by Jordan to show that the 2 different stories are actually related.The 300 pages on Nyn. &amp; Elayne's travels are stuffed with insignificant details.(70 odd pages were spent on describing their lives with the circus? Is this book about circus life?)Last but not least, the ending, I believe was quite poorly done and predictable. Mat roasted by Rhavin? Of course he wont die and the only way to do it is burning Rhavin with balfire. I think that most people would have guessed that as well.I really hope book 6 can pack more punch."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If it wasn't for Perrin and Mat I'd give up on this series.The first three books thrilled me. I loved the world and the characters, knowing that there was going to be at least another 8 of these was amazing.How could it all go so wrong so fast.I've gone from loving and caring about Rand to thinking the sooner the mad man dies the better. All the women have turned into an absurd caricature of a universal Womens Circle. Jordan endlessly repeats himself (I can only think it is for people who have picked up the books half way through, because surely he doesn't need to remind his readers minor points after this long) and his plot devices are childlike at times.I admit that he is keeping me reading these books and that is for two reasons 1. I want to be there when Rand dies and 2. I have to read something while I wait for the new George RR Martin book to come out.If there is anyone out there who reads Robert Jordan and hasn't read George RR Martins 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series I suggest you switch NOW."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Close to two years ago, I started reading The Wheel of Time series. I was pretty hooked once I read The Eye of the World. Now, four books later, here I am at The Fires of Heaven. I started this book OVER a year ago. Over the months, I have trudged my way through this book page by page at some points.Jordan had a solid storyline going for him, so where did he go wrong? Here are a few things that may answer this.First and foremost, he seems to have become completely convinced that the quantity of pages in each book outweighs the quality of them. The first book was around 800 pages. Thats fine. The next one, I believe, was shorter. Now though, each next book gets more difficult to fit in my hand. The main cause is that he spends nearly an entire page or more to tell us that . . . \\"The sun is hot.\\" If a blade of grass was bent on the other side of the castle, he makes sure we know about it. He spends way too much time with description instead of the story. Each step our characters take seem to take a chapter.(Gamers, have you noticed how these books are more like sidequests in a game? Simply there to keep you a little occupied before the grand finale . . . only, you HAVE to do the sidequests!) Also, in his descriptions, he forms sentences that are the lengths of paragraphs. Obviously, he wants to prove that he's capable of forming complex sentences. Unfortunately, he fails miserably. Simply because it annoys me now to not know what the heck was just said, I have found myself rereading sentences over and over to no avail of making sense out of these bunched up sentence fragments. Terrible grammar skills has he. . . . I could be a grammar teacher now that I've had so much practice observing what is bad.Maybe the more hooked readers haven't noticed, or refuse to, that many characters seem to have very little diversity from one another. Elayne, Egwene, the wise ones and just about every other female character seem to sound like an old, bickering nanny whom all have nothing but confusing \\"sayings\\" to say. Most of them are also red-heads too. . . . Honestly, I used to like them. Now, it really wouldn't bother me if a couple of them just . . . vanished. He does do a better job with the male characters however.Also, have any of you people noticed how this series is subtly becoming a . . . porn tale? Jordan had me convinced that the showing of a woman's ankles was controversial in his world. Now, it seems that its become offensive to NOT have sweaty, naked women giving massages by the fireplace and sneaking off into Rand's room to seduce him( I never said I disliked this change mind you! I merely find it quite odd.)Overall, he's gotten in over his head now. The story grows ever complex and you wonder what he WON'T suddenly add in. One of our characters has suddenly gained the ability to make ser and ter'angreals(something not done since \\"the breaking of the world.\\"). Some of these sudden additions not only make ZERO sense, but are completely annoying. My prediction is that by the 15th book, Rand and a crazy old lady from Tear whill have created Grenade Launchers and B-52 bombers.I constantly find myself wondering who many people, that he had previously introduced, are. With too much rubbish having been said in these books, I just find myself guessing when this or that happened or who the heck he or she is. I guess that I've simply grown accustomed to not caring about so many things in this. I have bought pretty much the entire series though . . . or have I. In five years, I may discover that I'll have ANOTHER ten books to buy. How many more nannies must come and seduce Rand and how many times must everything be retold from a different angle!! I've almost confused myself trying to clearly disect all of this. . . . All I can say for myself is that I've wasted my time(and money) if I don't continue my trudging. There are still more irritating flaws that I may have overlooked. Sorry for the length of this. Just thought I'd give the rest of you a heads up on this one. If you're new to all of this, buy a DragonLance book instead. The plot is deeper, takes less time and gives you more innovative and emotional characters for you to get attached to. I still think this story has massive potential, but perhaps if someone else were in charge of the writing, editing and etc. . . ."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you are into epic tales of adventure of the fantasy genre, this is a supremely written book for anyone looking for a good read that lasts a long time, even for those who read fast.

Even if the inspiration for them is fairly obvious, Jordan does some impressive things with them, and with the reaction of the western &quot;wetlanders&quot; to their latest incursion.Other than that, this book has simply added to a series that is becoming top-heavy, and in danger of crushing itself under its own weight. Since of all of the characters in the book, it is Egwene who develops the most, I would rather have had Rand's tale wrapped up long ago, and had a (concurrent?) story about her instead.But no, the Last Battle is yet to come, and I'm sorry to say, the sooner the better"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A man destined to go mad, Rand al'Thor must find the strength to save the world.

Not only was Robert Jordan able to come up with a bunch of new ideas (that we all thought he'd used up in his first four) but he was able to freshen your memory without the repetition of other authors.Robert Jordan is the best author that there has been for a long time, when people are still reading his books fifty years from now, I won't be surprised. The quality of Fires In Heaven is unsurpassable, and there will never be a fiction/fantasy book that equals it.

I live in Taiwan, and I have to wait much longer that most people who read these books. I still think that it is worth the wait though. Even though I reagard these books so highly, I managed to find three flaws in it, which is why I could not give it a perfect ten. One, in either this book, or the after it, Robert Jordan suddenly pops in the idea of Bail Fire and Nae'Blis (?). Out of know where, you all of a sudden find out about two relatively important aspects of the book. Second, every one of the female in this series has a bad temper (at least the main females), and none of their tempers have changes since the beginning of the series.

Now they have a new, and better (I believe, from experience reading The Lord of the Rings series), author to be compared with. Robert Jordan has created a believable world where right and wrong are clearly defined, as compared to our own. I gave this book a 9 because although it is truly fantastic in its imaginative scope, it did drag at times. In this volume we get a better view of the problems Rand will face as the series progresses. And I also got a feel for what kind of troubles people in power may come against. I recommend this book, in fact the entire series, to those who enjoy fantasy, those who like to go to other lands, and those who don't, because I'm sure it will change their minds.

Into the Amyrlin's study in the White Tower, where the Amyrlin, Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan, is weaving new plans. Into Andor, where Siuan Sanche and her companions, including the false Dragon Logain, have been arrested for barn-burning. Into the luxurious hidden chamber where the Forsaken Rahvin is meeting with three of his fellows to ensure their ultimate victory over the Dragon. Into the Queen's court in Caemlyn, where Morgase is curiously in thrall to the handsome Lord Gaebril. For once the Dragon walks the land, the fires of heaven fall where they will, until all men's lives are ablaze.There are many masters in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien would certainly be lauded highest when it comes to development of the world in which the events he illustrates transpire. Robert Jordan, for all the criticism leveled against him for what appears to be a marketing ploy - stringing the series out as long as humanly possible to generate greater book sales - would certainly have to rank near the top for character development. His series is filled with various interesting folk with varied viewpoints and motivations. While most (decent) authors go well into detail in describing the motivations and quirks of their heroes, Jordan doesn't stop there. Even his villains are thoroughly detailed. Moghidien, for example, one of the wickedest of the fallen, has a history and personality that influences how she reacts, as well as insecurities and frailties. Good, evil, benevolent or malign, all of Jordan's characters are fully fleshed out, and we get a fair view into their minds and motivations as the drama unfolds. Yes, the world is on the simple side, and yes, the plot, of late, has lost its pace; but it's a world and plot filled with only the most fascinating of folks. At a series currently juggling over 50 characters, all unveiled over the last 10 volumes, it's a commendable and laudable feat, indeed.Fans of Jordan's epic series of many volumes of many pages have been whinging since book six that the series seems to have no end in sight. Unfortunately, it's now a race against the clock for Jordan and his publisher, whose decision to prolong the series as long as they have may result in the work never being finished. Ironically, Rand, the hero destined to die on the slopes of the Dragonmount, may outlive his creator. Full sympathies to Jordan, and I, for one, hope he holds out long enough to complete the story he began."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There is probably little to say about this book that will be useful to the reader of this review. If you are considering reading Book 5 of the Wheel of Time saga, you probably have read the first four. In that case, I can assure you that this book is more of the same - well written, engaging, and deep. There are some specific details that might interest a reader of the series, which I'll include here.The plot: of the \\"Original 7\\" that set off from the Two Rivers in Book #1, only 6 are included in this book. Although Perrin is probably my favourite character, his absence from this story is welcome because it also means the most annoying character (Faile) is also absent. Of the other 6, five are clustered around Rand, as he brings the Aiel (the desert-warrior race) across the mountains to invade the kingdom of Carhein and add it to the countries that have pledged allegiance to his cause. Along the way he battles Forsaken, his own demons, and the mechanations of his so-called allies. Meanwhile, Nynaeve and her group learn of the coup in Tar Valon and attempt to locate and join with the rebel Aes Sedai.Jordan is clearly becoming a better writer (or he had a better editor?) with this book. Much of the annoying repitition of previous books has been eliminated, so we only have Nynaeve blaming Rand (or Lan) for everything 10 times instead of 100 times. Similarly, the story is more \\"plausible\\" because it doesn't rely on a series of cooincidences to get everyone back together at the end - the Original 7 are in 3 groups at the beginning, and are still in 3 groups at the end.Finally, there has been little suspense in previous books because the Original 7 (and the other main characters) have never been in danger of dying. As a contrast, I point to Tolkien, who killed Boromir about 1/3 of the way through, which made the rest of the books more suspenseful because you never knew who might be next. Well, Jordan has finally killed someone of importance (I will not say who, obviously) in this book, although the manner of the character's death leaves open the possibility of a return (sort of like Gandalf's \\"death\\" in LotR). Even with the possibility, it should make subsequent books more interesting since Jordan has finally given us a shocking development to nudge us from our complacency with the series.To sum up: Jordan fans are likely to be pleased with this effort. I found the writing to be better than in the previous books of the series, and the annoying characters are written in a way that makes the characters annoying without annoying the reader when reading about them."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I bought the first book &quot;The Eye of the World &quot; with a bookstore gift voucher, knowing nothing about the series except that it had a prominent place in the fantasy section and looked like a popular series. Turned out to be a good decision, as &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; and the next two Wheel of Time books I purchased with the rest of the voucher were all top-notch fantasy, set in a world equal the best of them. However things started to go wrong around book four (using my own money now), after Rand got to Rhuidean the whole dynamic was off, I could tell something wasn't right. I got through the book anyways, despite the magic having gone and reading the Wheel of Time becoming more of a chore than a pleasure.By book five when a good deal of the book concerned the adventures of non-essential characters running away from another even more non-essential character, &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; went for longer and longer periods without being read. By the time I checked on here and found out that old Perrin Aybara wasn't even in it, and rest of the series had less and less to do with the core characters, I had completely lost momentum. &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; has been taking up bookshelf space ever since.

Her thoughts are mostly copied and pasted fears, ramblings, lustings, and hating men. Everywhere. And how many instances of \\"I'll never understand women\\" will we find in here? No, Jordan needed an editor. The fantasy within the fantasy is that every word is necessary in here. Not so. If this book can meticulously detail what people are wearing, and each character comparing what everybody looks like to others, or I suppose other women would find him attractive, and how attracted Nynaeve is to some schmuck, then where is all the detail on the things we care about? Like the combat and the gore. Nope, we get more worrying over who is with who and the daytime drama factor. No Perrin in this book either. I'm tired of these bumpkins and their constant comparing of how they look and appear to others. I'm tired of Rand having a more difficult time figuring out who he will shack up with (and you know his readers don't have this problem) than he does destroying people or solving crucial problems. Does the series end for me here? I'll probably read the next one, because it's there, and because of the cliffhanger ending.

So far the series has been consistently good, although I've heard that after this one the quality starts to decline.

Every time a female character appears he describes their clothes and the resulting effect on how their breasts are displayed.

I got a partial copy of The Eye of the World for free at Walden's. I threw it in my closet and picked it up a few months later thinking what the heck. I soon became enthralled. It was exciting, complex, and a little bit spooky. So much better than the D&D; junk I had been reading since I was twelve. It was the best fantasy I had ever read. I read and loved all the books up to book 6 and then I ran into a wall. From this point on the books get slower and more difficult to get into. There is a lot of sitting around doing nothing and idle conversation. The writing becomes very over descriptive (I really don't need to know what color the drapes are but thanks for the info) and there is a very noticeable lack of action. Action and suspense were what drew me to these novels, but with each installation there is less and less. It starts to get repetitive also. Reading these later books now 11years since the 1st book I have discovered that you have to read them very slow and try to picture the the setting in your mind. Otherwise you just won't enjoy them.

There were basically three climatic events in the story: Rand chasing down Couladin and the Shaido clan, Nynaeve and Elayne finding the Aes Sedai hideout, and Rand destroying some Forsaken. We spend hundred of pages following Rand's trek out of the wasteland in pursuit of the Shaido. I am looking forward to a big battle with Couladin. HOWEVER, once we finally reach the confrontation with Couladin, it is presented from a Mat's reflection on the events. OMG! All of that time spent building it up, and it is basically blown off in a few sentences and barely described in those - like it did not really even matter. The same thing happened at the other two climatic events: they were built up and basically blown off.This book is nothing more than a filler in the series.

Our intrepid characters once again bravely wander the countryside, occasionally taking the trouble to slay a number of really scary Trollocs, still apparently the most common enemy. We have budding 'relationships' abounding- Elaine might love Rand, but so might Aviendha... etc.Some find this exciting, but I don't, and by this time I'm tired of this series. It has none of the scope of Tolkien's grand work, or Pullman's beautiful His Dark Materials. There's nothing driving it forward, hardly anything holding it together but a final conflict with the 'Dark One'. For such a simple plot this series is astonishingly long. And, just because its long doesn't mean it has anything good about it(as many readers erroneously assume). Most of the book is full of sterile and pointless details and descriptions.

But from what I remember, Eye of the World was almost totally clean. If in five books Jordan goes from practiaclly G to PG-13, I really don't want to read what he does in the next four.And I wish that Perrin had been present in this book--at all.Maybe I could edit my copy . . . . . . . :("},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Just the 3 first of the serie are somehow worth the reading. Following the readers review I bought straight the 9 first books. What a mistake. the Game of Thrones or even Sword of truth series are far better than the Wheel of time serie. It is as if Robert Jordan is paid by the line like the french writers from the 19th century, Balzac, Flaubert etc...So far I have finished 1 to 7. From the 4th (till 7th) they just are impossible to finish. Like chewing branflakes forever and being unable to swallow it.I really regret I went further the third.Do not make my mistake unless slow rythm and low level action is what you seek.Robert Jordan has also the gift for beginning threads of stories with no intention of closing them, creating new characters without really caring to give them substance, depth or real influence on the plot.My recommendation: read the 3 first ones, and then taste the 4th, if you have the patience and like it carry on. If not don't hope it'll get better and you'll get some action or anything ...stop right there.Same with the 5th etc...Don't buy them all at once like me.This a real never ending story, not even close to that, and it just gets slower and slower with more and more characters...I hate it, but may be you won't.My bet ? you will."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I loved/enjoyed every moment of it.Story so vividly told as the other previous books.

The item came in good condition and ahead of schedule."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love this series and Jordan definitely has a wonderful ability to paint a picture, but this, for me, was the worst of the 1st 5 books. I will be moving on nonetheless to book 6 with hopes that the series will pick up the pace. Plus I\\"m invested in the series so I will finish it. I already own all of them in hard back form minus the last book. I bought them all at bargain prices whenever I came across them just because I was impressed with the first 3 books. I thought the 1st 3 books were great. With the 4th book I felt it had started to fizzle out a bit, but it was still quite good. With this one I really began to get bored. Then, it would pick up again and become somewhat exciting again only to slog down again. There were some interesting developments such as Moraine's oath to Rand and Matt's predictable introduction into war strategy as well as Rand and Aviendha's closer relationship. Overall though, the pace has slowed down and I'm starting to live for the great moments in this series to happen while I trudge through the in-between parts.In defense of one of this series common complaints is Jordan's depiction of women. While I agree the little nuances of the women's personalities and differences with each other seem quite childish and they serve little purpose, they are not that far from truth nor is Jordan's take on the men especially the Two Rivers men, Rand, Matt, & Perrin. It always amuses me how each one thinks the other is so good with women while they think themselves terrible with women. So I don't mind Jordan's depiction of women because I find it quite accurate, I do mind a story that seems to focus too much upon it without getting on with the damn story. To clarify, my view that Jordan is pretty accurate depicting women isn't a knock on women. I love women and admire these traits. So I don't see them as childish. Men have the their own traits that women often have to straighten us out on. Anyway...whatever.When this series hits its stride it is something to behold so I will be moving on to Lord of Chaos, but this one definitely left me wanting. I guess it should be expected seeing how this series is a billion books in length. I know the good parts will be worth it, but piss on book 5!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A little background: I first read the first 6 books of the Wheel of Time in 1995, thinking at the time that those were ALL the books in the saga. How wrong I was, but then again the Internet was still in its infancy and I didn't have a mind to check for information about its completeness all the same. Disappointed by the lack of ending in sight I decided to not read a single more of these books until the last one came out, and over the years I've kept my decision.Fast forward 2013, the final book in the series is out and confronted with the decision of whether to pick up book seven and just read up or go back and start the series anew, I decided to read from book one again and, boy I am happy I decided to read them again. I'm not exactly a teenager any more but I've been enjoying reading the first books in the saga, really, really enjoying them. The Fires of Heaven is a beautifully written book, my favourite along with the Eye of the World among the first five books. Sufficiently fast paced, even a wee too much when considered the whole saga. It successfully creates an interesting new plot line for a few characters where you might be wondering why there were even brought up in prior books, and moves the story along quite nicely.I can't compare these books to the yardstick against which the genre seems to be measured against these days, RR Martin's work, since I won't be touching those until he is done with them, but suffice to say that in my opinion the first five books area amongst the greatest, if not the greatest, example of what defines this genre. Highly, doubtlessly, recommended, unless you are taken aghast by the sheer amount of reading you will enjoy if you plan on reading this epic through.Final Note: I have read some criticism regarding the pacing of some later books, I will make a point of reviewing those too when I get there, which shouldn't take long, even as a father (I certainly didn't have my current duties back in 1995) it's hard to put these down!!!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you are looking for Epic Fantasy in the order of Lord of the Rings. this is your author and series.

Book five is one of my favorites, because even while the recycled phrases and clich&eacute;s weigh down Jordan's prose, the developing characters speed the incredible epic forward. Fans of Perrin, Faile, and Loial may need to skim through this one, but other favorites flourish. Some of mine lived to see themselves become hateful, sniveling vermin *cough-Nynaeve-cough*, but at least *SPOILER* they find some redemption in the end. And by book five, it's too late to turn back.

His descriptive prose has a tendency to run on and on, especially in regards to clothing!But aside from that, now re-reading this series for a second time I find it even more enjoyable. Small victories are won as the story moves closer to Rand's ultimate battle with The Dark One. One of the best things about this particular installment is that the character of Matt who in the previous novels I just found plain annoying, is finally becoming a more well rounded and interesting character with some real purpose. The downside to the book is Perrin is not mentioned once. Fans who've enjoyed the series thus far will find more of the same, but with some new twists. And not everyone makes it through this time.Personally I find myself breaking the novels up instead of reading them one right after the other. That way I find you don't get burned out too quickly."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I do not quite agree with the previous review (the very long one) comparing WOT with The Lord of The Rings. No doubt, LOTR is definitely the top notch of Fantasy world because it opens a new epic of imagination. (Who've ever created such a fantastic world of imagination?) However, I believe that Robert Jordan has done a good job himself (his world is definitely not some RPG games)Although LOTR portrays beautiful languange and smooth writing that no Fantacy novels have yet beaten; I'm inclined to say that WOT has created a world that can stand in the same status as LOTR, if not better. LOTR is a tradition (where hobbits, elfs and different form of creatures dwell in the world). But WOT has outlived this tradition by developing a more &quot;human-based&quot; world. Much focus are on the human-human interaction instead of men fighting beasts. A whole new concept has evolved that deserves much merits. A good book does not necessarily follow the traditional trend of Fantasy.&quot;Fires of Heaven&quot; may not be as good as the previous books. But as I say, much patience is needed, then you'll appreciate the complexity of the WOT."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was really excited about reading this book when it came out because I had finished &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; in two days because I was so addicted to the Two Rivers/Perrin storyline.

Of the 5 I've read, this one is by far the best. The Lord Dragon learns more about weilding the One Power, about his destiny to fight Ba'alzamon, and keeps finding himself thrown about the pattern like a leaf in the wind. As beautifully detailed as one could wish for; you almost feel the taint of the dark one when Rand touches Saidin. The battles, the sorrow, the laughter. Jordan shocks and amazes. I can't wait to get number 6."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think this is one of Robert Jordan's better books. To all of you people who give the latter half of the series a poor review, I don't think that Robert Jordan's subtle use of detail and foreshadowing actually registers in your pitifully impotent and inadequate minds. Somebody earlier stated what dress Egwene and Elayne are wearing is inconsequential, but if you think about it you need all the detail that he puts in. in a book detail is the quinessential essence, the essence that creates a&quot;~ cinematic experience in ones mind and imagination. In the Fires of Heaven Robert Jordan creates one such experience in such a vivid way that leaves the reader in a lingering taboo of contemplation, hungering for more. All of this is created in such a tangible and malleable way to form the perfect picture in the reader's mind. So if a person cares not for detail, then he/she can't get anything much from this wonderful collection of extoardinary novels. throughout the books is amazing. In book one, the story takes place in Emond's Field, a small localized location. As the story progesses the point of veiw gradually grows larger, more grand. It grows to encompass whole regions, countries, eventually the whole continent. Overall what I am trying to say is that the use, the jordanesque flare, in The Fires Of Heaven is not unnecessarilly subtle nor brazen, but that of a perfect level to illustrate the extreme beauty and complex world of The Wheel of Time. All in all, The Fires of Heaven was most definately a great book and i can't believe anyone could think otherwise. Read it again, pay more attention to the detail which you think so poorly of. ~signed, the HMFIC"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is definitely better than Part 4 (TSR).

Robert was great in the beginning, but was unable to hold on, and lapsed into repetetiveness."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm going to start this review with an assumption; that you've read the first 4 books in the Wheel of Time series. I'm going to make a second assumption; that you're not sure if you want to embark on a 1000 page long journey to...wherever the next one goes.That's a start. If those assumptions are right, then this review may help you. If not, maybe this review will serve to give you an idea of how Jordan writes. Failing those 2, I have no idea why you might be reading this. But I'll do my best to entertain you.Jordan can put words together. Like a bricklayer, he can slap words down and cement them in place with the best of them. As you read the book, you never stumble through pages of narrative. If the procession of words is a foundation, Jordan builds a good one. It's fairly easy to walk through the pages of the book because Jordan is, in general, a good wordsmith. What's he not necessarily good at is getting to the point. His well built foundation often times supports a minimal structure.This book is better than the 4th in the series. But after several hundred pages, you begin to seriously wonder why you're still reading it. After roughly 600 pages, I asked myself, \\"Is this going anywhere?\\" I was reminded of the Talking Heads song, Road to Nowhere. I'm actually being serious.Eventually it does go somewhere, and that's what makes this book better than the 4th in the series. That, and the fact that the last 100 pages serve as the conclusion. In contrast, I think book #4 was wrapped up in about 5 pages. However, I'd be lying if I said I had trouble putting it down. The truth is, Jordan slogs through another loooooooong book to tell a relatively normal length story; but with a lot of words added to describe things you don't necessarily want to read.Jordan must work under some restriction where he is required to maintain a conservation of feminine anger in any book he writes. One of the problems I have with the average Jordan character is that they more often than not act like a pre-teen with a sour disposition. Resonant with this is Jordan's lack of character development. This book does a better job in that regard. However, some characters regress. Some that acted with composure in the previous books suddenly get, as strange as it sounds, immature.Another annoyance I have with Jordan is his vocabulary. In one sentence, he actually uses the expression, \\"Languid hauteur.\\" Are you serious? I feel as though I am the object of Jordan's attempt to learn a new word every week. I'm not here to build my vocabulary. I just want to read a fantasy story. Others have commented on this same phenomenon, so I'm not the only one who thinks that reading \\"haughty\\" 20 times in a 300 page stretch of narrative is odd.Another of Jordan's shortcomings is his ludicrous depiction of women. I'm not sure how many feminine rituals there are in the series now, but rest assured of this. No ritual exists in this book without female nudity. Whatever Jordan aims for with this, he misses so widely that I think he shot the wrong way. I won't even offer suggestions as to what exactly is going on there.I think we're supposed to be led to believe these books are built with a strong female presence. The reality of the matter is that most women in the book act like teenage girls who still think that boys might actually have cooties. The reverse is true also, with most male characters randomly veering off on his own train of thought in which he deduces every woman is 51 cards short of a deck. Maybe that's a fair assessment, considering the way Jordan portrays most of them.Even with all of this, the story is better than the last. The angry female characters are becoming less of an issue with Jordan, while building strength is becoming his predominant theme. The idea of the characters \\"building strength\\" is one I took from another reviewer, who suggests these stories are like a game of D&D; being played out in a book. I think there's a lot of truth to that opinion. Every chapter we have a new skill being developed or learned.All of that said, again, it is a decent read. You cold do worse. Yeah, I'm sure you could do better but I'm not very well versed in fantasy stories to be able to say. So I'll probably pick up the 6th book because I am compelled to find out what happens. Truth be told, as lengthy as the book is, it's refreshing to get your money's worth when you buy it. As opposed to some of these 250 pages books, Jordan's sure have a lot of meat on them.A final tidbit about the story. At this point, there are over 30 characters in the book. Each occupies a story line, no matter how trivial the character. Granted, they are often intertwined so we're not reading three dozen narratives at once. Still, there are so many that Jordan left out at least 5 major characters this time. An entire book went by with no mention of Perrin and that story. Mind you, there were 1000 pages in which to do this. That tells you just how laboriously the narrative thickly flows through these 1000 pages.Jordan's acceptance that not all the good guys can get out scot free is a step forward. As is his character development and the more robust final showdown. I still think he's got some work to do in terms of shoring up the details of his story. Every book ending is roughly predictable, and this one is no different. But this is probably worth picking up if you're not sure whether or not you want to continue."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am rereading the series for the umpteenth time, in anticipation of reading &quot;The Path of Daggers.&quot; I just finished TFOH. It seems each book in the series is better than its predecessor. Unlike Knight Michaels, who writes nearby, I found a lot of character growth in the book. And, I don't see what he means by his comment about &quot;...murdering characters....&quot;In TFOH, we see a lot of Rand. He emerges as a complex person. He seems somehow to fully understand that almost everybody wants to kill him or to use him for their own purposes, whether or not it helps the cause. He's the only one who has a holistic view about the nature of the conflict. He hardens himself like iron, using and commanding whole nations against his own nature. And yet, three pretty girls can put him through agonies of uncertainty and self-doubting.Prior to this book, we knew little about Elayne. Sure, she's a spoiled brat. She's also delightfully spunky and adventurous, and she too is learning how to deal with smart, energetic people like Thom Merrilin in a way that will help her become a ruler.Nynaeve has a ton of conflicts gnawing at her - her relationship with Lan, her feelings about Aes Sedai and Moiraine, being challenged by Egwene, etc. The stable, quiet world in which she lived for 25 years has been replaced by a maelstrom of currents, and she's having a hard time coping. But, she's tough as nails and fierce as a tigress, and she's a heavyweight with the One Power. The scenes with her and Moghedien in the Royal Palace are absolutely riveting.Mat continues his march to becoming my own favorite character. He would take the easy way out in every situation, but The Wheel won't let him. He is a reluctant hero at best. We see his powers growing in stages, and at each stage he surprises with his capability. Rand sees it too, and tests it and exploits it as he can. The scenes in the battle with the Shaido are gripping.As far as the general relations between men and women - hey, that's pretty much on target. That's why that other book about Mars and Venus was an all-time best seller. Let me introduce you to my half-dozen sisters-in-law sometime. They make Aes Sedai look like Brownies. They even sniff at stupid men just as do Jordan's women; and we men employ that same look that Thom and Juilin use when being put upon by Nynaeve or any others.Anyway, by the time this book is ended, all sorts of momentous and exciting things have happened. It's a delightful and essential building block in this epic series. Finally, keep in mind two things. First, only about two years have passed since Rand and gang, who except for Nynaeve were all teenagers, were routed out of the Two Rivers at the start of the series. The character changes they show seem reasonable to me.Second, those who suppose that Jordan is dragging this out to extort more money out of us: think a minute. Think about placing yourself behind a typewriter 8 to 12 hours a day, day in and day out, for YEARS on end. Think about devoting your life to pleasing all sorts of unappreciative people - for however long it takes to finish the stories. I'll be happy to pay $25 or whatever pittance he asks each year or two for as long as it takes to resolve this great story."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fifth book of the Wheel of Time Series, compells you to read on like those before it. Despite suffering from the same ailment as book 4 (The Shadow Rising), that is too much detail, The Fires of Heaven finally gives Moiraine a place in your heart, finally unwraps any built up dislike, and truly lets you see her as a real woman.The Forsaken (or Chosen as they call themselves) play an even larger role in this episode, revealing not only how much Rand has matured but also how far he has to go.The lack of any presence of Perrin only assures me that he has a larger role in future novels in this series, and the few brief glimpses of Emond's Field in Tel'aran'rhiod give you a glimpse and expectation of what's to come.I regret that I feel at times &quot;Where is this going? When does the end come?&quot;, all I need do is remind myself of the struggles of the people in the World that Jordan has so intricately constructed. The characters come alive as never before. Like real poeple, the depths of their personalities vary, but all are worth considering. If nothing else I can honestly say that when reading this and other books in the wheel of time, I do not read words on a page, but rather gaze about me and see the amazing and fantastic events unfold around me. I am always by the end of every installment, more than willing to read the next if only to visit with those who seem friends near and dear to me."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the 5th book in the Wheel of Time series. As with the other books of the series, I will rate and review the book on its own merits and not be influenced by any shortcomings of other books.First off is whether or not this book qualifies as a stand alone book. It has a clear cut beginning (Rand trying to decide what to do next after the events of the previous book). This storyline culminates in the events of Caemlyn, thus giving it a clear cut ending. I thus feel that this book is a stand alone book though much would not make sense to someone who hasn't read the previous books. There also still some unresolved threads making future books necessary as might be expected.What I liked:*Rand's growing strength in the power and finally growing confidence.*Resolution of a couple of problems (even though new ones arise)*Battles against the Forsaken, some long overdue*Further Intrigue*Mat's emerging skills as a tactician as well as more comedy at his expense.*Birgitte*Moiraine*Lanfear*The most argued about mystery in the whole Wheel of Time series!What I didn't like:*The pace slows down, particularly during the Elayne, Nynaeve, Birgitte quest. Even though some important events happen during this quest, it is still a tough read in those parts particularly when re-reading the book. I don't mind a slower pace as long as the information in it is relevant and leads to something climatic. A little more brevity in some parts would have been better. As one other reviewer alluded to, by this time in the series, we have firm pictures of the main characters in our minds and don't need a reintroduction to them or at least not THAT detailed of one.*The complete absence of Perrin! Of the many main characters, Perrin is one of the \\"big three\\". Those three should NEVER be excluded!In Summary:Despite the slower pace in some parts, this book still had a lot of enjoyable moments with an exciting and emotional ending. The slow parts were still relevant and in the least gave the reader a feeling for the arduous journey that some of the characters were on. As for Perrin being absent, I must admit that I'm glad that RJ didn't throw in some filler just to include him so maybe that's not so bad after all. The slow pace and occasional over description, though was enough for me to take away one star (It was still enjoyable enough to make me feel pain in doing that, though)."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time is probably the best-known and most widely read fantasy series other than The Lord of the Rings.When book one (The Eye of The World) was published in 1988 or 1989, it created a sensation -- a tremendous first volume that had the usual good-evil battle and tons of action but also was filled with magic, history, politics, sociology, cultural background and realistic characters.When I re-read the first five books, I was amazed at the details of history and politics that Jordan provided in his world. Jordan also has numerous protagonists, not just one or two primary ones like many other fantasy writers. Moreover, the series features strong men and, through their magical abilities and powerful personalities, stronger women. Jordan has been rightly lauded for the prominent and powerful roles he created for the female characters.The Great Hunt, The Dragon Reborn, The Shadow Rising and The Fires of Heaven followed and created a tremendous series such that The New York Times noted that Jordan had come to dominate the genre that Tolkien made famous.The Fires of Heaven is the most action-packed book of the series, with few dull moments and an explosive ending. The various protagonists continue their development, especially Mat (as a war commander) and Egwene. Rand continues to be pulled in many directions, but needs some help from his allies to survive.Nonetheless, this book is NOT a preview of things to come -- The Fires of Heaven's plot twists near the end (especially the most important one that would be a HUGE spoiler) are barely examined in books 6-9.Unfortunately, starting with Lord of Chaos (book 6), Jordan's creation became unwieldy. Instead of concentrating on following the themes and story-threads of books 1-5 (which combined are more than 3500 pages, hardcover), he created new storylines, bogged down the narrative and halted the pace of the epic. Book 8 in particular is an unmitigated disaster -- 650 pages (hardcover) with almost no progress to the story. Book 9 began to jump-start the narrative once again.The series is at 10 books (the tenth will be published in January 2003) and growing (13 total possible -- it's a common numerical theme in the books), thus the last volume will be published in 2006, at the earliest.Other than the final chapters of Lord of Chaos (book 6), this is the last of the good WoT books published to date. The Fires of Heaven is the blood-and-guts installment -- it has the highest body count, much war, scheming, conquest, hunting the evildoers, a couple of surprises and a fiery finish (hence the name). By the time you read this volume, you will most likely be addicted to the series as a whole; but if you hadn't made it this far, be forewarned that the pace, storyline, action and development slow down considerably in books 6-8."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The adventure fans considered book 3 or 4 the death of this series, where Jordan expands the series to cover power politics, intrigue, layers on layers of new places and characters, at the expense of the pace of the story. The rest (me included) saw this simply as Jordan filling his promise of giving Rand & Co more status and power, putting his highly detailed and complex world into full use - something I personally cheered for.It seems most people in this latter school of thought regularly name Book 6, 7 or 8 as the point where Jordan went haywire, writing chapters on things that could be passed with one page while practically not progressing the story at all, and annoying us to death with female characters, which instead of developing actually get worse, annoying and increasingly one dimensional.But IMHO Book 5 is where Jordan loses it. This is where the authorial self indulgence begins, with Elayne & Nynaeve bickering and traveling, making a turn at Amadicia to bicker and travel even more, have Birgitte join in, and (appropriately) join the circus to have a bickerfest with more freaks - for 400 pages. The whole thing could have been 3 chapters, ie. meeting Galad, introducing Birgitte, meeting the prophet. That is, if it wouldn't apparently be physically impossible for him to simply have them start the trip and reaching destination between chapters. This half of the book is where Jordan decides he can't pass anything no matter how trivial with a simple notion (unless, as we later learn, it would actually be something of cosequence).You'd think that after experiencing imminent danger to life and being captured and abused so many times, the women would at least accept someone to watch their backs, but no. Worms learn faster that Jordan's females. After getting some 500 electric shocks from one direction, worms actually pick another direction to crawl to. Jordan's women don't learn, or if they do, they forget it the next page.Jordan apparently loves his characters, getting into their boots, writing from their respective POVs. It seems writing this book he simply lost his interest in advancing the plot, or character development. Had he not done this, he would have been abandoned by the high adventure fans in any case, but at least kept those who like a mix of adventure, prophecies, politics, intrigue and epic battles, a'la Eddings for example.He apparently decided \\"to hell with what the readers want, it's my story, I write what I like\\". He's right, but he won't sell much books. I stopped buying them after this.Other good points about where things went wrong with WOT can be seen on the previous page, by Dennis Drury (Aug 1st 2004), to summarize too powerful \\"magic\\", overuse of characters apparently dying and coming back. Check it for elaboration, good pointers for more \\"epic\\" fantasy writers than just Jordan."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you like the series, there is no reason to stop with book four, but if you are getting tired of the series then don't bother reading The Fires of Heaven.First, the reasons to read the book:There is a surprising betrayal - a darkfriend in their midst.Matt achieves much personal glory.There is a huge battle.They don't do as much of their corny foul language like \\"Burn me!\\"One of the seven main characters dies.One of the seven main characters has sex.Now, for the reasons to not read the book:The events above are not as interesting as they sound. The sense of wonder in The Eye of the World is gone. The feeling of discovering a new world is gone.The suspense is gone. For example, the characters no longer have to rest in order to recharge their ability to channel like Moraine did in The Eye of the World. Sometimes they will just keep channeling spectacular feats all day long. There are no suspenseful chases or escapes.The characters torment each other even more than before.The women are even more bossy than before.Perrin does not appear in the whole book.Predictably, Rand learns more from Asmodean, but he still hasn't made an effort to learn how to block women from channeling because he needed a woman to practice on, and he was too proud to ask. What a jerk!We learn that Rand can't hurt a woman even if it means death and suffering for all women for all eternity. That's OK with him just as long as no woman is hurt by him personally. What a jerk!Balefire works really well, so they decide they had better not use it. What a bunch of jerks!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There are certainly both positive and negative things about this book and the Wheel of Time series as a whole.There are only a certain number of ways we can read about how wonderful and terrible saidin can feel. Ice and fire, sweetness and vileness, etc. ad nauseum. But the reader gets the impression that Jordan wants us to understand exactly how it feels for male channelers, and the constant repetition of sweetness and vileness makes the end of Winter's Heart all the more poignant, even moving.I have to take issue with previous reviewers' problems with the book. Elayne, Nynaeve, Egwene, Rand, Mat etc. all act juvenile BECAUSE THEY ARE JUVENILE. Even Nynaeve, the eldest of this young group, is understood to be no older than 25. Being 24 myself, I can testify that these individuals are acting exactly as many of my peers would act given the same situations. I can't imagine what kind of stress it would produce to have the kinds of life-altering experiences these people have had. I understand it is fiction, but I think Jordan has done an excellent job portraying realistic characters and their reactions.I also don't understand one reviewer's statement about \\"Jordan's juvenile obsession with female nudity and sexuality.\\" Honestly, the male characters are naked or in their \\"smallclothes\\" just as often as the girls are naked or in their \\"shifts\\". I would have to say Jordan is again being realistic. People change clothes. It happens. I think Jordan has anything BUT an obsession with nudity. He doesn't go into medical detail about body parts like some writers. Heck, one of our main characters didn't even have sex until the FOURTH book in the series. Sex is not meant to be a driving point in the story.Speaking of the story, I would have to join others in saying that the series has gone on longer than it maybe should have. But I'm sure Jordan is well aware of this fact himself, and doesn't need US to tell him that. That whole \\"many-headed monster\\" idea is probably truer than we think. As a budding writer myself, I can't imagine how difficult it would be to keep track of as many characters and storylines as Jordan is juggling. I would have to say he's doing admirably. Bravo, sir!I believe the story is meant to have a web, or Pattern. As I read the story AGAIN, I am struck by how clear it is that events are drawing to a conclusion, however bleak, far-off, and long-awaited it might be. I'm willing to wait and I respect Jordan as a writer trying to write the best story he can.I believe it was Stephen King (and please forgive me if I'm wrong) who once said, \\"Sometimes a story is just a story.\\" I think we, as readers, would do well to remember that. I've been a fan of fantasy for as long as I've been able to read. In a literary sense, of course certain authors (Tolkien being a good example) are going to be better than others. Tolkien is probably looking down from whatever cloud he may be sitting on, and wishing we would all just let the authors in the genre he really created simply TELL THEIR OWN STORY. I think we need to stop comparing EVERYONE in the fantasy genre to Tolkien, LeGuin and others. Personally, I don't care for LeGuin. But that's my opinion. If you like Jordan's books, good for you. If you don't, well then good for you too. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.Before I close this review, I would like to remind the readers who keep comparing Tolkien and Jordan of one thing. Please remember the VOLUMES of material concerning Middle-Earth that Tolkien never had a chance to have published before his death. I believe the \\"History of Middle-Earth\\" is pretty close to 12 volumes, if not more. Jordan doesn't have to worry about a professorship at Oxford, so he therefore has the time to do what Tolkien never did . . . truly complete his epic.I say again, Bravo Sir!!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fifth volume in the WoT series is the one where it becomes more or less official that Jordan is juggling too many subplots. For an entire book he loses track of one of his central characters, Perrin. And yet he really isn't doing anything to resolve all these storylines, instead he's building up more. In this book, for instance, Morgase runs away from her court to try to reclaim real power from Gaebril, a development that goes nowhere in this book but presumably will be used in future volumes. At the end, a character is murdered, leading to a mystery that will have to be unraveled at some future point. And, as in #4, another Seanchan character is introduced, then led offstage - where I can't really believe she'll stay - at the end of the book.In this book, we have too little real plot advancement and far too much display of general bitchiness from Nynaeve, Elayne, Siuan, and Aviendha, all of whom act like they have PMS 24/7.In spite of this, the book works pretty well. That's partly because it has a real ending, which #4 largely lacked. As part of that ending, a character is killed off who we had thought of as too central to the plot to die. But there's a bit of mystery, leading to the possibility that he/she might still be alive. The death isn't without elements of mawkishness, but I still found it moving enough to upgrade my opinion of the book as a whole, which probably would only have gotten 3 stars otherwise.Incidentally, if you haven't already read the book, skip over the review directly under this in chronological order, written by someone who hasn't grasped the basic principal that reviews aren't supposed to include major spoilers."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I gave it two stars because, other than the big battle about 3/4 of the way through, it was too slow! Perrin wasn't even in the book at all, and he is my favorite charater. This book is definitly not up to par with its predecesors."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's series is interesting and imaginative, there's no disputing that. However, I find that it rather resembles a retelling of the Star Wars story in a Middle-Earth atmosphere. First, you have your young people struggling to learn about and use a magical power. You have spunky princesses and love triangles (or other multi-sided polygons). You have heroes with questionable parentage. You have a potential romance that develops into a more fillial relationship (rather abruptly, might I add), and of course there's the fact that Aiel spelled backwards is Leia (ok, maybe that's stretching it). and then, for good measure, there's a dose of Tolkein in the form of Trollocs (creatures that seem quite similar to Orcs) and Fades (remember that black riders in Fellowship?). But anyway, even if the series isn't completely original, at least Jordan had good inspiration and fresh presentation. Over-all I'd say book number 5 is as interesting as all the others so far, and I reccomend the series to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre. However- I have just one more beef. Mr. Jordan, it's time to use some new descriptions. &quot;honey-colored hair&quot; and &quot;plumply-pretty&quot; were clever the first several times you used them, now their starting to sound rather hackneyed..."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes.but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation.the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have just been rereading the series and have had a strange suspicion...I do not believe this series is being written by the same person. First of all, the every book is written with a slightly different style. Second, there are many inconsistencies in the series for example some of Min's viewings from the first book never show up later, maybe they are still yet to come? or were forgotten or not used by successive authors. Also starting with this book, book 5, many inconsistencies begin to show up, for example, at the end of book 4 the Avendesora tree in Rhuidean has only one limb broken, but in the beginning of book 5 it is burnt to a crisp...Finally, while there are many appearances of &quot;Robert Jordan&quot; at various events, the appearance of having just one author would not be hard to do, and &quot;Robert Jordan&quot; is actually the main character in a book entitled &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; by Hemingway!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Unfortunately I found FoH to be an unfulfilling novel, on the whole, considering it's the 5th book in the series. It's not necessarily worse than the first 3 novels, but rather a rehashing of past themes and plot devices in such a manner that it does not warrant 900 odd pages - especially after the excellent 4th book, Shadow Rising, I can't help but feel somewhat let down.Still it isn't a total loss by any means. For example, I feel that the continued excellent use of Matt provides a standout character that is interesting and one that you truly begin to care about. Of course Matt alone doesn't carry the novel but I hope that Book 6 can revitalise the series by adding a new dimension or two."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fifth book had exellent plots that made it seem half as long as it was.

I have come halfway through Book Five so far in the series, and although Mr. Jordan spins a fair yarn, I am constantly annoyed about errors in spelling, grammar, and story flow, all of which a good editor would catch and have corrected. All too often, what is said on page n jars with what is said on page m: Obviously some editing was done, but not all references &quot;cleaned up&quot;.The worst example of sloppy writing so far has to be: &quot;Except that his step was lighter and he felt full of vinegar&quot; (pg 669, Book Five). Gee a guy a break. Now, I am no native speaker, but I am virtually certain that this bit was not a particularly witty twist of words, but rather a skillful (snort) mangling of &quot;vigor&quot; to &quot;vinegar&quot;, however it happened.Ah, enough ranting, I guess.

The sheer size of &quot;Fires&quot; is impressive, so I snuggled down to chew this one up, prepared for the literary ride of my life.... and found that this book has nothing. There is no content in this book that can explain the 800 plus pages. I somehow finished it and to this day, can't remember a thing that was in it. All I recall is the ending was great, the last 50 or so pages were tremendous, but everything else was a waste of paper. What got accomplished in this book? I can't recall anything in this book, whatever emotions I had...who knows? All I remember thinking is that Mr.Jordan should have ended this series long ago, with book 3. Instead, he insists on churning out huge volume after huge volume, and expects people (rightfully so, because they are) to eat these books up. I'm sorry, but 8 volumes of this is too much. I made it to &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; but gave up after that. Book 1 was great, book 2, book 3...and then it started to dwindle away, to utter monotony and repetitive, bone-dry BORING fantasy. &quot;Fires of Heaven&quot; may be considered a classic by Jordan fans, but I feel like a threw down _ bucks for a large block of paper.

Mr.Jordan, END IT."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In his fifth installation of the Wheel of Time, Robert Jordan reaches perhaps his apex in plot and twists. Basically what happens in the book is Rand leaves the Aiel Waste to pursue the renegade Shaido Clan, while Nynaeve and Elayne seek the hiding Aes Sedia, who have opposed Elaida and the new regime within the White Tower. And through all this, Perinn frees his home town from the grip of Whitecloaks and Trollocs. The plot of this story is magnificent, and the twists superb. But once again, characterizations and length are the downfalls of this book. Mr. Jordan really must do something about making his charcters more likable, except for Perrin, they are all spoiled, annoying, bossy, hypocrites, and act more like children, rather than great heros. He also seems to have a very negative view of gender relations. And because of his excess of detail, parts of the book drag on.

I don't understand the inconsistency and I also think it's a bit much. $5.99 seems a more reasonable price for books that have been out for a while. If the book were new, then that price would seem more reasonable. I will probably read the rest of them in book form that i already have."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Fires of Heaven is book 5 of 14 in The Wheel of Time series. By book 5 the series is firmly in Act 2 of 4. I think Act 2 (books 4-6) is the best collective group of the books in the first 3 acts, but book 5 doesn't really stand up to books 4 and 6, both of which are commonly mentioned by fans of the series as their favorite. The Fires of Heaven is notable for its heavy focus on Nynaeve and the almost tangential menagerie storyline, its introduction of some major themes and types of action sequences we will see much more of, and for the first time the complete absence of a major character (Perrin). Along with Lord of Chaos, The Fires of Heaven probably has the best climax of any of the books in the series.Any series stretching over 4MM words has an unenviable task of balancing between recapping too much in an effort to remind readers of what they read perhaps years before and recapping too little and leaving everyone lost. The Fires of Heaven is the first book in my re-read (the full 14, at 1 book a month) to annoy me with the amount of recapping and repetitive exposition given.I was much closer to the age of our younger protagonists (Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, and Elayne) when I started reading the Wheel of Time. In a mark of how long its finale has been in the making, I am now several years older than Nynaeve. I was a bit concerned when I began re-reading the entire series in anticipation of the release of A Memory of Light that I would now find the younger characters' immaturity too off-putting. Thankfully, that is not the case (I find Faile's immaturity grating, but that was always true). What I have found is that I have a newfound appreciation for the older characters. And that is no truer for any character than for Nynaeve. She has gone from one of my least favorite characters to one of my most favorite. I can better appreciate her now, but The Fires of Heaven is still Nynaeve at her worst. In her broader character arc, she is firmly in phase 2 of 3. She has lost the position of authority she held at the beginning of the series, and her younger female companions are beginning to outstrip her, but she has yet to begin really growing as a person.The Fires of Heaven heavily features Nynaeve (she is arguably the main character of the book along with Rand), but her storyline, and the menagerie storyline it is a part of, aren't terribly relevant for the larger series relative to the attention they are given. Certainly, if you find the way Jordan writes women off-putting, you will be a bit exasperated. The women are heavily featured and they are at the Jordan-stereotype worst. The menagerie storyline is also uncharacteristically humor-heavy, which some readers will find jarring. Nynaeve does, however, shows shades of her \\"Act 3\\" self at the end--her role in the climax is particularly apropos to her final arc.The Fires of Heaven introduces some things we'll be seeing a lot of later on in the series. Jordan focuses for the first time large scale battle scenes (Tarwin's Gap and the battle at the end of The Great Hunt were sort of secondary). There will be many, many more battles as the series rolls on, and Jordan writes about battles and tactics at a broad level very well. Rand continues to grow in power, but we begin to really see the emotional toll his duty is taking on him and his sanity begin to crack. Rand's mental state will be VERY central to the story going forward.The Fires of Heaven has one of the better original covers. For the first time the clothes appear as described, the coloring on the three characters shown is right, and the trollocs are depicted as humanoid rather than human. And the architecture, as always, is beautiful. The title, on the other hand, is one of the worst. It is pulled from a prophecy with only the most esoteric ties to the book 5 storylines and references a concept (heaven) unknown (or at least unmentioned) in a world with reincarnation.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

I have given up on this series after slogging through the first 4 1/2 books (I gave the series a reasonable chance), because there are too many other good things to read out there and I can't devote any more precious reading time to a series that does nothing for me.The background story/universe of this series had a lot of potential, but it is never realized. This book and all the books so far (and, I'm assuming the rest of the books would follow suit) are about 85% repetitive filler, 10% new/interesting background material, and 5% events and developments that actually move the story forward (and very little of this being what I would call 'action'; action in this series is quite tame - I almost said 'lame'). Most of the background material, of the universe itself or the characters, is the same background material stated over and over again; so the characters (and the universe itself) do not actually have any depth or complexity. I think that Jordan does this to continually bring what might be new readers up to speed, which completely annoys me. To have to read 600 pages for only a few (I'm not exaggerating here) moments of wonder, awe, surprise, shock, sadness, concern, etc., or even just the story moving forward (the rest of the time spent thinking, 'OK, I've already learned this information 5 times in the first 3 books, when is something actually going to happen?) is not even close to being worth the effort.I do want to recommend one fantasy series that I feel is one of the best things I've ever read (in any genre), and which excels at these qualities I find so lacking in Jordan's series - and that is Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. All 5 stars, all awe-inspiring, with a far, far richer universe and hundreds of characters all with their own personalities and who you care about, unbelievably exciting and compelling (and brutal) action, revelations coming at breakneck speed, all the threads coming together beautifully in the end. One warning: there is no catering to possibly new readers; you are continually dropped into the story and may need some time/effort to figure out what's going on, just like the characters in the story; and you may have a hard time keeping it all straight, or remembering all the key threads or how they relate to each other, just like real life.

(personaly if I was Rand and all these women threw themself's at me I would go for it. what the hell you only live once), it looks like Min's prediction of 3 women falling in love with Rand has come true, the 3 women are Min, Elayne.and Aviendha, ( even if Aviendha hasn't admited it out loud, I could be wrong about Aviendha since I'm only on book 6 but at this point I'm sure it's Aviendha) It looks like Nynaeve and Egwene's relationship has turned around and Egwene is standing up to Nynaeve and becoming a (in my opinion) know-it-all plus she is be coming inpatient with her teachers and doesn't seem to care about the dangers as long as she learns everything. I'm glad that the Wise Ones punished her and showed her that she doesn't know as much as thinks she does. Egwene needs to learn to take directions and orders even if she doesn't like it, it is for her own good.

But the only thing that made this book a four star instead of a five star was that Perrin is hardly mentioned."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was great! The way Jordan will send some kind of twist to the story and get you excited is magnificent. Jordan loves to hit you with the excitement when you least expect it, then let you calm down and hit you with one again. As with all of the books so far you do not know what to expect until it happens. The only thing I did not like about this book was the absence of Perrin anywhere in the book. Other than that Jordan gives the characters old and new more depth and life. So far I have been quite pleased with the series as it becomes more interesting with each book. Hopefully, book six will be just as good, if not better than this one."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I should probably stop being amazed by RJ's talent (capitalized?) for writing... this series is already epic and getting better by the word! The death of two characters at once is shocking, to say the least, and I can't blame Rand for feeling how he does, doing all he can to keep from killing a woman and his lack of action kills 2 and injures two more. That meeting in the prologue between the four Forsaken is worrisome at best... but what's on Lanfear's agenda, lying about Asmodean? I'm wondering how long Rand has, both till the Last Battle and until he goes crazy. He will definately need help to win against the Dark One, though... it took 101 of the most powerful channelers besides the Forsaken to lock the Dark One up again the last time. It was more than time for the girls to get out of Tarabon altogether, what with an angry Moghedien on their tails. All in all, this makes for a great read. I can't find flaws or discrepacies: RJ is obviously keeping tabs on what happens when. It's clear he gave up any attempt to control this size of the series within the first 5 chapters of Book One, and all the better. A series this big, there's no way to control it and make it this good. Keep it up, RJ!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the much anticipated sequel to &quot;The Shadow Rising.&quot; Rand has entered Rhuidean and has been marked by two dragons, one for each arm.

It's commendable the way Jordan has cast women into powerful roles in the series, but he has done so to a fault. It seems to me that women are not only equal to the men, but superior. The women can hardly say anything at all about the men without some dispariging remark. If the roles were reversed and the comments about the men were made about women, the series wouldn't survive. This book seems to be the culmination of predominant sexist theme in the book. The sexism is the antithesis of what we see in the real world, and it is just as irritating. The book itself is good if you can ignore this feature, or if it doesn't bother you. The idea of Elayne bonding Rand just seems absurd to me and it castrates what should be the most powerful character in the series. Of course I'll keep reading, I have too much time invested in the series to stop now."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm actually listening to these books on audio while I wait and wait and wait for George R.R.

Wow, what a concept, GRRM could certainly churn out just as much blather as Jordan has been.I actually hated the first book in this series, but I kept on because in my one hour commute to work I have nothing better to do than listen to how men cannot understand women and how women think men are bullheaded/arrogant/stupid/selfish and oh did I mention stubborn? I put up with the male/female characters tiring global stereotypes of the opposite gender in books 2-4 because it didn't detract (too much) from the main plot of the books. Here's where it all went wrong. There are about 5-6 interesting things that happen in this book to further expand the \\"pattern\\", the rest is filler and really annoying/tiring filler at that.The few interesting chapters from Mat's perspective push my rating up from a 1 to a 2 star rating. Some of the stuff from Rand's perspective is also pretty well written. That's it though, seriously.Despite all this I find that I just can't jump off this now clearly sinking ship.

Suian and Leane have been stilled and spirited out of Tar Valon by Min Farshaw with some help by Laras. Laras, I will miss you. You were fun and would make for an interesting prequel. Now Suian, Leane, Min, and Logain must find a gathering of rebel Aes Sedai and convince the women there that their best interest is to support Rand al'Thor, The Dragon Reborn.In the Aiel Waste, Rand is confronted by attacks from the Forsaken. And it is a race for him to learn as much about the power as he can from his captive Forsaken, Asmodean. Captured with the help of Lanfear only because she intends for Rand to learn enough to be a worthy companion to herself. Meanwhile other Forsaken plot to lay a trap for him that will see him dead. But first Rand must deal with Couladin. As Couladin leaves the waste with an army, and lays siege to Cairhien, Rand is forced by events to follow and wage war against Couladin and the Shaido. And somehow Rand must avoid a trap set for him by a group of Forsaken. But even after he deals with Couladin, Rand must journey to Caemlyn to confront the Forsaken Rahvin.Far to the west, Elayne and Nynaeve leave Tanchico behind, setting out for The White Tower. They don't know that Moghedian is searching for them and following their every step. Learning of the break in the White Tower and of the stilling of the Amyrlin, they too now plan to join the rebel Aes Sedai. With Moghedian in pursuit, they join a traveling menagerie and attempt to disguise themselves from her, while somehow making it to Salidar.Coming to a dramatic conclusion in Caemlyn where Rand and Nynaeve join up to fight against Moghedian and Rahvin, The Fires of Heaven is one of the best books of the series. Most of the book is told from either Rand's or Nynaeve's point of view. This helps move the plot line along without too many deviations. Plus, because there is no Perrin, there is no Faile. For that last bit alone, I would give this book six stars. On the other hand, because there is so much Nynaeve there is a lot of sniffing. Loud sniffing. Jordan not only has the women sniff more than ever, but he discovered the adjective 'loud' and applies liberally.I've been keeping track of the sniffs in the book because Jordan has his women sniff way too much.

In the first four books, that was fine, and worked to make up a beautiful tapestry that really drew the reader into a believable world. In book five, *The Fires of Heaven*, that was a huge drawback.The camaraderie was gone, for the most part. The characters still talked and discussed, to be sure, but it was seemingly each fractured group *competing against* each other, instead of *working with* each other. It seemed like the desire to get more control and power for each person's parochial interests was what mattered the most to some of the characters. *CoughEgweneCough*Other characters seemed to revel in a certain amount of cruelty. The culture of the Aiel, which is easy to value for it's warrior ways, is shown to have an extremely dark side. One character that they don't know is a dark friend, but do know to be a thief, they punish to a horrible extent, in a manner seemed designed more for getting their jollies than for any actual purpose. Did they want information or money, or any reward from her? No. They wanted suffering. That, and the cold way they looked at the deaths of those related to those who offended them years ago, really disgusted me.To get to the pont of Egwene. She discovers that in the Dream World of Tel'Aran'Rhiod, she has greater power then Nynaeve, even when Nynaeve can channel. This is due to Egwene's training with the Aiel Wise Ones and her natural gift for dreaming. Nynaeve is strongest at healing though good at everything. Egwene is similarly strongest at dreaming, though she can do other things with the One Power as well.Well, Egwene basically rubs Nynaeve's face in her weaker state when they see each other in dreams. She lies, acts like a huge hypocrite, and, worst of all, she is not sorry for being unkind to Nynaeve. She actually *enjoys it*. She enjoys having power over others. That creeped me out more than anything else about her attitude in the novel, I must say.Anyone who goes to war will be affected in different ways. Jordan himself stated that he was trying to work through his Vietnam experiences while writing the books.*\\"I do think the military characters in my fantasy novels are more realistic in terms of how soldiers really are, how they feel about combat, about being soldiers, about civilians. Beyond that, my time in Vietnam certainly has affected a certain moral vision. Not just based on what happened to me, but on the abandonment of a people who had put everything on the line for us. It started me off on a quest for morality, both in religious and philosophical reading, and in my writing. Again one of the central themes in 'The Wheel of Time' is the struggle between the forces of good and evil. How far can one go in fighting evil before becoming like evil itself? Or do you maintain your purity at the cost of evil's victory? I'm fond of saying that if the answer is too easy, you've probably asked the wrong question.\\"*Jordan was obviously haunted by his experiences, which is understandable. So am I. So are all who see combat. What matters is what one takes away from the experience. Now, maybe I am completely wrong in my assessment of Jordan. Perhaps later books will dispel my fears quite nicely. I don't know. I hope so.It seems that Jordan had accepted an idea that necessary actions, such as killing, torture, harsh interrogations or actions, and so forth, are good. Not just bad things sometimes justifiable and necessary, but actually good. He seemed to have a view of power as good in it's own right. To be enjoyed without all of the guilt associated with those who are reluctant to use it.If I am reading too much into it, so be it, and I hope that I am wrong. My experience was that power should be used, but never, ever enjoyed. Power is a good tool, but is not good in and of itself. Those who enjoy lording it over others are only one tiny step away from those they oppose. Doing harsh things for necessary reasons, is one thing. Doing harsh things for enjoyment is another. The former is good, the latter is evil. That is my lesson from war. Power and harsh treatments can do good, but themselves are not good. They are deadly in fact. I can't condone Jordan's view on power and enjoyment of harsh behavior. His experiences and mine simply lead to two completely contradictory visions of warfare. In other words, we may probably have agreed on tactics and actions to take, but diverged greatly in the mindset and moral vision behind the methods we may use.Now, it seems that I am on the way to a low rating, but not really. There were three plot lines that salvaged the book and actually made it enjoyable to me. They are Moiraine and Rand learning from each other, Mat accepting more and more his role as a ta'veren, warrior, and champion for the Light and the Wheel, and Nynaeve, Elayne, and Birgitte, as Nyanaeve is forced to grow up some.Seeing the friendship, even though greatly strained between Moiraine, Rand, Mat, Avhienda, on the one hand; and Nynaeve, Elayne, and Birgitte on the other; was a pleasure and brought back to me just *why* I *love* the series so much. Of course, there is still the matter of Rand's inevitable polygamy, but it's more of an epic-y myth like the ancient myths to me. Jordan was careful to do no gratuitous swipes against Christianity like many other fantasy authors do. *CoughTerryGoodkinCough* ;)All in all, the weakest of the series so far, and presents some disturbing aspects of the so-called \\"heroes\\". However, there *were* also some fine parts of the novel, that have saved it from a bad score and the not recommended pile. I recommend it, but primarily for the above plot threads. You'd be better off skipping the other parts of the book."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After two good books and two excellent books, Jordan's series continues to get better and better and better. The Fires of Heaven tops even the sprawlingly complex \\"The Shadow Rising\\" with it's deep character development, faster pace, and excellent climax.The Fires of Heaven might have the most characters of any book so far, with a whopping eighteen major characters, each of whom have their own points of view at one point or another. However, that's a poor indicator of how the series is divided. Most of the book is dominated by Rand al'Thor and Nynaeve(arrgghh . . .), each of whom has about 30% of the book. Egwene, Elayne, and Mat each have significantly smaller POVs(though Elayne is present in most of Nynaeve's chapters), and following are thirteen characters who's POVs are only seen briefly.Perrin is largely absent from this book, having no POV and only appearing in a brief cameo. The book itself is mostly divided into two key story arcs: Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilan traveling while they seek the rebel Aes Sedai and encounter Moghedien. And Rand(along with Egwene, Mat, Moiraine, Lan, Aviendha, and Asmodean) as he takes his Aiel forces over the Spine of the World to defeat the Shaido and take control of Cairhien.Character development reaches an even higher peak than in previous books. Rand and Elayne get the brunt of it, but every character benefits in some way or another. However, the annoyingness of several characters is really building. Egwene and Aviendha are almost at Nynaeve's level now.(I applaud Rand's ability to remain stoic most of the time.) However, Egwene compensates partially for this when she calls Nynaeve out and gives her a taste of her own medicine(quite literally . . .) while in the world of dreams.Of the storylines, Rand's is undoubtedly the best. Elayne's and Nynaeve's is certainly interesting, but gets bogged down in places with unnecessary details. Of particular note is the menagerie, a section that could be skipped with almost no problem for the rest of the story.Earlier than that in the storyline, is a particular incident that I'd like to mention. Elayne beats any previous episode of weirdness in any character when she flirts with Thom.(!!!) When Nynaeve blows the whistle on her bizarre behavior, Elayne's explanation seems to indicate that she isn't really being serious, and she isn't entirely sure that Rand isn't looking at other women. Wait, what? I thought for sure at the time that it would be the definite crowning moment of WTF factor in the whole book, if not the whole Wheel of Time series . . . but I thought too soon.Some time later, Rand topped Elayne. Apparently, Elayne's little stunt triggered a karma-backlash that came back to bit her, in the form of the crazy chapter, \\"The Far Snows.\\" If Elayne raised the WTF factor to the roof, Rand propelled it into the stratosphere. After I was recovered from being totally and completely shocked out of my skull, I cursed out loud and threw the book across the room.All right, I think it's time someone said it. Rand is apparently just too attractive for his own good. Elayne and Min are both head-over-heels. Lanfear has a very unhealthy obsession with him. Aviendha doesn't let the apparent fact that she hates his guts get in the way of her overpowering, all-consuming lust for him. Who's next?The Fires of Heaven finishes strongly, with the last several chapters packed with explosive action. It is prefixed by an awesome scene where Rand totally loses it and goes on a roaring rampage of revenge against one of the Forsaken. When I read that scene, I knew without a doubt that there was only one way this book would end: Rand flourishing Rahvin's severed head in the air and bellowing victory. I almost felt sorry for the poor Darkfriend.Rand fights two Forsaken(separately) in the last few chapters. The first such incident is an absolutely amazing, spectacular, breathtaking one-on-one duel, which is sadly hampered down by Rand's ridiculous inhibitions about harming a female, even a BLOODY FORSAKEN TRYING TO KILL HIM. Argh. The second such fight is also intense, though it comes with the problem of Rahvin's cowardice. Why do the Forsaken, the strongest wielders of the One Power in the world, always run away?The Fires of Heaven starts strong, stays strong, and ends strong, populated with awesome characters and built with massive complexity and deft worldbuilding and very few problems or flaws. So far, the Wheel of Time has not only maintained it's pace but improved with every subsequent novel. I'm currently reading Lord of Chaos, and can't help but wonder the dreadful question: When will the glory end, and when will the infamous decline of the series begin?4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the second go around in the series.

Approximately the first third of the novel contains so much recap and repetition that, if I'd had \\"my hair in a proper braid,\\" I would have been yanking it as often as Nynaeve does.The formula for the first 100 pages or so goes something like this: One or two lines of dialogue, two paragraphs of backstory, another line of dialogue, another couple of paragraphs of backstory... It felt like the proverbial \\"one step forward, two steps back!\\"I managed to stick with it, though, only because I was listening to it on audiobook (and therefore only half listening while I accomplished something else at the same time) and because I wanted to write a review. Besides, I found it immensely entertaining when I could complete Robert Jordan's sentences for him... &lt;&lt;Heavy sigh>>...In The Fires of Heaven, we never see Perrin or Faile, which is fine with me. There is an interesting plot-line involving Siuan Sanche, Logain, and Gareth Bryne. Rand's adoption of Asmodean is entertaining, too -- I like that we're not really sure which side Asmodean and Lanfear are on. The plot does finally move forward a bit, but it takes way too long to do so. The book could have easily been cut to half its size and been better for it. If I had been the editor, I would have taken a blue pen to all instances of:* females obsessing about the modesty of their clothing* males obsessing about the modesty of female clothing* needless skirt smoothing and straightening* silk clinging to hips and breasts* shivering or sweating that has nothing to do with the weather* disgusted talk about not understanding the opposite sex* braid pulling, tugging, and yanking* sniffing* thoughts or actual instances of bottoms being switched or spanked* Nynaeve's cat fightsI would also have fixed these sentences (because they don't mean what Mr Jordan meant them to mean):* \\"From the shine in Siuan's blue eyes, she had learned something.\\"* \\"From the horrified look on Mat's face, he was gathering his strength to run.\\"* \\"From the noise roaring out of the inn, the crowd inside was big enough to hide an army.\\"* \\"One man, a tall fellow in a ragged red coat that had belonged to someone else once by its green and gold embroidery, ran out in front of the others on long legs, shaking a wood axe overhead.\\"* \\"More like a palace, by the number of pages.\\"At this point, I'm quickly loosing patience as The Wheel of Time quickly looses steam. That's a shame, because the story itself is very good -- but it's just too hard to extract it from the dross."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think that the Wheel of Time series suffers from the fact that it has taken over 15 years for Jordan to get as far as he has. Alot of people stopped liking this series starting with this book, and if I had started reading them in 1988, I probably would to.However, this is not a series of books that can simply be seen as single, separate entities, this is a massive epic, and each volume has its own purpose. I have started reading this series with book #1 and simply gone through each in turn.Jordan writes his books with a distict eye on the social aspects of his world. We witness the turn of events in his novels as a person of that world would. Tainted by the viewpoints and prejiduce of its people. This is a refreshing idea in fantasy, where many books orient themselves into distinct and static plot lines.Jordan breaks many barriers in fantasy: Strong female characters (sometimes debated), exploring complex personal relationships, characters that think and feel. These aren't just hack and slash heroes, they ponder the right and wrong of their actions, and constantly find themselves in doubt over their justifications.Think about each book in a bigger picture, and you'll find that they not only fit together cohesively, but that you'll be yearning for more. If I had any complaint, it would be that new work on this series takes awhile to surface.For readers that enjoy this type of reading, I would also recommend the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. Dark Tower probably isn't typical fantasy, but it is a very good read."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Ah . . . if only Robert Jordan could go back to the end of this novel and we could forget what came after.

There were the accepted on their journey after the Black Ajah, there was the new army in the Two Rivers, and there was Egwene learning about dreams. None of that was resolved until the next book. Instead, this is all about Rand travelling with the Aiel, occassionally stopping on the increasingly uninteresting travels of Nynaeve and Elayne.

The story seems somewhat juvenile in perspective in Jordan's rendering of the main 3 boys. Their ongoing immaturity (and internal process) grow tiring which is not an endearing characteristic, considering they are the protagonists. It leaves the impression the series is written for children, not unlike Harry Potter. Hopefully this will improve, or I may not make it much further into the series.Beyond this, the world they dwell in his somewhat well constructed, though the whole doesn't measure up to Tolkien's total rendering of Middle Earth, its languages and the layers of ages he created in the LOTR/Simarillian/Hobbit, etc. Perhaps I expect too much from Mr. Jordan, and though the comparisons are commonly made, I don't see it. Not in the same league to me at all!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The fifth Wheel of Time Book does not disappoint as it continues the story of the 3 men and 2 women caught up in great events that will eventually wind up in a battle for their world.

Other than that the book was in good condition."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thought the books would have to get less interesting as the series progressed but I have to say I've enjoyed every single book in the series to date. Definitely recommend."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am rereading the series for the umpteenth time, in anticipation of reading &quot;The Path of Daggers.&quot; I just finished TFOH. It seems each book in the series is better than its predecessor. Unlike Knight Michaels, who writes nearby, I found a lot of character growth in the book. And, I don't see what he means by his comment about &quot;...murdering characters....&quot; Rand emerges as a complex person. He seems somehow to fully understand that almost everybody wants to kill him or to use him for their own purposes, whether or not it helps the cause. He's the only one who has a holistic view about the nature of the conflict. He hardens himself like iron, using and commanding whole nations against his own nature. And yet, three pretty girls can put him through agonies of uncertainty and self-doubting.Prior to this book, we knew little about Elayne. Sure, she's a spoiled brat. She's also delightfully spunky and adventurous, and she too is learning how to deal with smart, energetic people like Thom Merrilin in a way that will help her become a ruler. Nynaeve has a ton of conflicts gnawing at her - her relationship with Lan, her feelings about Aes Sedai and Moiraine, being challenged by Egwene, etc. The stable, quiet world in which she lived for 25 years has been replaced by a maelstrom of currents, and she's having a hard time coping. But, she's tough as nails and fierce as a tigress, and she's a heavyweight with the One Power. The scenes with her and Moghedien in the Royal Palace are absolutely riveting.Mat continues his march to becoming my own favorite character. He would take the easy way out in every situation, but The Wheel won't let him. He is a reluctant hero at best. We see his powers growing in stages, and at each stage he surprises with his capability. Rand sees it too, and tests it and exploits it as he can. The scenes in the battle with the Shaido are gripping.As far as the general relations between men and women - hey, that's pretty much on target. That's why that other book about Mars and Venus was an all-time best seller. Let me introduce you to my half-dozen sisters-in-law sometime. They make Aes Sedai look like Brownies.Anyway, by the time this book is ended, all sorts of momentous and exciting things have happened. It's a delightful, exciting building block in this epic series. Finally, keep in mind two things. First, only about two years have passed since Rand and gang, who except for Nynaeve were all teenagers, were routed out of the Two Rivers at the start of the series. The character changes they show seem reasonable to me. Second, those who suppose that Jordan is dragging this out to extort more money out of us: think a minute. Think about placing yourself behind a typewriter 8 to 12 hours a day, day in and day out, for YEARS on end. Think about devoting your life to pleasing all sorts of unappreciative people - for however long it takes to finish the stories. I'll be happy to pay $25 or whatever pittance he asks each year or two for as long as it takes to resolve this great story."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After the first 4 Jordan books, I was on board. I thought number 4 was just as good as the rest, if a bit long-winded. But something about number 5 just turned me off. Halfway through this book it hit me that this series was never going to end, and even if it does, there's no way it can be worth the effort. At page 800 of this book, I bailed. That was 4 years ago. I do not regret the decision, and still haven't.Let me compare this series to another series I recently read, the Earthsea series by Leguin. I had never heard of these books, until a friend recommended them (apparently the scifi channel just made a tv version of Earthsea, and my friend was telling me all about it). Do yourself a favor, if you have never heard of this series, go to the library, and get \\"A wizard of earthsea\\". It's only 200 pages. Read the first 50 or 100, and if you don't like it, fine. But let me tell you, it is the polar opposite of Jordan. Leguin can do more with 50 pages than Jordan can do with 500. No exageration. This book moves by so fast, you can't skim. At all. You can read it in an evening. Not only will it be a nice refresher from Jordan, but you'll lose all respect for JK Rowling in the process. Read it and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think writing these reviews for Jordan books are like grouptherapy.\\"Hi, my name is...and I suffer from WOTmania. I started reading long time ago but I haven't been able to stop it and it has teared my life apart.\\"And everybody else in group is nodding. Some are saying yes I know how you feel but...maybe it ends some day. Or sure they hope so.No...really, somehow Jordan reminds me of myself as writer. I have played some rolegames when I was younger and I'm great making new worlds with interesting characters but at least I know when to stop. Jordan doesn't.I like that books are almost perfect. I mean that there aren't too many unnecessary words to describe something that reader doesn't want to know like Lini's advice number 44544576 and does Nynaeve change his clothes in the dreamworld and thinks like that. As said they are useless. At least after the time you have heard those words thousand times.Somehow I feel that all the characters in the books are living in some kind of fantasyworld. No, I'm not kidding. Everybody seem to have this terrible important mission to achieve but they hardly do anything about it until someone shows them the way. Then they achieve with almost no action at all.Let's face it. Jordan's characters are dull. Women even more than men. Women in the books just dream over something that never really has happened like twelve year olds. I mean not only the young women but also the more mature ones. It's pretty clear that age scale for this of series is about 15 years old. Just like Eddings books.In the books,men are like they don't know anything about women.Women are like they know everything about men.How funny. I'm almost laughing. The series is based into this kind of small jokes and the thing that Rand al'Thor and his companions must face the evil one as in all the other series. Well, I think I know as well as you how that is going to end. I don't really even wait that series ends but that something would happen between the start of the book and the end. If nothing happens it's like watching photo of something when I could watch moving picture and I like movies more.Watch my point? I have tired of seeing that nothing happens. Jordan draws wonderful world and then let's it be. I'm tired of Rand killing another forsaken in seconds when before that he has used like dozen of lifetimes thinking should he do it or not.Just like this review Jordan's book are full of rambling. Nothing else. But I warn you. If you touch the first book, The Eye of the World and you may become ill. It's called WOTmania and it won't stop until bookserie stop. Then you will wake up from the dream and understand what you have just read and how many pages of it. Then you can use those pages for some better purpose.So my message is: Save the environment and don't read Jordan because he kills the rainforest with useless modern entertaiment more sure than anything on earth."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really like the book and the series.BUT ... the publisher is outrageously overcharging for the electronic version of this book ... and others in the series. The pre-order price is $9.99 and the trade paper back is $7 and it can also be ordered NEW for as low as $4.99.There is no reason but ripping off the consumer to charge this much. There are virtually no costs in the ebook version, but there are production and distribution costs in the hardback, paperback and mass market paperback. So, if the publisher charges more that the lowest print version price, they are making a higher profit. There is no indication that the author (or in this case, sadly, his estate) receives more royalty than for the print version. So, this means higher profits for the publisher.I have written to the publisher about this and the lack of their books in ebook format and they have chosen not to respond."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Rand Al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, He Who Comes with Dawn and possibly the Coramoor of the Sea Folk. He is destined to fight the Dark One in the Last Battle and then Break the World again. In this book The Fires of Heaven, you are with Rand a lot of the time and you see some of his characteristic development. You also read about Aes Sedai who wield the One Power, Darkfriends who serve the Dark One and Forsaken who in the Age of Legends were thirteen of the most powerful Aes Sedai who serve the Dark One and also have some Darkfriends under their command.This book is a good fantasy novel about a young man with enormous responsibility on his shoulders and he must decide what to do with this power and responsibility that he possesses. He leads battles that get men killed, fights with his friends, orders people around and tries not to get captured in the nets of meddlesome Aes Sedai. This book is not just about Rand it also is about Mat Cauthon who is trying hard to forget what he is and has become, Egwene who is learning to become a Dreamer, Nynaeve and Elayne who are trying to find the hidden Blue Aes Sedai and many other characters who deal with their own problems.This book is very detailed and descriptive and a very good adventure and fantasy story. I thought it was a very good book even if was a little drawn out in some parts. I think it strayed a little too much from the center of story and included none of Perrin which I was very disappointed about, but overall it was a well written and fun adventure/fantasy story. The characters were very realistic and believable and retain a lot of the characteristics people today, for instance Jordan writes about women never letting a man do what he wants and always convincing him to do what she wants, and how men can never stop women when they set their mind on something. I think it was very funny to read about all the social struggles the characters in the book go through, it was very realistic and entertaining. The theme of this book was courage, Moiraine Sedai showed innumerable amounts of courage when she faced Lanfear knowing that she was going to die, but she did it because she had to, to save the world, if she hadn't the Last Battle wouldn't have happened because Rand would have died. Nynaeve also showed courage when she went into Tel'aran'rhoid even after Moghedien almost killed her in it, if she hadn't conjured up the courage to do this then Rand Al'Thor probably would have been killed by Rahvin. Rand Al'Thor also showed courage by bearing his burdens and did what he had to do eventually and went and faced Rahvin.I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of this book even though at times it could be very slow, overall the book was very good if not quite as good as it's predecessors. I would recommend this series and book to anybody who likes a good fantasy novel and has a bit of time to read."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you like man bashing, arrogant women. This is the book for you. I thought that the women would get better as the series went on, but it's much worse. I don't understand what they are so angry about. It's bizarre.This entire book is basically dedicated to these snippy, condescending, man hating women. I don't know if I can continue the series. About 900 pages of this is too much. OK, OK men are stupid...I get it.I have to say my favorite part of the series so far was when Egwene got beat to a pulp.I wonder if Robert Jordan is really a man?"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan composed a masterful work of literature when he wrote the Fires of Heaven. First, I admit that I am favorably biased toward any fantasy book. But if you also enjoy these types of novels, Jordan does not disappoint. I have read many authors who go into great detail and are able to weave deep plots. But as I read the last one hundred pages of the Fires of Heaven, I was amazed. I had forgotten how good this book was. The ending to the Fires of Heaven was better than any of the four previous Wheel of Time books, and I think better than the next four. The climax comes at you in two waves. The first wave is good enough to be the finish for the book, but Jordan continues, and left me ready to begin the next book.So what happens. Siuan, Leane, Min, and Logain are be hunted by Bryne for Oathbreaking. They do eventually make it to Salidar, where Aes Sedai opposing Elaida are gathering. But Bryne finds them there, and is chosen to lead rebel Aes Sedai's forces against Elaida. Nyn and Elayne have left Tanchico with Thom and Julian. Eventually they join a carnival, until they get passage to Salidar. Birgitte also becomes part of the real world. Once they make it to Salidar, Nyn captures Moghedien. Rand chases Couladin to Cairhien, where Rand defeats him. Mat becomes a talented military leader, and becomes one of Rand's generals-unwillingly. Moiraine dies killing Lanfear. Rand and Avienhda become lovers.This book continues to develop Mat's character more in depth. Additionally, much of Nyn's personality and thought process is described. With everything that occurs in this book, what makes Fires of Heaven one of my favorite Wheel of Time books is that Faile is never mentioned. Jordan created many good characters, but Faile makes me skip passages. Perrin went from being one of my favorite characters, to being a warning for Faile. This is a great book, but it has created a problem. I cannot decide if it was better the first or second time I read it."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Mr. Jordan appears to have a phenomenal eye for detail, and has the potential to be a very good writer, but his work is crippled by clear imitation and by a certain emotional sterility. He lifts his primary cultures and the vast detail that accompanies them straight from European and Asian history, without either truly transforming them into his own vision, as did Tolkien, or unashamedly acknowledging his sources, as does Guy Gavriel Kay. In terms of emotional relations, this book is exhausting! Jordan's characters live in a sterile world in which endless dominance and status games stand in for real emotions, feelings, or relationships. Physical punishment is the primary indicator of a character's status or lack thereof. After a while I found this repetitive. I lost count of the time people &quot;howled,&quot; and found that I really wanted a character to come up with a way of solving problems or managing impossible situations other than resorting to position, place, and force. One either submits or is dominant in this world. The series appeared to me to be a romp through a comic book world with characters who have the emotional maturity of early adolescents (or the type of person who seeks out a military life because of its overt hierarchy and rules, and cannot function outside that clearly delineated environment). If you want good writing, intellectual stimulation, and solid psychological exploration in light fiction, read Laurie King, Ursula Le Guin, Robin McKinley, or Mary Doria Russell. If you want a sensitive and hard-hitting treatment of torture and pain, read Susan Matthews and Mary Doria Russell. Jordan, unfortunately, has turned his early potential not in the direction of richness, but to an adolescent soap opera."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I read the previous books and they were great!!! But this is a bit farfetched. I don't want to read a soap opera. That's what it's like. Characters argue about nothing, stupid, unimportant things happen. all the characters bicker endlessly with each other. jordan wants to be another tolkien, so hes describing everything describable. it's a very bad book. it's too long. read the previous books. don't bother with this one. his writing isn't good either. there is too many mistakes. sentences are bad. i can't believe people actually like this. don't let your children read it, there's nasty stuff."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The first 4 books were not too bad, but hold on to your seat, because it is downhill from here. Jordan loses focus with book 5, or maybe he never had a focus to begin with. Certain themes which have been beaten to death are beaten more: (Nynaeve is a hateful men hating (except for Lan), hair tugging bitch. Mat, Rand and Perin all do not understand women, but think the others do......you get the idea.In this book Nynaeve who up until this point was a strong brave leader, does have a personality shift and suddenly can only think about how much cleavage she is showing, and worries about her circus act, while the rest of the world goes to hell. I would like a nickel for every time the word bosom is used in this book. I can only guess that Jordan must have had a very poor relationship with his mother, and I doubt has ever managed a successful relationship with a woman. He spends chapter after chapter puzzling out the male-female differences and relationships without ever finding an answer. How many times do we have to see that men and women are different, before we can move on?Do we really have to know how each character is dressed down to their underwear in boring detail?Jordan gives his characters unlimited superpowers, but then makes them too stupid to use them? Rand chases after his enemy through the waste on foot, while the guy rapes and pillages ahead of him, when he could just skim ahead and zap the guy with a lightening bolt......duh.You had better learn the art of skimming yourself for this book and the ones that follow unless you want to find that you have burnt yourself out."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I enjoy the series very much, even though a lot of it is long winded.

The narrative changes from the Aiel Waste headed west and in Tarabon headed east with several locations in-between seen from the perspectives of various characters. But of all the characters, it was Rand al'Thor and Nynaeve al'Meara who dominated the majority of the book.One of the good things about this book is that all the point-of-view characters help give great context of the world Jordan created, visiting many of the nations that have until this book only been names but given no in-person description. Another is the excellent described battle scenes that happen throughout the book, especially around Rand including the final fight of the book. And finally seeing the reactions to the coup in Tar Valon and the breaking of the White Tower.Unlike the other four books, there are minor things that seemed to bring down the quality of this book. The first was the pace of Rand's POVs in which most of battles take place, the largest battle almost has the sense of being the climax of the book only for seeming to set up to the final battle. Then there was Nynaeve's narration, which at many times late in the book are a bit wearing especially as she comments on her traveling companions. And finally one of the primary characters is missing in this book and it's noticeable.Overall the good vastly outweighs the bad, however the \\"bad\\" is more evident than the previous four books but not enough to not recommend."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book series follows some standard fantasy themes but the level of detail and plot depth are unmatched in any series in any genre that I've ever hear of or read.

The one thing I was dissapointed in with this book was Perrin's absense. During the last book I was really caught up with his character and Two Rivers. I kept reading and waiting for him to come up, but he never did. Other parts, however, were really good.Mat's character becomes increasingly interesting. His memory is very mysterious and makes you wander what will happen to him. Rand is also a good character and most of the action happens around him, which makes it very exciting.Min, Leane, and Suine Sanche also have enteresting parts, though they don't appear nearly as much as all the other characters do. Nynaeve, Elayne, and Bigitte are good characters, but were used to much.This is why I rate this book with 4 stars. I can't wait to read the others.

The reviewer in question writes a well thought out review that reflects his opinon quite well. Let me state at the outset that there is nothing wrong with his/her review and I respect it as much as I respect any of the others.This reviewer was the one who compared Jordan's work to a Computer Game.The main reason I find this so distastefull is the uses of Tolken and Ursla K. Guinn references. I find this happens so much in Fantasy literature that it makes me sick. Yes, these two authors where outstanding, they defined the way fantasy is written. They came up with the first epic tales to fill our hearts with wonder. They where the best at what they did. But there are not anymore.I work in an university and I see from instrusters there exactly what I see from this reviewer. I'ts basically a reluctance to except change. They want to teach it they way they where taught, they want to do the things that they did when they where in college. It does not matter that new and better ways have been found to do the same thing, they just want to cling to the old. Lets look at Tolkins books...women barely existed in them, much less real powerfull women. Yes there where some women there and they had some good roles to play but no power. Basically women did not exist from the neck down. Now why do (I) think this is so? Well I think it is a sign of the times, when tolkien wrote women where not looked at in the same light they are now.There are plenty of examples I could give that show the different times and attitudes of writers but I will not bore you with the details.The note I would like to get out is this, lets try not to force writers whether they are good ones or terrible ones to fit in the same mold. People write differntly than Tolkin and Guinn, let them. If they are not allowed to do this, we get stagnation, everyone doing the same thing.Let sleeping dogs lie."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This series, I admit, can get a bit repetitious but there are plenty of surprises that should, like in my case, keep readers on their toes!

Rand's character does manage to improve and I also began to like the characters of Aviendha, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene more so than before.

Slaughtering likability by murdering characters who used to be so intriguing and giving them all calloused, self-centered, two-year-old mentalities?Everyone in the Wheel of Time starts acting as if business is as usual and you get the feeling no real story is being told. Page after page, you hope that it is all to make some wonderful observation. But it never is. The Fires of Heaven ultimately cannot be saved by such amusing conundrums like *saying in a ladyish voice* Elmindreda or by shocking plot twists like deaths or Tower betrayals, it all seems so much like...a comic book.No character growth. And there should be character growth, we should not have to buy two more books just to see extremely slight nuances hinting at very small character changes. Pl! ot begins your narrative and keeps it fresh, but ultimately only good characters will ever distinguish popular work.Jordan's style is so rote by this time, you can almost imagine the words yourself. And why must he explain every single thought process of each character, as well all his points for readers he obviously does not consider intelligent enough to take in what little symbolism there is and make their prejudices so blatant and hellish? Why does he reduce them to one dimension by using sex, when he could have expanded them past anything else there was in this genre? Why do we never see them highly effected by what happens to them? That's just not realistic, no mattter how stubborn Emond's Fielders are. Furthermore, there is a weakening of the diversity by making all men essentially the same with little differences and all women follow the same line of thinking. The nations all have the same problems and their interesting civilizations are now rote memorizations.A ! shame. Truly a shame, Jordan had to come to this. Where did! all the plot elements go? Jordan has completely lost control of them and his so-called imagination.3 out of 10. Only bother with it if you must know what happens next--like a horrid soap opera--and if you can stand Aviendha and Sorilea.

Also, if you didn't like the &lt;i&gt;The Lord Of The Rings&lt;/b&gt; This is my favorite book!! The Aiel are the most impressive people in a book that I have ever known! The True Souce is the most discriptive power that has been writen. At a perfet par with &lt;i&gt;The PridyenCoranicals&lt;/i&gt; by Lloyd Alexander. The Apprentace Adept is less intense, Tolkien is above, but only &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; Ilike the form, and the &lt;b&gt;length&lt;/b&gt; of the books. If you don't enjoy an intense novel, filled to the brim with magic and enchanment, don't plunge in to R. Jordan. The loss of intrest during the middle of the book is a bad point, but the end is worth it. The multiyplicity of enemys and heros in astonding. The City of Ruinhidain was a magnifican addition to the Aiel part of the story. The Dark One has not reapperd in any of the dreams, which is a missed part. The Rand al' Thor trasition from the weekness of risitance to the Power is wonderful. Here is an exert from my Web Page The Wheel of Time:by Robert JordanThis is an admireable book coletion. The Wheel of time has Seven spokes, Each an Age.The previos age turns to legend. Legend becomes myth and even myth fades away before the age comes again.The Wheel is turned by &lt;i&gt;SADIN&lt;/i&gt;, The male half of the true sourse and &lt;i&gt;SADAIR&lt;/i&gt;,The female half. Some people can touch the true source. They are called Aes Sendi. Ever sencethe Dark One was relesed by the thirteen Aes Sendi, known asthe Forsaken, and traped by Lewis Therrin {&lt;b&gt;The DRAGON&lt;/b&gt;} Their has been a taint on &lt;i&gt;SADIN&lt;/i&gt;, making all male users of the One Power to go mad and use the power to destroy the earth. Rand al' Thor is the DRAGON REBORN. He was born on the slopes of Dragonmount and will onday defete the Dark One. The Forsaken are escapeing from Syoal Goul. The Dark One is attacing the barrier whith all his might. He is seaching for the items that can make his downfall. The eye of the world.The horn of Valere. The sword, Callanador. Rand al' Thor, Morine Aes Sendi, Perrin Aybarya, Matrim Carrborn, Nynaeve and Ewgene al' Vere are the stars of the first novel.

Mat finally discovers that his luck IS useful for something afterall.And several of the Forsaken get taken out of the picture...some for good others perhaps not for good. We see the apparent death of Moiraine and Lanfear but with several hints that they may be back at untimely moments later in the series, and Lan heading off to meet a &quot;green sister&quot; who Moiraine trusted with his bond.

He and his friends travel all over the world trying to get everyone on his side, getting ready for the big battle which will decide whether the end of the world will go to the evil one or the good people. But not everyone will believe in him. There is magic, and unseen forces, monsters, strange peoples from far away, all kinds of different unexplainable things happening that can only happen when magic is used. It's a fun read, there are many small plots and twists to follow along the way. I love the story line, and the writer is wonderful. It's very colorful, and it is easy to visualize in your head, based on his descriptions, what is going on. The characters are very real and their personalities are very distinct and some are quite unusual.

I do not complain about all the time we spend waiting, because I am one of the luckier people: I discovered the Wheel of Time only about a month ago. Finished them all until part 7, though. CoS will follow soon. But of course, soon I'll get to the final torture: waiting until PoD is released in Holland. I suppose people in English-languaged-countries do not know about THEIR luck: WE IN HOLLAND HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ALL THOSE DAMNED 900-PAGED BOOKS ARE TRANSLATED!!!! Remember that, and dont complain anymore. I, and a lot of others, have to wait until fall 1999 to read Path of Daggers.Who is the most interesting person of the story? Lanfear of course. Does she really love LTT for the person he is or for the power he has? I thought she only loved her ambition and power, but I cant believe she'd torture Egwene and Avi because of ambition. She was really jealous... and she really wants Rands' (and LTT's! ! ) love. So: a fascinating person. I was angry on Jordan when he let her disappear with Moiraine. She isnt dead, I just know, but she will not be on for a while. And thats a pity, because I enjoy her appearance in the story.A fascinating series!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This fifth book in what I rate as the best series that I have ever read(and I have read a fair bit) is easily one of the best, maybe with Book 3 or 4 besting it. But still, this book cranks! It deserves the 10 that most normal people would give it. I must say I was not all that pleased when Moiraine was killed, but it was an excellent plot twist. And to anyone who says that the Forsaken being killed off is bad, what do you think Rand al'Thor's purpose is? He must kill as many Forsaken as possible before Tar'mon Gaidon, otherwise he would be easily overpowered. I love this series, and I am currently reading Lord of Chaos, Book 6. It seems to be just as good as the last 5, if not better. Rand is concentrating on Illian, getting ready to trap(and hopefully kill) the evil Forsaken Sammael. But back to the one I'm supposed to be talking about, The Fires Of Heaven. I wondered, while reading, why nothing was mentioned of Perrin and Faile back in the Two Rivers. I quite liked that effect in the previous books, going from person to person, place to place.But I'll stop moping now and get on with the review. The Aes Sedai in Salidar, I hope, will overpower Elaida do'Avriny a'Roihan and bring the White Tower back together. Speaking of Aes Sedai and the One Power, I liked the balefire battle between Rand and Rahvin at the end. Even the Dark One himself cannot reach back in time. Overall, this book is easily one of the best I have read, and Robert Jordan would rival Tolkien as the best fantasy writer in history any day(in my opinion anyway), and The Fires Of Heaven deserves the whopping 10 I give it."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this is by far the best series of books i have ever read.

R. Martin's 'Game of Thrones'. I read the Jordan book first and was very disappointed, especially knowing that I was going to attempt to read the entire series. But, I looked at all the books that he had put out and figured with all that writing he HAD to have gotten better with practice. Then I read 'Game of Thrones'. My god, read that book. It is amazing. Anyway, back to WOT. Having just finished volume five I feel I have to comment. Who are all these people giving these books 9's and 10's? I dont care about the length of the series or the books themselves, as long as the story MOVES. The story drags, even though there are some nice scenes hidden here and there. The characters remain one-dimensional, the soap-opera tendencies are overblown, and Jordan has a SERIOUS case of David Eddings disease (his cutsey men vs. women arguments). And judging by the comments of others, I am not the only one finding this three women sharing Rand a bit disturbing. Is there any real suspense in this series? I dont think so. Is Rand REALLY going to go mad? No. Is anyone we care about going to die? No. Is the Dark Lord going to win in the end? No. Has this series broken any new ground in any way? No. Looking ahead, even fans are moaning about the next two volumes of the series, not a good sign when I am not exactly enthralled already. My recommendation: if you haven't started this series, don't. Read Tolkien, read Donaldson, read Martin, hell even read Eddings first series. Stay away.

I mean if you got this far and you are sickened with it, I can't believe that you weren't already puking with The &quot;Great&quot; Hunt. Anyway, this book ruled supreme. I love what Rand can do, and the whole traveling show thing with Nynaeve, Birgitte, and Elayne (NtM Thom) was great, even though in The Shadow Rising the only thing I didn't like the the west coast work of the Accepted (like in Tarabon). Jordan's descriptions are unparalelled and interesting, not boring. I have just ordered Lord of Chaos and A Crown of Swords. I hope LoC is as good as they say. . .and a new Amyrlin Seat??

Never have I had to stay up this late so many nights in a row for a single book. Jordan's incredible discriptions pale that of all other authors of which I have had the pleasure to read. Rarely, if ever, have I had such a thirst for the next volume of any series. This is a dazzling display of the creative epics that Jordan continues to scribe for fantasy fanatics to read over and over again.

The Eye of the World was the first fantasy book that I ever read, and I picked it up thinking that I would get a book full of witches, magic, and elves. Instead, I got the best books ever! Jordan's characters are teriffic. They are vividly real, and they are often so funny that I laugh out loud while reading them. The world is detailed, and I absolutely love the One Power and the Aes Sedai. It is the best magic of any series that I've ever seen... And the Fires of Heaven is the best book of the series. The Aiel are teriffic, especially Aviendha. I love how she and Rand get together... The plot is teriffic, and Rhuidean was a nice addition. I am sad that Moiraine is dead and Lan is gone... but I expect that Moiraine will reappear soon! All I can say is: don't listen to those people who say that Jordan copied Terry Brooks or Tolkien.

I mean, she's been waiting long enough. Rand finally, stops taking crap from all the women who think they know better. One thing though. I would like to know how in hell does Elayne think she could make Rand her Warder. What's wrong with that girl? Personally, I hope that he chooses Min, cause she is the nicest.

This book is very important because it introduces the Aiel, they definatly have a big part to play in the series.

Jordan created what could have been a fascinating world with a well-imagined matriarchal society, and hinted at many intriguing things about its past... then drifted off into endless scenes with the female characters b***hing about the men.

It is here that he decided to fragment his epic story into several hundred subplots, peopled by several hundred minor, flat characters, and written with several hundred repeated phrases and descriptions.Rather than continue on with a focused, interesting tale, Jordan instead decided to create the never-ending Melrose Place of fantasy, with characters popping in and out at a head spinning pace.

Even before I'd finished it I'd begun to forget, and I don't mean that as a complaint, or a slight against the book. On the contrary, after reading five of these in a row, they have begun to blend together into a kind of quasi-historical landscape of individual hills and valleys that defy compartmentalization into neat and tidy narrative arcs. Well... sort of. Everything that happened since the last Forsaken was killed/defeated is bound to be in this book - that only happens in one book doesn't it? Sorta... Two of them are killed in this book, one almost as an afterthought, and two \\"defeated\\" one way or the other. Jordan's characters may not like to kill women, but Jordan the author doesn't like to kill kill his villainesses, either.Oh, yeah, THAT's what happened. Nynaeve got her comeupances! She realized that she was being stubborn, being silly, being vile, and that her actions had real and serious consequences for the people around her, and for the rest of the story she was sweetness and light personified. Except she wasn't. Right after she learned what a pain she was, she conveniently forgot all about it and went back to sharpening both sides of her tongue and quenching that blade with the blood of men and women both. Ye gods, but she's insufferable. I have a hard time waiting for her next chapter.The Good: The tension between Rand and Aviendha finally breaks in a predicable, but welcome way. Mat continues to be an enjoyable character. Someone central to the story dies, giving us the feeling that the danger is a real thing. (Wait, I shouldn't say that. Thom \\"died\\" too, didn't he? Never mind about the danger.) The Battle for Cairhien is one of Jordan's best executed so far. Min, Suian, and Leanne make a fun group to follow.The Bad: The battle scene with the Forsaken at the end feels a bit like a repeat of the previous, and a little bit unimaginative. It's like there has to be a super-destruct giant battle mode at the end of every story, but Jordan turned the volume all the way to 10 in the second novel and hasn't figured out how to get it to 11 in the novels since. What happened to Perrin? Sure, there's plenty going on already, but even a glimpse of his wedded bliss would be nice. Too many relationships are in holding patterns. Again, it might be too hard to follow Lan/Nynaeve, Rand/Min, Rand/Elayne, Moraine/whoever, Egwene/whoever, Perrin/Fayle/Berelain all the same time, but these are months going by with some long distance pining without letters and no stoking or waning of the fires of anyone's passions.The Takeaway: Read between book 4 and book 6 for maximum effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Fires of Heaven is the continuation of Rand's journey after his trip to the Aiel Waste and his conquering of the Aiel peoples. Pursuing the rebel Shaido Aiel across the Spine of the World, Rand's forces march on Carhien in order to avert catastrophe. Battle scenes come into their own during this book, yet the clear trend is one so as to bring the characters into their own with regard to power. The Forsaken make appearances throughout, with each set of characters seeming to be battling a Forsaken at some point throughout the book. Rand's power increases exponentially, as he is now capable, and increasingly willing, to level vast tracts of territory with balefire to achieve his goals. Follows is Rand's assault on Camelyn as well as the removal of the subsequent storyline (for a couple of books) of a character that the WOT community has grown to love.Grades:Content: ADevelopment: A"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Fires of Heaven, book five in Jordan's highly acclaimed Wheel of Time series, catapults the reader deeper into the battle between good and evil.

The Fires of Heaven (TFOH) is IMHO the peak of the Wheel saga; it's all downhill thereafter. But TFOH is well worth reading. The politics of the White Tower muddy the waters, even as Rand's efforts to rally all the People of the Dragon gather momentum. The essence of the Aiel, the various warrior societies and their mission in the series become more clear with every revelation of their way of life and the fascinating honor code concept of Ji'e'toh. Egwene's apprenticeship among the Aiel and Aviendha's task of teaching Rand serve as windows for us to try and grasp the Aiel way of life. The battle scenes in TFOH are easily the best of the lot so far. Sadly, it's the same battle scenes that indicate RJ is following the bad trend of many authors and leaving huge blanks for the reader to fill in; is it because of laziness? See the description of the desperate battle between the Shaido and Rand's forces, with Mat battling for all he is worth even as Couladin himself comes against Mat's position. What happens? We only get a third party anecdote, several pages later, telling of the outcome, not a blow by blow account. Is this a new literary device? For a reader, such disjointed narratives are very annoying. Padan Fain appears and disappears yet again in yet another avatar and I for one do not understand where exactly he fits into the saga; sometimes I wonder if RJ himself is very clear about this aspect. The rousing climax is superb; unfortunately it is preceded by the interminable description of Elayne and Nynaeve's odyssey. Starting with dubious premises, this odyssey seems to have become self-sustaining with every possible logical ending becoming a new excuse for the tour to continue. The endless dissension between them also becomes stale and tiresome; after the way RJ has developed their characters in the previous books, this sudden descent into juvenile snappishness is paradoxical. Worse, RJ stretches the point to breaking. Where was the editor of this book? I still give the book 4 stars because of its clear strengths. I will not give RJ a 5 however till he comes up with better cartography."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"\\"When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!\\"REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good \\"thumping\\" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly \\"Wise\\" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called \\"intellectual\\" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the \\"Evil\\" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many \\"Evil\\" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all..I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the \\"Evil\\" side, to \\"Good\\" side (Even if it was un-willingly).He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The thing that ruins this book in this beautiful series is the fact that 90% of the book is Elayne and Nynaeve, as well as Egwene, complain and plot. After about 600 pages, you get utterly bored with Nynaeve's tempers and her tugging on her hair, and worying about how much clevage she is revealing.This book also goes through some major dry points in its plot. It goes from so boring that you want to cry, to relatively exciting, but since the previous parts are so brain numbingly boring, it makes the action scenes so much better.One more thing, what the heck is up with Robert Jordan and his obsession with naked women? He constantly describes Avienda (spelling?) naked, or getting dressed, and in other books as well... oh well. If you want to read the entire sieries... read this book out of nessesity, the 6th is great... oh! and the ending of this book is amazing as well!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; is a wonderful fantasy series, and just about all the positive comments about Jordan and his characters are true, but it is difficult to avoid the sensation that the story bogs down within the later books, and particularly in the fifth volume, &quot;The Fires of Heaven.&quot; The constant repetition of Aiel customs, Rand's temper tantrums, and chiches that are nerly inevitable in a project of this magnitude are at their strongest here. One gets the impression that Jordan wastes too much time with *travel*, causing one to wonder if Rand will *ever* get out of the waste or if Nynaeve and Elayne will *ever* get to Salidar. And how many boisterous inns and fat innkeepers do we have to suffer through? Do not misunderstand this criticism; Jordan is a very good writer and at least makes every chapter vivid and interesting, but the best novels in the series are the first, second, third, and seventh. Between those the sense of adventure and wonder seems to take a back seat to bureaucracy, boring journeys, and Rand's interminable temper tantrums and paranoia. In spite of that, &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; is a must-read due to its few essential elements of the overall story, and, again due to Jordan's excellent descriptive style, stands above and beyond many other rival sagas. I eagerly wait the eighth volume."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Yes, the book is very long. When I began the series, I'd only read a couple of thousand page books. Now, I'm starting to think that I'll have read a dozen by the time the series is finished. That's besides the point. When I read Robert Jordan, the pages fly by. Suddenly I'm 100 pages from when I last looked at the page. This book had some of the usual annoying babble and frustrations such as Nynaeve and Elayne consistently falling into traps and revealing too much information. I did enjoy reading about Rand's relationship to Aviendha, and Moiraine's change in character. Mat is becoming more and more interesting as he begins to have a life of his own outside of following Rand. Sadly, the book doesn't talk any of Perrin, and way too much of Elayne and Nynaeve. I think the ending could have been a bit better but I still liked it. It gets 4 stars because I didn't put the book down with a big &quot;wow&quot; at the end. Jordan keeps the story moving with various plot twists, and I don't think there is a single chapter where something significant doesn't happen. It's a very, very good book, and from what I hear, the next one is better. I just have one question... how many women can have &quot;ice cold stares&quot; or something equivalent to that?"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As this is not a new book, there are many reviews published here on Amazon. The great majority of the reviews are correct in making the same point: this story is much too long.The Fires of Heaven is the fifth book of this series. There are currently ten in the series, plus a prequel -- and the story isn't done yet. There must be close to 9000 pages of &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; books published -- and the story isn't done yet. There must be 50 or 100 separate characters running around the stories (often with similar names, to confuse the reader) -- and the story isn't done yet. There are dozens of different plot lines floating around and confusing each other -- and the story isn't done yet. To make a comparison, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings ran 1350 pages without the appendices, and that is considered a long story. The length of this story is far beyond ridiculous.I also agree with many of the reviewers that Jordan's female characters -- not only the more famous named characters, but innumerable Aes Sedai, &quot;Wise Ones,&quot; &quot;Maidens of the Spear,&quot; and so forth -- act like teen-agers afflicted with permanent PMS. It gets far beyond tiring to read the thousandth description of how stupid they think men are, etc., etc., ad nauseam. The series could have really been improved if a couple of these offensive little twits could have gone bad. Then there would have been real reason for their incessant squabbling and bickering, and maybe they could have wasted each other and we would be done with them. But the bickering and whining continue, with no end in sight. If the story were of reasonable length, maybe this approach to female characters would be endurable; but after several thousand pages of this, it gets far more than tiring.Jordan also over-uses the plot device of having characters appear to die, or actually die, and then somehow come back. Tolkien used this device once (with Gandalf). Jordan uses it with several characters in this volume alone. This is bad writing for two reasons: first, it reduces the finality and horror of death, and thus cheapens it; and second, it confuses the reader mightily -- is this character really gone, or not? One of the major characters of the story up to this point dies in this volume. But does she? So many other characters have come back; maybe she will, too. So what's the big deal about dying?Perhaps most importantly, Jordan makes the great fantasy error of making magic too powerful. In a previous volume the hero, Rand, got his hands on a magic sword that could blow up entire cities. After this, Jordan must have realized that putting such power in the hands of his hero would ruin the story -- makes things too easy -- so the hero took this superweapon, stuck it in the floor, and left it. While that idiotic behavior is rationalized in the story, the least bit of common sense says that he would keep this weapon, use it to slaughter all the bad guys, and bring the story to a quick end. But that would keep Jordan from selling another zillion books, so the weapon gets left behind and is not used in this volume. Even so, the hero's magical power is so great that he apparently can just zap uncounted bad guys into nothingness. If so, just why he spends this volume building a military coalition to fight wars is beyond any reason. This is important because even as a stand-alone book, apart from the endless series of which it is a part, this book has a plot that does not make much sense.When Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings, he wrote the entire work, and then re-wrote and edited it completely, so that the entire story held together. Jordan instead started with a single book -- The Eye of the World -- which was written so that it could clearly have stood alone. But because the first book sold well, Jordan seemingly dedicated his life to grinding out more and more Wheel of Time books. Since they kept selling, he kept grinding, with more and more characters, more and more plot twists, more and more endless verbiage. This book is a too-long part of an endlessly-long series. It is readable for those that like fantasy, but as literature, it scarcely rises above garbage. I give it two stars because I have actually read worse, and one star is the lowest score you can give. So I suppose it rates more than one star; but it is not a good book."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"One of the criticisms often laid at the feet of this series - and not unfairly - is that it is splintered.Read any epic fantasy, and you'll see that at some point, the author splits the party up. This is an almost guaranteed way to create more action, more storylines and, if you're being paid per word, more money for the author. Tolkien, the grandfather of modern fantasy, did a nice job of splitting the Fellowship up into three branches at one time, and then brought them back together at the end. Since then, the technique has been a stock tool of any writer who is dealing with an ensemble cast in her work.Jordan has taken this technique to its extreme. He used the standard method back in The Eye of the World - split the group into three, bring them all back together just in time for the climactic ending. Pretty boilerplate plot construction right there. From The Great Hunt, however, we began to see that having all of our main characters in one place at one time will be more the exception than the rule - while it starts and ends with everyone together, the beginning of The Dragon Reborn starts us off with the party split again, bringing them all together only at the very last minute.By my count, there are eighteen different point-of-view characters in this book, occupying four different major plot threads, only two of which actually manage to come together by the end. And it just gets more complicated from here on out. From my research, there is yet to be any point in the series where every plot thread manages to come together in one place at one time.For some readers, this is supremely annoying, and I can't say I blame them. You find yourself going back and forth from character to character, keeping up with storylines that are superficially unrelated, all in the hopes that they'll pay off eventually. The circus interlude in this book is an excellent example. In an attempt to hide from the Forsaken Moghedein (whom Nynaeve seriously pissed off in the last book) and to get safe passage to the rebel Aes Sedai after the breaking of the White Tower, Elayne, Nynaeve, Thom and Juilin find themselves traveling with a circus. The logic behind this is that no one would ever look for them there, and I suppose they'd be right. I certainly didn't see it coming.There's a lot of good old-fashioned circus wackiness that goes on - Elayne puts on tights (which just scandalize Nynaeve) and learns to walk a tightrope. Nynaeve ends up being the target for Thom's knife throwing and battles her own distaste at the skimpy clothes she has to wear versus the fact that she thinks they look pretty. Now I'm not saying that nothing important happens during the circus interlude - lots of things do. It's just that there's no reason they had to take place in a circus.And there's no reason they couldn't, either. After all, who's the multiple-bestselling author, Jordan or me?As opposed to a single POV series, such as Harry Potter, where you know where the important action is and who it's happening to, Wheel of Time requires its readers to observe a world of characters. And I think that's the key to how these books are structured. The events that are happening here aren't just happening to one small group of people, or one kingdom. It's happening to the entire world, from the edge of the Aiel Waste all the way to the shores of the Aryth Ocean, from Seanchan to Shara. Rand al'Thor may be the Dragon Reborn (or the Car'a'carn or the Cooramoor, depending on whom you talk to), but that doesn't mean he's the only one who has things to do. In order for the Last Battle to be won, a whole lot of things have to happen, and not all of them are going to be centered around our main protagonist.In this book, for example, we have two groups looking for the Aes Sedai who fled the White Tower when Elaida became Amyrlin (I hope you've been keeping up, otherwise that last sentence makes no sense whatsoever). Siuan Sanche and Leane Sharif, the former Amyrlin and her Keeper, are traveling with Min (a young girl who can tell the future from people's auras) and Logain (a former False Dragon whose ability to channel was severed by the Aes Sedai.) And then there is Elayne and Nynaeve, who were both out of the Tower when the rebellion took place, but who hate Elaida more than Siuan, so they're trying to find the rebels. These two plot threads eventually merge, but it takes fifty chapters before that happens.At the same time, there's Rand, Mat and Egwene, who are leaving the Aiel Waste for Cairhein, hot on the trail of the Shaido Aiel, who are murdering and pillaging everything they can find. The Shaido are a \\"rebel\\" clan, who refuse to accept Rand as the Car'a'carn (the Aiel's Chief of Chiefs) and have decided that the best thing for them to do is to kill everyone who isn't an Aiel. Rand and friends chase the Shaido all the way to Cairhein, where they engage in a fierce battle to save the city from being ravage by war for the third time in twenty years. Even within this plot thread, Mat, Rand and Egwene occupy their own strands, staying apart more often than they get together.The fourth plot thread is a thin one - Queen Morgase of Andor, who has been gulled into complacency by the Forsaken Rahvin (who is posing as \\"Lord Gaebril,\\" the queen's lover) ahas finally come to her senses, and escapes from her own castle. She doesn't know where she's going, or who will help her, but she's intent on regaining her throne and seeing Gaebril hang. Lucky for her, Rand manages to take care of her little Forsaken problem by the end, although she's unaware of this.Meanwhile, the whole world is falling apart. The White Tower has well and truly split, something that the new Amyrlin, Elaida, is desperately trying to keep from the world. There is war and strife across half the continent, men who believe that the existence of the Dragon Reborn means that all bonds are broken, all social contracts annulled. The Prophet Masema - a man from the northern nation of Shienar - is preaching absolute devotion to Rand al'Thor as not only the Dragon Reborn, but as the source of all that is good. The coming of the Dragon brings not only a great battle with the Shadow, but great upheavals in civilization itself.So, to say \\"there's a lot going on in these books\\" is a bit of an understatement, and it's Jordan's fondness for creating new plot threads and then following them to see where they lead that has probably led to this series going on as long as it has. Had he just centered on Rand, it all could have been over in half the time. But it would have been far less interesting in the long run.The characters of this world are fond of using a certain metaphor to describe life - the Great Tapestry. \\"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,\\" they like to say, and they believe that each person's life is a figurative thread in a greater system. Some characters, like Rand, Mat and Perrin, are more important than others, and they tend to bend other threads to follow theirs. But you cannot make a tapestry out of only three threads, and the end of the world in this series is something in which everyone may participate. Without the actions of the myriad minor characters, Rand wouldn't be able to be the person he needs to be, and the story wouldn't be able to be as rich and as complex as it needs to be.So, give this some thought. If you're the type of reader who prefers to stick with one character or group of characters throughout a series; if you don't like having to keep notes on who is doing what and where; if you're not the kind of person who would create a spreadsheet to note all of the different major characters, with color-coding and hand-drawn graphs.... Not that I have, mind you.... If that's not your kind of read, then you may not enjoy this series. And there's nothing wrong with that. But it's good to know what you're getting into.--------------------------------------------------------\\"It would be easier if this was a story.\\"- Rand al'Thor, The Fires of Heaven--------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"OK, short and sweet cause you have already read the other 4 books.Like the other books in the series, The Fires of Heaven is intriguing, if u can get past Jordan's childish problem with women. The stroy line is wonderful, but it seems one can't get through a chapter with out a character commenting on \\"Oh the opposite sex is stupid. We have to take them in hand.\\" However, the plot line is enjoyable and so is Jordan's formation of magic and how it is used. So if you can stand Jordan's view of women (which he should see a counselor for) then the rest of the book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"So. Book 5.After reading it, I must say that I was a trifle bit disappointed. I still love the series, and cannot wait to sink my teeth in the remaining books. But really -- one can only take so much of Nynaeve.I really do not have a problem with headstrong women characters. But, when a headstrong female character takes up over 300 pages of detail describing how men are fools, one gets tired.To his credit, Jordan displays Nynaeve (as well as many of the other &quot;woolheaded&quot; women) contradicting her own thoughts. Not a line after admonishing men for thinking that violence could solve everything, Nynaeve wishes she had a stout stick to thump the men with. (Just after Nynaeve talks to Galad in Samara, for the curious.)Really, with the headstrong feelings of the women, subtle glances passed between men and women alike, descriptions of scandalous diving necklines, and an inconclusive ending, Fires of Heaven leaves a foul taste in the back of ones mouth.Part of the problem is that my favorite character was barely even mentioned in the book. It seems that Jordan, in 600+ pages, could not seem to remember Perrin Aybara. Which to me, is unfortunate -- I absolutely loved The Shadow Rising because of Perrin, and to not have included him is annoying. Especially since the addition of Perrin could have saved the book from Nynaeve.Even so, I cannot give the book a really bad mark. It did succeed in keeping my attention. And, Jordan was able to weave threads of suspense during the endgame of Fires, even if the pattern failed to resolve any issues. I just hope that Lord of Chaos finds Jordan's characters in more favorable positions."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If half stars were allowed I actually would have given this book another half star. I did enjoy it, but it was quite long and the length did not seem as necessary as in some of the other books. The action seemed slow, even draggy, which I had not found before. There were quite a few places where Jordan went into more detail than he needed. I also think that at this point he could stop explaining where every character came from so much and trust that by book five the reader probably knows all about it.It's hard to reach a balance between realism and interesting reading. As other reviewers have pointed out, Elayne, Nynaeve and Birgitte do bicker a lot and it is annoying. However, it's also realistic behavior to expect from three women cooped up together in a small space. Does that mean we want to read about it? Maybe not at such great length.Many interesting things do happen. I am increasingly fond of Mat, whom I couldn't stand at the start of the series. I enjoyed the women's time with the traveling show. As always, I enjoyed the characters of Thom and Juilin. I mainly enjoyed the characters in general. I would, however, like to see people begin to communicate and compromise more. Everyone seems to think s/he knows exactly what's best for everyone and no one listens. I hope they can begin to resolve this before the ultimate battle, or they're going to be in trouble.Book five is a point where people who have been stretching to be patient with this series are going to find they can't stretch any farther and give up. For those who don't find very long books daunting and those who don't chafe at inaction, it is something of a flat spot, but with its own features of interest."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I begin to get the sensations that many other reviewers have outlined from my reading of book 5.

I will read book 6... but the jury is out."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I actually was already a big fan of the book series, but these audio versions are extremly well done also, with very good narration and quality. Much better than most audiobooks I have tried in the past. Most importantly they are unabridged, which is very important with a story this complex. I was extremely happy with this product."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In this book many different issues are addressed. When I first read this book the plot absolutly shocked me. The deaths of several main characters shock the WoT universe, creating voids and resulting power struggles. Personally I feel that is so far is Jordan's finest and the best in the series.The action, is intense including 2 major battes (in the same book), confration with multiple Forsaken, not a boring dialogue filled book (unlike Crossroads...),increased character depth, and awesome twists to the plot (of which some haven't come back into effect yet...). Quite simply this is the Wheel of Time powerhouse novel were Jordan hits everynote in fullstride. I strongly recomend readers to start at the beginning and wait until they reach The Fires of Heaven. This is a very solid read, please enjoy it to the fullest."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Fires of Heaven is the first glimpse of what will plague the later novels. I had problems reading the first 500 pages, but after that the novel was great, even the parts concerning Nynaeve and Elayne. However, the first 500 pages probably took me four times as long to read as the last 480. They were slow and contained almost no action. I actually caught myself rereading sentences because I could not understood what they meant. But even the beginning was really too bad, just not as good as the second half, and the second half more than made up for the beginning.What happens. Rand chases Coudalin into Cairhien. Mat is becoming a great general. Rand's Aiel fight the Shaido. Moraine fights Lanfear. Nynaeve fights Moghedian. Rand fights Rahvin. Who wins? The final two hundred pages are jammed packed with action and excitement. But the best part of the novel is that Faile is only mentioned once. She is without a doubt the worst character ever created. This next line is for anyone who has read the novel already.Looking at the copyright date on the cover, it has been ten years since Jordan killed Moraine and probably twelve since Egwene's dream of Thom pulling a blue crystal out of fire. It's been ten years. When is something going to happen here.Anyway, this is still a great novel."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really love the series, and I feel like I know the characters-- they are even in my dreams! But I get irritated with the repetitive nature of the books, how Jordan is always reiterating things that we already know, such as: Nynaeve can only channel when she is angry (I don't know how many times I have read that!) and that she is much stronger than Egwene or Elayne, if she can channel at all! I get sick of it because I have read all of the books so far, and I manage to keep the characters in line-- I figure everyone else probably does, too. Also, I felt that there was something lacking in the fact that Perrin didn't make an appearance at all. But I guess I shouldn't complain-- the book was indeed impossible to put down, and I will be looking forward to starting #6 as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There is something, allmost inexplicably horrifying when you open the first page of the book and when you figure out that it was written in 1993. Then you make quick calcualtion, and then it stuns you. Twelve years. twelve years since book five (!?) and there is not an end anywhere close...Oh well, it seems that my grandchildren will countinue to read this saga, and they'll tell me all about it when I am blind and on my death bed....Oh well, better to say something about the book.What can you say? This is the book five and if you're not by now into this series, you should turn around and walk away, but if you, for some reason like it (or you are just masochistic as I am) this is same stuff as any before.It is, though, interesting, how everyone in the book, doesn't have a clue what they're doing, but they still insist on doing it, though still aware that their actions may shake the world in it's roots. Everyone goes around muttering their very own catchphrases that we learn to dislike, instead of maybe just being simpathetic with them in first book.Oh, yeah, short summary would be necessary here, just for you to know what you're missing and what you should expect (but I'm sure you can figure that out by yourself by now). Rand is leading Aiel, whose ways he still don't understand. Mat is trying to run away from them but still cannot. Egwene is doing nothing. Nynaeve and Elayne show remarkable ammount of idiotic behaviour, and that's about it. Oh, yeah, and a big fight in the end, where another Forsaken gets dumped...Just remember boys and girls...twelve years since then, 'till now..."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In _The Fires of Heaven_, the maturing that the characters have begun in the previous four books is really shown. Rand, while stubbornly refusing almost all the help people offer him, finds it difficult to be as tough as he pretend to be. His development is the most negative in the series, as he goes from an Everyman to a sort of uber-macho-man, the sort you can see Hemingway admiring: unemotional to the extreme. While this is understandable, it's also just the slightest bit annoying. Granted, Rand is surrounded by enemies, but he ought to figure out who his friends are. The other characters are less irritating. Perrin is absent for the entire book, presumably on some sort of extended honeymoon with his wife. While this is bad in some ways, it also gives Jordan the opportunity to focus more closely on his two remaining major plots: the Aiel matter, and the Black Ajah matter. To deal with the last first: Elayne reveals herself to be more and more a queen-to-be throughout the series. Her constant desire to be make peace and be diplomatic can get old, but that's what Nynaeve is around for. I don't know why so many people hate her-- she may be a bit tactless, but she has a heart of gold, as she shows time and again in the series. Of course, man troubles plague this book, since Nynaeve would rather be without Thom and Juilin (although they rescue her and Elayne rather neatly towards the beginning, for which they're actually *thanked*), and then they meet someone named Valan Luca, who actually falls in love with Nynaeve. There is also trouble with Moghedien, still angry that Nynaeve could match her in Tanchico; one of her cruelties in the World of Dreams makes Nynaeve become so unselfish it's almost nauseating, and a relief when she returns to her old self. With the Aiel, Egwene is learning all the twists of ji'e'toh, and maturing greatly. Aviendha's one step towards it is her semi-acceptance of her fate to never be a Maiden again, both by participating in the Cairhien battle without her spear and by the interesting scene in the Far Snows of Seanchan. Mat is amusing as always, whether shocking everyone with the knowledge he gained from the other *Finns, or when trying to escape a battle only to always find himself in the thick of it. The two huge battles towards the end of the book are very long, if you like that sort of thing, and full of non-martial observations, if you don't. And then, in the Andoran battle, there's the mysterious demise of Rand's tutor, Asmodean, which has been haunting _Wheel of Time_ fans since. There are so many great little plot details that make _The Fires of Heaven_ wonderful to read, from the use of forkroot to Rand and Lan becoming to similar to Forsaken plots. It's definitely one of the two best books in the series."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I made it through book five. I started the Wheel of Time series over a year ago and with each successive book it takes me longer and longer to finish. Like an all-you-can-eat buffet, I started out fast and now (with three books left) I'm more than full. Oh, I'll make it through books six, seven, and eight, but I'm reading (or eating) to fulfil a mission rather than out of hunger.That said, I won't comment much on the book itself (I've also written amazon reviews for the previous novels). The same usual stuff happens. Elayne and Nynaeve bicker like adolescents. Egwene and Rand bicker like adolescents. Mat chases women. Trollocs attack at will. There's a big final confrontation (gosh, I hope I'm not spoiling things) at the end. Jordan's juvenile obsession with female nudity and sexuality continues. In short, it's the same old, same old.Rather, I feel like spewing out some thoughts on why this series has received so much attention. Why are there so many readers who can't make it through the first ten pages of The Lord of the Rings (yep, it's true, read through the Amazon comments to see how many readers place Jordan above Toliken) but who CAN make it through EIGHT books and nearly 7,000 pages of this series?Fantasy is an ancient genre. There are elements of fantasy in the Bible, in Greek Mythology. In fact, it is impossible to date just how far back fantasy goes. Our more typical conception of fantasy (dragons, battles, elves, fairies, etc.) show up in Beowulf, the epic poem, The Faerie Queen, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Most recently, of course, in the 20th century, J.R.R. Tolkien (who, by the way, translated Gawain), Ursula LeGuin, and John Gardner (in his novel Grendel) have carried on the tradition. Sadly, though, this sense of tradition is what is missing from the Wheel of Time series. I really don't believe that Jordan is well aware of the broader tradition that he's writing in.So what tradition IS Jordan writing in? I may be going out on a precarious limb here, but Jordan's novels seem to stem from the more modern, attention-deficit disordered, quasi-Advanced Dungeons and Dragons/Role Play-gaming tradition. The Wheel of Time is a like a PC RPG put in words. There's a loosely structured main theme (Rand must defeat the Dark One) and inbetween there's a bunch of side missions and marching to and fro (the equivalent of roaming around gathering experience points). Along the way certain characters, with this accumulation of experience, recieve added skills (the ability to channel or channel with newly learned powers (healing, calling wind, etc.), the ability to dreamwalk, the ability to plan battles (Mat), the ability to communicate with animals (Perrin)). Likewise, characters pick up useful items along the way (Mat's medallion and spear, Elayne's Terangreal, Rand's Terangreal). And like in RPG's, after accumulating enough experience, they're finally strong enough to defeat a decent enemy (Asmodean, Rahvin, Moghedian etc.). And what happens after this enemy is defeated? Well, the characters go back to wandering back and forth throughout the countryside, gaining more experience points so they can do battle with the next strong enemy. Eventually, of course, these characters will be strong enough to encounter that final enemy, The Dark One, and then, well, Game Over!My problem is this: slowly going up levels and gaining experience points may be a lot of fun on a computer screen but it makes for BORING reading. Thus, I'll wrap up my long, long review with the following: there's something wrong when today's readers shun traditional, talented writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Ursula LeGuin (who, in addition to being a sci-fi/fantasy writer, is also a published poet and writer of literary fiction) and turn to the thin, convoluted plots of writers like Jordan. Readers who claim that Jordan is the greatest fantasy writer of all time simply don't appreciate strong, capable writing and manageable plots; instead, many of today's readers (when they can tear themselves away from Baldur's Gate or Everquest) cast the quality of the story and the quality of the writing aside in lieu of countless numbers of battles, myriad subplots and mindless wanderings back and forth across that silly Wheel of Time Map. When will the Wheel of Time series eventually end? I honestly don't know, but it seems Rand, Mat, Perrin, Elayne, Egwene, and Nynaeve still have thousands more pages of experience points to acquire!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"There is a recurring theme in all of the reviews of the Wheel of Time books - eventually, it seems, reviewers become fed up with the slow pace and aggravating main characters and give up, with more giving up the further along in the series they go.I'm probably at that point now. Fires of Heaven has a remarkable ending, one that gets the adrenalin flowing, but reaching that end is a long, tedious slog. Fully half of the novel - the half featuring the mind-numbing adventures of Nynaeve and Elayne - is barely readable. The portions with Rand are much better than in the previous book, but are too frequently interrupted by more of the Wimpy Women to be fully enjoyed. It is not that Jordan cannot write women . . . well, okay, he can't, but some of the best moments of Fires of Heaven come when he lets us inside the heads of Min and Siuan Sanche. But far too often the women characters spend their time complaining about men, only to place themselves in situations where men have to rescue them, all the while obsessing over how much cleavage or leg they or other women are showing. It's cute for the first few hundred pages of the first book. By the time one hits page 4000 in the series, however, it is a complete turn-off.It took two weeks to muddle through the thousand pages of this one (and only two hours to get through the last two hundred). It is a serious question whether book six will be worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have been reading the Wheel of Time series since the first book came out and this is my favorite series ever. However, it's not for everyone. Jordan is probably the most descriptive writer I have ever read and he will describe everything he possibly can in one situation in order to set the mood properly. This makes his books, and the chapters, very long. Some people don't like long and descriptive, elaborate writing like this, I do, and I believe that Robert Jordan is the best author I have ever read. Read the series in order, starting from the first book, and it will make a lot more sense and be much more enjoyable reading. I've gone back and read all of them over again at least twice."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Quite simply, the most boring book I've ever read.

Write on RJ !"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Yes! It was actually possible to write an entire, lengthy novel that is part of a long and ambitious series, and not substantially advance a single basic plot line. Just a string of overly descriptive chapters that moved characters around on vaguely defined or just unfinished business. What a depressing concept.I decided Jordan had essentially run out of ideas, yet he still seemed determined to stretch \\"The Wheel of Time\\" past ten or more titles.Willing to give the man one more chance, I confess I purchased \\"Lord of Chaos,\\" but gave up for good shortly after reading 100 pages when the paperback's binding failed and the book disintegrated. Since two of the previous books had shed their covers before I finished them, I decided this was a trend towards very cheaply made paperbacks stuffed with filler and fluff.Sadly, the series had become a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. The pacing is pretty good and everything is described in detail. Sometimes it gets annoying since there are a lot of pages keeping you away from the action, but it does lend that extra bit of richness to Jordan's world. There are some surprising developments and a couple plot twists you won't see coming unless you read between every line...and even then you will probably miss it. All in all, the book is an enjoyable read for the most part.The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that @*#&amp;$ Nynaeve. I wish Jordan would use Balefire on her and remove her sorry thread from the entire series PERMANANTLY. She has got to be one of the biggest @*#&amp;$^% of all time in the genre. Egwene and Elayne I can stand, and Moraine has always been the best female character in the series, and perhaps one of the best ever created in the genre."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think this is one of Robert Jordan's better books. To all of you people who give the latter half of the series a poor review, I don't think that Robert Jordan's subtle use of detail and foreshadowing actually registers in your pitifully impotent and inadequate minds. Somebody earlier stated what dress Egwene and Elayne are wearing is inconsequential, but if you think about it you need all the detail that he puts in. in a book detail is the quinessential essence, the essence that creates a cinematic experience in ones mind and imagination. In the Fires of Heaven Robert Jordan creates one such experience in such a vivid way that leaves the reader in a lingering taboo of contemplation, hungering for more. All of this is created in such a tangible and malleable way to form the perfect picture in the reader's mind. So if a person cares not for detail, then he/she can't get anything much from this wonderful collection of extoardinary novels. The way he evolves his storyline throughout the books is amazing. In book one, the story takes place in Emond's Field, a small localized location. As the story progesses the point of veiw gradually grows larger, more grand. It grows to encompass whole regions, countries, eventually the whole continent. Overall what I am trying to say is that the use, the jordanesque flare, in The Fires Of Heaven is not unnecessarilly subtle nor brazen, but that of a perfect level to illustrate the extreme beauty and complex world of The Wheel of Time. All in all, The Fires of Heaven was most definately a great book and i can't believe anyone could think otherwise. Read it again, pay more attention to the detail which you think so poorly of. ~signed, the HMFIC"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Mr Jordan first started the style of branching out new sub plots from the main ones in Book 3. At that time, I was quite impressed that he could actually compile the various little storylines into 1 book and all seem to be interconnected.However, in Book 4 &amp; 5 (esp. 5, The Fires of Heaven), he definitely overstretched his limits. No longer do I see the clearly defined links between those little plots. The storylines revolving around {Rand} and {Nynaeve + Elayne} have absolutely no connections at all. It's just like reading 2 completely different short stories compiled together in a book. Those meetings in dreams between Eqwene and Nynaeve seem a feeble attempt by Jordan to show that the 2 different stories are actually related.The 300 pages on Nyn. &amp; Elayne's travels are stuffed with insignificant details.(70 odd pages were spent on describing their lives with the circus? Is this book about circus life?)Last but not least, the ending, I believe was quite poorly done and predictable. Mat roasted by Rhavin? Of course he wont die and the only way to do it is burning Rhavin with balfire. I think that most people would have guessed that as well.I really hope book 6 can pack more punch."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"this book had everything and lacked nothing. it's definitely the best book in the series."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Okay, I like elements of Jordan's books, but this novel jumped the shark for me. Must every one of the main character's have a 'secret power'? No more normal humans, no, Min can predict the future, Egwene can dreamwalk, Nynaive is super powerful (but only when angry), Mat can channel dead Generals, Rands has hordes of nubile women lusting after him, Perrin... I won't even go there about Perrin's super-keen-but-oh-so-silly wolf abilities, which seemed to drop out of the sky. Where are the NORMAL people? I'm all for the super powers *in moderation* but what makes fantasy interesting is the struggles between normal joes and the super powered ones. When Jordan makes every one of his characters super-human the believability goes down the toilet.Also, Jordan's fantasy race the Aiel seem to be a race of Mary Sues. They can out-fight, out-hunt and out-run normal humans. Their customs are deemed superior they look down their noses at everyone else. The Aiel annoy me to the very core, as Jordan seemed to have created this unbelievable race to serve Jordan's messiah-ish character Rand.There are some other ick moments in this book for me. Jordan clearly seems to be setting up Rand to become some sort of fantasy Polygamist ala Heinlein. Ick. Also there is a strange element of humiliating powerful women which Heinlein seems to enjoy. Women are often spanked or 'thrashed' and male characters aren't. Also, he creates situations where characters are forced to do humiliating things such as.... The trio of former aes sidai forced to laundry, fetch, and clean for the general as 'punishment.' It seems a bit petty giving the characters lives are in danger.This was an entertaining novel, but the mary-suism really needs to be dialed down. 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is a slow moving plot line, like a giant freight train....."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The story rolls ponderously along, gathering characters like fractures.

You often can skip whole pages and not loose the story thread. Character interactions reinforce my conviction that Jordan's philosophy is: trust no one, have no friends, and those you do you cannot confide in, and if you love someone, torment them mercilessly.

The writing is starting to get a little ... dense here, but you will only be disappointed if you abandon the book early.Enjoy this book, because you have a lot of reading ahead of you that is less than stellar in Books 6, 7, and 8. There is noticable improvement in &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; ... but that's a 1500 pages away. In the meantime, things do move here, and if you have read 1-4, be prepared for a surprise by the end."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading this. In fact, I had to force myself to read it. After reading the first four books, each as long as this one, I was quite burned out on it. However, once I did pick it up and start reading it, it all came back to me and I mostly enjoyed it. I think this book has good and bad points.For one thing, everyone argues. A lot. You would think that all the trials and hardship they've gone through with and for each other, that it would bring them closer together. That's not the case. Instead, the characters are constantly at each other's throats. The women all think that Rand can't do anything right and get mad at him all the time, sometimes for no reason that I can discern. I found myself wondering if Robert Jordan perceives all women to be that way, since that is the way all the women in his books are. Rand has no idea what he's doing wrong in the women's eyes, and continues to act like a spoiled prince, while Elayne really is a spoiled princess. Nynaeve's stubbornness is unreasonable, and so is Aviendha's anger.On the other hand, there is more to the characters than meets the eye. You just don't get to see that much of it, and it doesn't come out much in their reactions to other characters. Also, since the books are so long, and it seems like such a long time since they left home, it's hard to remember that Rand, Matt, and Egwene are only teenagers. I'm not sure what Nynaeve's excuse is, though.We don't see much of Matt in this story, although he plays a more important part later into the story, and nothing of Perrin that I recall. I think Perrin should have had some part in this story, as he is part of the important trio with Rand and Matt. It's been so long since I read the other books, I'm not really sure I remember what happened to him, and seeing him again would have been nice. This time the story centers on Rand, Egwene, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Aviendha.Rand is trying to bring the tribes from the Aiel Waste together, and bring down the False Car'a'carn, Couladin. He also thinks that he's starting to go mad. Egwene is continuing her training with the Aiel Wise One's and is learning how to dreamwalk in Tel'aran'rhiod. Nynaeve and Elayne talk to Egwene through Tel'aran'rhiod, and are also hunting one of the Black Ajah.All in all, I don't see that there is much to distinguish this book from the others in the series I have read so far. It's not horrible, and it's not great. It seems more that it is just a step along the way. I think it could've been a much shorter step. If you plan on continuing with the series, you'll have to read this book."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If weren't for Perrin's battle in the fourth book, &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;, I may have given up on this series.While &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; isn't the page-turner that the first three &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; books were. It does manage to pull me back into this long epic.My favorite character, Perrin, is barely mentioned in this book and I find the conniving, bossing and moodiness of the woman characters terribly irritating (they also scare me because I fear that those traits could be all too real).It's the supporting characters, Thom Merrilen, Juilin, Lan, and others that make this story enjoyable.&quot;Wheel of Time&quot; is defiantly a worthwhile read for fantasy fans and I do plan to read the next one. It's just too darn long. So it won't make to the top of my must-read-list.While some huge epics out there, Martin's &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot; for example, stay vividly exciting. &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; seems to have a lot of filler.Note to authors: You do know you can finish a storyline and start another in the same setting.

The characters are very dynamic, and continue to change as time passes by, evolving from simplistic characters to well-rounded and powerful parts, capable of evoking emotions in any avid reader. The only problem I have with this book is the same one that I have had from the very beginning: All the women in the book act as if they are far superior to the males. I realize that reality, despite the best efforts of most people, is the exact opposite, but the book is still ruined by Jordan's repetitive use of this twist on his reality."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book had it all.

Once you start reading it's hard to put the book down! It allows you to get deeply involved with every character."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Fires of Heaven is an amazing story. I've just read it for the umpteenth time, and I found it as engaging as ever before. Unlike Knight Michaels, who writes nearby, I do not see characters being &quot;murdered,&quot; whether by sexual stereotyping or anything else. The main protagonist, Rand, shows an incredible growth in strength in response to the position he finds himself in. He seems to understand full well how everybody else has ulterior motives or hidden agendas where he is concerned. He alone seems to have an holistic view of the struggle, and he steels himself to do, or cause to be done, that which will give the best chance of success. If he seems arrogant or &quot;full of himself,&quot; - well that's sometimes what it takes to be a leader. Yet having to be that way is hurtful to him. He is after all, just 20 years old, and most of the world wants to use him or to kill him. That's a load for anybody. And, it's humorous to see the effect that three young women can have on the poise and concentration of our young Dragon.We see Elayne a lot more in this book. Sure, she's a spoiled brat. And, she's also delightfully spunky and adventurous. She has been growing on me, and she wins my heart in the scenes around Birgitte's reappearance in this world, and in particular by her dealings with Thom and Juilin. Those guys will follow her anywhere, and that's a good start to becoming Queen of Andor.Nynaeve - now there's a case for you. She has so many conflicts gnawing at her it's remarkable she can keep it together at all. She is several years older than the other key characters, and she was an important person in the quiet place where she has lived most of her life. She's struggling with the changes - her loss of acknowledged station, her situation with Lan, her ambivalence about Moiraine and Aes Sedai, etc. But, she's tough as nails and fierce as a tigress, and a real heavyweight with the One Power. The scenes with Moghedien, especially in the Royal Palace, are riveting.Mat - my favorite character - just keeps on being Mat. He would always take the easy way if he could, but the Wheel won't allow it. Our unassuming hero just continues to grow. Because he is such a cynic and antiestablishmentarian, the things that befall Mat are really incongruous. As a result, stories about Mat are often side-splittingly funny. But, even though Mat doesn't confide every little thing, Rand recognizes the development of his military skills. He uses Mat's skills to the extent he can. The battle scenes around Cairhien are terrific.As for the relations between men and women, I think Jordan has that scoped out pretty well. That's why that book about Mars and Venus was a monumental best seller. Let me introduce you sometime to my five sisters-in-law. They make ordinary Aes Sedai seem like Brownies, and they all seem to think they are the Amyrlin Seat. And, we brothers-in-law just look at one another and roll our eyes when they launch. There's nothing to be done about them.Finally, to those of you who think Jordan is just &quot;milking&quot; this story for the big bucks - think a minute. Imagine yourself a very wealthy person now, who everyday has to sit down behind a typewriter and write for 8 or 12 hours. You're going to spend a large chunk of your life producing further instalments of a story instead of going off to play and spend all that money. And this even though some significant number of people will revile your efforts and accuse you of being some sort of sleaze. I am thankful Mr. Jordan has stuck with it. I'm willing to pay the pittance he asks every two years or so, just to find out about some imaginary people who seem very real and are important to me. Remember what your grandmother said: &quot;If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan has awesome characters flying all over the place in his series. (I personally like Matt, and Perrin.) In this book, all of these amazing characters are doing some serious butt-womping! Nanaive in Telaranroid. Rand in the palace, and just his plotting alone. Matt turns out to have more hidden abilities in addition to his gambling luck (which I envy more than anyone can know) Perrin returns home to what I thought would be a boring &quot;time to get the crops going before it gets to cold and the town starves&quot; scenario, to instead be a knuckle-whitening challenge! Does he have to leave such tense cliff-hangers?!?! I read the next hundred pages like a man possessed to get back to that character, only to be presented with a cliff-hanger for another character. This is like an intelligent Soap Opera for serious fantasy fiends. And as for reading the books over, and over again to prepare yourself for the newest- I have a solution! Audio cassettes! I do NOT recommend listening to them before reading the books, as they do cut out quite a bit of the charm that is Robert Jordan. But they are very good, and M. Rolston is an excellent reader (except for Thom Merrilyn's voice). They are abridged and can be zipped through very quickly- letting you dive right in to the next book!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Although I do generally agree with everyone else saying that the series is slowly beginning to lose some of its initial 'oomph', I must say that this book still tops the ranks of one of the best WoT books in the series.And BTW, I do like Nynaeve so you guys can stop it with the insults about her 'braid tugging' and 'skirt smoothing'! Unfortunately, I don't quite like what Jordan has done with his characters. They started out pretty likable, with definitive characteristics and their own minds, but now I see that they've degenerated to extremes. The women as usual have almost formed their own unofficial universal Women's Circle, with Elayne, Aviendha, Egwene and the rest trying to rid the world of men (even though it's pretty obvious who they've thrown their hearts out for ...). Rand has lost all his appeal to me as the central character of the series, becoming more like a madman muttering to himself all the time, while trying to puzzle women out and defeat all the Forsaken for his 'immaculate' plans. Mat has always been irritating, so I'll just skip him, but Perrin was totally obliterated from this particular book! Sometimes, it gets pretty unnerving for someone with such a terrible memory like me to keep up with the central ppl in the story when they aren't even included in certain books... Anyway, the WoT is still THE series to read! I've already bought the next one, so I'm in no hurry to get to the end (if it ever comes! j/k Jordan! Take all your time! PLEASE!)."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After surviving the disappointment of \\"The Dragon Reborn\\", the Wheel of Time series has definitely regained its lost momentum and the series continues to get better with each book.This book has been my favorite of the series so far. Jordan builds on the momentum he captured in book four (\\"The Shadow Rising\\"), and the storyline and character development continue in TFOH.As for the main characters, each is facing new and exciting challenges in this book. Rand is still dealing with the realization that he is The Dragon Reborn. He has rallied the Aiel clan chiefs in a massive battle against the rebel Aiel chief Couladin, who claims that he is the true Dragon Reborn. Couladin and his followers, the Shaido, meet the fury of Rand and the rest of the Aiel in a decisive and climactic battle.Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve continue their pursuit of the Black Ajah. Word has reached them that Siuan Sanche has been overthrown and stilled by Eladia. The three have also learned that a group of Aes Sedai has decided to try to overthrow Eladia and reclaim the White Tower.Mat, Lan, and Moiraine continue to travel with Rand. Mat distinguishes himself in the battle with the Shaido by beheading Couladin. Moiraine has decided to become more yielding to Rand, but this turns into disaster at the end of the book.This book is the best of the series so far in my opinion. The storyline and character development is very good, and the plot keeps the reader interested throughout the book. The last 200 pages of the book are some of Jordan's best work. The ending of the book is a true cliffhanger and will leave the reader wondering what will happen next. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. Hopefully, it will be as good as this one."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once)I Have never left a series unfinishedI am leaving my third decadeI have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly.I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.Shame."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off, this book is not awful. It is just not that good, and this is where he starts wasting countless pages on meaningless descriptions. If you have read the first four, consider stopping. By the end of this oversized book, much of the magic of the series will be gone.I don't know who told Jordan he was good at writing women, because he is the worst I have ever read. If real women were as snippity, hot-tempered, one-dimensional, and stupid as every single woman in this series, no one would be here.This book also continues his over-use of phrases such as: 'but there it was', and 'so and so looks at character x as if seeing him for the first time'. He should get 10 floggings for each use of these two phrases, that will keep him on the flogging post for months. He also has a bad habit of capitilizing words/phrases that should not be. ie Nynaeve Tugs at her Braid, while Taking a Dump. Well it isn't quite that bad, but close. Actually, since he no longer cares about story and his main concern is now endless, pointless descriptive blather, I am surprised we haven't been treated to several hundred pages of one or more characters pinching off a loaf. Imagine the drama and excitement as we feel Elaynes pain as she strains and strains to no avail, and then she goes to Nynaeve for a herbal cure, and we get to learn what herbs to use for such a tragic condition.The Wheel of Time is a deep, well fleshed out world in desperate search for an interesting story. It is not found in FoH, and the tradition not only continues, but gets exponentially worse, up to and including the worst novel ever written: Crossroads of Twilight."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was the weakest book in the series so far for me. The plot is thinly developed, and the relationships are not focused or emotionally acute enough to make me care. I read this after I finished Shadow Rising, with the relationship of Perrin and the Bashere woman fresh in mind. (I think that she was from house Bashere-- the Hunter of the Horn, whom he loves.) This one, despite the sparkling relationship between Aviendha and Rand, saw these highlights come few and far between. The best thing in the book for me was probably the rise of Matt as leader of the Red Hand, a re-instated military group from the Age of Legends. Matt does not use Age-Of-Legends warriors or anything to man his army. He just runs it. Also, this book relates some great tragedies, and course changes. The book gets three stars because Jordan's prose is still actually pretty lucid, and he seems to have a point to make. The thing is, these points are explained with little vigor."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Last time I read this book, it was a while ago, but at the moment, I am nearly half way re-reading, I've nearly finish 4, and about to reenter five.With what i remember, it was fantastic as it all is.

Why? Well, despite my above comments, I think number 5 is actually more focused and moves a bit better than number 4. This is not so much an endorsement of Fires of Heaven as a recognition of how Shadow Rising was so horrendously written.Fires of Heaven still has most of the problems that plagued Shadow Rising. Needless summation of previous events, characters reduced to caricatures, saying in 50 pages what could be more effectively done in 10 or 20, etc... it just has the feel that Jordan has totally lost control of his series and is drifting aimlessly. He seems to have written the parts of the story that he was sure about in the first few books, but then he let the scope of his series overwhelm him and so now, with this book and the previous one, he has produced 2000+ pages of material that can only be described as very disappointing, after showing some promise in books 2 and 3. Final caveat: lots of this book take place in Telaranriod, and that bothers me because Telaranriod is one of the sillier, more illogical concepts developed in this series. The notion of a \\"dreamworld\\" which is an actual physical copy of the real world, but where nothing is permanent except for injuries to a person's body is a metaphysical nightmare of an idea that Jordan really botched thoroughly.But is this surprising? By now, no."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Being particularly fond of lengthy series, Robert Jordan delivers the goods. I didn't find out about the series until the eighth volume, but when I did I couldn't put them down. Just when the story gets you focused on one character, the perspective changes in such a way that another character is the central figure. I especially enjoy when they interract. I am also looking forward to the illumination to the allusions of this world perhaps being a time in our own very distant future (light bulbs, airplanes, even the original names of their notable historical figures). I can't wait to see where it's all going and am looking forward to ride."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In this book (as well as in his previous books) Robert Jordan really shows his writing skill. Not only is he creating a interesting and exciting world full of magic, he also provides us with interesting details of the people living there. The Aiel are simple the best and their strange customs and Rand's struggle to get along with these is sometimes really funny.A very good element of the story is also the rebirth of the heros and so their memory of long past lives. Therefor Mat is for me nearly the most interesting caracter of Jordan's novels. His unnatural luck and his strategic skill he shows often accidentely do not let the others understand him.I am really looking forward to the next book.

His fight to hold off madness will be an interesting development for the story. Mat Cauthon's character, which I was only interested in passing, has been stepped into a new dimension which leaves questions in my mind whether he will maybe become the second most important figure at Tarmon Gaidon behind Rand himself. The interaction between the Aiel and the &quot;Wetlanders&quot; provides comic relief and gives us an example of how two very different cultures can assimilate somewhat peacefully in society.

More than that, though, The Fires of Heaven continues the raising of the stakes that began in the fourth book. There, prominent characters were cast out of authority, Aes Sedai were stilled, the nature of the Aiel was changed forever, and more. Some of that continues here - most notably with respect to Mat, whose nature and importance to the series is beginning to become more and more apparent - but more than that, this book reminds us that the price of failure isn't just being outcast or losing what you hold to be true; it's death, and it's often brutal, and once it comes, there's almost no going back. We're still early in the series here, and no one would ever accuse Jordan of wielding as heavy an axe over his characters as George R.R. Martin. But at the same time, Jordan makes it clear here that no one is ever truly safe, not even characters we expect to have for books and books still to come. Rand al'Thor is the hope and savior of Jordan's world, but fulfilling that role isn't as easy as showing up and being himself; in fact, as The Fires of Heaven reminds us repeatedly, Rand is inexperience and out of his depth, and his survival is never as assured as we might hope it would be, a fact which the book makes fatally clear. And yet, for all of the gathering threats, for all of the danger, there's a sense that the boy we met in The Eye of the World is no longer a boy, but a man - and a dangerous one at that. It's that rich character development - not just Rand and Mat, but the Aiel, and Moiraine, and Elayne, and so many more - that makes The Wheel of Time so rich and immersive. More than that, though, it makes the death that's entering into the series all the more chilling."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"And great on the Kindle and my Lumia.

Rand and Mat are still chasing Couladin and The Shadio who are wrecking havoc all over the East, killing anybody that gets in their way. Rand has some great character development tat really let's you in to his thought process there's a big shock involving rand and another character. It's really fun watching the Taveren and Mat's luck pulling him all different ways, when he has really had enough and just wants to get a way but the Wheel won't let him. Egewyne Comes lore to learning the Wise Ones ways as well as learning the Dream world. Nynaeve and Elayne have the far interesting story in this book as they search for the rouge Aes Sedai They confront the Forsaken, The Prophet, Join the circus, The White Cloaks, and get poisoned, as well as meet up with some old Friends. I was very satisfied with where their story went.This Book has the Most Deaths thus far in the series, of characters you've read about in the other books, I would say three of them are really shocking and I did not see them coming.ALL in all this book was one of My Favorites there was lots of surprises, there was a good mix of politics and war.

The action culminates at the end like most novels do along with some added twists and unexpected character changes. Other readers describe this novel (along with many others in the series) as slow and boring. If you like a novel to pique your interest every minute, then this series will leave you disappointed. If you want to immerse yourself into the storyline and world completely, then you are in the right place.That being said, there was one point of the book that always made me want to read right past it. That was the women constantly getting angry with the men for being decent, well, men. Always rolling their eyes or sternly talking to them as if they were complete idiots. If I didn't know any better, this book feels like it was written by a woman who hated men. I certainly hope that the following novels don't have as much of this bashing as it became old very quick."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When it was announced that Brandon Sanderson was tapped to complete the Wheel of Time after the untimely passing of author Robert Jordan, I suddenly had my interest in the series piqued after many years of apathy. So, I began the somewhat titanic undertaking of re-reading the Wheel of Time, a task that I am still in the midst of while alternating between one Wheel of Time book and books by other authors.My favorite books in the Wheel of Time series remain The Great Hunt and The Shadow Rising -- although The Shadow Rising does start off particularly slow. The first four volumes remain by and large coherent works that while being part of a bigger series still introduce and resolve certain plot elements within their own pages. The Fires of Heaven is the first book to make the transition from a traditional volume in a series that stands somewhat on its own, to the \\"super-novel\\" approach adopted by later books. This is when the action begins to slow down and pages and pages are spent describing clothes or going round and round through the characters' fears and insecurities. This is not to say that important things don't happen in The Fires of Heaven -- Moiraine's fate, Rand's growing madness, Mat's transformation from an archetypal trickster into something a bit more and developments in Salidar are all important to the series.Yet, one of the most important confrontations in the novel -- the battle against the Shaido -- has key moments occur off-screen, while much time is spent for a final confrontation with one of the Forsaken that is not built up much through the course of the book.The Fires of Heaven is by no means a bad book, or the worst title in Jordan's classic series (the dubious honor falls on the completely worthless Crossroads of Twilight). But it does remind me why I gave up on this series so long ago and why some volumes are going to be a slog to get through. Luckily, it's high points outweigh its low points. But that won't always be the case as the series marches towards the Last Battle.Please note that while though this book is currently priced at $6.39, The Fires of Heaven is one of the titles that Macmillan wished to foist on Kindle owners for $14.99. Since used copies can be obtained for less than a dollar, and new paperback copies are substantially cheaper, this seems a bit ridiculous for an older title. I'm glad to see that it's currently being offered for a fair price."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm sure this is a great book.

Whether it's them or Amazon one of them is really messing up its customer relations, and the other one, by not communicating to us what is going on, is doing the same.*Update: Amazon has just made this available in Canada. The three day delay is no problem; the absence of information is. I was going to buy a used paperback copy from a second hand store today. Now I don't have to, but it would have sucked if I had done so yesterday not knowing that I only had to wait one more day to get the format that I want (and am willing to pay for). I've upgraded my rating from one star to three to reflect that I'm happy Amazon is taking the steps necessary for it to make these titles available in Canada, but that I'm disappointed with their communication of what's going on to us Canadian customers."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Entertaining read. Robert Jordan has the fantastic ability to set the surroundings in such a way that you feel you are there in the scenes."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"We come to the fifth book of the sequence and we can see that there is pressure to start bringing us to a conclusion. One that Jordan will again fight and sidestep around so that the series grows.We have had in most of the books so far three streams. In the first when the party splits after being chased in Shadar Logoth, it has set us up for this sequence in all the others. But here one of the three, which might have been a conscious play on three Tevern, though often those three combined in some way, one whole third is missing. Perrin.That makes this one of the weaker books.It is a book about movement. Get from the Aiel waste to the land of the Kingdoms. We have had that before, but it seems when we have, we have been grounded in places. Here, that is at the beginning and the end.We are introduced to exciting characters, Valan Luca and the menagerie, what fun. But again the story is so large Aludra returns, has met Thom before, and Jordan drops the ball by not having them recognize each other.Galad takes more depth, and here we start to question relationships. Did not Galad and Rand share a mother? Will that not come into play? When?But I said how things look like they could be finished at the end of the book. We have a powerful group of Aes Sedai with an army growing. We have the old Sheniaran companions of Rand growing an army, we have an army of Aiel, and we have an army of kingdom men following Rand, and more in the last few pages. We keep killing Forsaken.So we can get to the big battle in the next. But we won't.Too many ideas. Have to make sure every single one is fed to the faithful and noting left out. This book also spawns the rudeness that was Robert Jordan in the great RAFO-Asmodean dilemma. I have read and not found out more than a half dozen times. You can only guess at the answer. Jordan and his Hubris make this one of the worst of the series.Another example of his Hubris. A city surrounded by, after several days of siege, 160,000 warriors. Walls may give an advantage of 5 to 1, so there has to be over 30,000 defenders inside, but that is never written. Further, until this battle, those 160,000 enemy, Aiel, could easily take on any two regular kingdom soldiers. It was only the better warriors who could face them fair.Rand Brings over 300,000 Aiel spears, and there is another 160,000 undecided. In the midst of all this, the only kingdom soldiers a few thousand, under Mat, are roaming the battlefield with a mission.The numbers of the Aiel in relation to all we know of the world are out of proportion. In relation to all we know of those who were to follow and who remained behind. The battle is also hyperbole in that we do not have a map, so a unit is in a gully, surrounded by hills, a light forest hiding them. This is all on the plains in front of a walled city. Jordan wanted to talk about a great fight, and though a student of military history, did little to give us a believable battlefield, or battle.So why read this, because you have to read it to get to the rest. There is good stuff in it. And more good to follow. It adds depth to the rich world, but it certainly looks like it was written with add a careful plan on how to bring us to a conclusion. The objectives were met by bringing Rand to the Kingdoms with the Aiel, and setting up a Tower dedicated to fighting the fight that Rand has to fight. But so much more should have been done. And, where is Perrin?"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"NOTE: This review contains some spoilers, so I would not suggest reading this review if you haven't read this book just yet . . .The fifth installment of Robert Jordan's \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series immediately picks up where The Shadow Rising left off, so those who haven't read the first four books before this one will be very confused.Anyway, the story continues as Rand, Egwene, Mat, Moiraine, Lan, Aviendha, and the people of Rhuidean move West into Cairhien to stop the Shaido Aiel from destroying it. Meanwhile, Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, and Juilin continue their search for the Forsaken while disguising themselves as performers in an active menagerie. A few chapters also involve Queen Morgase of Andor, Siuan Sance, Leane, and Logain. They're short but they are still very important to the overall story.As I've said before in my previous reviews of Books One through Four, this is a fantastic fantasy series. It is vastly complex with its plot, characters, places, and a distinctive magic system. The characters, especially are what makes this story interesting. Rand al'Thor, Moiraine Damodred, Aviendha, Egwene al'Vere, Mat Cauthon, Asmodean, Valan Luca, Rhuarc, Queen Morgase, and countless others have their very own personalities: no one's completely the same (except for some minor characters). Mat Cauthon, especially, has become an immensely popular character over the years. His pure luck, his passion for gambling, and his appearance (green silk coat, wide-brimmed hat, fox-headed medallion, and spear) makes him one of the most recognizable figures in fantasy fiction.-----------------------------------------------------------I think everyone who's read the book knows what's good about it: (memorable characters, complex histories and mythologies, humor, etc.). So I'll skip the good side, and focus on what's awful about it, at least in my opinion . . .Like every other book that's out there, The Fires of Heaven does have its flaws. One of it deals with the pacing. In the first four books, the pace was just fine. In nowhere were they really too fast or too slow. But here in the fifth volume, almost everything seems to slow down for the first time. The number of plots and sub-plots are at a very high level (though not as high as the more countless ones in Books 8 through 10), there are a whole lot of things going on, so it takes time to understand everything. The second flaw on the list comes from the character Aviendha. Now, she as a character isn't the problem. She is indeed complex and fairly likeable. Her constant reminder to Rand, however, became almost painful. Whenever she tells Rand that he \\"belongs to Elayne,\\" I felt like telling her, \\"He gets it! I get it! WE get it! You don't have to say it page after page!\\" This happens in The Shadow Rising as well. Thank God she stops in the second half of the book.And speaking of Elayne and Rand, I can't get anything out of this couple. So they meet at Caemlyn for such a short time in The Eye of the World, and then in The Shadow Rising, Elayne and Rand admit that they're both in love with each other? I'm sorry, but I don't see any real relationship between the two, except for the \\"love at first sight\\" ploy. Rand would be better off only with Aviendha, (or Egwene, but that won't happen. I guess we'll find out who Rand will REALLY end up in the last volume).Another flaw in the Fires of Heaven (hell, in the ENTIRE series) is the character Nynaeve. I know she's supposed to be a character that we can somewhat admire despite her big temper. In truth, I found her to be one of the most annoying characters in the series, and in fantasy fiction in general. She gets mad in almost every chapter that she's in, and her personality does feel forced at times. The scenes in which Nynaeve feels extremely miserable after she couldn't rescue Birgitte in time was especially irritating. Birgitte should've done something much worse to her, just to get her to understand that Birgitte is still alive, and that mistakes do happen. And let's not forget about her relationship with Lan, Moiraine's Warder. Where the heck did that come from anyway?! Like Rand and Elayne, I just don't understand how they were able to fall in love. Nynaeve and Valan Luca would be more sensible than this!And finally, here's the one that hits hard . . . the absence of Perrin! Why isn't he in the fifth volume? He's ta'veren: he's supposed to be as important as Rand and Mat. But he's only mentioned in a few pages. Jordan could've at least trimmed down Nynaeve and Elayne's plot and written about fifty pages about Perrin, Faile, Loial, and the conflicts in the Two Rivers. But we're only left with brief mentions from different characters. A shame, really.----------------------------------------------------------With all these flaws, you would think that I would give this three stars instead of four. Well, I'm just being nice . . . for now. I have thoroughly enjoyed The Wheel of Time (except when it comes to Book 10), and I can look past the flaws, if not completely. All in all, The Fires of Heaven is still an enticing read, and it's much better than the later volumes.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After a couple of chapters to set the stage, the Rand plotline moves forward at breakneck pace throughout this volume and a number of important events take place (including the biggest mystery of all in this series!). My only complaints were that the Siuan/Min/Leane and Elayne/Nynaeve threads moved too slowly at times. However, the Elayne/Nynaeve thread still had some critical events take place. I truly enjoyed the Rand/Aviendha interaction, as I did Mat resisting the call of battle at first before giving in. The last 100-150 pages of this book are shattering, and really serve as the conclusion to the events from Shadow Rising. While it dips in parts, this is a solid four rated book and really makes you yearn for the next book."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book picks the pace back up after a slower fourth volume. Several subplots advance satifactorily here and the cast of characters continues to progress--familiar characters keep developing and new characters enter the story in ways that add to the overall narrative.

Highly recommended to all who have read the first four books in the series."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This fifth Wheel of Time book goes a bit more widescreen.Mat, now being the general to beat all generals with his Bene Gesserit-general-specific type memory knowledge, is an obvious choice when you have a fairly heavy duty war to be fought.The only problem is, there is likely to be more than one, and in different places.Those sneaky Forsaken are still hanging around, too."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've been more than patient with Robert Jordan.

The next 300 pages are so monotonously boring, I almost threw the book in the trash. The attack on Cairhein was interesting, but then the book bogged down again because Nynaeve was constantly complaining about the same things over and over and over and over and over... The result is that the last half of the book is only slightly better than the first.The fate of Lanfear and Moiraine were interesting. Nynaeve's confrontation and capture of Moghedien was also good. However, Rand's final confrontation with Rahvin is not only predictable, but down right formula. Every book ends with just such a confrontation against one of the Forsaken.As I've said in my reviews of the previous books, Jordan is a fairly good story teller, but his poor writing ability constantly gets in the way."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Another bestseller.

I've really enjoyed these books, but I have some problems. Everyone else has commented on the amount of description, so I can skip that. Starting in book 3 or so, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene merge into the same character. Without the context you couldn't tell which character you are reading about. They act exactly the same. It's very frustrating. Was I the only one who noticed that Nynaeve's obsession with pulling her braid came in the middle of book 2, and not book 1? All the \\"habits\\" of characters have evolved along the way. However, my biggest problem would be this obsession with \\"Women's Circle\\" or the constant berating of men. I'm a girl, and we aren't always that derogatory of men. I'm getting to the point where I dread the girls perspective because we have to listen to 3 pages berating men, and then the plot continues. However, if we listen to Rand we get his little temper tantrums and lessons on Aeil customs. But if we switch to Mat we hear about how much he hates being ta'veren. These are my biggest problem. And traveling. Can't they just arrive somewhere and stick with it? I do really enjoy the series, and hopefully he'll be able to smooth out some of these problems."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The series started out fine with The Eye of the World. The next installment continued the plot well. After that, however, the Wheel of Time spun slowly and stayed in one place.Now, it wasn't the length of the book that put me off - I love longer books. But when the storyline just drawls on, the bulk of the book makes you groan. The descriptions are vague, and everything seems to repeating itself. Nothing gets anywhere! The women are mad at the men for trivial things, the men are mad at the women for even stupider things, and all of the books seem to end in the exact same place as the previous installment. I nodded off before Jordan could draw breath for his next rant.Best to just cut the books off quickly."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Something to do with balefire? Lightning? The tempers of the people in the book? I still don't really know what \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" stands for, and I must admit that troubles me.But not to the point of reading the book again.This book's content made no impression on me. I can't remember anything that happens in \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" other than three scenes near the very end. I have no idea why. This amnesia set in two weeks after I first read the book, and has continued since.At the time I read it, I still really liked the series, which I was reading from the library, had just finished \\"The Shadow Rising\\" extremely quickly, and hurtled into \\"The Fires of Heaven.\\" It took me a month to get to the last page. This was where the series's plotlines suddenly exploded into a million writhing lines of illogic. It must have been, because when I started \\"Lord of Chaos\\" (which I liked much better), there were those plotlines. But only vague images of this book itself remain to me.If you're reading \\"Wheel of Time\\" for excitement, you might want to skip directly to the end of \\"The Fires of Heaven.\\" There are several interesting battle scenes that might make your blood pound without reading the rest of the book. (I won't reveal them for spoilers' sake).Why review this book, then, if it made so little impression on me?Because that's not what should have happened. I was in the middle, so far as I knew, of an exciting series- grant that I was younger then- and one where I actually cared about the world if not the characters. I thought the pace would continue. I thought Rand would change the Aiel in some dramatic way. I thought there was a plot somewhere in all the Aes Sedai bickering. I thought the thing I wanted most would happen, and Faile would finally die.But this book slammed me dead. It was a year before I started \\"Lord of Chaos,\\" and then I didn't miss the presence of \\"Fires of Heaven.\\"So, even though my reaction to this book is mostly indifference, mixed with it is a grumbling dissatisfaction. I think that Jordan sabotaged himself with this book. Various reviewers pinpoint various places in the saga that made them give up. This book wasn't enough to make me give up, but it was enough to warn me that Jordan was not an undisputed genius and could not walk without faltering. Up until that point I had thought he was.The one star is because there are no 0-star options. Well, and because I still wonder what the title means."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Or so it will seem to the reader while reading this book. The promise of the WOT is amazing but squandered hopelessly. If every book was written like the prologue to the Eye of the World, this series would have been more than great. As it stands, Jordan seems to find the need to write badly, sloppily, with complex yet dull plots and dull characters who love to complain.Around this time the series turns quite sour. I didn't bother to read the rest of the books- just skimmed through the endings at the local library.So here's a short description of what happens in this book.Forsaken scheme and plot. Rand is trying to lead the Aiel out of the waste. Nynaeve and Elayne are wandering the countryside trying to report back to the Amyrlin. Forsaken scheme and plot some more. Nynaeve and Elayne join a menagerie and bicker (no, not bicker, BICKER) for 500 pages. Rand finally leads the Aiel out of the waste. And then BANG, the ending, and the next book.There are some VERY well written scenes in this book- the part by the caravans near the end, for example. But there are so many flaws, and so many pages and pages of nonsense that must be trudged through, that its just not worth it.In addition to the utterly boring female characters (apart from Moiraine) and the dull plots involving travelling circus adventures, you will be subjected to endless verbiage about the World of Dreams and cleavage.Yes, cleavage. And nudity to a lesser extent. Jordan apparently can't get enough of cleavage. No description of cleavage possible is left out. About once every 3 sentences in any chapter involving women we have cleavage.If you positively must read this book, do yourself a favor and read the following parts only:1. the one chapter with the forsaken in it at the beginning.2. the chapter called &quot;the Far Snows&quot;3. the chapter with the battle and Mat4. the chapter with the scene near the caravans (its near the end) and everything after that."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really have a hard time understanding the people that love these books. I was looking for a new fantasy series and I'd heard about the Wheel of Time. Its fantasy. Its long. Its popular. So maybe its good, I was thinking. Well 5 books later I'm giving up. Sure the first book was interesting; getting to know the world and the characters usually is. But by now The books are so predictable that reading them is more of a chore than enjoyment. The plots of each individual book are so cyclical that soon we will be able to predict on exactly which page-number Rand will have his final confrontation with the latest minion of the Dark One. And the plot of the series as a whole no longer interests me becuase I no longer believe that Mr Jordan is capable of surprising his readers. If you like cliches and retread plots that go nowhere than you'll like Robert Jordan but, in my opinion; you'll be a lot happier with Tad Williams or George RR Martin if you're looking for true innovators in modern fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This audio book can be ordered at most book stores for less than $100 new.

That being said, it washighly entertaining, continued the illumination of the world where ittakes place, and contains plenty of action. In short, I loved it, butI just didn't love it quite as much as The Shadow Rising, or Lord ofChaos. Nevertheless my recommendation is to keep reading.This book does follow the \\"pick up and leave\\" formula of the previousfour books, this time starting out from Rhuidean, with Rand and theAiel heading back to Cairhien, and warring with the Shaido, in pickingup from the ashes of The Shadow Rising. There is much explication ofthe workings of the power with Asmodean, a very interesting character,and of course Lanfear is still afoot. Rand's relationship withAviendha develops more and things take surprising twists that are notresolved in this book. Mat is developed very highly as a character: Ireally started to like him in this book. Nynaeve and Elayne maketheir way back to the tower unknowing of the schism precipitated bySiuan's deposing. Perrin is totally absent. This was a surprisingchoice to me, but I barely noticed, and the way it was done (there arevisits to the Two Rivers in the dream world) was artful.The big one was this: Nynaeve and Elayne join a circus. Now when Ifirst read this, I was furrowing my brow trying to think if this wasreally as silly as it seems. After having read the next two books, Irealize it makes a lot of sense: Jordan's depiction of the world hehas created includes all aspects, which is what makes it great. Oneof those aspects is the arts that he depicts. One of the biggestcharacters of The Eye of the World is a gleeman; gleeman, poets,musicians and so on take particularly large roles in these stories.After considering that, seeing Elayne and Nynaeve in contact with atraveling show made sense. It also makes sense in the politicalcontext where Jordan presents it. I don't mind so much after a littlethought. Definitely not a reason to stop after The Shadow Rising.The ending of this book (that is, the last 200 pages) is the bigaction sequence, where we don't just get the usual big fight with theForsaken, but three (count 'em, 3!) huge battles take place.Furthermore two major characters are done in during a sequence thatstill haunts me.

How in the name of all that is good and holy can you say that the WoT series is a product of a short-attention-span generation? NINE books at close to 1000 pages each? There are alot of problems one might have with WoT, but I don't think that can be one of them. Let me say also that if you have read the first four, can you really be happy stopping now?

It was wonderful to find out about Rand's real mother and father. But the real story lies in the ending of the blockade of Carhien by the Shaido Aiel. Also in the book Andor is added to Rand's belt. Another exciting part was the killing of Rahvin and Lanfear (or so you think). Jordan is a brilliant writer. I felt all the emotions swirl through me while i was reading, I could almost hear Lews Therin's voice. I loved this book just like all the other books in the series.

The introduction of some new characters is done quite nicely as well. Jordan has a gift for putting the people in his books in seemingly impossible situations and then extracting them from those situations in ways that are both suprising and plausible. I found myself wondering if we were going to lose an important character so often that I was genuinely suprised when we did. I have two major problems with this book that most reviews have already covered 1)no Perrin, big mistake 2)for all the pages and events in the book, the story itself doesn't seem to move forward. I found myself going with this edition of the story waiting for some important payoff. I was dissapointed that it never came. I'll give the next one a shot because I've come this far, but I hope to see some resolution soon.

In fact, I can outline their entire jorney with a sentence:They started out in Tanchico &amp; ended up with Min. There is only one very interesting part concerning Brigette. The 300 or so pages on them include mainly descriptions of seamen, circus fellows &amp; of course the infamous tarven owners! I do not understand why RJ Potrays such a negative aspect of the female character on most girls here?BUT... I like the parts on Rand, Mat, Min &amp; even Moraine. They were refreshing for a change &amp; though the story still moves quite slowly, at least they were worth mentioning.So, here's my recommedation: 1.Read the book as normal, but I strongly advise skimming through parts on Nyanaeve &amp; Elayne ( I know thats not good reading habits, but better this than give up a good story in frustration ). I don't see how their endless scenarios in the dream world &amp; on carriages and ships contributes to the plot at all. Bye! ^_^"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is a book that weeds out the casual readers from the hardcore fans. Its slowwww, and almost nothing happens, it took me alomost a month to read it; I kept putting it down. If you think this book is terrible, youre right. This is the worst book, in the series, and a far second worst is book 7. The rest of them are great. If you can handle this one, youll be rewarded with an additional 7500+ pages of some good stuff. If you cant, godspeed, maybe you should try out sword of truth, its a lot less convoluted."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Despite the fact that the extremely famous Wheel of Time series seems to have lost some popularity with fans by the 10th book, this is a good epic (at least for the first 5 books I've read so far). Just like Tolkien allegedly created his world to explore the various invented languages, so too it seems that one of the motivations behind Jordan's creation is to suggest how mythology is born, lived and forgotten. As a result, the Wheel of Time world is centred on the idea of the revolving wheel where the succession of ages, is circular. The series contains a very well thought out universe and mythology as well as interesting characterisation and good writing. I don't really consider fantasy a favourite genre but this series has been good at least in the beginning.This fifth book is better than the previous two in that it contains much more action Rand-wise (whereas the previous ones had several hundred of pages of him moping). After the end of the last book, he finally has his own people the Aiel and he finally begins to take action, weaving around the politics of Aiel customs, his commitments to his friends and the guilt of having them involved as well as machinations from the Forsaken.The frustrating part is largely the other characters: Elayne, Nynaeve, Siuan etc. who are all scattered throughout the land and go on their epic journeys which are tedious at times. That and the gender politics of the Wheel of Time are increasingly frustrating as the men are bumbling fools and the women unfeeling dominatrixes (or at least most characters fall into one of those two broad generalisations). The mechanics of the new divided Tower is always interesting but there is quite a bit of what I found to be very frustrating.Apparently the next book (6) is very good and then it goes downhill until 11. This one still doesn't seem as drawn-out and scattered-with-plot-openings as the next ones probably are, but there are still plenty of Jordan's quirks which become tiresome after several thousand pages. Whether you persevere depends on how much you like the world he's created. If you forego a significant amount of annoyance, there's still a good tale to be told here!"},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was awful. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and would give them 10's, and the third as well. The fourth started good and slowed by the end, giving signs to the decay of the story that was to become the fifth book. While the complexity of the plots and the overall storyline are attractive, Jordan has slowed the book so bad that even when Rand was battling the Shaido, I could easily put the book down for a few days. There is never a sense of suspense or panic, I was certain throughout my reading that no major character would die, it was a matter of seeing how the events played out. As for the characters themselves, the descriptions are cut and paste from one book to the next, they never evolve, and even though we no how they will react, we are reminded every other line. Jordan has also worked into the story an absolutely horrendous relationship between men and women, that is the same with every couple. No good questions are answered from the last book, and we are left with more at the end of this one. Anyone who dares rival the works of Tolkein to this verbose, out of touch writer needs to take some creative writng courses and get a good mental exam. For me, this series is done."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"4.5 stars. This is the 5th book in the Wheel of Time series, and about 1.5 years have passed since the villagers of the Two Rivers left their home with the Aes Sedai Moiraine and her Warder Lan. Since the ending of The Shadow Rising, about 2 months have passed and it is now late summer in the Wheel of Time world.The Shadow Rising ended with Rand uniting half the Aiel clans and capturing the Forsaken Amosdean for a teacher so he can learn how to control saidin, the male half of the True Source. This book is told mainly from Rand, Egwene, and Nynaeve & Elayne's viewpoints. There are also some sections told from the perspective of the former leader of the Aes Sedai, Siuan Sanche and her comrades, including another former Aes Sedai, Leane, that was her second-in-command, a man that could channel, and Min (another character, while not given as much page time in the series, does play a somewhat significant role). For those who enjoy reading about Perrin, he does not make an appearance in this book.I thought The Fires of Heaven moved along at a quicker pace than even the previous book. Nynaeve & Elayne encounter dangers from one of the female Forsaken, Moghedien, who is stalking them in the dream-world and the waking world at the same time. While Nynaeve & Elayne struggle to keep hidden from Moghedien and find the rebel Aes Sedai hiding from the White Tower and their new Amrylin, Elaida, Rand is facing just as many dangers and struggles trying to stay one step ahead of all the Forsaken trying to bring him down, in addition to chasing the Aiel clan that refused to follow him.What I liked about this book was how everything moved along faster, there always seemed to be something interesting or new occurring. Whether it was learning more about the World of Dreams, the new enemy of the Seanchan, the Forsaken, etc.I also liked how you get more insight and knowledge about the mysterious Forsaken, especially Amosdean and Moghedien. Up until this book (and a portion of the last book), there wasn't much information given about the Forsaken. All that was given was the Forsaken were the 13 most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends that turned their backs on the Light and swore new oaths to the Dark One. But in this book, you get snippets of the Forsaken and what they are planning.There was one big annoyance I had with this book, and that was with one particular character, Egwene. Her character personality wasn't so annoying in the previous books, but it seems that in this book she has gone beyond annoying for me to the point I wished I could put my hands through the pages and literally strangle her for her hypocritical and arrogant ways. Not to spoil, but knowing what is in store for this character, I can see why Jordan had decided to tweak her personality and have her change in this fashion as it becomes apparent later in the series when she becomes something more.It got very annoying to see Egwene sniff and glare at Rand for what she considered arrogant ways, or to give Nynaeve a thorough scolding for not listening to her about the dangers of the Dream World. Especially when Egwene herself was just as arrogant in her belief she was right and Rand wrong, and the fact she didn't take her own advice to Nynaeve about the dangers of the Dream World (when she was ordered by others, her teachers the Aiel Wise Ones, not to enter the Dream World without a teacher, as she was still learning about the Dream World). I couldn't help but notice those contradictions, and it drove me up the wall to read this character taking the high road while expecting others to listen to her like she was the voice of authority and they mere mortals who had no clue. In this regard, Egwene is becoming more and more Aes Sedai.The arrogance of *all* the women in the Wheel of Time world can get quite annoying too, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Egwene was thinking so much of herself. All the women surrounding Rand think they can guide him best, and only they know what's best for him in order to see him live to the Last Battle with the Dark One. Like I said, gets real irritating at times to read!In fact, it's interesting, all the main characters have gone through some personality changes that are noticeable. They have all experienced certain events that have shaped them and changed them in ways that *are* noticeable to the reader (if you have read from the very 1st book).Rand has become even more hard and cold, as it's the only way he knows how to do what he must do without guilt or remorse for what he is, Egwene more arrogant and lofty, Nynaeve has learned to reign in her famous temper and be more reasonable at times, Siuan & Leane having lost the ability to channel have been brought down a peg or two in Aes Sedai arrogance, Moiraine has been less overt in her prodding of Rand and even listens to him now.Actually, of all of the main characters, I would say Mat has probably changed the least in personality. He is still the gambler and rogue, who doesn't want to take on any responsibility, although he does become more than he was by the end of the book too.Anyways, if you can overlook the blatant sexism by the women characters, this book and the series is very good epic fantasy reading."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With The Shadow Rising, Robert Jordan moved The Wheel of Time series out of its 'adventure' arc into a 'political' phase as the characters finally moved into positions of high authority and influence amongst different nations and cultures, and could begin the process of uniting the world to face the Last Battle. Whilst adventure storylines would continue to appear, a lot more time from this point onwards would be spent on political maneuverings. Indeed, some storylines would unfold almost entirely within a character's office as they fired off letters, received intelligence, and debated strategy. That, at this stage anyway, Jordan is able to make this readable and compelling is a testament to his often-underrated storytelling skills.The fifth book in The Wheel of Time opens by picking up the storylines from the previous volume. Rand has convinced several of the Aiel clans to accept him as their chief-of-chiefs, and he makes preperations to lead them back into the Westlands. However, his task is complicated when the Shaido clan rejects him and launches a devastating invasion of the kingdom of Cairhien. Rand is forced to take his troops in pursuit before he can secure the loyalty of the remaining neutral clans, leaving his forces exposed to possible attack on two sides. Meanwhile, Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom and Juilin have extracted themselves from the civil war in Tarabon but now face the task of crossing the hostile nation of Amadicia, the stronghold of the Children of the Light and a country where channelling is outlawed. At the same time, a fanatic claiming to be the 'Prophet of the Dragon' is ravaging the kingdom to the north, Ghealdan. Back in Tar Valon, the Aes Sedai have splintered into opposing factions, with Elaida seizing control of the White Tower and a 'Tower-in-Exile' opposed to her rule establishing itself elsewhere, but the latter's stance towards Rand is unclear. Finally, the Forsaken are preparing a trap to neutralise Rand once and for all.There's certainly a lot going on in The Fires of Heaven and Jordan mostly handles these storylines with aplomb, switching between them to stop things getting stale and delivering a relentless pace to Rand, Mat and Egwene's story, which has them chasing the Shaido hundreds of miles and culminating in the biggest battle in the entire series (to date, anyway). However, the first few cracks in the series' structure are becoming apparent. Given the distances traversed by Rand in his story, Jordan had to find a way of slowing down Elayne and Nynaeve's trip across a much smaller area so events would converge as he needed them to. His solution was to whack them in a very slow-moving circus as it traverses Amadicia, which leads to the first chapters in the entire series so far which don't actually seem to advance plot or character, but merely keep things ticking over for some of the characters. With events proceeding pretty rapidly elsewhere, the cutting-away to Elayne learning to walk a tightrope or Nynaeve being followed around by the lovelorn circus-owner really kills the pace of the book, making it a sluggish read in places. Some readers may also bemoan the lack of any appearance by Perrin in this book. Whilst Jordan had downplayed some characters' appearances in previous novels (Rand in the third, most notably), this is the first time one of the major characters from the first book doesn't appear at all.Jordan makes up for these issues with the ferocious climax. At the end of the book Rand unleashes a blitzkrieg as a huge battle is fought with the Shaido and he has to face down two of the Forsaken in separate, desperate duels with the One Power. During these few chapters an enormous number of important events in the series take place, several important new characters are introduced and no less than five recurring characters are (apparently) killed off. This section of the book really repays careful rereads, as you can see how Jordan impressively set up events ahead of time. In fact, this may be the most dynamic part of the entire series to date and makes for great reading. However, be warned that a fairly big mystery is introduced at the end of Book 5 that has still not been conclusively answered more than 15 years later, although Brandon Sanderson has promised us a definitive answer in the final book of the series.The Fires of Heaven (****) is a solid installment of the series, with a sometimes leaden pace and a very tedious subplot (the circus) more than made up for by the highly impressive climax and the way Jordan deftly spins the series' course onto a new heading (although this also lays the seeds for some extremely dubious writing decisions in the books to come)."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I will try to keep this sort. The parts with Nyneave & Elayne are simply unbearable. I'm re-reading the series because I stopped at book 6 years ago because it trudged along to slow. Mainly because of the pointless constant bickering that goes on with Nyneave & Elayne. The parts with them take too long and there is no pay off for the \\"effort\\" it takes to read their stories. The characters take up too many pages and they are uninteresting. I don't care about them and judging by the reviews, not many others do.Reading about Nyneave & Elayne is like listening to two 16 year old girls arguing on a cell phone. It takes forever and goes nowhere. It's petty and pointless. You can read two chapters in a row of their mindless story and have no clue what you just read or why it was important.So I am now re-reading the series and I am skimming over their parts. I know this is literature sacrilege but so what? I enjoy the series much more now and so far I totally get the story, so I haven't missed a thing yet.If I do I will catch the synapses on wikipedia or something.So take my advice...ignore them. The rest of the story is great and so are the characters."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Alot of people dislike this book for reasons that mainly show up in the first half of the book. Nynaeve is particularly annoying throughout most of the book and her point of view seems to overwhelm the first half. Nynaeve's parts, being mostly dialogue and fighting with Elayne, made the first half pretty slow. Also, I have to complain about the fact that Perrin/The Two Rivers wasn't included whatsoever in this book. Since he has one of the most interesting story lines in the book I was a little dissapointed, but I'm sure there's a reason and it makes me more excited for book six.I forced myself through to the second half of the book, and everything turned around. It took me about two days to finish the last 500 or so pages and it was an obsessive read. I don't want to give anything away, but it really picks up when it gets back to Rand and Mat and I just ordered book six...dying until it gets here.It's really worth reading. Just push yourself past the first few hundred pages."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is pretty good, but in some parts it drags. It is highly annoying, however, do to the fact that all the woman are constantly mad over nothing, and men are constantly slammed to the wall if they say 'what a nice day' about how subborn and stupid and wool headed they are. Then the whole thing with Nyneave tugging on her braid, I would like to tug it out of her head. She is always mad at someone, for no reason at all, and the only charcter you still like is Perrin because he's the only one who isn't whiny and makes dumb choices. The action is really good, when there is action, though the book could have been shortened to about 300 pages. But the whole channeling thing is cool, and it has great potential, lets just hope he can hold on to the same quality as the first four in the future."},{"Title":"The Fires Of Heaven (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I consider The Fires of Heaven to be the beginning of the truly complex volumes in the series. So much of interest happens that it's nearly overwhelming: the Far Snows dance, accidental forming of the Band of the Red Hand, what happens to Birgitte, what Nynaeve does to Moghedien, Moiraine doing what she does at the end, Rand giving Rahvin what he deserves, what happens to Asomdean at the end, Galad and the Prophet, Gareth Bryne catching up and getting involved...That's just a taste, really, the highlights of the highlights; without giving anything away. In TFOH, RJ laid the foundation for a dozen subplots, all of which he would develope in the later books, and it's all we can do to keep track of what's going on.I have sometimes skiped the Elayne/Nynaeve thread whenever re-reading through the series, as I usually found it far less interseting than the other threads. This time, I made a determined effort to give that thread as much of my time as the others, and I'm pleased to conclude that there is much to reconnend it. Despite my feeling that Nynaeve's absurd reaction to Birgitte's fate was unnecessary and detrimental to her character's development, she gets a chance for redemption. When she does what she does to Uno, the Prophet, and Galad, that was probably one of RJ best-written scenes in the book, and it shows us that Nynaeve is capable of more than just losing her temper and pulling her braid.There are plenty of surprises in TFOH, and RJ rolls them out with the expectant glee of a proud father. It felt like he was reading over my shoulder, and every time I got to another plot twist, I could hear him say, \\"Didn't see that one coming, did you?\\" There was even RJ first big outdoor battle scene. When RJ talks about various maneuvers, I'm a bit lost. However, RJ does a smart thing-he flips between Rand and Mat's point of views, giving us the moments before or after battles. We don't actually get any scenes where he describes a conflict in detail, which is a decision I totally agree with.The only real complaint I have is that we see absolutely nothing of Perrin. Granted, there wasn't much to tell, but at least 1 scene of him and his new bride would have been nice. However, RJ soon makes up for it.PLOTTING: There were 2 main plot threads, and a handful of minor threads. As said before, RJ laid the foundation for a bunch of subplots. I liked how RJ brought the 2 main threads together at the end the way he did; it brought both to a satisfying conclusion.CHARACTERIZATION: Rand's character at this point is already so strongly established that RJ uses him as a way to flesh out other characters; his interactions with Aviendha, for example, tell us more about her than him. RJ sets up Moiraine's departure with a subtlety and class that makes readers miss her all the more, and Mat's attempts at leaving serve to illustrate both his unfortunate attraction to battle and his intense desire to avoid it completely. However, the most developed character in the book is probably Nynaeve, who grows into a real leader of men (while still needing to learn much about leading women).PACING: As always, the beginning was slow, but things picked up, especially once Rand and Aviendha had sex. As his plots grow more complex, it will become more difficult for RJ to keep an even pace, but no problem with that here.BEST SCENE: There are some who might think I would choose the Far Snows scene, Heh. For me, however, the best scene was Moiraine's very last meeting with Rand. After you've read the book once, when you get to that scene again, you know what's going to happen, and her calm acceptance of what will happen still stuns me with its power.MOST POV: Rand and Nynaeve split time fairly evenly, with Elayne, Mat, Egwene, and Siuan getting a few paragraphs here and there. I think from this book onward, RJ tries hard to keep the POVs even between the sexes, so that the women get as much time as the men do.OVERALL: Highly entertaining, especially in the second half, and full of surprises, TFOH builds on the positives of book 4. Another outstanding volume.Sorry for my rambling on, and making the review so long.

I just finished it, and book 5 was everything that I could have imagined and more. The only explanation I can think of is that it takes a more mature/experienced reader enjoy amount of detail that Jordan puts into every page. In the Fires of Heaven, Jordan unleashes the best tactical combat scenario of the series, and uses each character to their fullest with the exception of Perrin, which seems to be absent from this book. All in all, an extraordinary effort on Jordan's part.

If you're an avid fan, you want to know all the little things, so it's almost as if you're there.The way Mat was brought into the center of things more in this book was very good and provided a great profile of the &quot;new&quot; Mat.

However, I am growing a little tired of hearing phrases like&quot;The Light burn me!&quot;,and&quot;The Light take him for a fool&quot;. Also,I don't know if anybody else feels the same way, but I am getting sick of reading about the Whitecloaks! I hate those guys. Whose side are they on, anyway?

Note that the title is not really representative of the book, as &quot;Lost in Mongolia&quot; merely describes one aspect of the journey. Only the upper headwaters are in Mongolia, while the expedition down the Yenisey River mostly takes place in Siberia.Regardless, Angus and his mates had a perilous adventure through unforgiving landscapes with friendly people, surrounded by corrupt government officials and the depressing leftovers of Stalinism. The voyagers made some unbelievably stupid decisions along the way, like rafting the river at flood stage, which got them shipwrecked in a forest. Angus then went off on his own in a kayak in search of a lost camera bag, with no supplies and wearing nothing but a pair of pants. He presently got &quot;Lost in Mongolia&quot; for several days, and without the help of some friendly locals and a huge amount of luck, it's amazing that he lived to tell the tale. After the team reunited, more ineptitude ensued when they bought a small rowboat to traverse down the now large and tumultuous Yenisey, dealing with supertankers, dams, and disgustingly cramped living quarters.In Siberia, they met many interesting people who really make this book a great read, from mafia dons who offered huge amounts of assistance and supplies in return for a little intelligent conversation, to friendly and helpful villagers who gave from their hearts and asked nothing in return. The human side of this adventure is the most revealing, as Angus and the team would have surely been unable to complete the voyage without help from the people of Mongolia and Siberia, assuming that they would even get out alive. This book is both an exciting tale of a real seat-of-the-pants expedition, and an enjoyable showcase of interesting cultures and landscapes hidden behind the decayed Iron Curtain. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I received this book on Christmas day and, much to the dismay of the rellies, I finished it on the same day. As the miserable weather outside lashed at the windows and my Aunt Jennifer babbled about napkin handling etiquette, I was far removed to another world; a land of gushing rivers, Russian mafia, indigenous people, and non-stop action. &quot;Lost in Mongolia&quot; is a true modern-day adventure and Angus vividly details the trials and tribulations that he and his team encounter as they attempt to become the first to fully navigate the length of the world's fifth longest river. It is obvious that the quest to be &quot;first&quot; comes secondary to the team's desire to simply get out and explore the most remote regions of our planet from a unique perspective. Angus' strongest writing comes through as he describes the varied characters that they enounter the whole way down the river. For me, the most haunting moment came near the end where, at 71 degrees lattitude in the perpetual grey twilight of the tundra, they come across a scattering of human bones, remnants of Stalin's period of terror. And amongst the bones a small rotted leather shoe is found, obviously from a little girl. It is a mystery that leaves the reader feeling uncomfortable, juxtaposed near the team's triumphant ending at the Arctic Ocean.This adventure is definitely worth reading about. It is an insightful and difficult journey through one of the last regions on the planet untouched by tourism."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"As an explorer, Collin Angus has a deep respect for the natural wonders of earth. In \\"Lost in Mongolia,\\" he makes an attempt to give readers a sense of what it is to travel down a river at the mercy of nature and he provides an excellent description of how the river acts like a living being with a personality of its own. Through the discoveries readers make about the process of moving from source to mouth, as well as how the water affects surrounding life, he establishes for others the same appreciation that he has for the Yenisey River. The book also doubles as a documentary of the full length of the waterway that is as unique and surprising as the river itself.Collin has traveled the world on various expeditions since the age of nineteen and ever since has built up a thirst for exploration and adventure. He has rafted all of the world's major rivers including the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze, with more adrenaline and fervor each time. Soon, adventure became a regular part of his life and would often turn out to be a priority. The Yenisey was the only major river that had not been fully explored by then, and Collin had become set on changing that fact. Angus has written books on most of his trips, and each one reveals more about his double life as a normal human being and an adventurer.Though his writing does not use spectacular literary techniques to form a connection with the reader, the amazing detail with which he describes each activity and event of almost every day of his voyage is what captures readers. It successfully reels the reader in, slowly but surely and with increasing intensity, by starting with the everyday and at times, escalating to points of rare or special encounters and events. Though some of the curiosities are rather small and may seem unimportant in the grand scheme of things, by the time the reader reaches the middle of the book, all the little foreign wonders of the journey start to break through and impact the reader with a whole new sense of culture and living in a region unfamiliar to the West.\\"Lost in Mongolia\\" is a relatively simple read for any teen or adult. Through simple writing and connections that are easily made, yet with more than enough individuality and detail to seem as if the memory of the expedition is just as much the reader's as it is Collin's, the documentary successfully leaves the reader with some sort of newfound knowledge of the region. Whether it is appreciation, thrill, or cultural wisdom, it will strike readers on a powerful, personal level that is definitely capable of providing insight much later in life."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"Not knowing anything about Colin Angus and his past heroics, I picked up this book based on a personal interest in Mongolia and the paucity of travel literature on the region. About seventy pages in, I was utterly exasperated by the author's gloating about his impending accomplishment of being with the first documented group of travelers to run the fifth longest river in the world. There's one stretch where he makes no fewer than five comments over a five page span about how he'd be with the \\"first Westerners to lay eyes on the landscape.\\" In the opening pages, he shows exruciating attention to detail that is irrelevant to the larger story. What's more, he makes a point of documenting instances where he makes his friends laugh, and points out a friend's failed attempt at making him laugh.And then... his raft flips over, he loses track of his friends for a couple weeks, and as he slips out of self-absorption we actually see a remarkably humanistic portrayal of people in Mongolia and Siberia. There are some really colorful scenes... for example, playing charades and drawing pictures with rural Mongolians to explain his plight when he is lost; hearing about a doctor prescribing vodka for a leg wound; putting up with a babbling stranger who watches them repair a boat and warning them that they would never succeed. Ultimately, this is a heartwarming story, showing remarkable hospitality- warm meals and warm receptions in a cold climate. At one point a Russian sailor stalks him in his cabin as he is trying to write: \\"Write later. Drink now!\\" he insists. Angus embraces this hospitality, and as a result the strangers he encounters come to life in the book.The river journey itself is thrilling- at times the only way I could assure myself that the travelers would survive was the fact that I was holding a finished book in my hands. And it's clear from the reactions the group receives from the locals that their journey is a remarkable feat, and the travelers are goal-driven achievers.This is actually a very well-written book, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. You just have to be patient at the start, and the story may win you over just as they were won over by the east Asian hospitality- and the river itself."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I read Colin's first book, Amazon Extreme, and felt compelled to read up on his follow-up adventure. Although I was interested to learn about Siberia and Mongolia, I felt there was no way that Lost in Mongolia would be as exciting as Amazon Extreme. Well I was wrong! Although they weren't shot at by guerrillas or lost in a desert this time around, a whole set of new, and even more intriguing, setbacks plague this intrepid team. Colin is separated from his colleagues for 12 days with nothing more than a pair of pants and a kayak - no food, no money, no shoes, and not even a blanket to keep him warm through the sub-zero nights. This is probably the most interesting part of the book. In the lower Yenisey, the adventurers are almost hit by large ships in the fog and are bombarded by freezing Arctic storms. This was one hell of an adventure!The thing that impresses me most about Colin's expeditions is that they are fueled by hardly anything more than the sheer determination of following a dream. Coming from a working-class background, Colin never allowed finances to get in the way of his ambitions. As is chronicled in Amazon Extreme his adventure in South America was completely self-financed - money earned from his firewood business. I'm glad to see in Lost in Mongolia that the team was finally able to get some assistance from sponsors.I would definitely recommend this book for people looking for an adventure read different than the usual run of the mill. The writing isn't quite the style of Thubron, but the story will keep you hooked from beginning to end"},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"The best way to summarize the way I felt after reading this book is jealous! The concept seemed so simple: to voyage the complete length of the world's fifth longest river, yet it is unbelievable that in the 21st century no one had done it before them. I thought all the firsts had been done! This book isn't just about rapids, waterfalls, and man against the elements, it is also very insightful and Angus does a wonderful job of portraying the varied characters that the team encounters in remotest Mongolia and Siberia. This book is a Bryson meets Hyerdhal: it is humorous, interesting and very exciting. Definite thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I love river stories and this a great story and funny at the same time. It made me feel like I needed another adventure."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I don't regret reading this book, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to very many others. If you really, really want to read about areas of Mongolia and Russia that most of us will never see, then read the book. If you are just looking for a new travel adventure book, keep searching so you can find a better one.The book is about Colin Angus and his trip from one end of the Yenisey River to its end at the Arctic Ocean. Colin made the trip with 3 other men from May to September of 2001.One problem I have with the book is that it is not very well written. It seems to me like this guy needed a better editor. Many times, I had to turn back to figure out exactly where the travelers were and where they were headed on the river. Essentially, some aspects of the narrative were confusing and could have been written better. The book is written in a journal entry style, and some entries were seemingly made just to mark the passing of time.Another difficulty I have with this book is its basic claim that the author and his co-travels were the very first to travel the length of the river. This is a bold claim to make, and I can't agree that it's true just because others haven't written about their experience traveling the river's length. This bold claim and the very clearly Western attitudes of Colin and his co-travelers left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.I am giving it 3 stars here because I can't give it 2.5, which is how I feel about it: I am not sorry I read it, but I did not think it was very good either."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"Angus' straightforward and readable tale of daring adventure and relentless stamina is a refreshing insight into one of the least documented regions of earth.Although not as well written as the version penned by his expedition team-mate Ben Kozel, &quot;Five Months in a Leaky Boat&quot;, it is nonetheless a most enjoyable read and highly recommended to anyone with a spirit of adventure.I suggest readers ignore Bozeman's review of this book on this page, as it looks suspiciously like a bad case of sour grapes from someone who didn't have the skills and perseverence to get his own dream expedition up and running."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I received this book on Christmas day and, much to the dismay of the rellies, I finished it on the same day. As the miserable weather outside lashed at the windows and my Aunt Jennifer babbled about napkin handling etiquette, I was far removed to another world; a land of gushing rivers, Russian mafia, indigenous people, and non-stop action. &quot;Lost in Mongolia&quot; is a true modern-day adventure and Angus vividly details the trials and tribulations that he and his team encounter as they attempt to become the first to fully navigate the length of the world's fifth longest river. It is obvious that the quest to be &quot;first&quot; comes secondary to the team's desire to simply get out and explore the most remote regions of our planet from a unique perspective. Angus' strongest writing comes through as he describes the varied characters that they enounter the whole way down the river. For me, the most haunting moment came near the end where, at 71 degrees lattitude in the perpetual grey twilight of the tundra, they come across a scattering of human bones, remnants of Stalin's period of terror. And amongst the bones a small rotted leather shoe is found, obviously from a little girl. It is a mystery that leaves the reader feeling uncomfortable, juxtaposed near the team's triumphant ending at the Arctic Ocean.This adventure is definitely worth reading about. It is an insightful and difficult journey through one of the few-remaining regions on the planet untouched by tourism. And lastly, although it's not clear by the cover, these extraordinarily tough guys are Canadian. Good on ya Canucks!"},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I bought this book for my brother's Christmas present. Having some spare time on my hands, I thought I'd read a few pages... Three days later I finished the book and loved it. I haven't read any other adventure books so I have nothing similar to compare it to, but it sure kept me hooked. Colin turns a journey of chaos and uncertainty into silky prose that will satisfy the non-adventurers. It's an entertaining way to learn about Mongolia and Siberia."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I never thought I'd come across another book as good as Don Starkell's &quot;Paddle to the Amazon&quot;. Well this is it! This is a story about true adventure, exploration, interaction with extremely remote cultures and a beautiful portral of a seldom-visited region. The journey starts in North-Eastern Mongolia and it takes five months for these intrepid explorers to travel right through Siberia to the Arctic Ocean. One of the most gripping parts of the book is when Angus is separated from the group for 12 days with nothing but a pair of pants. Through this period he is forced to live off the land until he meets up with his companions 500 km downstream. With nights dropping below zero and without a shirt, shoes, tent or sleeping bag, things start to get quite interesting for Angus. Definitely recommended if you like reading about adventure."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"This book, and the film that Banff Film Festival actually accepted (much to their discredit) are the result of the absolute worst pretensions of idle first-world youth cooking up an &quot;adventure&quot; so they can capitalize on the instant fame attendant with convincing some publisher and several gear companies to front the money for an exercise in hubris.Think of &quot;Huckelberry Finn&quot; acted out by a bunch of spoiled frat boys and you come close to the ethos of this story.The protagonists portray their own ineptitude in planning and sheer good luck at not drowning as some sort of virtue. Had they done any kind of research they would have realized that at least through Mongolia, their route was very well worn. The only thing that made their float on the Selenge (upper Yenisey) interesting was that they were stupid enough to try to float it at flood stage. Even the most novice boater knows that is an purely unforgivable thing to do, particularly when a cursory glance at a map would have shown the braiding of the river which resulted in their near-death experience wrapped in the willows.These guys, and their supporting gear companies (who would sponosor a cannibal feast if it meant product placement), are exactly the reason why term &quot;adventure&quot; is a hackneyed joke. This entire enterprise confirms the notion that 'truth is for losers'. Why bother with the facts when some glib editing and even more glib writing can transform the three stooges into modern day &quot;explorers&quot;.Don't buy this book. If you value integrity, if you are sick of the commercialization of &quot;adventure&quot; as something to slot into the Thursday TV lineup, please, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Lost in Mongolia: Rafting the World's Last Unchallenged River","review":"I am very concerned that a review of the book \\"Lost in Mongolia\\" by my son, Colin Angus, appears under my name in one of a series of reader reviews on your web-site.

The problem is that the authors' biases and agreements with some of the anti-Black ideas of colonization and deporation are all too clear. Near the end of the book, the authors rant against John F. Kennedy's support for civil rights deomstrations (i.e., JFK's speech on June 11, 1963 on the subject) and the \\"forced\\" integration of \\"ignorant and unqualified Negroes\\" in colleges and neighborhoods.Since this book was written in 1970, the authors could not have forseen the likes of Condoleeza Rice, Oprah Winfrey, Gen. Colin Powell, et. al. (although they damn with faint praise Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier in their critique of the \\"overrepresentaion of Negroes as saintly beings on television\\"). Additionaly, nothing good is said about the performance of Black politicians during reconstruction (forgetting that these guys started the public school systems in the South and some proved to be able statesmen and orators like Robert Smalls).These kinds of outdated biases really hurts this book, Read with a careful eye."},{"Title":"Distressed Debt Trading: Understanding International and Domestic Secondary Markets","review":"The issue of distressed debt resolution is a key issue in the world of finance and economic development - and one which this book in large measure clarifies.

Being that I am a doctor in training and am contemplating the continuation of my education in neuroscience, I have found this book to be quite well worth reading...and the fact that I have just begun to learn about medicine, and am not familiar with all terminology and explaination, makes this book great for even the general public/anyone simply interested in the subject.

It won't be that close. He enters a new town where bad guy is trying to take over everything. One man against 50? You've got to be kidding!

When Marshal Jim Majors arrived in town, he found himself amidst enough gunfighters to start his own war, and he knew one wrong move would cause the whole thing to erupt into an all out battle to the finish. But Majors had taken on the job to \\"tame\\" Reservation and he would do it, come hell or high water--the trouble was how to do it. His badge made him a target. Add to that complication a woman, a strong woman, and Jim Majors had even more trouble to deal with. Sundown Jim is a solid novel packed with characters with strengths and weaknesses you will recognize in people you know; and that's what makes it an Ernest Haycox novel. His characters are never cookie cutter types, but people you can identify with and understand why they do some of the things they do. Maybe the overwhelming odds seem outlandish and a bit too incredible to be overcome, but when all is said and done, the solution and resolution to getting the job done is plausible and realistic. Get this one and enjoy a treat by one of the greatest of western novelists."},{"Title":"Dance On The Wind (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Brandy barely remembered the time she was little and her mother had left her at the door of the parsonage with only her trunk.

The first suprise came with Brinkley's account of Christmas Eve. Not only was there no trip to Cambodia, but the entire day was fully accounted for by a \\"special breakfast\\", the beginning of the Christmas cease-fire, a mortar attack and fire-fight, a Christmas greeting to his commander, and then, back at base, letters home. This seems a little too much for Kerry to have \\"forgotten\\" and then to have \\"remembered\\" as a trip to Cambodia. Another suprise was that any mention of Kerry's trip (trips?) to meet with the North Vietnamese in Paris while a peace activist was omitted. But overall I found the book fairly well written and more interesting then I had expected, except for the strong political bias to be found in any campaign book. One major shortcoming: After finishing the book I found that not even a hint of Kerry's character had shown through. Throughout the book he was just a dark silhouette.

How true, how true, and how applicable to the choice the American electorate will soon have. As noted historian Douglas Brinkley so vividly shows in \\"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War\\", Senator Kerry is a courageous man, both physically and morally. He went from being-literally-waist deep in the Big Muddy to rescue a wounded comrade under fire to coming home and assuming a leadership role in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War because he knew the war was wrong and must be stopped. He had been wounded three times. Ponder that for a minute. Three separate times he had been hit by enemy fire. Three Purple Hearts. Three more Purple Hearts than are possessed by the entire student deferred, 4F, national guard weekenders in the Bush administration. Siver Star. Bronze Star. These medals are not given away lightly; they aren't just pieces of tin hanging from a brightly colored ribbon. They represent personal valor and are earned with blood.Mr. Brinkley details how this bloodied warrior had the moral courage to speak out against an immoral war (and to later join his friend Senator John McCain in leading the fight to normalize relations with Vietnam, their old foe) and incurred the wrath of the Nixon administration; they went after him and branded this legitimate hero a fraud. This was always done from the shadows, a hallmark of our most corrupt president. No doubt history will repeat itself during the 2004 presidential campaign as Karl Rove and his henchmen try to make their man's flimsy service record appear better than it is. Fat chance, since there is no there there. John Kerry is a hero many time over; our war president is not.So back to \\"Braveheart\\". Recall that William Wallace was a battered, muddy fighter who inspired immense loyalty from his men because he was out there on the battlefield with them, leading them, sword in hand. The lords they fought for were above the fray, never dirty, never bloodied, but my they sure looked pretty sitting on their fancy steeds high on a hill wearing their fancy armor and clutching their fancy, pristine weapons, just like a certain war president who rented a fancy flight suit and bounded out of a fancy fighter jet onto deck of a fancy aircraft carrier. He looked very pretty, too.\\"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War\\" is well-documented and well written.

I mean sure, he wasn't the best soldier our country has ever seen, but just compare him to Bush and it makes him look extremely good. Bush can hardly form a sentence (at his age) and Kerry was performing great anti war speeches at a much younger age. As for one of his purple hearts being earned by a self inflicted injury, thats just preposterous, that is not how it works and I think people know that but choose to to believe it. Bottom line is Kerry wouldn't have been the greatest president we have ever seen, but it would have been nice to see someone holding office that actually had served in a war. He might actually have thought twice about sending kids to die. The swift boat vets for \\"truth\\" were only one side of the story, and even if some of the things they said were true, obviously the people the Brinkley interviewed with would know better than most of the \\"truth vets\\" as they had actually served WITH Kerry, which is different than serving in the same general area."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I get the distinct impression that some of the so-called &quot;reviewers&quot; who trash this book here have never read it. If they had, they would know that Kerry exercised NO editorial control over the content of the book.Brinkley offers a well-written and researched biography of John Kerry. He is uncritical overall, but doesn't hesitate to include unflattering comments by people who just didn't like Kerry for one reason or another.Besides being a top notch biography, this book provides a fascinating history of the (until now) relatively overlooked brown water navy."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"When I started to read Tour of Duty in January 2004, I knew very little about John Kerry. My knowledge of him was limited to bits and pieces of news picked up over the years. Since he had voted for the most recent war in Iraq, I had been a Dean supporter. As I read the book I came to feel as though I knew the man John Kerry. I could place my own life along side his remembering how the Vietnam war tore America apart. Kerry's own words in 35 year old letters provide insight into the heart and soul of a truely honest and admirable man. The book sheds light on his own personal struggle with doing what he believes to be right while fighting a war he knew to be wrong. It chronicles not only the war he experienced but also his/our fight to end that war. Like his fellow crewmates, who campaign by his side today, I would trust him with my life. John Kerry is the most knowledgeable, experienced, aware, hard fighting, honest and sincere presidental candidate I have ever known. If you have any doubts about how this man would operate under pressure, then read this book. He has my vote!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Though the subtitle of this book is &quot;John Kerry and the Vietnam War,&quot; it is much more than that. Brinkley's main purpose is to chronicle Kerry's early years, covering his life up to his failed race for a House seat in 1972. Brinkley is obviously a fan of Kerry's, though after reading this book it's easy to see why; the portrait he paints of the young man earnestly leading his men into battle on the rivers of South Vietnam is certainly more appealing than the aloof presidential candidate currently being depicted by the media. Readers seeking to learn more about the Democratic nominee and potential president will find much to ponder here.This book is also worth reading for another reason, though - its account of the &quot;brown water navy&quot;, the riverine craft deployed on the rivers of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Brinkley uses the material Kerry carefully preserved during his service in Vietnam (which includes diaries, letters to his family back home, and audiotape recordings) as a lens through which to examine the broader war that he was a part of. While Kerry's materials are the foundation of this examination, Brinkley also utilizes interviews with other Swift boat operators and other histories of the conflict to provide what is likely to be the most detailed examination of riverine operations during the war ever published. This gives the book an enduring value, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book makes for a great promotional piece and that is about all. For the true story, the whole story on John Kerry's \\"Tour of Duty\\" check out Unfit for Duty coming out next week. A book written by people who really knew the REAL John Kerry-The RAW Deal."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"What kind of reporter is Brinkley that he didn't check all the facts before writing this book? Kerry himself admits now that he wasn't in Cambodia that Christmas,1968. I really have a problem with many things that John Kerry did ,especially after coming home from Viet Nam. Of all the Marines and soldiers that I personally knew who went to Viet Nam,some to die, I don't recall anyone coming home so fast as John Kerry. Doesn't Mr. Brinkley have a problem with the anti-military stance that Kerry took at the Congressional hearing? Kerry was not just anti-war,that is forgivable, but anti-military is another story. Mr. Brinkley should have covered more of Kerry's inconsistencies. That would have made a better book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Tour of Duty is well written and entertaining. It does a good job of giving one a sense of Kerry's childhood and a reasonably good account of his actions in Vietnam. The post-Vietnam details are a bit thinner though. Also missing is any analysis or comparision of Kerry's actions with any facts. Thus one is left with a very one-sided view of John Kerry but an interesting view nonetheless. The book is worth reading for some general background but a more authoritative biography will probably have to wait until after (and if) he gets elected."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"If you want to read a true and fascinating story of a real hero--both during and after the War--this book is for you. If you want to rant mindlessly against Kerry, like a lot of wackos who reviewed this book have done here, then skip it. Perhaps they'd prefer to be led by an overprivileged bozo who slid into the Champagne Corps of the National Guard--the unit where all the rich boys hid out--and then went AWOL even from that, to work on a pro-war Senate candidate's campaign.As for me, I'll stick with the real heroes."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"On D-Day, 6 June 1944, American soldiers were accidentally drowned in the English Channel because their inflatable life preservers were worn incorrectly. Nearly a quarter century later, during a helicopter evacuation on a hill near Khe Sanh, 8 April 1968, U.S. combatant Max Cleland picked up a grenade - thinking it was his own with the pin intact. The twenty-five-year-old Army captain had his right arm and both legs blown off. Decades after the war in Vietnam, Republican columnist Ann Coulter criticized triple-amputee Cleland for \\"allowing Democrats to portray him as a war hero,\\" because his injuries were a result of an accident rather than enemy fire.Growing up in the 1950s, it was not uncommon for children to be asked, \\"What did your daddy do during WWII?\\" Ike became President and most Americans took pride in their contribution to that war effort. Today's youth have a curiosity about the war in Southeast Asia, but veterans and citizens on either side of the peace issue seem understandably reluctant when talking about it. Children of veterans who want to learn more about war and politics in the late 1960s and 1970s should read Tour of Duty by Douglas Brinkley. Although a sad chapter in American history, the politics of the war in Vietnam is described through the eyes of one combat sailor who was there. Historian Brinkley claims that John Kerry \\"exerted no editorial control on the manuscript.\\"The politics of war is not unique to the Vietnam era. On Normandy D-Day, a glorious day for the Allies and FDR's administration, and a day of gratitude and thanksgiving throughout our nation, politicking continued in Washington, D.C. With the November 1944 election approaching, in an attempt to embarrass President Roosevelt, the House of Representatives directed the Secretary of War and the Navy to begin court-martial proceedings against Admiral Husband E. Kimmell and General Walter C. Short for negligence over the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack.The naval service of Lieutenant Kerry and sacrifice of Captain Cleland should not be trivialized for political gain. As the son of a D-Day naval officer and grateful citizen of this nation, I honor and salute the sacrifice of all Vietnam combat veterans, both Republicans and Democrats on either side of the peace issue. One of every ten Americans who served in Vietnam became casualties with amputations and crippling wounds 300% higher than in WWII. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude and special care for the 75,000 Vietnam veterans who are severely disabled. This book is not about pity for Max Cleland, for he courageously plays the hand he was dealt in Vietnam. Tour of Duty gets five stars because the book is an exceptionally well written biography of Senator John F. Kerry, Captain Max Cleland's friend and hero."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Whether you like John Kerry or not he is a genuine war hero and a man of profound courage and all the petty reviews here most likely done by Republicans can't change that reality. Face facts.I am an Edwards supporter but I can't deny that John Kerry is a good man with an honorable record of public service. He should be proud.This book is an honest assessment of his Vietnam experienes which are told warts and all. What comes through is a brutal honesty that is rare in politics these days. And a good overview of a dark period in our U.S. history. However, this book should be read to understand Kerry's greatness and to learn lessons from this ugly war.The Bush/Cheney war record is nonexistent. So far, the sketchy evidence of the Bush war record is that he was proven to have shopped at the base company store a few times and that he had his hair cut on the base on occasion (kidding). Truthfully, Bush's guard experience is difficult to assess and shaky to measure. This is not the case with Kerry. He actually fought in a war and was wounded.Read the book and learn what a great man John Kerry is."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Any historian who is attempting to write history is obliged to be as objective and professional as possible. Further, history must be based upon the historians thoughts not upon his or her feelings. He or she is obliged to present all the evidence, and to address any significant contradictory data to his or her interpretation. He or she is also obliged to acknowledge and respond to contrary interpretations. If he or she does not do this, he or she is not writing history but is writing a political tract or something even less centered upon the historical truth (like out and out propaganda).Brinkley fails to meet this standard period, and consequently, Tour of Duty is NOT a \\"piece\\" of history. The fact that is an election year actually only made it more incumbent upon him to have admitted his limitations and prejudices which should have been followed by an even more determined effort at objectivity because, after all, he is supposedly writing for the historical record (not of course to get Kerry elected). If Brinkley has political views that inhibited a balanced account, he simply should not have published this book as a work of history. We must never forget that tyrants (Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot, Saddam, you name it)ALWAYS attempt to have history rewritten to make it more flattering or to comform to their own selfish interests, and even in inclusive societies such as ours, there are those who surrender to this temptation, a point Tour of Duty only makes too well!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"There can be no question that this work is politically motivated. How else does one explain its convenient release during primary season? The author, who (surprise surprise)is a \\"liberal\\" historian and academic, had to know that Kerry was planning a run before beginning his research at least a year or more ago. This fact together with the entire tone of the work illustrate that, yes Virginia, it is a campaign book. Missing in action is the probable role that Kerry's privileged position as a friend of the Kennedy Klan played in his \\"war service\\" and\\"decorations\\" (PT-109 indeed). Also largely absent is a honest assessment of his subsequent efforts to undermind his country while it was at war (opposing a position was one thing during Viet Nam, actively supporting your country's enemies was something else entirely).What emerges here if one actually knows something about Kerry's life and career before starting, is a fairly masterful piece of propaganda, which is why I give it two stars. But let's remember that lots of men (including U.S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, and Adolf Hitler) have been more geniunely war heroes than John Kerry, and most certainly would not or did not made good presidents. This is especially true for a man, like Kerry, who has done everthing inside and outside of office he can to undercut his country's defense. The good news is that if you want to see the President defeated for re-election, you will find enough illusion here to assuage your conscious in voting for a shallow opportunist like Kerry. But don't fool yourself that this book has anything to do with historical truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Okay, please allow me to point a few things things out: it is not only hypocritical but dishonest (and typical of the studied irrationality of the left) for those who have supported Bill Clinton (like almost all those who now applaud Kerry and this book), a man who ran away from any military service during Viet Nam, who participated in demonstrations against his country overseas, who is a personal physical coward, and who is on the record as &quot;hating the military&quot;, to now turn around and try somehow to imply that service in the Texas National Guard (whether that included a stint in Alabama or not, who really cares?) by our President was somehow dishonorable. They also conveniently ignore that fact that he is now among the most successful war time commanders-in-chief in our history, certainly far more successful than the last Democrat to find himself in that position, Lyndon Johnson.Nor is it especially impressive that they feel empowered to attack the President because he and his family have been successful financially, especially as their &quot;hero&quot; John Kerry has never had a real job in his life and has only become hugely weathly by leaching off of lonely rich women. If you study Tour of Duty closely, it is clear that John Kerry is just another Massachusett's rich guy and opportunist, who enjoyed a privileged military service during which he gave himself purple hearts, and had his rich connections arrange for a higher decoration for a minimal accomplishment. Equally clear is that his life and world view has had nothing to do with those of the &quot;people&quot; he pretends to want to lead, a fact only underscored by his propensity to change his position with every variation of the political winds.No amount of verbage, even that by a skilled writer like Brinkley, or vituperation by those who write here, is going to change the truth. Hopefully after November we can look forward to John Kerry at last achieving something geniunely substantial by his assumption of the mantle of that other Massachusetts champion, Michael Dukakis."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book was both exciting and educational, Kerry has some brilliant ideas, and the backgroud of service to back them up. An inspiration for anyone who loves America."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This is my second review, and it is inspired by the startling naivet&eacute; demonstrated by the reviewer who insists that since Brinkley is a professional historian he could not, therefore, be politically motivated in his composition of this \\"biography\\" of John Kerry. I, too, am a professional historian, and while I cannot claim that my books match the popularity of Brinkley's, I have a professional understanding of the process of writing works in history. The reality is this: John Kerry as just a senator is not a subject of sufficient stature to merit such an explication of his life. Aside from his recent presidential efforts, he is but one of hundreds of men and women alive and dead who have served or who are serving in the Senate. He has no major legislation associated with his name; he has not been a real leader of the Democratic side of the upper chamber; and he was, until recently, not even much of a household name outside of Massachusetts. Historians choose their subjects with great care not only because good historical works require tremendous time, concentration, and luck in researching but also because publishers demand that they be at least reasonably marketable. Someone of Brinkley's status certainly would not bother to begin the arduous task of researching a biography of say Senator Mikulski of Maryland without the certain knowledge that such a work would be a greater public interest in the future - occasioned by, say, a run for the presidency. It is simply not reasonable to believe, therefore, that Brinkley did not know Kerry was going to make a presidential run in '04, and wrote Tour of Duty accordingly; it is even possible that he was approached directly or indirectly by Kerry's people or those of his mentor Ted Kennedy to write the work because that, children, is often how life works.Further, let us have a reality check about academia and historians. It is a rare scholar indeed who is employed as a professional historian either within or without universities and colleges who is not at least a strong liberal or socialists (at one major Big Ten school, the chair of the history department at one time was an open and passionate communist, who was saddened by the fall of the Soviet Union). This is not my opinion, it is objective fact well known within the profession. Scholars who do not conform can be and are denied tenure and promotion. Therefore, it is not only possible, but also probable that Brinkley is indeed a \\"knee-jerk\\" liberal, and certainly the content Tour of Duty only buttresses this contention. It is, I repeat, a rather skillful campaign book designed to attract votes for John Kerry. It is neither history nor historical biography, but is instead, like Kerry's public image, a clever manipulation of the truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I enjoyed this book. John Kerry seems to get more interesting the more you look into him. The portrait given is a moralist, a thinker, who struggled with the great questions of his age. I hope more people will read about Kerry's life, not just judge him by the sound bites and attack ads. Brinkley does a good job of humanizing the man behind the political persona."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"If as an undecided voter one takes one's responsibility AS a voter seriously, and if one can see past the jingoistic flag waving and fact-free, supremely childish and shameful attacks on this man's service record, this book is well worth the read. At the very least you're left with a man who isn't afraid to face combat but clearly understands that a)it should only happen when all other options have been exhausted, and b)when it happens the US government has a solemn responsibility to its troops. I'm convinced that Kerry won't ever send US troops into harm's way so poorly equipped that they have to have their parents send them flak jackets. (Think I'm making that up? Do your research.) This book is admittedly not a fully balanced critique of the man, a senator flawed just like the rest of us. It has a point of view, like all books, but presumably someone with a mind can come to their own conclusions and this book is simply a tool to assist us in making a very important decision. To regard this man as a traitor, especially after one reads the book, is simply infantile beyond measure and intellectually lazy. The guy's carrying shrapnel around in his body, he saved a man's life, he beached his craft and went after the enemy on his own, he got shot after VOLUNTEERING FOR COMBAT DUTY, in a war that he easily could have avoided. I guess that just doesn't add up to an unelected president who protected the skies over Houston, but only when he felt like it. If you're a fair minded person, read the book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"After I bought this book and started reading it, I discovered that the author, Douglas Brinkley is doing a rewrite because some of the information provided by Senator Kerry has turned out to be false and misleading. And as I understand it, the changes are still coming. Perhaps Mr. Brinkley should have done himself a favor, and written this book in pencil. It's a lot easier to clean up the errors that way. Are they going to issue free addendums of the new rewrites, or am I going to have to buy a whole new book to get the newest version of Kerry's story?"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book is nothing but lies and propaganda.

John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and said \\"I'm John Kerry reporting for duty.\\" 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune. More like \\"I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment.\\" OR \\"I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home.\\"As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Tour of Duty was just another example of the ineptitude of the Kerry people and how they underestimated the survivors, the real heroes of Vietnam. Perhaps Kerry, Brinkley and company thought that these brave heroes would forget or would not come forward or were dead.Perhaps Kerry and his minions thought that nobody would check and let Kerry get away with his flagrant lies about heroism. NOT ON OUR WATCH!The title of t his book is also just another example of how Kerry tries to align himself with hollywood. In this case, taking a title that was a popular tv show. Sorry, but the actors in that tv show were better. The only comparison is that in both cases, it is all ficion. In the case of this book, the fiction part has been taken to an extreme.Nice try, but this pr campaign to try to land Kerry a seat in the oval office didn't work.

Brinkley was USED in writing this book but only because he allowed himself to be used. He has revised its anecdotes since publication, in order to assist Kerry, only to find both his original tales AND his revisions contradicted by Kerry, through Kerry's \\"people\\". The result is that it is dangerous to cite this book or rely on it for quotes. It is insanity for Kerry to build his candidacy around his service in southeast Asia.

I found this book thought provoking and very well written. This was the first book I read by Brinkley and I look forward to reading more of Brinkley's works.I am stunned by the partinsin comments in the other reviews here. It's not that I'm shocked people have opinions but that their voices are filled with venom."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I find it really interesting that Kerry's political enemies find it necessary to write a review of this book on Kerry and they did not even read it. They also invent supposed letters from people who served with him during the war to attack him. Now they are attacking a historian who has published around forty books. Half of them have been reviewed by readers. All but two have scored at least 4 stars, usually 4.5 stars. Why do they do this? Are they afraid that Bush can't beat Kerry on the issues or his record? Why can't they write opposing views on this positions using facts or against his previous votes? But, don't distort those votes. Remember when Dick Cheney was Defense Secretary he started cutting funding for the military and for the current weapons that helped us in Afghanistan. Check out the congressional record for the proof. Why can't we have a civilized political discussion instead of attacks of personal destruction?

Pick up John Plaster's book -- &quot;SOG&quot; or Hal Moore's book, &quot;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot; then expound on how heroic John &quot;Kahn&quot; Kerry was in his 4 month tour of Vietnam in comparison to the real men who fought, received Medals of Honor, were wounded and were killed in the Vietnam war from which John &quot;Kahn&quot; Kerry deros'ed home early, to accuse of disgusting and untrue acts, to further his own narcissistic ambitions.Brinkley's book to me was a waste of time, although the truth of Kerry's egotism, arrogance and unscrupulous ambition is there for all but the blind to see.Kerry ranks even lower in the eyes of millions of we Canadians than all of the deserters and draft dodgers who found refuge from serving their country in Trudeau's socialist Canada and that's about as low on the scale of cowardice as one could be. This may come as a revelation to you but there were upwards of 20,000 to 40,000 (never an accurate statistic) Canadians who crossed the border to join the forces and fought in Vietnam.

It is an excellent book. How dare anyone bring anything else into a review of the book. (Somethings Fishy). This book is about war and not the 2004 presidential election."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Brinkley often refers to Kerry's service on board Navy ships cruising in the Eastern Pacific, showing that he is directionally challenged, and also demonstrating that he had no experienced navy people read the manuscript before publication.All sailors and naval officers know the word \\"Westpac\\" as being that ocean area close to Asia and its many exotic ports. If Kerry was gaining his naval experience cruising the Eastern Pacific, he was very close to his San Diego apartment, far, far from Nam. An inexcusable error showing sloppiness on the part of the author.Then there is PCF-94's mission 91 0n Feb 28,1969, when Kerry abandoned his Swift boat, M-16 in hand, to chase down an enemy combatant in the forest, a clear violation of the rules of engagement. \\"We had been taught at Coronado (in training) that we weren't supposed to become jungle fighters,\\" his crewman, Sandusky, said. (Page291)In so acting, Kerry left his craft unattended, hazarding boat and crew. Lucky for him, his superiors did not decide to court-martial him. His audacious, albeit improper, conduct got him a silver star instead.The Silver Star is normally given for \\"Gallentry in Action\\" and is the nations third highest award for Valor, but it is sometimes given for political purposes. Look up the Silver Star given to LBJ in WWII to see what I mean."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"The book reads very well, but the analysis is pure political puff. As a Vietnam Vet, I can tell you that atrocities were few and far between. Brinkley ignored most of the Swift Boat charges against Kerry. He presented most of the Winter Soldier \\"Investigation\\" as fact when much of it has been discredited.It is interesting to read this book in conjunction with Unfit for Command. You get a totally different interpretation of what went on. And it appears to me the numerous officers who contributed to Unfit for Command have it right.One of the interesting things is that Brinkley never even bothered to delve into Kerry's admission on the Cavette and Russert shows that he committed war crimes, including the burning of civilian homes. Hard to believe he did not ask that question. A glaring ommission."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book makes for very worthwhile reading in light of the current controversy generated by the anti-Kerry SBVT campaign currently being waged (and seemingly unraveling as the credibility of the funding and some of the witnesses is being called into question.) The book provides descriptive accounts of the incidents that led to Kerry's military honors, as well as the official reasons given for the medals, as signed for by the commanding officers responsible. This seems conclusive enough as far as I'm concerned. But the strength of the book is in the way it portrays the murkiness of war, the concessions made by those responsible for managing it, and the effect it had on John Kerry, who comes across as a reflective, insightful citizen, determined to get involved in shaping society and applying the lessons learned from his wartime experience. There are extensive quotes from his journals that give ample evidence of his ability to see the big picture (I could never imagine G.W. Bush articulating his thoughts and impressions so effectively) and numerous interviews with men who fought and served side by side with him in Vietnam and elsewhere. This book helps me understand what drives John Kerry and what he and others in his generation went through during the entire span of the Vietnam war era.

Plus, the people of Nicaragua would still be captives of communist dictatorship...(Just as the people of South VietNam have had to suffer under Communism, mostly due to a devided America as a result of all the anti-war protests here at home!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maybe ypou just dont want to believe the above...so, lets proceed with thee FACTS (you can research for yourself!).====================================================== Tragically, kerry succeeded brilliantly in one of his signature campaigns, helping to condemn the people of South Vietnam to the horrors of life under a communist dictatorship...which today still honors kerry as one of 'THEIR' war heroes! As he preens himself in the glow of misplaced admiration for his 'alleged' heroism during his (ONLY) four months in combat in Vietnam, he carefully shies away from any real discussion of his sordid anti-American activities. He doesn't like to discuss how he 'slandered' his comrades still fighting in the jungles of Vietnam, calling them war criminals and baby killers. (Nor will he sign form #180 that exposes FACTS related to his so many medals in such a short period of time... that reqiured little IF any hospitilizatin!). --------------------------------------------------------- For kerry's valiant service on behalf of the Communist Vietnamese government, Kerry was awarded a special commendation as a \\"Hero of communist victory in 1983\\"... (while he was Lt. Governor of Massachusetts)! Kerry's contribution towards THEIR victory over 'us' was cited by General Vo Nguyen Giap, (the military commander of North Vietnamese forces); when in his 1985 memoir Gen. Giap wrote that: \\"IF it were NOT for the disunity created by stateside protests, Hanoi would have ultimately surrendered.\\" Earlier, the N. VietNam military leader also said that: \\"We were losing and demoralized...But; then our political leaders advised that America was NOW devided, and thus with patience and persistance we could eventually prevail!\\". (Well, hanoi kerry was 'THEIR' field general back here in America...helping to devide America which lead to our Defeat! For lets NOT forget that America never lost any major battles during the war...which we should of won!). Thus, kerry earned THEIR award, having aided and abetted OUR enemy, as he actually helped to prolong the war which lead to even more American casualties! Today, a photo of Kerry being greeted by Do Muoi, General Secretary of VietNams Communist Party, is displayed in a room dedicated to his anti-war protesters in the Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. ====================================================== Next, during the Reagan administration, Kerry got another chance to turn on his country. In the fall of 1983 the KGB launched an all-out \\"peace offensive\\" via a welter of front organizations in the U.S. and Europe. A nuclear freeze at that moment would have meant permanently freezing the Soviet ADVANTAGE in troops and weapons... precisely the Kremlin's main objective! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- So, as Kenneth Timmerman wrote in \\"The French Betrayal of America: \\"...in the United States \\"the nuclear freeze movement won the support of key (liberal) Democrats in Congress as well as that of political gadfly Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Operation PUSH joined forces with the Communist Party USA AND the 'Soviet-backed' U.S. Peace Council...in demanding nothing less than the unilateral dismantling of the U.S. Military!\\" ---------------------------------------------- - - -----For those to young to remember, the entire nuclear freeze moment was a Soviet initiated and financed attempt to undermine President Reagan's nuclear strategy, which even then was beginning to drive the Soviet Union into an arms race that it could NOT win, and would eventually bankrupt them! UN-fortunately, kerry also reported for duty in that movement...(once again undermining American efforts to confront a brutal enemy!). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Then in 1985, after elected to the Senate (with the help of the nuclear freeze PAC), kerry spoke at a nuclear freeze conference in Geneva. There he pandered to European pacifists with the absurd claim that: \\"IF it were not for the freeze movement, I'm confident that America would not be in Geneva today talking with the Soviets\\"...(clearly undermining Reagens efforts!). Well, as an early backer of the nuclear freeze movement, kerry had climbed into bed with European leftists who (wrongly) denounced Reagan as a 'reckless cowboy' for daring to counter Soviet SS-20 missile emplacements in Eastern Europe with U.S. Pershing IIs...(which helped us WIN the Cold War...despite kerry's misguided efforts!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Thus, true to his liberal based Appeasement nature..... In 1985 Kerry introduced the Comprehensive Nuclear Freeze Bill, and, also sponsored two amendments to freeze the Strategic Defense Initiative (related to our nuclear development). All of this was in complete opposition to the sucessful policies of the Reagan White House, which was trying to pursue an aggressive strategy of 'keeping up the pressure' on the Evil Soviet Empire. But, History shows that Reagen's strategy ultimately succeeded, despite Kerry's, And, the KGB's efforts to derail it! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - So, IF kerry's liberal based Appeasement legislation had passed, it would have completely undermined the valid policies being pursued by Reagens White House, and thus prolonged the Cold War (very likely to this very day!)! Thus, had kerry been in charge of fighting the Cold War against Communism, the Soviet Union would still exist. Once again kerry backed the \\"other side\\" at one of the most crucial moments in the Cold War! ====================================================== So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!. --------------------------------------------------------- Throughout his career Kerry's attitude towards communism has been as NAIVE as his current approach to Terrorism. (Plus, lets not so quickly forget the absurd statement kerry made before the senate in 1971: \\"that we can NOT confront Communism all around the world!\\". Well, kerry's judgrement was wrong then...just as it's wrong now!). Thus, it seasy to see why that this man now backed by the Communist Party in America (as well as abroad) ! ====================================================== Thus, is it any wonder that Communist terrorists, (such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua), could always count on his liberal gullibility...as when Daniel Ortega met with Kerry in Managua. Back then Ortega promised to obey the Contadora Act for Peace and in Central America; But, just a few days after meeting with kerry he flew off to Moscow to get a check for $200 Mil from his Soviet masters. Yet, incredibly, even as Ortega was pocketing his Soviet check kerry was on the Senate floor telling congress that they didn't need to support the Contras since Nicaragua was now free of Soviet influence (based upon just a false promise)! -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - For a full account of Kerry's shameful conduct see Dave Eberhart's May 20, 2004 story in NewsMax.com! See thee FACTS yourself about how kerry took Extreme efforts helping the Communist Ortega, and thus Undermining Reagens proper (and successful) efforts trying to confront Communism! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Well, it's no wonder that Kerry has been endorsed by T&oacute;mas Borge, the terrorist-friendly Sandinista leader, (notorious for his brutality when his old communist regime still ruled Nicaragua)?! ====================================================== UN-fortunately, kerry reminds one of the naive Neville Chmaberleign whom lulled the world into a FALSE sense of security based upon his FAILED policy of Appeasement; as he paraded around Europe hailing \\"Peace in OUR time\\" , after every (FAILED) meeting with Hitler...(which only allowed him to grow stronger during thee time that Hitler's rise could of been PRE-Empted!)! ====================================================== Well, like Neville, kerry's naive Appeasement based 'Liberal' attitude was WRONG before...just as it is Wrong NOW ! --------------------------------------------------------- So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Too bad Brinkley missed the boat with this pack of lies. Another piece of Kerry-esque: self-glorification, self-implied hero, self-promoting, self-gratifying, self-serving, self-seeking, self, self, self...self-Kerry, self-political-gaining script.Brinkley is a decent writer(I'd rate him higher if he hadn't done this book based on the pure trust of believing all the Kerry-inspired lies that history has shown us to be both (at minimum bordering on) traitorous and treasonous.Brinkley even has since admitted that he used Kerry as a lone source in some instances; only to learn later some information supplied by Kerry was as many have already called an embellished misrepresentation of fact (or should I say fiction?)Only God & Kerry knows; since his (allegedly \\"non-persuaded\\" $) shipmates don't have a say here.If Brinkley coulda checked facts vs. potential for embellished fact or fiction, I'd put more stock in this piece of work.Since some things in this book & through much of Kerry's story occasionally turn out to later be deemed in error or lies; it just makes me wonder why John Kerry just can't tell the truth in the first place--always. We need a commander-in-chief who has integrity & is not always back-peddling to change \\"fact\\" later turned up to be false."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Brinkley's book contains many factual inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and fallacies; likely unintentional on his part. Several naval officers and enlisted who served with Kerry have submitted changes to Brinkley, often with supporting documentation. Most of Kerry's colleagues wonder if Kerry deserved any medal he received--as he proposed most of the awards for himself--so take any statement from Kerry about his three-month \\"tour of duty\\" with a grain of salt.Kerry clawed and scraped to get these awards, then called himself a war criminal on the Dick Cavett Show in 1971 and hurled the medals on the White House lawn. Now he wears the medals proudly. As a Bronze Star recipient from Operation Iraqi Freedom, I'm embarrassed to see others receive undeserved wartime recognition. I suggest waiting for re-release before taking this book on gospel."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Offshore for so long in his first tour. Then back for only four months, received minor wounds, got medals and &quot;out&quot; while others slogged through jungle in the real war.....Kerry is no hero. A biased book the purpose of which is to win an election, not to give a true account of the war.Kerry came back and accused our soldiers of hideous acts of cruelty and murder; he testitied to these facts while our men were still there. Some of them were even being held prisoners by the enemy at the time. How do you think they were treated by the enemy after hearing what our soldiers did to their people?A disgusting excuse for an objective book. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I'm afraid that Dr. Brinkley missed the boat on this one. By ignoring the Swift Boat Vets, he lost any claim to having written an honest biography of Kerry's war months. Kerry's unwillingness to release his military file would have signaled to any true biographer that there is more to this story than just Kerry's diary."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Douglas Brinkley's book on John Kerry reads like a political pamphlet written by the Kerry Campaign. And Brinkely is an alleged \\"historian?\\" Give me a break. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. Brinkley has no problem making up his own facts to benefit Kerry.Mr. Brinkley's fascination (and obvious political support for) John Kerry clouds his views. Whatever Kerry did in four months in country in Vietnam (which is questionable) was wiped away by his actions when he got home. Apparently Kerry wants to forget his book \\"The New Soldier\\" and his leadership of \\"Vietnam Veterans Against the War,\\" who did nothing but spit on and slander the heroic soldiers who fought in Vietnam for freedom, now that he's essentially the Democratic Presidential nominee. But, as John Adams once wrote -- facts are stubborn things.Vietnam service is popular and attracts votes -- so Kerry will play it to the hilt, this time with Douglas Brinkely as his willing accomplice. However, Kerry didn't think so in 1970 when the war was unpopular, especially among left-wing activists -- he testified before Congress that he was \\"ashamed\\" of what he did in Vietnam and of his service; that he committed \\"war crimes,\\" and charged his fellow veterans with doing the same. Well, there was no evidence for that then OR now. It's all a matter of historical record that you can read for yourself -- don't allow Brinkley to color it for you. Kerry was simply out to make a political name for himself on the backs of his dead comrades. Not exactly heroic or a \\"Profile in Courage.\\" Kerry is just a slimy political opportunist.Despite Brinkley's fauning account, it is clear that Kerry is no hero. This book is a waste of time and should not be confused with scholarship of any kind."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Kerry was still on the U.S. Navy's payroll as he travelled the NE &amp; MidAtlantic for Jane's Fonda's antiwar rallys. Kerry was an organizer in the group. Pretty sad how he was cashing U.S. Navy paychecks as he was smearing American GI's by calling them &quot;babykillers.&quot; I guess there were no wealthy widows around so he need the paycheck.Kerry is no hero. He is an opportunistic back stabber. His cousin Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.This is after Senator Kerry sold out American POWs &amp; MIAs while &quot;normalizing&quot; relations with the new Vietnam."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"John Kerry and his associate Jane Fonda ran the The Vietnam (faux) Veterans Against the War Organization. They were instrumental in helping North Vietnam win the war and turning the tide. North Vietnam was ready to surrender conditionally until Kerry &amp; Fonda rendered their aid.As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972.Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot;The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory.Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot;Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the North Vietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat. Gen. Giap in his book, made the same statement, adding that they were surprised by the news media reporting and the demonstrations in America. Instead of seeking a conditional surrender, they would now hold out because America's resolve was weakening and victory could be theirs.From 1969 to the end of the war over 20,000 American soldiers lost their lives in a war that the United States did not have the resolve to win. If General Giap was accurate in his assessment that North Vietnam was going to seek a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, but stopped due to the sensationalism of the American news media and the anti-war protests following the 1968 Tet Offensive, it follows that those who participated in these anti-war activities have to share partial responsibility for those 20,000 + Americans deaths.We won the war on the battlefield but lost it back home on the college campuses and in the city streets.Americans must realize that there are agents* operating in this Country attempting to undermine our Country and it's leadership through our democratic principles in an effort to achieve a foreign country's goal. A prime example of such a person during the Vietnam War was Jane Fonda, an admitted Socialist, who blatantly supported North Vietnam. * Agent - Any person who works to obtain the goals of another nation either for money or for their own political beliefs.A valuable lesson was taught by North Vietnam to other nations on how the United States may be defeated by fighting a two front war - the battlefield and the American home front. We must be aware of this vulnerability.In 1975, after the fall of the South Vietnam Government, Jane Fonda returned to Hanoi with her newborn son Troy for a celebration in her honor for the work she had done for North Vietnam. During the celebration, her son was christened after a Viet Cong hero, Nguyen Van Troi. Troi had attempted to assassinate Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara while on his visit to South Vietnam in 1963. The South Vietnam Government executed Troi for this attempted assassination."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"There can be no question that this work is politically motivated. How else does one explain its convenient release during primary season? The author, who (surprise surprise)is a &quot;liberal&quot; historian and academic, had to know that Kerry was planning a run before beginning his research at least a year or more ago. This fact together with the entire tone of the work illustrate that, yes Virginia, it is a campaign book. Missing in action is the probable role that Kerry's privileged position as a friend of the Kennedy Klan played in his &quot;war service&quot; and&quot;decorations&quot; (PT-109 indeed). Also largely absent is a honest assessment of his subsequent efforts to undermind his country while it was at war (opposing a position was one thing during Viet Nam, actively supporting your country's enemies was something else entirely).What emerges here if one actually knows something about Kerry's life and career before starting, is a fairly masterful piece of propaganda, which is why I give it two stars. But let's remember that lots of men (including U.S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, and Oliver North) have been more geniunely war heroes than John Kerry, and most certainly would not or did not make a good president. This is especially true for a man, like Kerry, who has done everthing inside and outside of office he can to undercut his country's defense (except where absolutely politically necessary). The good news is that if you want to see the President defeated for re-election, you will find enough illusion here to assuage your conscious in voting for a shallow opportunist like Kerry. But don't fool yourself that this book has anything to do with historical truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"It is regrettable that in our country &quot;the politics of personal destruction&quot; have become routine. When was it (during Nixon's administration, Clinton's?) that we collectively left behind any sense of proportion and prudence in our political passions and returned to the nineteenth century practice of just calling people names? Today individuals running for office are not allowed to be simply human beings but must either be &quot;saviors of the nation&quot; or plain &quot;evil,&quot; depending upon one's political agenda.As a &quot;swing-voter&quot; who regularly votes a split ticket, and as one who tries to maintain some semblance of objectivity, I purchased Brinkley's book in the fond expectation that the pattern above would not be followed, and that instead I would learn something of the truth about an emerging political figure. Sadly I was disappointed, but I did learn some things; I learned that Kerry is indeed a &quot;savior of the nation&quot; who always brushes his teeth, is good to the little people, and stands like a valiant sentinel for truth and justice. In short, I was &quot;treated&quot; to two-dimensional characterization designed to draw votes during a campaign. There is no good explanation here of how such a sterling &quot;hero&quot; could then turn around and shamelessly attack and demean his own country while also engaging in such blatant self-promotion - even a scholar of Brinkley's skill cannot reconcile the two very different images - and does anyone really believe that it proves anything that Senator Kerry's war buddies like and support him, eveybody, even a crack dealer, has friends! I wish, too, like the reviewer below, that there was more about the connection to the Kennedy family, but in most regards that is probably outside the scope of this book.Brinkley is a very skilled writer, and that is evident here in the highly readable style. Nonetheless, this is &quot;spin&quot; written to promote Kerry's candidacy, a fact illustrated by its unusually low price. It will convince no one who does not wish to be convinced, and it will only evoke ridicule from those who do not. Surely good history or biography should do more than that? If Kerry becomes president, much better books will be written, if he does not, Tour of Duty will probably not even qualify to be cited."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be.

I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"John Kerry spent approximately four months in Vietnam. He spent approximately one year active in the leadership of the Vistnam Veterans Against the War. Janus-like he has spent the last thirty years exploiting these two different personas -- war hero/anti-war hero -- in his life-long quest for the presidency of the United Sates. Brinkley is only the latest in the long line of people, friends, family members and comrades, whom Kerry has used to exercise the will to power. Brinkley, in 2002, was given access to Kerry and his memoirs, personal letters, and previous half-heartred tries to write his own biography provided he, Brinkley, publish prior to the 2004 presidential campaign. As a result his fawning biograph totally lacks objectivity. What Brinkley passes off as a personal &quot;War Odyssey&quot; of John Kerry is nothing more that the &quot;Walter Middy&quot; adventures of a self-aggrandizing imitator of John Kennedy, his school boy hero. If Brinkley is considering a sequel to this work covering the thiry years since those fevered days of 1970, he might consider for a catchy title &quot;I'm Just a Giggolo.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"As a daughter of a army veteran and a true \\"indenpent\\".

As he described and synthesized his experiences in Viet Nam, he never stooped to simple-minded extremes. Following up by getting the entire book, I continued to be delighted by the depth of thought, intellect, and insight Kerry has shown throughout his life. Kerry has been wrongly trashed for his ability to see and try to interpret all the ambiguities that life offers; actually to read his writing should help doubters to see the expansive scope of his mind.I grew up in New Haven, CT and was a girl in &quot;junior high&quot; when Kerry volunteered for his tour of duty. I wonder if one of the reasons he volunteered was that the New Haven Register regularly had reports on the young men of the community--not the Yale community, but the New Haven community--who were injured or killed in Viet Nam. New Haven was (and perhaps still is) a schizy town: full of Italian and African Americans who did not have a lot of money watching the contrast of all the rich guys at Yale. One of them, George W. Bush, was arrested for stealing a Christmas wreath from a local home. Such were the shenanigans of the typical Yalie at the time. Yet John Kerry clearly must have been impressed by the disparity between New Haven regular citizens and the sons of privilege. He did what any brave person with a social conscience would do: he denied himself the undoubted privilege he might have had of ignoring the war, or doing a mysterious stint in the Natnl. Guard.Read his letters in this book and you will be impressed with the heart and soul of a young thinker.

If John Kerry is a hero, Tour of Duty fails to prove it, that is unless one's definition is so general and faith-based as to be objectively meaningless.You can run from the truth but you cannot hide, Tour of Duty is just a a campaign book glossing over the truth to create a false image of man who has no apparent ideals other than his own self advancement (\\"I oppose gay marriage, I also oppose any effort to ban it\\"), no apparent leadership skills skills other than following whatever he thinks will serve his political ambition (\\"I support the removal of the evil dictator Saddam, I oppose the president's poor judgement in invading Iraq\\"), and certainly not much value as a soldier, expense-paid-for-by-Jane-Fonda anti-war \\"activist,\\" or as an United States Senator - what has he ever actually done in that capacity that matters?

As a historian Brinkley's book contributes nothing to the history of Vietnam and it is inaccurate in it's portrayal of Kerry's exploits. It relies too much on Kerry's diary and not enough on the recollections of the 200 plus men who served with Kerry. As a retired naval officer and a collector of navy medals for over 40 years, I found major holes in Kerry's records indicating conflict between the book and reality. Regretfully, Kerry has not released numerous pages of his record thus the truth of the matter will not be resolved. One would expect that if the records indeed supported Kerry, that he would have proudly shown them to the world. In the end, Brinkley's scholarship is lacking through a failure to pursue readily available sources.

It hardly seems a coincidence that this book came out right before Kerry's leap to the top of the Democratic pack--anyone who reads it will see just how much this brave onetime Navy lieutenant could bring to the presidency.

John Kerry does not deserve to even be called a veteran, much less a hero."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Having already proven himself to be one of our best biographers today, with his books on Dean Acheson, JFK, FDR, Jean Monnet, James Forrestal, Henry Ford, Rosa Parks, and others, Douglas Brinkley has done it again with a terrific look at the truth behind an American veteran, politician and lifelong public servant.Only the ignorant and openly biased will dismiss this highly-detailed examination of John Kerry's war experience, from growing up in Denver and his education at Yale through to his trials, triumphs, and ultimate disgust with the Vietnam War. Any questions you have about Kerry's character or his military service - especially those invented by political opponents who instead backed a corrupt coward named W - you'll find the answers right here.If you value truth over hype and courage over self-serving cronyism, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I can hardly believe that this book is being distributed as factual and historical. A respected author has written a political essay of propaganda. The mighty \\"hero\\" John Kerry is nothing but a liar and someone who has attempted to shame and hurt the image of a generation of brave American's who did what their country asked of them. His flagrant charges which are totally false were nothing but an attack on our country. How anyone could believe he is a hero is so mistakenly foolish to believe this nonsense. Do your own research. The truth isn't found in the pages of this trash. There were NONE of the atrocities written in the book. Where did Douglas Brinkley get his information? The truth is there are many respected Naval officers who were there as well as enlisted men who served WITH John F. Kerry LT (jg) USN who vouch for none of his charges. God help our great country if Senator Kerry becomes our Commander-in-Chief."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This is a well written and informative book. I've noticed that some of the reviews of the book do not review the book but advance a political outlook. Undoubtly the same reviewers rated books by Ann Coulter and others as great works even though they are poorly written and poorly researched. I severed 18 months in Viet Nam and when I returned in 1970 I also joined VVAW because it was an unjust, unwarrented war. Many of the reasons I chose to oppose this present war is bacause it is as assinine as Vier Nam. I am not opposed to war if the cause is just and the reasons clear, but any war based on lies and misinformation is wrong and does nothing but undermine the Nation."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Hopefully America has come to her senses and will restore honor and dignity to the White House. The current occupant is a disgrace to the flag, to the country, and everything Kerry bravely fought for."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Kerry is a pumpedup little windbag who has never done anything of substance in his life - that is the real story between the lines of this book. He is a multimillionaire thanks to his wives, has been the handpicked &quot;boy&quot; of the Kennedy clan, while all along having no real beliefs at all (as illustrated recently by his newly announced &quot;conviction&quot; that a fetus is a human being, which the polls show might be the more popular stance, but, of course, he is also on record as promising to appoint if he ever gets the chance &quot;pro-choice&quot; justices to the Supreme Court.) He has shown less leadership than the secretary of the local PTA, and the charisma of a sick bulldog (and a not dissimilar appearance).This book needs to be understood as part of the effort to coverup these truths. However, it has value because they are there; if you look past the &quot;gee whiz&quot; rhetoric of its obviously biased author, John Kerry emerges as the absolutely least suitable candidate the Democrat party has thrown up EVER, and that includes such lumnaries as George McGovern (who was at least a man of integrity),Michael Dukakus. Jimmy Carter.Among other things this book amply answers the question as to why the terrorists and the French want Kerry to win. Have you ever wondered why? Well, if you were at war with United States, who better as president than a guy who has based his career upon subverting one American war effort and then has consistently voted against every major upgrade of his country's military efficiency (M1 tank, Apache helicopter, you name it)? So if you are geniunely interested in the truth about John Kerry the pacifist, trophy husband, and militant opponent of America's ability to defend itself, get this book and try to read it objectively!!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Much of what we hear about John Kerry - good and bad - is exposed in this fascinating tale of Senator Kerry's life through the early 1970's.Kerry's arrogance is apparent in numerous incidents during his school days, in Vietnam and with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.However, his bravery, intelligence, and commitment to his country also come through loud and clear.Douglas Brinkley is an great historian and an even better story-teller."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I'm still reading this book but had to post some comments. Sad how the Vietnam War and service in it is still so devisive.I knew of Kerry's service and post war activities but the fact that he volunteered while harboring doubts about the War was a revelation to me. That took guts. For those that see some conspiracy or plan in Kerry's service, I fail to see it. When he asked to command a Swift boat, they were not involved in much action-merely patroling the coast. How could this been aimed at some false heroism and a political future? These boats were sitting ducks once they did enter the rivers and had high casualty rates. That's how Sen. Kerry could get wounded and recieve the medals in such a short time. Hard to see how one could be in harm's way with an eye toward a career in politics when by that very act, you endanger your future.As a young man, Kerry had no great fortune or political connections. If he had, he'd have used them to avoid serving like many others.I didn't start out a Kerry fan but I have been converted."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"When excerpts from Douglas Brinkley's forthcoming book on John Kerry and the Vietnam War appeared in The Atlantic in December 2003, I couldn't help feeling sorry for the author. Obviously he had spent a lot of time researching and writing a book that would be forgotten before the ink was even dry. Of course, at that time Senator Kerry's campaign for the presidency was dead in the water, while the supposedly smart money was accumulating around Howard Dean.Now Douglas Brinkley has the last laugh. His time spent on \\"Tour of Duty\\" looks like a shrewd bet. Not only has Kerry locked up the Democratic nomination to challenge George W. Bush--his experiences in the Vietnam War have become central to the campaign in a way few could have predicted.Anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of the veteran senator who would be president should start here. Brinkley shows Kerry's growth from youth to manhood through the harrowing crucible of the Vietnam War. Anyone who doubts the genuine courage and skill that Kerry showed as a Navy lieutenant in that conflict must contend with the evidence that Brinkley has amassed. With the cooperation of his subject, he has also produced a highly intimate portrait of Kerry's thoughts and writings at the time. Brinkley thereby succeeds in warmly humanizing a public figure often criticized for aloofness.Brinkley's Kerry is a compelling Renaissance Man: brave soldier, compassionate friend, charismatic politician, agile intellectual, avid sportsman. In short, he's a little too good to be true. And that's where one begins to have some doubts about this book. An associate of the late Stephen Ambrose, Brinkley seems to be a serious historian. And one might expect him to be broadly sympathetic to his subject--if he weren't, I doubt that Senator Kerry would have offered him access to his private papers.Still, Brinkley seems reluctant to criticize Kerry or even raise questions about his motives or judgment. This becomes more apparent when the narrative shifts from Mekong Delta war stories to antiwar protests and political campaigns. The final chapter, a glowing description of Kerry's presidential announcement in September 2003 (an event which seemed to fall flat at the time), reads like a ghostwritten hack campaign biography.It's too bad, because Brinkley was ideally situated to place the strengths and weaknesses of Kerry's candidacy in the context of his past. (A first-class example of this type of book is David Maraniss' biography of the young Bill Clinton, \\"First in His Class\\".)Brinkley's book also seems to have been rushed a bit into publication. Editors of political books ought to be able to spell Rep. John Dingell's name right, for example, and to know that Chuck Hagel is a Republican Senator from Nebraska, not a Democrat.That being said, Brinkley has produced a truly useful piece of work. Both Republicans and Democrats will be studying it carefully--the former probing for weaknesses, the latter looking for reassurance. But if John Kerry is half the man Doug Brinkley seems to think he is, the Republicans should be worried, and the Democrats should be proud."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I saw Doug Brinkley interviewed on the Today Show about this book and, although I don't know much about John Kerry, I thought &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; sounded interesting so I got a copy. Regardless of one's political views, this is an extraordinary book about the life and experiences of a young soldier in Vietnam grappling with what it's like to kill, survive emotionally and physically in a hellish environment (Kerry was wounded several times), and come to terms with a conflict he ultimately thought to be unwinnable--even thought he was right in the middle of it. This is not a Kerry campaign book, but a phenomenal, unbiased work of history on Professor Brinkley's part and, without question, one of the best and most riveting war books I've read. And I read a lot of them."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Douglas Brinkley, a respected historian and biographer, has put together an extensively researched, well-written portrait of a young John Kerry as well as a fascinating account of an important period of American history.Whether you like Kerry the candidate or not, this book will provide insight to the man. Kerry, by the way, gave Brinkley unrestricted access to his letters, journals, and personal papers, and exercised no editorial control over the end result. (And yes, Brinkley interviewed dozens of vets who served with Kerry.)It is telling of Brinkley's professionalism that in almost every subsequent article or commentary about Kerry, \\"Tour of Duty\\" is used as a point of reference. The book is cited line and page to settle points about Kerry's life and times. It is also a mark of Brinkley's journalistic integrity that the paperback edition contains clarifications suggested by readers and interviewees.When you scan the O'Neill/Corsi hit piece, compare the quality of the writing, research, and tone to Brinkley's. Like comparing Rush Limbaugh to Edward R. Murrow.(An aside to a prior reviewer - even the FR site has exposed the old \\"Giap thanks Kerry\\" bit as an urban legend. Get with it.)"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I had no plans to read this book, but after receiving it as a gift, I gave it a whirl. I am glad that I did. While Brinkley deserves some chiding for only bringing campaign biography analytical rigor to the subject, he does a fine job of describing John Kerry's life during the Vietnam era, and more generally, presenting the difficult choices that Americans of Kerry's generation faced. Kerry comes off as an admirable (though certainly not faultless) young man making his way through difficult time with intelligence and integrity."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"How to deal with the actual, living experience of war, then and now, is the underlying topic of Douglas Brinkley's troubling book. Troubling because in John Kerry's experience of Vietnam as a young soldier, there were no easy answers or solutions, even when it was clear that the war was wrong. How to behave? What decisions to make? How to maintain loyalty to one's comrades and decency to one's enemy? How to think about the experience years later, and apply it to the radically different environment created by the interplay of George W. Bush's insistence on invading Iraq and Saddam Hussein's efforts to disguise his own weakness, in a period when the CIA was warning he had the ability to kill millions with biological and chemical weapons, and was still seeking nuclears. No simple answers here, only the guidance that one has to do one's level best with the struggle to do the right thing. A powerful book, but not a happy one. What it does suggest that John Kerry has been through a crucible that would make him more cautious and serious than the people who got us into Iraq, and the compassion and empathy for others that might make him more capable of helping us find solutions for where we are now with Iraq and with the world."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Brinkley's text helps explain why every one of Kerry's crew members in Vietnam, regardless of party affiliation, are supporting him in his quest for the presidency. Brinkley's account describes an especially mature, serious, and thoughtful young man, trying to do what he feels is right for the country. Kerry's enormous courage, integrity, patriotism, and strength of character are on full display here. If you want to get a sense of what type of person John Kerry is, read this book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I really expected nothing but rah-rah, Kerry boosterism from this book but was surprised at the candor of the material. I was particularly interested in the Swift Boat era. According to this, John Kerry signed up for a second Viet Nam tour as a Swift Boat commander not because he wanted to be in the thick of the action but rather to have his own command. Only after he arrived in Viet Nam did he discover that he got more than he bargined for. Roy Hoffman (who now is now a critic) was the one who came up with the dubious use of Swift Boats in the Mekong Delta. In other words it appears that Kerry saw all the action he did because of circumstances not rabid heroism.The \\"Winter Soldier\\" hearings and the subsequent Senate Foriegn Relations Committee testimony is also viewed with candor. If people would bother to read it they might have very different views of Kerry's role at that very difficult time.An enjoyable read with some gingerbread and some warts to spice things up. Refreshingly positive overall."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Kerry's biggest crime is, of course, that he is everything their hero is not. Kerry served in Vietnam, honourably in both senses. He got wounded three times - which meant his tour of duty was over, and he got a medal for bravery. However, he also served honourably in that he questioned the actions of his fellow soldiers. Just this story about how they were supposed to treat local fishermen; Kerry was disgusted. Does that show a flip-flopper? Kerry's even greater moment of bravery came when he stood up against the establishment and spoke out. This book is more than an ordinary biography, it also covers the brown water corps, and it is also a story about an intelligent young man that learns that life is more complex than he was tought.Contrary to what the detractors of the book claims there are plenty of sources, not just Kerry's war diaries. The writing is actually quite riveting, Brinkley can write, but still sober. A far cry from the somewhat shrill and desperate tone of Unfit for Commmand."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I had hoped for an insightful biography of John Kerry. This is just a whitewashed story of his life. Everything is bathed in positive rays of sunshine. People who did not like John Kerry are described as being part of a &quot;cult of envy&quot;. It's hard to believe this book is not satire; Kerry is the Doc Savage of his generation. The stories of the war years were more interesting and kept me from rating the book lower. I will still be searching for a true, objective biography of the man."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book was well-written and well-researched, regardless of how I may feel about Kerry's political stance. My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam. My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate. For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years. My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there. That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, &quot;this one is accurate.&quot; Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I love politics and make a point of reading as much as I can about all the players - positive-negative-unbiased-etc. Because of this &quot;hobby&quot; I picked up Tour of Duty a few months ago (shortly after it was released, I believe) and on my shelf it collected dust until a trip.I had to partake a couple of plane trips within a months time for work, one in which I was going to be able to visit the Viet Nam wall and touch my cousin's name, so I decided to pick up Tour of Duty and even though I am not into &quot;war&quot; stories I was captivated.Again, I have read tons of political books from all sides and am very aware of &quot;propoganda&quot; both positive and negative and this one does not read as such (propoganda) and is a great adventure story...recalling that it is true - takes my breath away.I also find it interesting that I was finishing the book, during a week when J. Kerry was on the NBC Sunday morning show and pundits from the rep. party were decrying his military record for about a day and a half (the obviously had not read this book, or anything about this war) and by Monday evening those same pundits were saying in effect &quot;okay, he is a hero but this doesn't really matter.&quot; I found it so interesting to have watched these political events, while having the background of facts that this book produces.Whether you want to read about the Viet Nam war, John Kerry, a great adventure story or all of the above, I recommend heartily Tour of Duty. Let us just say that my opinion about the man, who is the subject of this book, was raised tremendously."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"1. Factcheck.org looked into the Swift Boat Vet controversy and summarized their ad like this: \\"[It] features vets who claim Kerry \`lied' to get Vietnam medals. But other witnesses disagree-and so do Navy records.\\"Factcheck.org notes that one of the key vets who signed a statement against Kerry wound up retracting it, saying to The Boston Globe: \\"It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here.... I knew it was wrong... In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake.\\"2. Jim Rassman, the army lieutenant saved by Kerry during a firefight, directly contradicted many of the claims made by the Swift Boat Vets. Rassman supported Kerry's Bronze Star and has always backed up Kerry's version of the story.3. The Swift Boat Vets are politically funded by a major GOP donor, and are going after Kerry decades after the action in order to help their candidate-George W. Bush-retain control of the White House.4. Nightline went to Vietnam to research the facts of Kerry's Silver Star firefight disputed by the Swift Boat Vets, talking to local villagers who had witnessed the battle. Nightline discovered that Kerry's version of the story was correct.Present author has admitted he has some corrections to make and is working on a revision; no such comment from O'Neil who is proven to be false on many accounts. Brinkley is a professional who tries to get it right."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Let's establish a couple of things first: 1) Douglas Brinkley is a professional historian and director of the Eisenhower Center, the mission of which is to preserve and honor the stories and sacrifices of American servicemen from World War II through Vietnam and beyond. No one can reasonably accuse Brinkley of being a knee-jerk \\"liberal historian\\" who only wrote this book to flack John Kerry's presidential candidacy. 2) Brinkley began his research for this book in 2002, before Kerry ever decided to run. To the extent that Brinkley became an admirer of Kerry--and clearly he did--I would suggest that this was a RESULT of researching and writing this book, not a CAUSE of it.That said, this volume is without question an eye-opener. Regardless of one's political persuasion and what one may think of John Kerry's presidential candidacy, this book is an education. Brinkley reminds us of how divisive the conflict in Vietnam was for Americans and how ambivalent many young men of Kerry's generation were about serving. He also accomplishes one of his primary goals with this book, which is to enlighten readers about the largely overlooked riverine war in southeast Asia, and how dangerous it was for the men involved. John Kerry and many others served bravely and well in this battle, despite its often unclear or contradictory goals. It was as a direct result of his experience in combat in Vietnam, and his belief that we were clearly not winning the \\"war for hearts and minds\\" that Kerry came to oppose American involvement in the conflict and the way our political leaders were conducting it. Additionally, we learn that Kerry's current campaign to honor servicemen through proper funding of veterans' hospitals and services is not an election-year gimmick; this is a cause he has supported and fought for throughout his career. As a leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Kerry's focus was to bring an end to American casulties AND to see that proper attention was paid to those who had already given so much. He constantly visited with disabled veterans and railed against the \\"shabby treatment\\" they too often received.Finally, given the current political climate, it is impossible--it was for me anyway--to read this book and not constantly reflect on the comparison between John Kerry and our current president. Again, regardless of where one stands politically, the intellectual and moral depth of these two men seems remarkably different. Here is 25-year old John Kerry writing in anguish to his girlfriend upon learning of the battlefield death of one of his best friends: \\"Right now everything that is superficial and emotional wants to give up and just feel sorry but I can't. I am involved in something that keeps pushing on regardless of the individual and which even with what has happpened must, I know deep, deep down iside me be coped with rationally and with strength. I do feel strong and despite emptiness and waste, I still have hope and confidence...Judy, if I do nothing else in my life I will never stop trying to bring to people the conviction of how wasteful and asinine is a human expenditure of this kind. I don't mean this in an all-consuming world saving fashion. I just mean that my own effort must be entire and thorough and that it must do what it can to help make this a better world to live in.\\"Can anyone even remotely imagine George W. Bush writing something like this when he was 25--or today?"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"In Tour of Duty, author Douglas Brinkley presents a thoroughly researched account of Senator John Kerry's years as a Naval Lieutenant in Vietnam. From the authors interviews with people who were actually there, we are led to the indubitable conclusion that Kerry, one of the most highly decorated swift boat officers during the Vietnam War, deserved his accolades. The book puts to rest the politically motivated revisionist spoutings of the so-called 'Swiftboat Veterans for Truth'. Also explored with great detail are Kerry's antiwar activities following his Vietnam service. It is interesting to find that the vast bulk of Kerry's work during this period was aimed at fighting for improved medical care and VA funding for injured and war-torn vets, demands that the Nixon administration ignored outright. Also notable is the fact that Kerry, when he senced that Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) was turning radical, resigned from the group in protest. This is something the SBVT and other Bush front groups certainly don't want the public to know about during this election cycle. Finally, we learn that the tactic of going back and attempting to discredit the service of honorable veterans is a remnant of a deplorable tactic used by the Nixon administration and Republican operatives some thirty years ago. Some things never change."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"John Kerry served bravely and with honors in Vietnam. He risked his life to save others. During a mission to insert troops on a riverbank, a Vietcong soldier fired a rocket at his boat. Lt. Kerry beached his boat, ran into the jungle, took out the enemy and returned with the rocket launcher, earning a silver star for gallantry in action.During another mission Lt. Kerry turned his boat around and headed back into the same enemy fire he had just escaped from to rescue a Navy Seal from certain death. While wounded in the right shoulder, Kerry pulled the Seal into the boat before leaving the scene. Kerry didn't even know the Navy Seal. He wasn't part of Kerry's crew, just a passenger but John Kerry brought him back alive.When John Kerry returned from Vietnam he protested to end the war, to save the lives of the soldiers that were still in a mistaken war. He risked his own future and fought the political establishment to save lives.In comparison, George Bush disappeared from duty when the air war heated up in Vietnam. On April 10-14, 1972 Richard Nixon began carpet bombing North Vietnam. Fighter planes were used as a slow moving screen to protect the B-52 bombers. Pictures of captured US fighter pilots appeared on the front pages by April 15. George W. Bush's last paid day as a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard was the very next day, April 16, 1972 (according to records released by the White House).Bush stayed in Alabama for FIVE months before he received authorization to transfer there. In Alabama, Bush stopped flying, failed to take a required physical exam and allowed his flying status to lapse. He never went back to Texas until he received his discharge six months before his required end of service date."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"For anyone that is interested in knowing what makes John Kerry tick, this is a book that must be read. John Kerry's extraordinary devotion to public service can be explained by reading of his experiences, as detailed by Douglas Brinkley. This is not a so-called &quot;campaign biography,&quot; as has been claimed by several other reviewers.

Give me a break!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004.But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.[...]"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Propaganda piece to make John Kerry look presidential. Doesn't do enough in covering John Kerry's radical extremism in slandering US GI's in Vietnam as war criminals and the bad guys. Kerry served a total of 4 months and this book makes it out like he is a regular Audie Murphy, do all for your brothers in arms. Kerry sought to get out after getting a third Purple Heart(due to very minor 'injuries') and got out after those 4 months, leaving those 'brothers in arms' to come back and join the pro-Hanoi, Fonda sponsored Vietnam Veterans against the War, a very radical, communist loving group that slandered the US and our troops still over there(The North Vietnamese used Kerry's supportive rhetoric as propaganda with our POWs) as the one committing the wrongs and this book attempts to sugar coat it.

Kerry seems to have spent vast amounts of time writing in his journals. The book seems to be surprisingly synchphantic, I lost count of how many \\"spellbinding speeches\\" Kerry gave to save the day. He is vague when he wants to be and glosses over, or even omits certain facts, such as the trips he took to Paris to meet with the representatives of the Viet Cong. His campaign has been forced to admit that he did in fact go to Paris just after his honeymoon in 1970, but refuses to divy up what Kerry talked about, other than it was a \\"fact-finding mission.\\" The book also says of John being at the Detroit Winter Soldier Hearings, that he was there to listen, on a \\"fact-finding\\" mission, and to make vague suggestions to the participants aboutwhat \\"atrocities\\" they were going to confess too. He sugar coatsjust about everything, his explaination of how he got his threepurple hearts is interesting. He admits that earlier in the dayhe got \\"tiny bits of grenade shrapnel and rice pellets blown inhis ass\\" after someone blew up a rice hootch. There were no enemy in the area at the time. Later the same day comes the famous saving of Rassman, where Kerry claims Rassman fell off another boat,(in his Bronze Star Citation) Rassman falls of his. Kerry knocks his forearm against the boat. That night he goes for medical treatment of the arm, a slight concussion and the (...)shrapnel. The Casualty Report says the contusion was \\"very minor\\"but evidently enough for another Purple Heart.Four days later he gets his third Purple Heart, the very sameday, at 7:42 in the morning his commander puts in the Thrice-Wounded reassignment request, this is in the book. Kerryis then again vague as to the exact day he leaves Vietnam, yethe can remember seeing Rassman in the water, several hundred yardsaway, with bullets flying all around him. Kerry says that\\"since he got shrapnel three different times in action\\" he qualified to leave his one year tour of duty eights months early.I am comparing Kerry's book against the official Navy documents on his website, there seems to be some that should be there that aren't, especially the Thrice-Wounded request. The book hasseveral glaring inconsistencies. He spends one sentence on hisNavy Reserve duty that he was obligated to do in the early seventies while at the same time involved in the VVAW, meeting with the enemy in Paris, ect.The other part of the book is how fantastic an orator Kerry is, spellbinding audiences and evidently biographers everywhere, this book is too funny in it's glorification of Kerry. If you are interested in the book, buy it used."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"O starts. The book fails to mention how Kerry smeared Vietnam Vets by calling them all &quot;babykillers&quot; in front of the Senate.Much of Kerry's speech before Congress painted his fellow GIs as so brutal that, today, they could easily be mistaken for Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen killers.He reported to Congress that U.S. soldiers had &quot;personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam.&quot;C. Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.Kerry's group, The Vietnam Veterans Against the War Organization, was funded by Jane Fonda.Jane Fonda personally sought out returning American soldiers from Vietnam to solicit them to publicly speak out against American atrocities against Vietnamese women and children during her broadcasts. North Vietnamese officials based in Canada allegedly coordinated her broadcasts.In 1972 Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden and others traveled to North Vietnam to give their support to the North Vietnamese's Government. When she returned to the United States, she advised the news media that all of the American Prisoners of War were being well treated and were not being tortured.As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972. Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot;The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory. Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot; Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the North Vietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat. Gen. Giap in his book, made the same statement, adding that they were surprised by the news media reporting and the demonstrations in America. Instead of seeking a conditional surrender, they would now hold out because America's resolve was weakening and victory could be theirs.From 1969 to the end of the war over 20,000 American soldiers lost their lives in a war that the United States did not have the resolve to win. If General Giap was accurate in his assessment that North Vietnam was going to seek a conditional surrender at the Paris Peace Conference, but stopped due to the sensationalism of the American news media and the anti-war protests following the 1968 Tet Offensive, it follows that those who participated in these anti-war activities have to share partial responsibility for those 20,000 + Americans deaths.We won the war on the battlefield but lost it back home on the college campuses and in the city streets.Americans must realize that there are agents* operating in this Country attempting to undermine our Country and it's leadership through our democratic principles in an effort to achieve a foreign country's goal. A prime example of such a person during the Vietnam War was Jane Fonda, an admitted Socialist, who blatantly supported North Vietnam. * Agent - Any person who works to obtain the goals of another nation either for money or for their own political beliefs.A valuable lesson was taught by North Vietnam to other nations on how the United States may be defeated by fighting a two front war - the battlefield and the American home front. We must be aware of this vulnerability.In 1975, after the fall of the South Vietnam Government, Jane Fonda returned to Hanoi with her newborn son Troy for a celebration in her honor for the work she had done for North Vietnam. During the celebration, her son was christened after a Viet Cong hero, Nguyen Van Troi. Troi had attempted to assassinate Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara while on his visit to South Vietnam in 1963. The South Vietnam Government executed Troi for this attempted assassination."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty LP: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book should be in the fiction category. I'm sure Kerry stayed up late every night and dreamed up what would sound good for a person with political aspirations before he wrote up the days 'After Action Reports'. I just wonder why the author didn't talk about Kerry's three deferments he applied for and received. When he applied for his fourth to study in France he was turned down so he rushed down to join the Navy where he thought he would be far from action. What a shock it must've been when after a few months he was assigned to somewhere where there was real danger.

He highlights the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" and takes us down memory lane with captivating stories from the days when radio was the center of family entertainment. The popular program \\"Hit Parade\\" was prime time entertainment.He takes us back to the patriotic songs of World War II and the era that introduced the \\"Hollywood Musical\\".

The author Chuck Denison has researched the history of singers, musicians, lyricists, and composers and tells their stories here. He tells the history of these people and how their lives interacted with their music. Some of the people written about include: George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Cole Porter, Paul McCartney and Frank Sinatra.The majority of the people written about did not have easy lives, but it was the rough patches that these people lived through that gave their music an edge. Denison talks about the music genius that this people carried within them. He also discusses those that seem touched by a muse. He writes: \\"The muses, the supernatural forces of beauty, art and music capture us, and reveal themselves. In an instant, we hear the melody, catch the concept and dream the solution.\\"I enjoyed reading the stories behind many famous songs from the past.

Benny and Babe is a classic coming of age story about 13 year old Benny who is a hurling all-star plagued with a very liberal mother and a little brother who won't behave like little brothers should. Benny also still play with dolls (technically its an action figure, but no one would care about the difference if they ever found out).

Benny and Babe end up friends and partners in a lure business where they find old lures and sell them to fisherman. All is fine an well until Furty Howlin enters the mix, then things get interesting.Colfer uses a very fun writing style that can be described as tongue in cheek at times. Although the main character is 13, Benny and Babe can appeal to older audiences because of the humor and writing style included. Themes include, coming of age, friends, entrepreneurship, juvenile delinquency, alcoholism, and responsibility.

The authors show the complexity of the subject and the need for managers to exercise caution in using prescriptive systems in the highly dynamic, uncertain and complex operating environment. The book avoids taking a simplistic view to the subject but take a realistic approach of presenting various approaches that managers can use depending on their peculiar circumstances. Having grasped the various concepts, leaders of organisations can then use their judgement to come up with appropriate decisions and actions. The book focuses on developing the ability of managers to make informed judgements based on analysis, synthesis, experience and intuition and harnessing the collective skills and expertise of their organisations.The book shows how strategy formulation and implementation are intimately intertwined as complex interactive processes in which politics, values and organisational cultures and management styles determine or constrain particular strategic decisions.Top managers have to make judgements on various unknown and difficult to predict factors and integrate external considerations about technologies, limited resources, competitions, markets, societal attitudes, cultural differences, government regulations and environmental issues. Internally, they have to make judgements on organisational structures, systems, staff, physical resources, existing and potential power bases and bureaucracies.The chief executive officer has the challenging task of mediating between the various aspects of the internal and external environment and exercises his skills, judicious exercise of power and often make highly qualitative (rather than quantitative) choices from a wide range of possible options.The book will enable the reader to understand the wide range of issues involved in strategy.The book has a wide range of cases and articles that give the reader the opportunity to develop and exercise judgements on strategic issues. Although experience is the best teacher, these case studies and articles shorten the training time of managers. The cases cover a wide range of issues and perspectives. The reader can practice their judgement that should develop an awareness of the complex and subtle issues typical in the business world. The cases should highlight the limitations and the reasoning behind various theories and the limitations of standard answers based on conventional wisdom.The book is recommended reading for those seeking a more in-depth insight into both the theory and practice of strategic management.
