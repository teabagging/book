His bean-topped pizzas are incredibly tasty and hearty - definitely not for the faint-hearted! Easy to use and very varied styles."},{"Title":"The Pizza Gourmet: Simple Recipes for Spectacular Pizza","review":"When it comes to pizza there are two basic preferences. Either you go for something simple and you sprinkle one or two light toppings sparingly to enhance the flavour of the crust and the flavour of the tomato sauce that has been finely balanced with herbs and spices. Or you go the other way and you overfill your pizza with your chosen toppings and even sometimes include as many different toppings as you can think of. This book is mainly for the latter type of pizza. If you enjoy filling your face with a smorgasbord of flavours and textures only to feel bloated and ill afterwards then this is the book for you. If, on the other hand you want to get down to basics and do things more simply yet at the same time produce something sophisticated in flavour and texture then you'll need a different book. Although the technical information and secrets are available online I have not yet found a printed book on true pizza excellence. Printed cookery books are aimed to appeal to as many buyers as possible who won't want to bother searching for the correct flours and do the necessary experimentation for success. On the other hand what has prevented me from rating this book a one star is that it has some use in suggesting unusual toppings but I will include only one or maybe two toppings on a pizza and much reduce the quantity."},{"Title":"101 Essential Tips: Hiking (101 Essential Tips)","review":"Sadly the best thing about this book is the portability.

It offers tips that are very basic as well as advanced but it doesn't make any sense. Its a small book meant to be taken with you while you hike but so it doesn't cover any one tip in too much detail. Because of its brevity, some tips are actually incomplete and could be dangerous on top of not containg enough information.TIP 2- Choosing Companions- walking with a group is safer than walking alone, and walking with friends is preferable to walking with strangers. (Rocket science folks!) Find a walking association and make an effort to talk to everyone early on.--so here the book is supposing that you are somebody who has never hiked before.Other tips go on to talk about choosing clothing, food, tents and backpacks so here the book is assuming you are going on a multi night camping trip which is fine but the information here is not thourough enough for inexperienced hikers so it really ends up being useless. Tips 8-24 aren't bad as they talk about boots, fitting you pack and how to pack it as well as foot care and the layer system. It pretty much goes downhill from there though as we get the myriad of misinformation and common knoweldege.TIP 25- Sleeping Bags- says nothing about the temp rating system or down bags or the difference between house sleeping bags and camping sleeping bags.TIP 30- Bring Portable Foods- no duh!TIP 36- Bring First Aid Kit- yikes!TIP 38- goes into detail about planning your route on a multi night hike. Does not talk about distance planning and makes it seem like a breeze. This is misleading and you shouldn't be making your own routes along places without trails unless you actually have some unmarked backcountry experience.TIP 41 and 42- How a compass works and setting your compass. -great except for the fact that again, someone who doesn't know how to do this should not be getting them in a situation where they need to do for the first time from a book!TIP 46- Navigating by stars- see problems with 38, 41 and 42....TIP 61-63- crossing dangerous water alone, in groups etc...oy vey don't get yourself into this please!There are some usefull tips here and there but for the most part I don't like this book. There are some usefull first aid tips but most kits contain this information in them already or you just get a pamhlet of the internet that does.Bottom Line: Anyone new to hiking should check out other bigger books at their bookstere which go into more detail about types of shoes, conditioning, safety etc..Anyone who wants to get into more serious day hikes or multi night trips should try out the Backpackers Handbook by Chris Townsend.

In light of what happened on 9/11/2001, this book provides a remarkable insight into how we as a society grieve and memorialize sites of national tragedy. This is not any easy or simple process, and Linenthal does an excellent job in explaining what happened in OKC, and the wide variety of issues that were confonted in developing the memorial.I would recommend this book to anyone considering how America should memorialize the World Trade Center site."},{"Title":"The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory","review":"In so many ways this is a fascinating and thoughtful book on one of the most important tragedies in American public life in the last decade of the twentieth century. No area of historical study in the last twenty years has been more important than the nature of memory and \\"The Unfinished Bombing\\" is an attempt to understand how Americans have recalled the April 19, 1995, instance of domestic terrorism that took place in Oklahoma City. On that day Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols conspired to explode a truck bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building killing 168 people, injuring many more, and opening a wound on the national landscape about the nature of modern American democracy. It is an exceptional study of how stories about the past become a master narrative, and what lessons they teach to those affected. This memory is constructed gradually over time as people reflect on the meaning of what has transpired, and much of what emerges is not so much a fable or falsehood as it is a kind of poetry about events and situations that have great significance for the people involved. The memories over time become more significant than the cold, hard facts of the past, insofar as they are recoverable at all, and become the essential truths of the past for the members of a cultural group who hold them, enact them, or perceive them. This book helps to pull those ideas together into a coherent discussion concerning the 1995 bombing.Edward T. Linenthal, now at Indiana University where he edits the \\"Journal of American History,\\" draws on extensive field work in Oklahoma City to construct this analysis of public memory and memorialization. Most interesting to me was how three preferred narratives emerged from the bombing, all rooted in personal understandings of what took place. The first was a progressive story of how the tragedy was overcome. It was about the heroism of the rescue workers, the support of citizens throughout the nation, and the recovery of Oklahoma City through urban renewal, commemoration, and a demonstration of character. This is very much, as Linenthal wrote, a story of \\"yes, it was horrendous but...\\" (p. 41) before telling all of the good that emerged from the experience. A second narrative, Linenthal believes, is one of redemption, \\"A crisis of meaning, as people struggled to locate it in an ongoing religious narrative\\" (p. 53). In this narrative, the pain and suffering of those who died, as well as those who survived, served as a sacrament, in the words of one survivor, Susan Urbach, \\"an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible grace\\" (p. 70). Finally, Linenthal unpacks what he calls a toxic narrative, one filled with loss, mourning, pain, and suffering. Sometimes it manifested itself in anger and agony, sometimes in fear and a desire for retribution, sometimes in the broken lives those who could not deal with the tragedy.It is this last narrative that Linenthal spends the most time with, writing at length about what he calls a \\"wounded community.\\" He describes in detail the process whereby members of the families of those at the Murrah building waited to hear if their loved ones had been rescued, or if bodies had been recovered, and finally how they commemorated those lost. Not only that, the toll on those working on the rescue efforts was intense. The best example, well told in \\"The Unfinished Bombing,\\" is of Chris Fields, the fireman who became a celebrity when his picture was taken bringing the body of a one-year-old girl (Baylee Almon) out of the rubble, and the mother of the child, Aren Almon-Kok, who also became a celebrity. Neither had any desire for such a spotlight to be shined on their lives, but modern media omnivorous in its appetite for visuality turned them into public figures. The fact that they handled this scrutiny, dare I say intrusion, into their private lives with grace during a time of trauma says much about the quiet dignity of many of those who had to deal with this act of homegrown terrorism. Linenthal, tells in this episode the interweaving of the toxic, redemptive, and progressive narratives in the lives of those at the Murrah building on the morning of April 19th.Toward the end of this account Linenthal discusses the process of commemoration of this terrorist act. Here he is concerned mostly with the public memory offered for all to see. He notes that in such instances considerable debate is necessary to determine hat exactly \\"is being remembered, who is being remembered, and the forms through which remembrance is expressed\\" (p. 195). Hierarchies of those who suffered found expression in the commemoration, discussions of whether or not to mention the terrorists who perpetrated the bombing also took place. And then, of course, there was the difficult process of deciding on the design to be employed in the memorial. What resulted was akin to a public park, and questions about its serene nature overcoming the horror of the event abounded. In the end, through a convoluted process of discourse involving huge numbers of people most agreed that this memorial was a fitting tribute to those killed, as well as those injured both physically and emotionally, in this terrorist attack. Its incorporation into the National Park Service ensured that it became a major part of the official memory of the United States.There is much to praise in this important book, and little to criticize. I recommend it as a fine case study of how we remember tragic events in the United States."},{"Title":"The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory","review":"If you're looking for an introduction to the Oklahoma City Bombing, this isn't the book you want. The author is primarily concerned with the development of memorialization, and how the community processed an infamous tragedy. The information on the actual bombing (perpetrators, procedure, etc.) is minimal, and the author's approach is distinctly academic. The academic tone of the book is nicely balanced with personal anecdotes of survivors and family members, saving the book from being overly dry. Personally, I enjoyed the unique focus of the text, and believe that it would be useful for interpreting any memorial process."},{"Title":"The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory","review":"I mean, I'm not sure the feedback to be left in the process of purchasing a textbook. It arrived later than I expected, but the book itself has no flaws to speak of. It was at a reasonable price and I suppose that's all that can be said for a textbook purchase. Heyo."},{"Title":"The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory","review":"The 1995 bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City shook the nation and produced a modest flurry of books. This late addition fills in a few blanks that may interest specialists.A life of Timothy McVeigh might enjoy wide appeal, and terrorist plots have a gruesome fascination, but readers won&#65533;t find them here. Edward Linenthal, Professor of Religion and American Culture at the University of Wisconsin spends little time on the bombers and the explosion. He has written a history of ideas, an academic field in which the books may outnumber the readers. In works of this genre, the author first asks a question. Thus, was the bombing a senseless atrocity? Or was it an act one would expect in the U.S., a culture that glamorizes violence? Having asked a question, the author doesn&#65533;t answer it. He collects everyone else&#65533;s answer, assembling page after page of quotes from editorials, talk shows, pundits, politicians, clergymen, and academics. After recording these thoughts, the author draws no conclusions. The chapter ends. Another chapters introduces another question. Was God or Satan responsible for the catastrophe? Oklahomans are a conservative people, and there is no shortage of feeling that a federal government that keeps the Bible out of schools bears much responsibility. Ironically, clergymen are far more restrained than laymen in laying blame. Mostly, clergymen admit they can&#65533;t explain it.For years after the blast, the city argued vehemently over a proper memorial for the victims. The author considers this such an important controversy that he devotes half the book to it. With the memorial complete, I doubt if many residents of Oklahoma City want to read about the pros and cons of the design. It has even less appeal to anyone else."},{"Title":"August Gamble (RCMP Series #1)","review":"In the tradition of Terri Blackstock's Suncoast Chronicles, Linda Hall creates a protagonist of which more are needed in our world, both real and fictional--a Christian law enforcement officer. Roger Sheppard of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is called to the scene of a crime--the body of a well-known local drug dealer found in the dumpster behind a grocery store.

As Roger continues to investigate Tom Anderchuck's murder, he is constantly surprised by various facts, such as discovering that Tom was a recent born-again Christian who had begun to change his way of life. Roger also discovers that various prominent locals, including the mayor, regularly traveled to the USA to the little-known gambling town of Azuyo, Arizona. In addition, what connection does the mayor have with a small-time meat market in Chester, and what connection does the casino owner have with a small fruit orchard in California?

The supporting cast of characters is a truly fascinating one. The descriptions of places are vivid. Be they the homes of the obscenely rich or rundown slum dwellings. The intricate plot unfolds in a way that really holds the reader's interest with a couple of nice plump red herrings thrown in for good measure.As always, Marlowe himself is tough as nails and completely hard-boiled. Except that towards the end of the book, he surprises us by becoming sentimental. This uncharacteristic sentimentality is not directed toward either of the two female love interests. But rather toward a tall, violet eyed boatman named Red who helps Marlowe in his hour of need. You really have to admire Raymond Chandler for knowing just when to interject the unexpected.I would love to give Farewell, My Lovely 5 stars, but I have to deduct 1 star. The reason? I can't for the life of me understand what the killer hoped to gain by commiting murder in the first place.If Mr. Chandler were still alive, I'm sure he would address that particular concern in the manner of a college professor talking to a kindergartener. I can just imagine him saying: \\"Reality is not straightforward. Only in the world of fiction are motives clearly defined and unambiguous. My writing is meant to reflect real life.\\" {From The Big Sleep (1939)- \\"It had the austere simplicity of fiction rather than the tangled woof of fact.\\"}"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I finished THE BIG SLEEP in a few days and was so impressed by the book, I immediately bought FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. Another great novel by Chandler.The book begins with Marlowe being pulled into a barroom mishap when an ex-con is looking for his girl. Once Marlowe finishes with the police reports, he thinks his day is over. At the office he receives a phone call from a man who needs his help. The man asks Marlowe to accompany him to a 'business' meeting. This is only the beginning of a twisted mystery which Marlowe is faced with solving.Once again Chandler does a great job of weaving various stories and characters in an effortless manner which takes the reader easily through the mystery. I look forward to reading another Marlowe mystery...they are pure joy!"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler's creation, Philip Marlowe, is a character that has influenced modern fiction greatly. Without Marlowe the archetype of \\"private dick\\" would not carry the cultural weight that it does today. It is true that the plot lines of many Chandler works are contorted to the point of no return, but it is not the plot that counts. The reason why these books are so successful is because we the reader become enthralled by Marlowe and his immediate knowledge of all things that surround him. Because Chandler made Marlowe such a carefully wrought character, Farewell, My Lovely becomes an examination of the human character rather than a list of dastardly deeds committed by crooks without depth. Every scene is an interaction between fully developed characters. He defines himself in relation to the people and actions that whirl in and out of his life. Marlowe offers us plenty of insight into his opinion of his relations. Because he is such an endearing person we want to believe every word he says. He is a product of the LA scene where he works. We the reader build confidence in our hero because he is capable of sizing up any situation immediately. Slowly we learn to trust Marlowe's way of navigating the underbelly of LA. I truly enjoyed Farewell, My Lovely because Chandler forces through Marlowe an undeniable wit and charm. He will make you laugh and draw you into his brand of thinking about other characters. I wonder sometimes when reading Chandler about how Marlowe would size me up. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about interesting characters and loves a wry wit and dark charm."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I hated how 1940 racism suppurated in this story and nobody saw anything wrong with it.I didn't like how sometimes I didn't understand what was happening, but then neither did Philip Marlowe.By the time I didn't understand I was mesmerized by red neon flashing further and further across grimy hotel ceilings, the damp smell of sage in the canyons that flared my nostrils, the scraping of pebbles pulled by the ocean tide.I liked seeing how words can be magic.Here is a random paragraph (truly) about the same as you'll find on any page in this book: \\"After a while there was a faint smell of the ocean. Not very much, but as if they had kept this much just to remind people this had once been a clean open beach where the waves came in and creamed and the wind blew and you could smell something besides hot fat and cold sweat.\\"I loved seeing how paragraphs can also be poems."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Given Chandler's enormity I'm feeling (as I did with Austen) more like I'll be reviewed than him - and this is complicated by the fact that I've been too busy lately to get to the review soon after reading the book. Anyway, with these disclaimers I'll push on.Great stuff - Chandler really has his own voice, mood and characters. Indeed, he's quite self-conscious in this book, having Anne Riordan remonstrate with Marlowe about how he *should* have run and concluded his investigation in a more traditional and elegant fashion:\\"You ought to have given a dinner party ... and you at the head of the long table telling all about it, little by little, with your charming light smile and a phony English accent..\\"Marlowe responds for Chandler, \\"It's not that kind of story. It's not lithe and clever. It's just dark and full of blood.\\"Interesting that Chandler felt he had to justify his deliberate departure from the classic mannered English detective story - or was he just enjoying highlighting the contrast?And it's not *just* dark and full of blood: there's flirting, camaraderie, humour, honour, and even a romantic ending. Still, along the way Marlowe takes a hell of a beating given his somewhat inexplicable method - which involves identifying particularly dangerous individuals and locations and just walking in without preparation, protection or backup. If you somehow manage to still be breathing after they've pounded you for a while, you've got some more clues to your case. And you even get the (nice) girl on your own terms:\`You're so marvellous,' she said, \`So brave, so determined, and you work for so little money. Everybody beats you over the head and chokes you and smacks your jaw and fills you with morphine, but you just keep right on hitting between tackle and end until they're all worn out. What makes you so wonderful?\`Go on,' I growled, \`Spill it.'Anne Riordan said thoughtfully: \`I'd like to be kissed, damn you!'So who's reviewing this book - me or Chandler?Marlowe is a pretty cool pro, but anything but a schemer. He throws himself in the ring and improvises. He blurs the lines, liking some of the bad guys a bit much, being rough and coarse - but then bugging the good guys by showing he's read a bit and can show more chivalry than they do. And just what was going on with \`Mrs Grayle' and the midnight assignation which could have ended very differently:\`I bet it's fun to be played by handsome blondes,' Anne Riordan said. \`Even if there is a little risk. As, I suppose, there usually is.'I didn't say anything.He's quite a contrast with the cold, aloof (but still troubled) Sherlock Holmes. If getting involved might cloud his judgement a bit, hey, what the hell...Chandler has a knack for making his characters shine - Marlowe is actually a bit of a soft touch, he can empathise, and from his perspective we find things to draw us to them the way he is. An odd thing in his in other ways very bleak, rough world."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is such an amazing book. From the first page, this novel does what all Chandler books do-- transports you to a whole 'nother world, so real it feels like you're actually there. FML is such an awe-inspiring accomplishment for the immensely talented man of letters, Raymond Chandler. Most of the time I was absolutely floored, just sitting there with my mouth wide open, marvelling at his genius. Writing is hardly ever this good, and when it is, the great stuff usually isn't the abundance of the book (as RC's is), rather, it's in little snippets here and there. There must be a God, because Chandler's writing makes me realize the potential of us humans to transcend the ordinary and be what he is-- extraordinary. Not to mention that the mystery will have you guessing all the way through, and even without the cynical prose (yes, I said prose) which manages to be beautifully ugly and positively negative at the same time (I told you he was a genius), is excellent in of itself. So, I urge every person who hasn't yet done so to read Raymond Chandler. He is not just a mystery writer (which usually means sub-standard literature) but he totally, without a doubt, transcended the genre. I guarantee his writing will blow you away. His clever, cheeky remarks, his sarcasm, his minimalistic prose, his cynical outlook, the dames, the coppers, the criminals-- that and more is what you can look forward to in this masterpiece of the English language."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"For me the main pleasure of reading this novel derives from wisecracks zinging on almost every page. Here are a couple, plucked randomly:The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on.A bogus heartiness, as weak as a Chinaman's tea, moved into her face and voice.And here is another one, a shot at Hemingway, as Marlowe explains a corrupt cop why he keeps calling him by that name: \\"A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.\\"Hemingway may not be a great writer -- I'm not a big fan -- but he was a far better one than Chandler. That little charming fish story of his alone has (rightfully) much greater literary acclaim than all of Chandler's works put together.Still, Raymond Chandler is a pleasure to read. He has a tremendous gift for storytelling. The wisecracks, the colorful characters, and the snappy dialogue make reading this novel, as well his other ones a pleasant experience, especially on lazy, boozy weekend afternoons. Nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Being a fan of \\"modern\\" mysteries, I always enjoy picking up a \\"classic\\" such as \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"I,the Jury.\\" THis was my first Chandler novel. I won't say I liked this book as much as the others mentioned yet reading it made me think of a dialog line from the first \\"National Treasure\\" film where Nicholas Cage reads the Declaration of Independence and says \\"they just don't talk like that anymore.\\" The same holds true here; the characters, the way they talk, and the way a bottle of booze can take care of everything captures the time and makes you understand what made Chandler so revered up to this day.As so many great novels do, the story line is secondary to you getting engrossed in the time period, the city of Los Angeles, the hero(??), private eye Philip Marlow, and those he meets up with. As some have mentioned, the plot seems somewhat disjointed early on. It almost borders on Quentin Tarantino movie territory in that you have to wait awhile for a couple of separate incidents to come together in order to grasp the entire story. Marlowe literally stumbles into the middle of a couple of murders and the women, bad guys, and good guys that Marlow comes across makes for a sometimes confusing yet very interesting novel.A good novel but, for me, not as much fun as Spillane or engrossing as Hammett's classic work. Still, this is the kind of book you read, enjoy, and say as you are closing that book cover, \\"they don't make 'em like they used to.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I started reading Raymond Chandler after the author of one of my favorite new authors of last year, Richard K. Morgan, was compared left and right to him. The comparison was apt, and Morgan should be flattered, because Chandler is a genius.Farewell, My Lovely is Chandler's second book, and features his hero, Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed, hard-boiled private dick who is straight as an arrow. I had read that The Big Sleep, Chandler's first book, was his best, and that they descended in quality chronologically. But after reading this book, I know that is wrong. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time. not only is the wonderful noir narrative there, but the mystery is first-rate."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"If you like incomprehensible story lines, improbable plots and connections and an overtone of misogyny then this is your book.If not this is book best left unread."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Ah Chandler. And Phillip Marlowe his private eye. This is the second time for this novel, but it's been so long it was like reading it for the first time. The characters, descriptions, and plot are vivid and complex. Marlowe witnesses the murder of a bar owner in the black side of town (1940s LA) by a big lug ex-con, Moose Malloy. Malloy is in search of his lost love, Velma who used to sing here when it was a white bar. This simple set-up embroils Marlowe knee deep in connected crimes. Well done, by a master."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"The second Philip Marlowe novel written by Raymond Chandler, and also the second one read by me was already familiar to me, having seen two film versions. Therefore, this story was the first real introduction to the character (Robert Altman's version of The Long Goodbye bears very little resemblance to any Marlowe novel I've read).I walk away from a Marlowe novel with an incomplete understanding of all the intricate mechanisms of the plot and how they fall into place (although Farewell, My Lovely is more straightforward than The Big Sleep in that respect) although I leave the book fully cognizant of a world created in a specific time and place with a self-contained atmosphere and a self-contained and pulpishly poetic language.In Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe is trying to mind his own private eye business but somehow ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, somehow running afoul of crooks as well as cops. A simple case of tracking down an old flame for a massive ex-boxer turned convict is never going to be simple with Marlowe. His encounters with seedy crooks, smugglers, dope peddlers and gambling joint operators provide the reader with a tour of, to use an overworn phrase, the \`underbelly of society.' With Chandler, the law enforcement officers and the laws of the government they are sworn to protect are often as corrupt as any of the pseudo legitimate businessmen/crooks.Culturally and sociologically, this is an interesting depiction of the U.S. in 1940. The racial attitudes are probably pretty typical of the time although aside from occasional uses of the n-word, Chandler doesn't exploit stereotypes as much as most of the films of the time period. Marlowe's attitude toward marijuana also seems to be fairly non-judgmental, unlike what one would expect of many of the law enforcers of that time.Marlowe is a collection of contradictions. On one hand, he can be as brutal and deadly as he needs to be although I don't recall him intentionally killing anyone. In this novel, I don't believe he kills anyone at all. On the other, he is sensitive to washed up losers such as Jessie Florian and he seems to want to believe that others are as principled as he is. Unlike many other popular private eyes, he seems at least somewhat cultured and even quotes Shakespeare on a couple of occasions. If one accepts the prose style as the creation of Marlowe rather than as simply the mouthpiece for Raymond Chandler, then Marlowe has a very poetic view of his world and describes it in metaphors that have been parodied to death and yet Marlowe has used the perfect set of words to describe what he sees.Chandler's plots have been criticized for their contrivance and implausibility. Implausible they may be, but plots are not why I read Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories. I'm reading them for the reasons I enumerated. I am reading them for the unique world view of a character who wears the necessary armor to do battle in a corrupt world and yet wants to believe in a world of chivalry and moral order."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler creates a world of grime and crime in his second novel Farewell, My Lovely. Protagonist and private detective Phillip Marlowe falls into a case when he's taken into an old nightclub with a large ex-con named Moose Malloy. Malloy is looking for his girl Velma, but it seems that the place has been taken under new ownership. Malloy winds up killing a man there, unable to control his temper, but that isn't Marlowe's only trouble. He goes along for the ride on a jewelry ranson deal where his client is brutally beaten to death. Things get stranger and stranger the more things happen, and plenty does.Even if you've seen any or all of the movie versions, you'll probably find yourself guessing to the very end. How? Because Chandler creates a world like no other, a world truly his own. He preferred Dick Powell as Marlowe in the 40s noir film Murder, My Sweet, an adaptation of this book.Chandler has an amazing grasp of the Marlowe character. Every line is distinct and memorable. Despite the lurid setting, you'll probably find yourself laughing at Marlowe's wit and sarcasm. This is no childrens' book, but it's an indulgent read.

I bought this solely for Ed Bishop being in it. It turns out I really totally enjoyed this book being dramatized. I have since purchased the other Marlowe plays available. I love the honesty, though brutal at times, of Marlowe's character. To me he is a dedicated, likeable guy who gets the job done and done well. For anybody who enjoys the old radio plays from years ago..this is a must for you. Any mega fan of actor Ed Bishop, (like me who totally fell in love with him years ago) this is also a must to own!

This novel reads like a Quentin Tarantino production where every one seems clich&eacute; cool, moves swift, and screams with devious intentions. The main detective Philip Marlowe knows the underground world around Southern California as he is initially recruited to find stolen jewels but ultimately stumbles upon a murder case full of twists and turns. Crime follows everywhere he goes as he meets gamblers, fraud, vixens, con men, prostitutes, poor, and rich. This books relishes in the criminal underground and that is exactly what makes this novel such an enticing read. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes of this book is the fact that Marlowe, like the rest of us, is not flawless. Rather than being the astute Sherlock Holmes, this gifted sleuth has normal problems which we all can relate to. He never seems invincible and always seems to be on the verge of trouble which ultimately makes the book more enjoyable. The only drawback is by the end of the book I had already guessed the criminal, but then again, I may have just gotten lucky."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely puts Chandler's detective hero, Philip Marlowe on the trail of Moose Malloy, a hulking ex-convict who's looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma. Marlowe stumbles upon Malloy as he tears up a bar looking for her. Velma had worked there when the bar had a white clientele. The place has the same name but is now for coloreds only. Molloy murders the bar's owner. The police are uninterested since the victim was a person of color. Marlowe looks into the case on his own initiative, even though no client has hired him to do so. A mysterious wealthy playboy hires Marlowe to be his bodyguard at a ransom exchange. Marlowe is knocked unconscious and his client is murdered. The story proceeds from there with all the loose threads being tied together at the end. There are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense.Bay City is a fictitious town abutting Los Angeles where a good part of the story takes place. It is a haven for crooked cops, corrupt politicians, quack doctors, phony psychics, and illegal casino gambling. Marlowe makes a huge effort, risking his life several times, to meet Brunette, the mob boss that runs Bay City. That effort seems worthwhile only in hindsight. The climactic confrontation between Marlowe, Molloy and the missing girlfriend seems contrived. All of that is unimportant. Raymond Chandler's novels are appealing more for their witty dialogue and clever metaphors than for their stories. Farewell My Lovely's best line describes Moose Malloy's girlfriend: \\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window.\\" Molloy himself is described as follows: \\"He looked as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\\" Pure genius."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"With smooth moves across the literary dance floor, author Raymond Chandler has his way with his partner, the fortunate reader. Without a word too much or too little, Chandler created a style both casual and elegant. His lead character in this work, private detective Phillip Marlowe, must solve a murder, one that is connected to gambling, beautiful women, guns and danger. If you like the sleek style of the 1930's or 40's, then this writer is probably the one for you.\\"She got out a gold cigarette case from her bag and I went over and held a match for her. She blew a vague plume of smoke and watched it with half shut-eyes.\\"Sit close to me,\\" she said suddenly.\\"Let's talk a little first.\\"\\"About what? Oh...my jade?\\"\\"About murder.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I recently listened to the unabridged version of this book narrated by Elliott Gould, and while Chandler's glimpse of 1940's era Los Angeles was surely entertaining, I still like Dashiell Hammett's \\"Continental Op\\" novels better. In Farewell, My Lovely, private dick Philip Marlowe starts out working for a barber on a minor job and unrealistically stumbles onto a murder by a hulk of an ex-con, looking for his old girl Velma in a club where she used to work. Marlowe then is mysteriously contacted out of the blue to provide security for a shady jewel transaction, in which a rich dandy is to attempt to buy back some precious jade from the thieves who stole it.The novel moves at a brisk pace, and while some of the plot twists seem a little forced, they are entertaining nonetheless. One of my main problems with the story is that Marlowe seems to spend most of the novel putting his life in danger, getting knocked out, shot at or drugged, without much of an incentive to get involved. He often seems to be acting on his own, without a paying client, despite warnings from the police to stay away coupled with the obvious dangers. Hammett's continental op, in novels like The Dain Curse, at least had a paying client ordering him to snoop into the multi-layered mysteries, with significant insurance money at stake.Ultimately, without giving away too much of the story, Chandler does a pretty good job of throwing a lot of balls in the air and wrapping up most of the loose ends by story's end. Some threads are left unresolved, like the whereabouts and motives of the mysterious doctor and psychic in Bay City, but most of the rest of the plot makes sense. LIke another reviewer said, at the end of the novel, while you may have enjoyed the ride, you are left with somewhat of an empty feeling.As for the narration, I expected a little more from Mr. Gould, an accomplished stage and screen actor who seems to sleepwalk his way through the beginning of the book as if he was handed a copy of the novel, a microphone, and told to read. He later changes pace a little, adopting different voices for different characters, but I found the voices ill-suited to the characters and sometimes caricatures of policemen or gangsters, as if the novel was a scene from a \\"Bowery Boys\\" episode."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Tough guy, hot woman that might leave you with a bullet lodged in your back, lies and double dealing all served up on a corrupt California landscape.

Usually it is when you think they will get away with it.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In this his second adventure, private detective Philip Marlowe - more or less in between cases - pokes his inquisitive nose where it doesn't belong. Encountering a behemoth of an ex-con, Moose Malloy, on the street, Marlowe follows the big man into a bar and witnesses a murder. And before the reader can ask, \\"Where's my Velma?\\" - the question makes sense when you read the novel - Marlowe finds himself embroiled in police corruption, a blackmail scam, chasing a gang of jewelry thieves, another murder and encounters a young female who becomes his pseudo-partner, a psychic con-man, a crooked doctor and is propositioned by beautiful young woman who is married to a much older and very wealthy man. All the while Marlowe attempts to keep tabs on Moose.If possible the plot/story-line of Farewell, My Lovely is even more convoluted than its predecessor, The Big Sleep. Marlowe meeting new players with each twist and turn of the investigation and getting physically bounced around on a regular basis. (For the politically correct there are a handful of racial slurs which may make the reader cringe.) But somehow the author ties it all together in the end with maybe a not so neat bow.This being a Chandler novel there are plenty of classic \\"Marlowe-isms\\".

I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun.\\"Ahhhh - to be Philip Marlowe."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chander's second novel is both more and less successful than his first. THE BIG SLEEP suffered from a plot that fell apart in midstream; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is much more consistent throughout. On the other hand, for all its twists and turns, THE BIG SLEEP was quite plausible; FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, however, is about as farfetched as you can get. But once again, such criticisms are almost beside the point: the great attraction is still Chandler's knock-you-flat prose, his tone of voice, his often imitated but seldom equaled style, and it is so powerful that it keeps you turning page after page after page.In general, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY once more finds street-smart and super-savvy California P.I. Philip Marlowe sticking his nose where it has no business being--and when curiosity leads him to follow a massively built white man into a black nightclub he finds himself embroiled in a murder no one cares about solving... at least not until it begins to figure in what seems to be a completely different case with a high-society spin. And encounters with stolen jewels, a spiritualist racket, police corruption, and a gambling ship quickly follow.Along the way Chandler again paints a gritty portrait of the seamy side of life. On this occasion, he takes a passing look at race, and makes the point that from a police point of view two standards apply: the authorities care nothing about the murder of a black man, but they treat a white man's murder very differently indeed. This portion of the novel is intrinsically controversial, for Chandler uses the slang and racial slurs common to the mean streets of his era--but it is worth noting that although Marlowe uses the same language, his attitude toward the blacks who appear in the novel is considerably different from that of the authorities, who could not care less about the murder of a black man who don't much care who knows it. And once again, Chandler graces his pages with dames and dandies, broads and bums--and he makes them live with remarkable vitality. The famous prose is as rich as ever, although noticeably less witty and quite a bit darker than that found in THE BIG SLEEP. We've stepped off the curb and into the gutter, Chandler seems to be saying, and we're walking in it all the way. Impressive stuff and a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell My Lovely, Raymond Chandler's second novel in the Philip Marlowe series, transcends the genre it helped to create, and is now (deservedly) viewed by many as literature and as social criticism.Chandler creates moods and telegraphs emotions via the poetic ramblings and outrageous similes from the mind of Philip Marlowe, the protagonist/detective/narrator who is picked up by the collar and dragged into a murder mystery that exposes not only the hypocrisy beneath the surface in the lifestyles of the rich and beautiful, but ultimately, the depravity of the human condition. And all of this is delivered with a caustic sense of humor, a wry wit, and a hypersensitivity to the visual world and it's translation into the language of the mean streets.Although Chandler died shortly before I was born, I grew up in L.A., and I can say that the L.A. Chandler wrote of is in many ways the city of my childhood memories, so well did he capture the ambiance and ambivalence of the 'city of angels'.Some have criticized his plotting and plausability, but emotion, action, and detail were what interested him the most, and in these he excelled. FAREWELL MY LOVELY must be viewed within the context of it's era (published in 1940) to be fully appreciated, but the flow of action, the visual aspect of it's language, and the insights into the very human conflict of corruption verses conscience are timeless.This book, like the first in the Marlowe series (THE BIG SLEEP) was written at the height of Chandler's creative career, and exemplifies the style that has made him a writer's writer, possibly the most imitated author of the past century."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler was such a master at his style of prose that you only have to read the first two paragraphs of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY to know exactly what sort of story you're in for. Those two paragraphs perfectly set up the plot that follows: a thriller crossing in and out of the racial divisions of 1940's Los Angeles involving seedy speakeasies, and off-shore gambling, with double-crossing as far as the eye can see. Wonderfully gritty stuff.This particular Chandler novel has a lot going for it. The hero, Philip Marlowe, is as entertaining as ever. The setting is the familiar scene of other Chandler stories -- alive, heavy and oppressively Los Angeles. The plot is logical, but jumps around a lot, which is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the more it moves around, the more room Chandler has to incorporate evil-doings; I quite lost track of exactly how many crimes are committed or alluded to during the course of the book. No matter how farfetched it is, Chandler's prose is utterly gripping and absorbing.I think Philip Marlowe must drink his weight in cheap liquor several times over during the course of this adventure, but you can't help but like the guy. He punches, he shoots, he boozes. He even solves the case by the end. He sure takes a beating in this one, but he keeps coming back for more. He's everything a pulp detective should be - angry, arrogant, determined, and with just a hint of pathos to make him interesting enough to carry the story.The book as a whole is just too appealing and entertaining not to be a fun experience. Chandler is pretty much the benchmark for these sorts of stories about guns, police, and corruption, so if you like the genre, you might as well read the man who invented it. Tough guys yelling, \\"Beat it!\\" at each other might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Chandler is so good as telling the story that any inadequacies in the conventions of this genre are wallpapered over with some slick dialog and snappy comebacks.I read FAREWELL, MY LOVELY more for the great atmosphere and tone than for its overall plot. The fact that the storyline wraps up nicely at the end is merely a bonus. But the real way to enjoy this book is to just let the atmosphere, the characters and the prose just wash over you."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Only THE LONG GOODBYE merits higher place in the shining canon of prose-poet Raymond Chandler. This violent, shabby, hilarious, and ultimately very moving novel rockets P.I. Phillips Marlowe through the darkest, seamiest side of Chandler's textured world Los Angeles. In no other novel does Chandler's razor sharp and witty prose slice so sharply, and his sense of tragic irony (&quot;It isn't funny that a man should die, but it is funny that a man should die for so little&quot;) reaches its zenith. Hard to put down, impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is the second Raymond Chandler novel I have read after \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I rarely ever read fiction but I can not overemphasize how much I enjoy reading Chandler's novels. These stories are most definitely NOT \\"page turners\\" and I mean that as a compliment. A \\"page turner\\" leaves the reader in suspense about what is going to happen or what is going to be revealed, often leading me, at least, to superficially scanning much of the prose in order to move ahead more quickly. There is some of this suspense in \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" (actually more than in \\"Goodbye\\" which spends more time philosophizing) but it is in taking every sentence as it comes, rolling it around in your mouth and savoring the flavor that gives the real pleasure in these novels.What particularly stands out in this story is the shades of gray of everything. Whereas many detective stories try to fit all the pieces together at the end and show us good guys and bad guys, Chandler's protoganist PI Philip Marlowe sees the world in shades of gray. He doesn't attempt to get to the bottom of people's motivations, and that includes himself. At the beginning of the story, he sees a big white man enter a black nightclub and then sees a black man come flying out the door. For no apparent reason, and admitting that it was none of his business, Marlowe goes in to see what is happening and gets drawn into the mystery. We see people commit murders and yet Marlowe feels that they are not \\"all bad\\". Marlowe encounters some policemen who are good, some who are bad and some who are in the middle. In the end, Marlowe figures out more or less what happened, but admits there are holes in his theory, and he can't completely explain why the characters he encountered acted the way they did. This is the way the real world operates and Chandler/Marlowe is telling us to be honest with ourselves and to admit that we often don't know why we do the things we do and whether we are being really consistent.I find it interesting to note that although this story was written almost 70 years ago, it shows a world that is pretty indistinguishable to our own. The story does not seem \\"dated\\". We see the materialist Los Angeles society that I grew up in during the 1960's and 1970's, and the type of people who live on its fringes. The only jarring note I encountered showing the changes in technology since 1940 was when Marlowe mentions he saw an \\"ice truck\\" parked on the street. Well, I guess time does move on.In closing, this novel has one of the most famous Chandler-quotations of them all: \\"I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and a gun.\\""},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"The tough-as-nails writing of Raymond Chandler has overtaken mysteries to so great an extent that it's easy to forget his role as a trailblazer. 'Farewell, My Lovely,' just Chandler's second novel, already burns with the rot of Los Angeles that spawned countless other imitations and had a far-reaching effect on both crime fiction and moviemaking over the next thirty-five years.'Farewell, My Lovely' is a typically Chandlerian novel, using first person narrative and a slew of characters. Thirtyish private investigator Philip Marlowe starts with a dull case, before he gets pulled onto the scene of a murder at one of Los Angeles's Afro-American bars. The huge, White assailant Moose Malloy has recently left prison and is searching for his lost girlfriend. Marlowe finds himself beside a dead body and a load of curiosity. Helping with police investigations, he enters a labyrinth of the Los Angeles underworld, including crooked cops, hot blondes, swindling psychics, and racketeers.Chandler's storytelling in the first person narrative of Marlowe is hard-boiled crime before it took on clich&eacute; status. The writing style is crude by necessity; found here is the private detective's rough and cynical attitude that influenced later antiheros like Peter Gunn and the noir style that dominated Hollywood movies. Besides several adaptations of Chandler to the big screen, other directors have paid homage, such as Roman Polanski in 'Chinatown' and David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet.''Farewell, My Lovely' is a well-constructed novel, but not without flaw. Chandler lets none of the characters go to waste, each holding a pivotal role in Marlowe's detective work. This novel stays consistent with his first project, 'The Big Sleep,' in having Marlowe revisit the same territory of earlier chapters. There is no predictability at all and Chandler creates genuinely tense moments.Marlowe, however, is steered by chance far too often and there are times when the action seems contrived, or without inevitability. The easy-going narration helps to smoothen over farfetched elements, such as the unlikelihood of Marlowe getting shoved into Moose Malloy's bar brawl, which is needed just to launch the story. The climax is also rather disappointing, taking place in an unimaginative location.While dealing with the social realities of 1940s California, Chandler's novels still need to be considered as great entertainments rather than full-fledged literature. The novels make generalizations about human life but are mostly driven by plot. It is pulp fiction of the highest rank: well-written, often humorous, and highly dependable. This novel, like others of Chandler, should hold its place in the detective genre for ages to come.The Chandler novels have been republished in an attractive collection by Black Lizard, the crime subsidiary of Vintage Books. 'Farewell, My Lovely' is 292 pages long, in a nice art deco format. Imperfect but highly entertaining, the novel is a must for crime fiction fans."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"From the first paragraph to the last, I was held hostage by Chandler's writing. The action comes at you faster than a bouncer's fist and is just as relentless. This was the first Chandler book I'd read and though I'd heard a lot about his stature as a noir writer, I have to say he did not disappoint in the least. Marlowe is a man's man. He doesn't back down from a challenge, he enjoys the women he likes, dismisses those he dislikes, fights the good fight, and he always tells it like it is!I worked my way through Hammett, Thompson, Mosley, and others, and now it looks like I'm going to work my way through Chandler."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In &quot;Farewell, My Lovely,&quot; Raymond Chandler's second Philip Marlowe novel, Marlowe reluctantly agrees to help a careworn police detective search for a nightclub girl named Velma, a former girlfriend of an ogreish ex-convict named Moose Malloy who is wanted for murder. Marlowe's first lead is the nightclub owner's widow, whom he plies with liquor, only to find out that Velma's whereabouts are being kept a guarded secret. Then, in what initially seems like an unrelated subplot, Marlowe is hired by a man who wants &quot;backup&quot; while he delivers money to some jewel thieves. The man ends up murdered, and Marlowe meets a mysterious girl at the scene of the crime. To think there's no connection between this event and Velma's disappearance would be to underestimate Chandler's genius at plot construction.Chandler cleverly plants false leads to twist the already unpredictable plot and subtle clues that make sense at the end. His colorful characters are masters of deceit; the reader imagines that these people must have great poker faces. They know a lot more than what they're telling Marlowe, and it's exciting to know that Marlowe will eventually be able to guess what they're leaving out. Like J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, Marlowe is one of literature's greatest magicians; the fun of reading the book is waiting for him to pull the rabbit out of the hat at the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's \\"Farewell My Lovely\\" we see the stereotypical detective, sitting in his detective agency, at his desk, looking out of a rain-streaked window, pondering something, something we will probably never figure out. The detective here is Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator, and he is presented with what seems like a simple jewelry theft case. Marlowe, with his wit and charm, instead confronts crooked cops, fraudulent psychiatric hospitals, blackmailers, con men, and beautiful and deadly women. Marlowe jumps, almost literally from situation to situation. Each scenario is highly entertaining, but a little difficult to believe. Either Philip Marlowe manages to fit thirty-four action-packed hours in one day or I don't know what. It's interesting how witty the character of Marlowe is and how unaffected he seems to be by all the events going on around him. Even when he is beat up, drugged, and almost killed, he gets up, and carries on. It is difficult to determine whether or not he does this solely for the money, or if he feels he has a personal investment, or perhaps desires the glorification. Chandler incorporates wonderful descriptions of sunny Los Angeles into his novel as we follow Marlowe around the city chasing after people, details, and a solution. He also uses a great amount of similes and metaphors, comparing everything to some strange seemingly unrelated object. Yet, when it comes down to it, this quintessential detective mystery fulfills all my requirements for a good book and left me guessing up until the end."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"With the exception of Charles Dickens, has any writer has more influence on narration than Raymond Chandler? Dozens and dozens of writers -- not always crime writers -- have tried to sound like Philip Marlowe. Dozens of movies have featured Philip Marlowe-like narrators, including the theatrical release of BLADE RUNNER, where Rick Deckard sound nothing so much as a 21st Century updating. And perhaps there have been even more parodies. Either way, we all know what detective narrators are supposed to sound like, and we know this because of Raymond Chandler.Raymond Chandler did not invent hardboiled detective fiction. He essentially took Dashiell Hammett's invention and focused nearly all his attention on prose style, character, and detail. There is an almost tactile quality to many of his stories, to the extent where you feel you could almost reach out and wipe the dust off a desk with your finger. There is, also, an almost wanton disregard of plot. If you read Raymond Chandler for plot, you are misreading him. I'll admit that in several of his novels I'm still unclear what happened. But who cares? The brilliance is in the texture, the detail. Take smell. Read virtually any other detective, crime, mystery, or hardboiled novel and look at how often other writers mention smells and then look at Chandler. He is constantly telling you what places smell like, whether mesquite or sage or sandalwood or whatever. Chandler wrote with heightened senses. I frankly can't get around to caring that his plots aren't very tight because other things absorb all my attention.FAREWELL, MY LOVELY is one of my favorite Chandler novels, perhaps only behind THE BIG SLEEP and his flawed masterpiece THE LONG GOODBYE. It featured many of his most memorable characters, especially the doomed Moose Malloy, and many of his most unforgettable scenes. Because of Chandler's ability to sketch a scene in such astonishing detail, there are scenes in his books that are as easy to visualize as it is a scene in a movie. He is that vivid and precise in his depiction. A great example is Marlowe's visit to Mrs. Florian in his search for Velma. It would be a person of very poor imagination who didn't get a strong sense of what her house looked like, smelled like, felt like.This is also one of his best books because it is one of the most tragic. The end of the novel feels almost like the end of Hamlet, with nearly all of the major characters either dead or at least shattered. And like with most of Chandler, there isn't an overly nice resolution of the mystery, whereby the detective magically makes everything nice and tidy and correct. Marlowe gets to the bottom of things, but often what he finds when he gets there is an abyss. And speaking of Chandler's influence, can one imagine the end of Raymond Polanski's CHINATOWN without Marlowe?As a side note, there have been two very good film versions of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY. The first was made by RKO while Chandler was still alive and was originally released with that title. It tanked at the box office, mainly because it starred former Warner Brothers boy crooner Dick Powell. His style of musical had gone out of style and no one wanted to see what they assumed was a musical. So RKO renamed it MURDER, MY SWEET, which obviously could not be a musical, and re-released it. It was a box office success and was crucial in launching the second half of Dick Powell's career, this time as a serious dramatic actor. Chandler himself was horrified at the casting of Powell as Marlowe, but later proclaimed that he thought Powell was outstanding in the role. By the way, the person that Chandler himself thought would have made the ideal Marlowe was Cary Grant. The second version of FAREWELL, MY LOVELY was released in 1975 with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe. With apologies to Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum is my favorite Marlowe. He was a tad too old for the role, but apart from that he absolutely nailed the cynicism and latent nobility of Marlowe. My only regret is that Mitchum didn't begin making a string of Marlowe films when he was 35. As it was he was too old in his second appearance as Marlowe in a bizarre version of THE BIG SLEEP set, of all places, in London."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This review is for the CD version of Eliot Gould's reading.I love Chandler's writing and have read &quot;Farewell&quot; at least four times. Gould does a good job of reading it, too.What's frustrating about the CD version is that the disks are not indexed. There was no effort to make a disk begin at the beginning of a chapter, for instance. Also, each disk holds one track only. That means if you want to pause for the night at the end of chapter 5, good luck finding your place when you return to listening in a few days.Breaking the audio into tracks is a very easy thing to do, so primitive a technology that it makes it seem that this CD box set was mastered in the 1980s.There is no competing product as of June 2003, however. Devotees may want to make their own MP3 files and then donate the CDs to a library."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely is one of several Philip Marlowe detective stories from Raymond Chandler known for their smokey, 1940s L.A. feel. Philip Marlowe is the private eye whom ladies love, but he seems to be more interested in solving extremely bizarre crimes (and not getting paid for his time) than in romance. Sometimes Raymond Chandler does a brilliant job in building a story around the Marlowe character, as he did with The Lady In The Lake. However he misses the mark with Farewell, My Lovely.Why? Hmmm, let's see. Well certainly the story scores well on the bizarre-ness scale. Marlowe finds himself in a pickle complete with killers, boozers, psychopathes ... the usual lot. But Raymond Chandler does a poor job with building on these characters; there are simply too many of them with only cameo appearances. The author fails to give his Marlowe character much to do other than waltz into one improbable scenario to another. Naturally in the end the story comes together, sort of. But Farewell, My Lovely sadly falls into the &quot;curious but forgettable&quot; category of mystery novels.Bottom line: Raymond Chandler on a bad day. Passable entertainment."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler, an everyday detective, Marlowe, gets wrapped up in a hermeneutic search that could eventually cost him his life. Everything he does affects what will be and, in turn, he winds up changing the course of his search as he becomes caught in its very tentacles. Leading from one murder and scandal to another, this mystery novel addresses corruption and deceit in all of its forms. While it is occasionally difficult to understand because of Chandler's creative habit of inventing new detection slang, it yet creates for an engaging read as it keeps readers in suspense and \\"in the dark\\" until the climax of the book, during which time everything is revealed. More than many other detection novels, this one follows a more Sherlock Holmesesque method of detection by revealing and explaining all in a very short, descriptive, \\"aha!\\" type of moment, which is exciting to the reader who has been trying to solve the mystery all along.However, while the eventual mastermind turns out to be a cunning, selfish woman, the overall portrayal of women in this 1940's novel is daunting. Although often depicted as intelligent, they are also often depicted as needing and revering men. Furthermore, Marlowe's sarcastic confidence and desire to rescue women just gives an overall bad taste to the novel as he looks at women as burdens, sex objects, and inferior beings. In fact, he doesn't very highly esteem African Americans, either. In conclusion, while this book is an interesting read, it is too great a reminder of gender and racial inequalities to be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Hooray! I finally found a classic crime noir novel that I really liked...This is book #2 in the Phillip Marlowe series. Marlowe bumps into a huge man named Moose and unwillingly sees him murder a man while trying to find his lost love. That is the beginning of a fairly complex, well plotted story.Book #1, The Big Sleep was also well done, but what was missing for me was a glimpse of the human, softer side of Marlowe. This book filled in the missing pieces with the aid of a genuinely good woman. Marlowe's ability to see her good qualities rounded out the tale for me - I got a little of everything I needed to enjoy it.I have to say, there's a lot of prejudice in these books. I suppose it was more common for the time period, but I'm hoping I never get used to it. And there's slang that I don't understand, but I'm catching on slowly. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Dodgy dames, crooked cops, one charlatan, one Moose and plenty of booze.Philip Marlowe is a pretty bright tough guy private eye in Los Angeles, when he is hired to be a bodyguard on a very strange assignment involving supposedly a jewellery ransom buyback.He is soon crossing paths with various police departments, the rich and powerful, and crimelords, not to mention saps and drugs, as this book improves throughout with some entertaining phraseology."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Chandler is great fun to read. He structures his sentences and paragraphs with such metaphoric precision that he turns the mundane crime noir into literature. His hero is none other than perhaps an alter ego of Chandler himself Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is the straight talking, honest PI that will not accept any money until he is on the case and everything is legit. I wondered as I read this if Chandler didn't wished he could live his life in the honest and opened fashion of his hero. In \`Farewell, My Lovely\\" Marlowe searches for Velma a nightclub singer and love of ex-con Moose Malloy. Murder, dope dealers, gambling ships, femme fatales and the always questionable police keep Marlowe on and off his toes.This is another of Chandler's canon that is worth adding to the reading list."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search for the inevitable \`missing woman' (\`dame' for the non-politically correct types) of an ex-convict who will not take no for an answer. And a \`missing woman\\" who wants to stay missing and will not take no for an answer. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned \`dame' that caught me off guard. Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in pursue of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. As always with Chandler you get high literature in a plebian package. Read on."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Farewell, My Lovely was my first Raymond Chandler experience, a novel I first read back in junior year of high school, and one that will forever be known to me as the novel that defines noir, hardboiled detectives and gumshoe novels.In this classic, detective Philip Marlowe gets hired to recover stolen jewels, which in turn has him running into the rogue gallery of gamblers, con men, crooked cops, and (of course) femme fatales. With this said, the story is completely character-driven, making it full of action and narrative. Just flip the book open to any page, and you'll clearly read slick, muscular dialogue and snappy comebacks. Chandler is a benchmark author for stories stripped of any literary fat.Besides Dashiel Hammett, Chandler is the perennial writer of gumshoe detectives. And Farewell, My Lovely is the perennial gumshoe novel."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Marlowe is in a tough spot. A hulking behemoth who murders some folks and loves others is on the prowl, and Marlowe sets out to unravel a twisted tale of crookery. Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot? The book is beautiful and the prose is blossoming with unusual and evocative images. Chander ranks as one of the great American masters of prose.Read this and weep..."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This novel is simply the best detective novel by the best writer of American detective fiction. Yes, the plots are zanily convoluted, but you don't care, for two reasons: Chandler's stunning prose mixing wisecracks and brilliant images, and Marlowe. Imperfect, human, jaded, but when it counts, Marlowe always comes through."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Raymond Chandler was the master of the hardboiled genre. The rich descriptions of the seedy side of pre-WWII LA is enough to make this book a winner. Our hero (Marlowe of course) gets drug into a bar and almost witnesses a murder, then gets hired by a rich playboy who drags him to another murder scene. He meets a spunky young lady, gets hired by a rich dame (to use the language of the genre), and runs into a pyschic and other strange characters. How does it all tie together? Does it even matter? Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Private Eye Philip Marlowe's curiosity for affairs that are none of his business sets him on a trail of murder, blackmail, jewels, women and a man who would always need a shave.Subsequent to Raymond Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep, this second installment from Chandler oozes class and atmosphere that is absolutely unparralelled.Farewell, My Lovelly is a book that grips the reader from the first paragraph and where The Big Sleep slacks and breaks apart in the middle, the book picks up the pace with astonishing prose, particularly the way in which Chandler starts and finishes a chapter makes it hard to set the book down.Marlowe gets involved in a case of murder involving a man named Moose Malloy who is searching for his old girfriend. The poilce take over the murder case and Marlowe is hired by a mysterious client for an evenings bodyguard work which ends in a nasty way.By the time Chandler had set to work on his second novel it is clear that his skills as a writer of detective fiction had improved and he was virtualy unparallelled and unstoppable.Chandler's character creations not only remain fresh and quirky, he has set the standard fom many more titles in the genre; The hard boiled P.I, the cop who is too dumb to fuguire anything out and of course the femme fatal. The key character Marlowe is a slueth on a trail he did not expect, Chandler writes with tremendous naturalism and his genius creation of Marlowe comes forth through the dialogue and attitude fully conveying his hard boiled persona.The prose and description furnish this book with undertones of classc dusty Noir which have become the benchmark for generations of writers and while the movie may have been a hit, it hardly compares to the book.I was lucky enough to stumble upon Farewell, My Lovelly through a reading list from my university and I was not dissapointed, the tension and themes along with the twists and turns leave the reader gripping their lip with thier teeth. The Big Sleep may have been the novel where Chandler broke out into the literary world but this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is my favorite Raymond Chandler book and that's saying quite a lot. It has a sense of mystery to it that transcends the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"A giant of an ex-con, bursting out of his costly, tasteless and ill-fitting clothes shows up at a nightclub one day, looking for his ex-girl, Velma, and takes Raymond Chandler's intrepid, wise-cracking detective, Philip Marlowe, along for a rather bumpy and dangerous ride, in this tale of crooked L.A. cops, gigolos, mediums, gamblers and gang betrayal. Moose Malloy is bigger then nearly everyone else and not overly bright but he is dead set on finding his Velma, last seen eight years before when Moose got turned into the cops for a bank job he pulled with some others. Marlowe witnesses Moose in action, while on a case, and gets sucked into the search for the big guy and his long lost honey by one cop while being warned off by another. But Marlowe is too bull-headed to do anything but keep pushing and, surprisingly, not particularly bright, since he keeps getting suckered and hit over the head and put at serious risk of his life. Situations he ought to see coming, as an experienced detective, he seems to persistently misread, perhaps because his liking for liquor has blurred his senses or maybe he just isn't a very good investigator. But, whatever the case, he stumbles on, from one life threatening situation to another. He also can't seem to get his arms around the fuzzy set of coincidences that follow hard on the heels of his run-in with Moose as he gets a job offer that anyone in his business with half a brain would walk away from . . . and then mishandles it badly. The seedy atmosphere of L.A. is very nicely handled and the characters sharply limned and convincing, but the perpetually soused Marlowe, with the self-defeating wise-cracks and nasty mouth is a little tiresome. I had a bit of trouble acclimating myself to the racist mindset that Marlowe and his cohorts present in this 40's milieu, too, since I thought it was somewhat gratuitous and even mean-spirited, but maybe that's how some folks thought in those days. More troubling was my profound sense that Marlowe was just not bright enough, or slick enough, to be a half-decent private eye. He seems, in this book, to have a death-wish, a bad trait for someone who hires himself out as bodyguard and investigator. He takes chances a green kid shouldn't take and never seems to see the blackjack coming. Still, he manages to stumble along, thanks to a combination of apparently undeserved good luck and just plain hard-headedness, until the cause of all his troubles unfolds itself before his and our eyes. Surprisingly, given his drink-induced obtuseness, he solves the mysterious set of coincidences that have led to so much murder and betrayal, and gets the girl who wants him though he's too tough to ever openly acknowledge wanting her. This was a very odd detective tale, if ever there was one, and yet, for all its irritations and flaws it kept me reading to a most satisfying conclusion that pretty much wraps the central problem up in an almost too-tight, neatly tied bow. Moose finds what he was looking for and Marlowe figures out how to find Moose and the killer of Marlowe's mysterious client is unmasked. Marlowe, of course, has another drink. -- SWM"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Oh how I wanted to hate this. It's racist, sexist, rude and absurd. But man oh man could Chandler write. He dragged me down into the seedier side of 1940 Los Angeles, and I couldn't get out until he let me go at the end of the book. The plot? Not so much to it in the end, really. Just a basic hunt for a killer who hunted for the girl he once loved. The twists and turns along the way just provided excuses for more wallowing in the seamy side of life--decadent rich, smelly poor, liars, cheats, and killers. If you asked me, I'd say it wasn't my cup of tea. But the man could describe everything from people to houses to a crawling pink bug in a way that kept me mesmerized. Read this if you want to know what hard-boiled is supposed to sound like."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"A hard-boiled detective novel featuring Philip Marlowe. A great read with a surprise ending. I really enjoyed Chandler's description of people and situations -- very colorful, like \\"he stood out like a pair of spats at an Iowa picnic.\\" At one point in the book the author has another character speak like Marlowe, whereupon he says, \\"that sounds like something I should have said.\\" not surprising how popular these became, along with the whole film noir genre. I can almost hear Humphrey Bogart speaking the lines!"},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Essentially, in this book, Marlowe just keeps getting his a$s handed to him in every way imaginable and you have to wonder what Chandler was thinking when our hero gets beaten down over the skull for the sixth, seventh and eighth time. I kept thinking he was going to die from internal bleeding or a serious head wound but instead he just pines for another long shot of whiskey.The story is actually a bit thin but still interesting. Historically, some have complained that this book bleeds into areas that have racist overtones and ideas, but it's a time-capsule look back into the past more than it ever will be a damning piece of evidence against Chandler. I' sure some literature of this day and age will be thought of as racist or troubled when read fifty or sixty years on.A long and tangled story, but a beautiful read full of some of the best dialogue between characters ever. It's no wonder everyone aped him in every other genre ever after. Chandler was as bold as he was blunt and could could write literature disguised as Noir Detective fiction better than anyone or since."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"It's nice to read a mystery novel without all the blood and violence that are part of today's fiction.

It is hard to choose which one is the best, because they are both so good. In this new adventure of his best character Philip Marlowe there are many more adventures, thrills and mysteries than in the first novel.In this second step of the noir literature, Chandler has built up and developed his style and characters, so he spends no time with that. The novel begins with plain action, and it takes only a few pages for the writer to set the main mystery of this narrative. Once it is done, he has all time in the world to make the weirdest people cross Marlow's path.Like in the previous book, the prose is dry, there aren't many descriptions --only of some characters, but nothing that evocative-- and it is not a bad thing. by using such a device Chandler is able to write non-stop action making the main plot more and more intrincated, until its solution. A great book, highly recommended to readers who like mistery novels of high quality and beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"Can YOU feel the pain from a right hook thrown in a darkened alleyway at 2:00 a.m. on a cold April Thursday, or the well-worn warmth of a ragged wool carpet runner tacked to the seventh floor of a well past acceptable rent-up in pre-war Los Angeles against the leather shoe sole, or perhaps your face?

He notices a big man walk into double swinging doors, almost immediately a youth is thrown through the air into the gutter. Marlowe looks in, and is taken upstairs by Moose Malloy. More violence breaks out while Malloy searches for Velma. Marlowe calls the police to report the problem. The police lieutenant strongly suggests that Marlowe should look for Velma. Marlowe gathers information, and looks up Mrs. Florian, wife of the now dead owner of this bar. Mrs. Florian says that Velma is dead, and gives Marlowe a picture of Velma. Marlowe gives her his card, and reports back to Detective Lieutenant Nulty.When Marlowe returns to his office, he gets a phone call hiring him by a stranger to act as his bodyguard. Marlowe accompanies Marriott to a deserted country spot to pay off a jewel thief. Marlowe leaves the car to make the payoff, but nobody is around. When he returns to the car he finds Marriott dead. A young woman shows up and gives Marlowe a ride to his car. Marlowe returns to the West Los Angeles police station to report another murder.Marlowe continues to gather more facts. Marlowe has meetings and adventures in pursuit of the truth. The story effectively exposes the crookedness of Bay City politics, and the corruption of the rich and powerful. The ending seems tacked-on to meet the moral conventions of the time: nobody gets away with murder, not in fiction. The author sort of admits this in the last chapter: \\"we'd never have convicted her\\". If the trial and scandal hurt her older husband, she'd be a rich widow. If not, they could move away from this scandal and notoriety."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"After reading &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; I knew that I was going to read more of Raymond Chandler. After reading this book I know that I will continue to read even more.A very interesting and entertaining crime yarn. I will give it the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's crime world, everyone's got a gat (a gun) - even sickly old women (&quot;I feel like Death Valley&quot;) and nice daughters of former coppers. People are led to locations where their screams will not be heard. Drinking establishments are respectable if there hasn't been a knife fight in the past month.****Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, is looking for a case that pays. But the action starts when he's not on assignment. He follows a stranger into a &quot;Negro dinge joint&quot; for no other compelling reason except that it wasn't any of his business. The dinge joint turns out to be a homicide scene, and Marlowe continues to follow the case without a real client in sight. Even the police aren't overly-interested in his participation.****He's a smart-mouth. An almost-heel. He frequently talks to himself out loud. Sometimes he hears a voice replying and realizes it's his own. This guy's a freak.****It's not hard to imagine how a recent writer like Jonathan Lethem could create a detective who has Tourette's Syndrome in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (Vintage Books, 1999). A detective is really just a man with serious quirks - he's also smarter than you think he is and likable enough to get the girl, at least for a little while.****Marlowe's a special brand of freak. He notices with exacting detail and describes in kid-like exaggeration what people wear. He fixates on the body musk of henchmen, the desirability of women, and a pink-headed bug crawling around an office.****There are &quot;agents&quot; in the universe - men with fluid positions that we merely call private investigators. Marlowe can fall into a scenario not of his creation. He can be as one character describes, &quot;a late comer to the show,&quot; but just in time to be in on the action. He carries the arc in a story and brings clarity. If he can't figure things out, there is no solution to be had.****&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is typical Chandler - tough, sardonic, thickly sliced but smartly dialogued, and oddly, funny as hell."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"The vague product description on Amazon may lead you to think this product is an audiobook of Raymond Chandler's classic novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, but it is not. It more closely resembles that of the radio programs of the 1940's-1950's, an art mastered by Orson Welles.The dialogue on this CD shows good character, though often a bit exaggerated; this is common in radio performances as you have no other means of conveying emotion but inflection of voice. The plot of the CD mostly follows the book, but much has been omitted. The background soundtrack contains sound effects and music, though the level is well-balanced in effort to reduce the amount of distraction from the dialogue.It is not substitute for the novel.Raymond Chandler's novel, _Farewell, My Lovely_, may be one of his most stylistically clever works. Brimming with sarcasm, repressed anger and sexuality, and criticism of both upper and lower classes, Chandler's prose makes any audio adaptation challenging. For those who love old radio programs, this will do for a few hours enjoyment."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This is the best book I have read in ages. I don't read everything start to finish. I like to be taken in, and to finish a book, I usually feel compelled to do so. This book had me eagerly flipping page after page. I couldn't wait to find out what would unfold next. It was the highlight of most of my recent days. Chandler's failed career as a romantic poet shows admirably in this prose. It's really beautiful, to the point, and not pretentious at all. It was fun. The pace was quick, and you are trying to put the pieces together with Marlowe as he brings you along. I don't usually read mysteries. With Chandler, I at least plan to read all of his. This is better than the best noir films. If you dig noir films and literature, read this book.

I kept looking ahead for convenient places to stop, but blew right by them instead. The combination of Chandler's pace and piquancy is simply irresistible.Farewell, My Lovely isn't the most believable of books, but just like The Big Sleep, it doesn't matter. Indeed, there's a tongue-in-cheek charm that peeks out quite often from behind the hardened facade. Chandler excelled at caricature. He danced on the edge of parody. But, he did it so exquisitely well that he detracted not a whit from the earnestness of the story.A paroled con comes back to LA in search of the woman he loves. Philip Marlowe, our protagonist, stumbles into the plot thus derived. Conspiracy and murder follow among the landmarks of the Los Angeles area. There's a magnetic pull to 40's-era LA and Chandler takes full advantage of it. Farewell, My Lovely is quintessential, it is provocative, and, in places, shamefully vulgar. And, still, I recommend it highly, because it is worth every bit of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"According to Wikipedia, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY (1940) was Raymond Chandler's second novel and created from three short stories--\\"The Man Who Liked Dogs\\" (1936), \\"Try the Girl\\" (1937), and \\"Mandarin's Jade\\" (1937). This makes a lot of sense to me, since Chandler's great creation, Philip Marlowe, seems more like a character from a short story than the deep and complex creation that a great novelist can achieve.Yes, Marlowe is certainly a well-defined in FML. He's a guy with high integrity, down-beat and droll, lyrical in his descriptions, relentless and lonely, and he drinks too much. But why is he this way? And what greater issues do his struggles touch upon? Here, Chandler offers next to nothing, unless you have a film-Noir vision of life and view all winners as corrupt and brutal. Instead, he stays small with Marlowe, a highly focused creation developed in short stories, who offers a perfect streamlined literary voice to tell a novel-length story of crime.This is not to say that Philip Marlowe is ever an uninteresting character in FML. But does he really have a very interesting mind? Take away his lyricism and the grouchy humor of his metaphors and his limits show--he's everybody's sour uncle, boyishly uncompromising, for whom things didn't work out.Of course, you can't really separate character and voice in fiction. And, Marlowe's voice, its absolutely uncanny metaphors and amazing lyricism, explains why Raymond Chandler, among hundreds of crime-fiction writers, is the guy I choose to read. (I'm usually bored by mysteries and crime fiction.) Here are just two examples from FML.\\"He wore a brown suit of which the coat was too small for his shoulders and his trousers were probably a little tight at the waist. His hat was at least two sizes too small and had been perspired in freely by somebody it fitted better than it fitted him. He wore it about where a house wears a weather vane...A tie dangled outside his buttoned jacket, a black tie which had been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea. ...He had a big flat face and a highbridged fleshy nose that looked as hard as the prow of a cruiser.\\"\\"Then there were no more houses, just the still dark foothills with an early star or two above them, and the concrete ribbon of road and a sheer drop on one side into a tangle of scrub oak and Manzanita where sometimes you can hear the call of the quails if you stop and keep still and wait. On the other side of the road was a raw clay bank at the edge of which a few unbeatable wild flowers hung on like naughty children that won't go to bed.\\"In FML, I also enjoyed the brief Hemingway parody and was surprised to encounter--SPOILER COMING--a multi-bullet suicide. This was something Martin Amis used to make a point about crime fiction inNight Trainwhere the narrator is, like Philip Marlowe, burned out but amazingly lyrical."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"In Raymond Chandler's second novel, Philip Marlowe gets embroiled in a complex plot involving murder and lost love.Marlowe's on the wrong side of town when he gets drawn into watching a murder in a bar that blacks frequent. As usual for this day and age - this is decades before civil rights, remember - the white cops brush it off as meaningless. Only Marlowe shows some interest in what is going on, and the lug of a man that desperately misses his lost love.Marlowe, pretty down on his luck and drinking hard, pries into the situation as much out of intellectual boredom as anything else. He's not after money, and indeed half the time he's not getting any. He's after making some difference in the world, no matter how small. He's after doing his part to help out those in need. These qualities of honor are taken up by many detectives who came after Marlowe, and are admired by millions of movie viewers who saw the movie version of this book.The gritty world that Marlowe lives in, the desperate state that many of the characters are in, the racism and disregard for the poor and drug use were all harsh realities of Los Angeles in the 1940s. In that swamp of despair roamed Marlowe, barely keeping his own head above water, but determined to do the right thing. It's his doggedness and his adherence to his own rules that make him a man to be admired throughout the ages ... and it's Chandler's brilliant writing style that brings this world to life.Those reviewers who cringe at the drinking, the despair and the racism should thank Chandler for bringing these realities into such clear view, instead of blaming Chandler for showing them a glimpse of a life beyond their air conditioned living rooms."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"After reading The Big Sleep, I was weary about picking up another Chandler book. I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books. And yes, that is true in his second book.Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe. Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm. Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre.At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I'm not much of a fiction reader, but I have just about everything Chandler ever wrote, including a copy of his screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot; Every couple of years I go back and read everything all over again. How many mysteries can you do that with?The thing is, of course, that you don't read Chandler for the mystery, which is just as well, because it's hard to figure out the story line in his books sometimes. You read, and re-read, Chandler because he created a whole universe in his novels - an image of a Los Angeles with a seedy underside, which suited perfectly the milieu that was associated with the town in the 1940's - the movie people and the parasites that lived off of them, the internal immigrants that flooded California from the Midwest during the Depression, the alienation under a bright sun. A lot of people got their image of California from Chandler.You also read him for the irresistable charm of his protagonist, Marlowe, the shopworn Galahad with the relentlessly absorbing internal monologue that has been imitated by everybody from Jean Claude Belmondo to Garrison Keillor. For a while, Hollywood couldn't get enough of Marlowe, and well into the 70's movies were being made of his books - several of them have been made into movies twice, including this one. I sometimes think that the Marlowe character appeals very strongly to men, or at least a certain type of men, and that's why so many actors - Bogart, Robert Montgomery, Robert Mitchum, and especially Dick Powell - really wanted to play him on the screen.The story starts out with Marlowe just walking down the street and not minding his own business, as usual, and ends up with multiple murders (some of them totally senseless), unspoken mistakes in judgement ( a favorite device of Chandler's) and a lot of unanswered questions. You always find yourself with a sense of brooding emptiness at the end of a Chandler book, a feeling that you've been through an incredible struggle to no purpose at all, and yet you're always glad you were along for the ride all the same.This may very well be the best of the Marlowe novels; it's in my top two for technical perfection along with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, although I have a personal emotional attachment to &quot;The Long Goodbye.&quot; My advice: try them all."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"This book is a good rather than a great read. The story got a little over complicated as Chandler tries to tie in and link too many threads - all connected to the gigantic villain Moose Malloy. There were times when I scratched my head a little despairingly as I tried to work out what these connections were. There were also times when sentences and paragraphs made no logical sense to me at all. I put this down to the language of the time but it did leave a feeling of bewilderment.However, I did enjoy this book and the character of Marlow is strong and amusing. His one liners did on occassions grate a little but nevertheless his overwhelming sense of optimism rang through and made me laugh.Although written many years ago - it still had quite a modern feel to it."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"While working a job that never pans out, PI Philip Marlowe is drawn against his will into a bar called Florian's by a very huge man. Moose Malloy has just spent eight years doing time, and he's looking for his girl Velma. Well, it has been eight years, and the bar's changed hands since then. The new owners and employees know nothing of any Velma, but Moose gets mad and someone gets dead, and Marlowe finds himself in the middle of something he never bargained for.Being a good PI, Marlowe calls the police, and the case goes to a fellow named Nulty, who tries to inveigle Marlowe into helping him solve it. Marlowe says he'll let him know if he thinks of anything, then decides to follow up on the Velma angle. He goes into a hotel near the bar, asking about the previous owner, and learns where the man's widow still resides. So Marlowe decides to pay her a visit.Mrs. Florian is a house-bound soul with a fondness for alcohol. It isn't hard to pry information out of her, armed with a bottle and a willingness to suffer being her drinking companion in order to get her to talk. The widow plays coy, but when she learns Moose is on the loose, she grows pale. Velma is dead, she says, so no use looking for her. Marlowe informs Nulty and goes back to his office.There he receives a phone call about a job, although the caller is being very vague and mysterious about what he's to be doing for his money. Money is money, so Marlowe gets the address and agrees to meet the client that night. His name is Lindsay Marriott and he lives in the better part of time. He wants Marlowe to go with him while he does something, but he isn't to be seen or do anything. Marlowe doesn't like that and makes no bones about it, and then he lays down his rules. It seems that Marriott is paying to retrieve some stolen jewelry--very valuable jade, to be exact. It was taken from a lady, and the thieves are holding it for ransom.Marlowe agrees to the job, for a hundred dollars, and instructions are received, along with directions. However, nothing is simple, and Marlowe gets sapped. By the time he wakes up, there's a strange girl there by the name of Anne Riordan, and Lindsay Marriott is deceased. Marlowe checks the man's pockets and finds something interesting--marihuana cigarettes in a cheap case. However, by the time the police arrive, those are no longer there.Turns out Anne's father was once police chief of Bay City, so she can't help but be nosy about what she's stumbled across. Marlowe finds her attractive in a more than pretty face kind of way. She returns the cigarettes she stole to him, and he makes an interesting discovery--hidden inside are the business cards of a local psychic, Jules Amthor. So Marlowe sets off to investigate.A dead man, an escaped convict, a missing girl, graft in high polices, a crooked doctor, gambling--all these things and more lie in wait for Philip Marlowe. The question is, has he bitten off more than he can chew, and are there people who are determined that he not find out the truth, no matter how they have to silence him?Farewell, My Lovely is the sequel to The Big Sleep. It's another great read from Raymond Chandler. I'm really enjoying Marlowe's adventures. He's not a super hero, he's just an ordinary guy, doing his job, and as such he's not beyond getting hurt--and he does, because he keeps sticking his nose where it isn't wanted.One thing to keep in mind when you read this is that it's a product of its times, much as Huckleberry Finn. Some of the terms used would be considered racist now, but they weren't then, so you have to realize that and either not be offended, or not read the book. Those don't detract from the enjoyment of the story.Chandler has a definite way with words that I enjoy. For example, in talking about Marlowe's first sight of Moose Malloy: \\"He was looking up at the dusty windows with a sort of ecstatic fixity of expression, like a hunky immigrant catching his first sight of the Statue of Liberty.\\" His description of scenery is also unique, pure Marlowe: \\"I got down to Montemar Vista as the light began to fade, but there was still a fine sparkle on the water and the surf was breaking far out in long smooth curves.\\"This story has a lot of twists and turns, and I didn't see the ending coming until it was on top of me. Raymond Chandler set the bar for detective stories, and he set it pretty damn high. I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries and detectives, and to those who haven't put your toe in the water, try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Farewell, my lovely","review":"I don't read a lot of thrillers and this is the first Chandler I've read. As many have said before, this is a step and a half above your average good thriller, the reason being the wit and intelligence of the prose, the elegance of the descriptions and the understanding of character which is compassionate, passionate and cynical all at the same time.His flip one-liners aren't just clever, but oil the wheels of the plot. Some of the references I couldn't understand, they belong to the period or the locality, but the plot moves along because the characters find common ground by means of their expressions in the shifting sands of what is acceptable and what is not in the way of behaviour.Another thing is that reading this is a bit like watching a film, Los Angeles comes to life before your eyes.On the downside there's a slight sense of not looking very far beneath the surface, it would slow the book down."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This sequel to Soulmates Dissipate was exciting to read.

After reading the fast-paced, interesting, drama-filled, exciting book \\"Soulmates Dissipate\\" the \\"Never Again Once More\\" was NOT a good book. It was slow and many times I thought...what is the point?I struggled to get through this book. It took me over a week to complete. I am going to continue to read the other books in the series, and hope it gets better.I'll let you know......."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I must start off by saying I did not read the first book and I don't intend too. I was really disappointed in the Character Jada and Wellington. They seemed very selfish. I was upset the Author made it seemed like they would not pay for hurting Lawernce and Simone the way they did. It was very unfair to them. I am use to African American Authors who give a more realistic approach to writing. When I'm reading the situations seems real and even the ending seems real. This did not happen with this book. To think that Jada and Wellington would just be living happily ever after seems more like a fairy tale than real life (I'm sorry this book was fiction, I have to remind myself). I'm glad I did not buy the book I just borrowed it."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Well there were so many things that made me stop reading this book, then pick it up again. First off, in this one, to me it seemed like no one aged meaning Jada or Wellington. Darius was what, 20 yrs old so that had to make them in their 50's but their language and the childishness of them both seemed like the writer forgot they were older than the first book. I felt like both Jada and Wellington forgot to grow up. If someone is your soulmate then why would you marry someone else, have a baby with someone else, have sex with someone else other than that person?? This book left me confused about soulmates."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I have all of the books in the Jada & Wellington saga. As I read the stories I continuously shook my head at the things the characters did. I don't think Jada & Wellington knew each other well enough to be \\"soulmates\\". Outside of the sack, they had nothing going for them. I was highly irritated at the fact that, although they were both still madly in love with each other and never stopped sleeping together, they went off and married other people! and don't even get me started on Darius. Regardless of the horrible logic the characters used Mary Morrison's books aren't that bad and might, just might, be worth your hard-earned dollars."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I enjoyed the story- Morrison is now officially on my list of favourite authors. I like the poetry in her books, and the fact that the lessons she tries to teach come out clearly. You never have that feeling of 'and the moral of the story is...?"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I enjoyed reading all of the books in the sequel of this story from beginning to end. Keep on writing these great books."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I liked part two to soulmates, but tell me why did it take so long when telling about the women in Darius life (the women on the job) I found some of the characters were boring and just plain simple. Ashlee I thought was the most interesting in Darius's life. I also thought that Jada jumped to fast after leaving in the first book. Well in the end it was a page turner and it ended to early I would loved to read more on Jada and Wellington."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BUT IT WAS COOL.

DivaBlack Book Club"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Have you ever ached for unconditional love? Do you hold your soulmate in your arms at night or in your dreams? The sizzling sequel to Soul Mates Dissipates addresses Jada's search for unconditional love and Wellington's ache for his soul mate. After twenty years, the magnetic attraction they shared in their early twenties still exists.In \`Never Again Once More', we catch up with a mature Jada and Wellington. They shed the brazen carelessness they enjoyed as young adults, embraced middle age with sophistication, and usurped parenthood with zeal. I really enjoyed witnessing the evolution Jada and Wellington experienced. Although they extended their best efforts to avoid chaos, Jada and Wellington still nurtured secrets and emotions that erupted, and caused distress for them and their extensions.The novel occurs over a 20 year span of time. It picks up at the end of Soul Mates Dissipates, and moves forward. I was initially very frustrated and confused with time elements. We were led back and forth through time, so occasionally I was disoriented and had no idea in which decade things were taking place. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the story, which is thick with the tension and drama that heightens your curiosity and stimulates anxiety. So, take care when you start reading because you may not want to stop until you reach the last page.-Reviewed by Miss Love"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This book was nothing like the first book.It has no storyline. It did not make any sense. This book really had me confused as to where it was going.I truly am dissapointed in the author and I hope she redeems herself in the next book."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Mary Morrison has done a terrific job on this sequel, you have to read Soulmates Dissipate first though. Jada (bka: Diamond) and Wellington are trully meant to be together, but circumstances that they created have separated them. They have allowed their inability to trully confess their feelings to one another keep them apart. They have found temporary satisfaction in Lawrence and Simone, but after time they can't deny what is really there. Mary Morrison has creatively told this story and you will be surprised at the events that take place. She is very descriptive, so you will be able to picture the scenary as if you were watching a movie... Oh and you will not see the curves or loops in the road coming... You have to read the whole book, if you scan or stop in the middle, you will be disappointing yourself. When it is all said and done, there is one question you will have to ask yourself, Have you found your soulmate? Also ask yourself would your answer be Never again? or Once more please? Also Darryl, Darrius, Maxine, Black diamonds staff, Melanie... all characters you need to get to know."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Mary Morrison you have done it again! I have been waiting on the sequel to Soul Mates Dissipate for a very long time. I immediately order this book before it was released and was not disappointed. I was surprised that you took the story over a 20 year period; however, in truth, I could identify because when you find that soulmate no matter what type of relationship you may be in with somneone else, you're always missing a part of your heart when they are not around.I loved the new characters, Darius, Lawrence, etc. I wanted you to dig deeper in the character of Darius/Ashlee. It seems like that could have been another opportunity for a &quot;soulmate&quot;. This book had it all, friendship, love, suspense, betrayal.Overrall this book was very very good.

You are one of Bourbon Street Bookclub's favorite authors."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Okay, I liked the series (of the ones I have read). I am admitting that I started from the ending of the story and working my way back. I have currently just finish reading NEVER AGAIN ONCE MORE. Where I am confused is with the time frame for the books. Darius (Jade's son) Is just born in this book and in his twenties in the last book. So, why is she making it seem like they are all in the same time frame. In this book she mentions breath strips and current basketball players when Darius is 9. Darius is still trying to be those players in the last books. Somewhere with the writing of these books the time frame were messed up real bad. Someone should have caught that before they were published. This book and the one before should have time period should have been long before his is 20 years old. Twenty years from now the last book should have been more with that time frame instead of the current time frame that is used in this book. It reminds me of the daytime soaps. You turn off one of those with a baby being born and the next day the same child is now five, by the end of the week the same newborn is getting married. So, you can say I am a bit confused on her writing."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Never Again Once More was a satisfying read as it tale spins into the selfish, drama filled life of Ms. Jada Diamond Tanner & her offspring.

Wellington turns out to be the knight in shining armor this go round and poor Lawrence is just something to do in the midst of Jada & Wellington sorting through their confusion. Great follow up to \\"Soulmates Dissipate\\" and I look forward to more sex, lies & drama in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"THIS BOOK WAS NOT BAD AT ALLIT WAS NOT GREAT BUT NOT BAD,IT STARTS OUT JUST WHERE SOULMATES LEFT OFF.

Morrison returns with the handsome and unforgettable Wellington Jones and his soul mate Jada \\"Diamond\\" Tanner for another round this time in Never Again Once More. Unfortunately for readers, Wellington is married to another as is Jada, but when it comes to matters of the heart these two make us wonder; does anything else matter?Some readers were disappointed with the break-up of Wellington and Jada towards the end of Soul Mates Dissipates, Mary B.Morrison's sister novel to Never Again Once More. I believe it is because of the readers' idea of what a soul mate is or should be. I enjoyed the book because it showed us how couples who are soul mates are not always put together at the right time.Never Again Once More takes us twenty years into Wellington and Jada's future. Emotionally time stood still for Wellington and Jada, but they learned to go with the motions learning to love others while the passion they held simmering slowly began to heat up and burn those around them. The time might not have been the most opportune for Wellington and Jada, but love takes no prisoners.The characters in Never Again Once More all had hidden desires that they masked by settling for less, until their hearts could hold out no longer. It's funny how the mouth verbalizes never, but the heart screams once more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; having the chance to meet with old characters from Soul Mates Dissipates and seeing their growth was a welcomed treat.At the beginning of Never Again Once More the time warping was a little confusing and I almost lost the story,but Mary B Morrison made up for it throughout the book, with her clear messages and well developed old and new characters that will tug at your heart...."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"great sequel!

Instead of accepting Wellington who she proclaimed she'd always loved she married Lawrence. Wellington just as crazy knew he might not have been Darius father but didn't care married Simone who he loved just not as he loved Jada, fathered her child only to divorce her and continue to drool over Jada.This could have been a better book, I believe in the power of love, and this is \\"so true\\" to fall for one person and wait a lifetime for them I just didn't like the way Mary B.

First, Jada is too old to be playing games like that, and Wellington is the definition of \\"a fool in love.\\" Darius was over the top (and his \\"just desserts\\" weren't good enough), and don't get me started on Lawrence...or Simone for that matter. Melanie was completely irrelevant to the plot line and her drama was, for lack of a better term, tacky. The author could have left her and Cynthia out of this one.I won't go into detail with the plot line because I don't want to give too much away. I will say that upon finishing the book, the reader will realize how pride and selfishness could lead to someone living a miserable life. After observing the characters and their actions from the first book to this book, I believe that the ultimate message is to simply be true to yourself and listen to your heart; You will be much happier and there will be much less stress. In other words: \\"go for what you know.\\"I'm giving this book 3 out of 5 stars, not because it was bad, but because there were certain parts of the story that didn't necessarily add up, coupled with Melanie's not-needed role.

Where &quot;Soulmates Dissipte&quot; may have rushed a bit through the lifes of it's characters, &quot;Never Again Once More&quot; gives us the substance behind each character giving you the ability to relate to them better. You can actually empathize with them and truly wanted to know....what's going to happen next??Never Again starts at the point that Soulmates end. Jada and Wellington still have heartfelt love for each other but still can not bridge their worlds to be together. As the years go on, Jada gives birth to a son Darius, marries a great guy and builds up her business, Black Diamonds. As for Wellington, he also hooks up w/ a Young lady and has a child.We see Jada's son Darius grow up to be a handsome young man with many talents but his womanizing urges may not only cloud his bright future but also may jeopardize his great relationship with his mother.All the characters from Morrison's first book are back but it's Jada and Wellington's suppressed feelings that are the star of this book.

YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY !!!!"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Well what can I say, Mary B. Morrison has done it again. Sequels usually [are not as good as the first book] but not this one. I was just as captivated with Never Again Once More as I was with Soulmates Dissipate. This book was witty, nostaligic, sensitive and emotionally captivating! I really became attached to the characters and sometimes felt as if I were living inside the book.If you've already read Soulmates Dissipate, I promise you...you will not be disappointed with Never Again Once More!"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I must commend the author for opening a broader spectrum of the characters and their lives, weaving a tale that eventually came full circle. My dissappointed could be my fault of immediate gratification, For I wanted the main characters to reunite immediately. Funny we can't always have the endings we want. Morrison brought to life these characters, and placed them in a world of relatable realities, often teasing the reader, and at times have us second guessing. Morrison showed that though we so often times use the term soul mates to interpret perfection, it is the truenuess behind the feelings, faults heartache and all that proves that love isn't always what we want what but what we make of it. When two souls are connected that connection can span a lifetime. Morrison hit the nail on the head a second time around. Never Again Once More is a must read!"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This sexy and provoctive novel is by far the best you will read this year. You explore the joys of love, success and great personal pleasures. You come face to face with your inner self and the pain that mistakes of the past may cause. We learn how to be true to ourself no matter what the cost. Love is only to be given if it is without conditions or stipulations. You will fall in love once again with Jada and Wellington and their passion for life, love, honesty and trust."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Mary Morrison has done an expert job of weaving a compelling story with steamy scenes to heighten the reader's senses. Life's lessons, as learned by the main characters here, truly show that when someone is your soulmate, no matter how far apart situations pull you, that person will still remain a soulmate. As the story unfolds, this fiction novel takes on a reality that anyone can relate to.Normally, sequels I've read have not lived up to original; in this case Never Again, Once More does the exact opposite. I enjoyed Soulmates Dissipate immensely, and having read it, made Never Again Once More an in-depth exploration of heart, mind, body and soul. You will not be disappointed with this book or any of Ms. Morrison's other works including: Who's Making Love? I will say that I am proud of Ms. Morrison's dedication to her craft and look forward to future novels.peace and love, light and joy.I also recommend Naleighna Kai, author of She Touched My Soul, More Than Enough, and My Time in the Sun"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"She's done it again! Mary B. Morrison is one of the most TALENED WRITERS I've read in years! This book is a continuation to Soulmates Dissipate, and I can not say enough about it..

It picks right up where Jada is leaving to move to LA and tries to start her life over with out Wellington in the picture. But the question is can she manage to do that when she meets her new love. This book covers so many years of their lives that it makes you want more even when the book has ended. Jada and Wellington will keep you going and waiting to see what the next page has to offer. When you are introduced to Lawerence you will fall in love with him , but still will crave for Wellington as must as Jada does. This book has drama written all over it. Jada's son Darius is a mess when he gets older, there is no telling what he would do next to get on top of the world or can I say on top of any woman. For those who have not read SoulMate Dissipate read it first and for those who are dying to see what happens to Jada and Wellington pick this book up now!!!"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I can say I really enjoyed the sequel of \\"soulmate dissipate\\" ,The plot is absolutely breath taking and Mary B Morrison s writing skills will keep u wanting more as u read page after page,Great reading!Big props to Ms Morrison!"},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This book, while being nice because it was a sequel, I found to be rather lacking and not really based in reality. I don't think there was enough character development...seems to me that all the character developing was done in 'they did this, they did that' instead of actual behaviors from the characters themselves. When reading a book, I'm not very interested in the name brand clothing and material possessions they have, I like characters that I can related to on a personal level - get into sort of. I don't know any guys that would behave as &quot;lawrence&quot; in respect to the main character &quot;jada diamond&quot;, but if you're into materialistic writing and the like, this book might be for you. The plot was good though."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I loved Never Again Once More. It is the second installment of a trilogy. I think Mary B.Morrison is an exalted author.This book is a page turner because it has an innumerable amount of drama. Never Again Once more is about a woman named Jada Diamond Turner's journey through life. Jada, the owner of Black Diamonds is faced with many trials and tribulations with her son Darius, her husband Lawrence, and her soulmate Wellington. During the book Jada has a secret that she has kept to herself.The choice she has made to tell everyone she loves has ruined all of their lives. I rated this book a five because I really enjoyed this book. I favor her diction. Her choice of words make readers have a connection with the characters. This is a divine book but I wish Cynthia, Wellington's mother had a bigger role.The only thing I disliked is that if you didn't read the first book, Soulmates Dissipate, then you will be fairly lost.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"If you enjoyed the first book, Soulmates Dissapate, you'll definitely appreciate how things turn out for Jada and Wellington, not to mention Melanie and Cynthia. It's not as explicit as the first, but just enough to keep you coming for more. I've already purchased and just finished reading 'He's Just a Friend' and I'm looking forward to 'Somebody's Gotta be on Top'.I have every intention of getting the others to complete the series. Ms. Morrison reminded me how much I enjoy reading. I feel certain that if people get this book, they won't be disappointed, but I strongly recommend starting from the beginning."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"This book was ok. It wasn't what I thought it would be compared to soulmates dissipate. A sequal is usually better. I still don't know what Darius looks like and plus the book skipped a lot of things like births and deaths that were all of a sudden just spun upon you in the middle of the story. The next book in the sequence is \\"He's just a friend\\". I'm assuming this will focus more on Darius' character and not just relationships that don't last."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"I read this book in one evening - to be exact 5 hours. I loved the twists and turns. I found it to be a very fast read - maybe because I just had to know what was going to happen to Darius and his entourage or the need to know whether soul mates really dissipated. It has the makings of a good movie. Now that I have this one under my belt - it is on to He's Just a Friend."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"If you read Soulmates Dissipate, or intend to, just go ahead and pick up this book as well. It picks right up where the first one left off.This is a good sequel. I'd even say it was better than Soulmates Dissipate, however it had a few shortcomings.My main issue was that while Soulmates Dissipate covered a time period of about two or three years (which the reader presumes occurs during the late 90's to early 00's) Never Again covers a span of about 30 years. There are some issues with that. The author makes the same pop culture references in what should be like 2030 as she did in what she portrayed in what was 2000 in the first novel. It seemed like she decided to lenghthen the time span of the sequel at the last minute and hadn't originally planned for such an epic sequel. (Yes, I'm a critical reader, but this issue really bothered me.)Otherwise, the book is just as drama filled (and fun!) and as the first and I think the writing is better in this one. I missed the hot sex scenes from Soulmates Dissipate. There were a few, but they weren't as interesting.Overall, it's a fine read. Just make sure you read Soulmates Dissipate first."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Never Again Once More proved you never say Never.Jada said Never again but her heart proved she would once more.I just could not understand why she would take so long to come to grip with her feeling.This was certainly a spicy and steamy read that I throughly enjoyed . Sometimes I had to put the book down just to cool off .I also found this novel a great read for a bookclub.I will have to suggest it to the two the bclubs I am a member of. So many questions and hearing the answers would make for a great discussion.Having read Soulmate Dissipate I am sure they will agree to select it.I rate Never Again Once More was 4.5* ."},{"Title":"Never Again Once More","review":"Time and time again we've seen that the sequel don't compare to the first novel but Never Again Once More was better.Twenty years after the breakup of Jada and Wellington the book picks up. In the beginning I was a bit confused due to the time elements but refused to put the book down.Who is your soulmate? Jada and Wellington moved forward with their lives but still ached for each other. Still Waters Run Deep. It's funny how your mouth says one thing but your heart says something else. Unconditional love. The love and desire for each other were so thick and desirable. I found myself reaching for a fan and an ice cold glass of water pretty regular throughout the book.Mary, you are one of the most talented authors thus far. You know how to keep your fans burning the midnight oil. Keep up the awesome job girl!

Needed the book for a college course and it is exactly what I needed."},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"The author introduces and describes the grammar from a very scholar,analytical and logical stand of view. The book is like a compact mini course of grammar. The author emphasizes the logic behind the words formations, i.e. clauses, phrases, verbs formations that makes some old fashion /ambiguous grammar terminology and rules more clear and straightforward.Although the length of the book could be a little issue, it is very readeable.I don't know if it is going to improve my gmat score (the only reason because I purchased it) but it definitely has improved my knowledge of grammar!"},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"This book is really helpful because it explains in detaila and is not boring at all.My professor did a great job on selecting this book for our course."},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"This book transforms grammar, the most hated subject, into science.

It would really help if a few more chapters can be added about things such as when to use past perfect, present perfect, progressive, etc. This books can be enhanced if some more details are given on the grammar topics it deals with.In all, I loved this book and this book, together with \\"Elements of Style\\", has become a crown of my personal library.

Morenberg assumes that the reader knows the basic rules, when in deed, this is meant to be a basic grammar book. He fails to mention the well used exceptions when doing a sub-par job of explaining grammar. This book may be called \\"Doing Grammar\\" but most of it is impermeable even for those who have been studying the subject for years.His persistent use of differing lexical categories -- he often makes up his own -- which don't harmonize with contemporary categories just makes matter more complicated.A excellent Grammar Book is \\" A Student's Introduction to English Grammar\\" by Huddleston and Pullum. I bought this book a year before buying Doing Grammar and it's great.

Really great stuff here. Tree diagramming, information sections on transitive verbs. It's what a girl wants."},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"Morenberg sets out to show you English grammar the way it really works, and not as a bunch of mindless, unconnected rules. Its real strength is that it starts from a fairly basic level (it helps to understand basic parts of speech, but that's all you really need), and by the end gives you the tools to analyze most sentences in the real world with a scheme that sticks generally to traditional terms, although it has been updated with more recent insights from linguistics. The coverage of the more complex structures is, to my mind, invaluable, since syntactic understanding becomes truly useful when it can help real-world writing problems, and that means being able to cope with any structure that might come your way. Morenberg's treatment of tense alone sets it far above traditional grammars without delving into the formidable technical apparatus of linguistic theory. I've used the 2nd edition of this book for several years to teach grammar to future teachers, and it has worked well, but the more I teach it, the more I have problems with some of Morenberg's presentations. One of his major themes in the book, is the importance of constituency (the way words, phrases, etc. work together as units). This is a key concept in syntax, and his stress on this point is one of the book's strengths. But he doesn't always follow his own principles. His treatment of the \\"main verb,\\" for example follows the (flawed) understanding of traditional grammar, even when some of his own example sentences make it clear that what he treats as a constituent does not, in fact, function as a unit. In a few other places, e.g., his treatment of gerunds, he adds what seem to be needless complexities without fully explaining the motivation. If he had borrowed a few more ideas from contemporary linguistics, his presentation could have been more consistent. The third edition doesn't touch these problems, but does add fuller explanation to many other points, as well as answers to fully half the exercises. Despite my reservations, which are minor, this remains the best book I know of for its purpose. The explanations and exercises suit the book for use in self-study."},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"*Doing Grammar* is an excellent instructional manual for anyone who already knows the basic differences between nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc., and really wants to understand how sentences are put together (and how to take them apart). Although it's presented in textbook format, with exercises at the end of each chapter, don't let that turn you off. The writing is clear and unpretentious (with a fair number of typos, however), and the learning progresses at a satisfyingly fast rate. Accessible, intelligent, and rewarding."},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical, &quot;real life&quot; way for me.It has helped me both as a writer and a reader.As a writer I found more options for expressing myself by having more tools to work with and as a reader it helps me decipher endlessly complex sentences that can resemble a linguistic maze.By being able to break down those complex sentences to their basic constituents, one can clearly see which parts of the sentence are functioning as core ideas, and which are functioning as embellishment.This book is very user friendly and is in my opinion an excellent self study guide with an interesting variety of exercises.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Doing Grammar","review":"As an English teacher who used this book in college during my Structures of the English Language class (and an admitted grammar-o-phile), I can assure any prospective buyers that this book is both easy to understand and thoroughly comprehensive. Presented in textbook format, it does require a little audience participation, but for the person wary of grammatical inadequacies, this is the book for you.Morenberg approaches the diagramming (no! keep reading!) from a different perspective, namely a &quot;bottom up&quot; method, so readers understand the construction of the sentence the way they see contractors build a house... from the foundation to the roof. Beginning with parts of speech (anyone can handle that, right?) and ending with the total sentence, you as a reader will learn all the names and labels and rationales in the language you use so effortlessly... what pitfalls exist, and WHY are they pitfalls? Do you know all the verb tenses? Do you know why it's wrong to end a sentence with a preposition? It really is, too, and Morenberg will show you why.Maybe you don't care.But the hallmark of an educated person is the ability to use our language accurately. Others notice grammar weakness even if you don't care (and you must just a little or you wouldn't be reading this review). In my field, I've decided against hiring those who can't even speak properly in an interview, and I never ever patronize businesses with errors in their advertising or business literature. It DOES matter.This book is very, very simple to understand while, at the same time, tremendously valuable in its information and accuracy.Go for it!

I was taught grammar by traditionalists in a manner reminiscent of morality lessons. And I was the grammar atheist. The results were ugly.And so I expected grade school to end my grammar career.But then, this summer, I decided to apply to Ph.D. programs in business and this requires taking the GMAT. So I registered for the test, took a pretest, and 80% of my errors were - you guessed it - grammar errors.So I wandered through my local Border's grammar section and I found one book that looked a little different - blue, and written by a guy named Max. So I sat down with my cappuccino and inside Max's book I found a grammarian with a mathematical mind. He said screw trying to memorize grammar; instead, understand grammar as the system by which the English language operates.Max said that you know twice the grammar that you think you do. If you are a native speaker, all you really need to add to your current knowledge is the system by which grammar works. And so I have learned Max's system and I recommend it to you.If that's sufficient for you to add 'Doing Grammar' to your cart, great. But there's more.Eight weeks after that purchase, I got a perfect 800 score on the GMAT. And I now teach other people how to improve their GMAT scores (if you live in the Palo Alto CA area, email me for details).But more important than my GMAT score is that I am now cognizant of twice as many options in my writing. It's said that H.L. Mencken learned the English language inside out to be acutely aware of his options. Well, I'm on my way to understanding my options too.

I brought this book when I read in the preface, &quot;It is odd we humans hate studying grammer. It is like a dolphin hating to learn how to swim. We are born to love language.&quot; He also tells the story of how after he had taken a German language exam, a co-student had misunderstood the story because though he knew the knew the meanings of the words, he minterpreted the story because he did not know the grammer or word order of those words. What I love about the book is how the author ordered each chapter to build upon the previous chapter in a very logical point by point learing process. In short, the author worked hard to help you understand a subject which so many of us do not want to understand, but which we need to understand in this age of emails. For the price of a tank of gas, you will lose nothing by getting the book; but you will improve your writing, a very important life long skill.

What is presented is a tedious tome overburdened with such common-sense topics such as choosing a parking space, selecting a cart (flatbed or shopping cart, pretty self-evident), a whole chapter on shopping cart \\"etiquette\\" (including the \\"risks\\" of abandoning your cart), choosing a check-out lane (4 pages!), and buying two sizes of clothing/returning one, given the lack of fitting rooms, etc. Add to that more tedium (5 pages worth!) on communicating with your family while shopping (Cell phone? Walkie-talkies? Runners? Public telephone? It boggles the mind!). Warehouse clubs have been in existence 25+ years, so most people understand the concept. Perhaps if you were raised by wolves, this book might be enlightening.Any insights into Costco and its interesting culture are scarce. And some information is flat-out inaccurate, such as references to cluttered, narrow aisles, and the option of shopping bags.This book could have been so much more. For the Costco non-member, the meat of it can be explained to you by any member in about 10 minutes. The time it takes to read this book would be better spent \\"touring\\" your local Costco a couple of times and picking up a copy of the free monthly magazine on your way out. If you are already a member, there is little, if anything, of significant value. I learned absolutely nothing from this book, and regret both the expended time and money.I guess there's a reason why this book was never carried by Costco, not available in any chain bookstores here in Seattle, nor stocked by the King County Public library, (which carries an exhaustive collection of books on Seattle-area companies): no perceived value to their respective communities."},{"Title":"The Costco Experience: An Unofficial Survivor's Guide","review":"Let's face it - shopping is not the high point of the day.

As a Costco shopper, I've always looked at shopping there as a &quot;have to&quot; ordeal, rather than an enjoyable experience. Yet, this author has taken all of those semi-ugly, if not occasionally painful, situations and put them in a different light.

It is an elegant discussion of the experience of shopping at Costco. First I like the free food at lunch. Then I like the prices and the selection. Costco has recently added bakery goods from the French Bakery in Soquel. FANTASTIC. In Colorado, Costco put in a new all-fruit juice carbonated beverage. I bought 4 cases and gave bottles to my friends. Why? Because Costco does it right. They care about their customers. After reading the Costco Experience, I asked my local Costco store why they don't give the book to their members. They should. But if they don't, Costco will miss out on the greatest of all business opportunities - that is the courting of their own customers with all that they do and sell (and best of all how they do it).I cannot speak highly enough about the Costco Experience. This past holiday season I gave out the book as gifts. You see, the people who shop at Costco really love it. And those that have not yet discovered it are missing out on the very best in customer service, the best in selection, the best in free food.Yes, I have poked my head into other so-called member warehouses.

For those with an academic interest in psychedelic drugs, it's almost a mandatory purchase, containing dozens of novel new tryptamine-based psychoactives (including several LSD derivatives), many of which are now available through the so-called &quot;research chemical&quot; trade.

It is as though the authors said almost everything that needed to be said in PIHKAL and included this additional commentary to satisfy themselves rather than the reading audience.The chemistry section, however, is superlative, and is more than well worth the cost of the book in and of itself if you are interestd in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Tihkal: The Continuation","review":"Like Shulgin's earlier work Pihikal, Tihkal is a book of two parts.

The second part is a useful compendium of tryptamine devivatives, their structural chemistry, synthesis and their effects on very willing human volunteers.This book is an absolute must for drug chemists, and I suspect it will enjoy a wide sale to both chemists employed by enforcement agencies and those with a more direct personal interest in the effects of the compounds described.The title? It's an acronym for Tryptamines I have Known and Loved......."},{"Title":"Tihkal: The Continuation","review":"This is a fine contribution although 'The Continuation' might lead one to believe that both Pihkal and Tihkal are of the same sphere. I suppose they are, if one isn't well-read regarding the metabolism and synthesis of these two very different families of compounds. As a synthetic organic chemist, I appreciated not only the autobiographical sketch but also the synthesis/observation section. Some of his methods are a bit dated. However, they are indeed valid if you don't mind sacrificing yield and purity."},{"Title":"Tihkal: The Continuation","review":"well written,by by a good mind.All-in-all, it makes me wonder why mankind took a step backwards since the 60's...and....raither the following generations to come will have such brain farts, as those have done who in the last few decades, in the name of LAW and ORDER(that has caused such disorder.Experimenting is how civilizeatoins progess.You can't expect progress when good minds are supressed and restricted.That would of been like telling Ben Franklin\\"Kites with keys on them are now against the law to take out into a lightning storm,and,could hurt you.So, if you risk hurting yourself, and take kite with keys out in the lightning storm: By law we will hurt you real bad,and those who love you, so you wont risk hurting yourself any more.(yes it is a backwards step) GOD HELP US!But deffinately enjoyable books to read."},{"Title":"Tihkal: The Continuation","review":"This book is a must have for all those with interest in pharmacology.

I thought, from the cover, that it may be written in a more narrative style that would interest a person like me. It seemed more like it was written to prove they were doing valid experimentation. I would like to know that, but I would like to know that in the context of a story. I really enjoy historical fiction.

This is one of the most informative, enlightening, and controversial books of our time. Shulgin was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, and my admiration of his work is why I give this book such a high rating. I have to be honest, Ann Shulgin (who writes a lot of the semi-fictional stories in the book) is a terrible writer, and never stops talking about her own emotions and relates nearly every experience she has in life to herself. Its a huge disappointment when youre looking for some solid, non-fictional history on the struggles and advances within this new age of cognitive/neurological science, and you end up with half of it being a whiny, lifetime TV style drama about a love story not unlike any other love story. The book would be far more powerful without the fictional romance.Anyone into this sort of scientific research can not be without this book. Its absolutely fascinating. Its stark political controversy allows it to also appeal to the more left, liberal, or perhaps politically subversive crowd. My respect for Sasha Shulgin and his contributions to science earn this book its rating."},{"Title":"Tihkal: The Continuation","review":"A penetrating, intellectually substantive work that earns its right at center stage on your bookshelf.

From Simone DeBeauvoir's famous statement \\"one is not born a woman...\\" to Gayatri Spivak's ruminations on \\"strategic essentialism\\" and Third World representation in American academia, literally every text is exceptional. The reader will find (almost) everything, from revolutionary African-American and Latina responses to the purported Eurocentrism in early feminist studies, to French feminists' (Irigaray and Wittig, specifically) provocative interrogations of the phallocentric culture, to mention a few. My only complaint is Nicholson's introductions to each section-- they could be a bit longer and more comprehensive; readers with a cursory knowledge of feminist thought should consider reading a basic introduction, not the texts themselves, before delving into this collection. Regardless, this book is a must-have for anyone interested in women's studies/feminism."},{"Title":"The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory","review":"I got this book for my Feminist Theory class, taught by one of the contributors, Uma Narayan, and have found it to be an excellent representation of the diversity of feminist theory: Radical Lesbian Feminists, Marxist Feminists, Liberal Feminists, Third-World Feminists and more all contribute powerful pieces. It really is a great way to expand your knowledge of feminism... you learn it's a complicated and controversial topic--many of the essays disagree with each other. I highly recommend this book for a diverse array of accounts in feminist history."},{"Title":"Erotic Sculpture of India","review":"By the standards of the late 1950's, some of the sculptures in this book would be considered erotic, perhaps even pornographic. However, if you were to look at them through that lens, it would introduce a bias that would prevent you from seeing the true value of this artwork. In most cases, carved by hand out of stone, the statues illustrate the degree to which religion and culture was valued. Many human work centuries were spent in the creation of these carvings.They also demonstrate the role that sexual activity and expression had in the religions of India. Unlike the sexually repressive religions of Christianity and Islam, the artwork openly displays the bare human body and humans engaged in all varieties of sexual acts. If you read this book with an eye to appreciating other cultures, then there is no erotic nature to this art, just expressions of life in religions that allowed all aspects of human activity to be displayed."},{"Title":"The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon: Volume 9, The Sea Voyage, The Double Marriage, The Prophetess, The Little French Lawyer, The Elder Brother, The Maid in the Mill","review":"Although volume 9 of Fredson Bowers' Beaumont & Fletcher project is a good one, none of the plays mentioned by \\"a reader\\" occur in volume 9.

I had no recollection of it being a good read, but it's actually quite good. It covers just about everything that the applied linguist needs to know, including research methodology, data collection, modern theories of second language acquisition together with their historical development, learner variables and their relation to success or failure, and an excellent bibliography for those who would like to read more. I think that although this book claims that its intended audience needs no prior knowledge of SLA, from my personal experience, I would contest that it takes a few years for everything to sink in! I recommend this book only if you have been involved in linguistics for a number of years, or are an exceptionally keen or smart grad student. If you are considering doing your own research, then this book is also a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research (Applied Linguistics and Language Study)","review":"I think a lot of the previous reviewers have misinterpreted the purpose of this book. The key word in the title is \\"research\\". This book prepares graduate students who are going to do SLA reasearch in the course of their studies. It provides an excellent introduction to research by first presenting the different styles of reseach used in the field as well as research methods. The rest of the book consists of the major studies that have been conducted up until the publication of the book. A graduate student can use this as a resource book for their research. The methods of each study are well described. Also, students will be able to see what kind of research has already been conducted, so they can check whether the problem they want to research has already been done. Also, some new questions have arisen from these studies which would make excellent research projects.I assume that the previous reviewers were not interested in research, but in application. If that is the case then they bought the wrong book. For an introductory text to SLA research, I recommend Lightbrown and Spada's \\"How Languages are Learned\\". That book is designed for practicing educators, and it gives good explanations of the research without using much jargon. Please be sure to choose the book that suits your purpose. In other words, the previous negative reviews are more due to the reviewers' poor choice of material rather than any defect in the material itself."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research (Applied Linguistics and Language Study)","review":"I am a K-12 teacher and I've used this book in an introductory second language acquisition class for teachers.

I DO NOT recommend this book to be used as a basic textbook for a Second Language Acquisition Introductory course."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research (Applied Linguistics and Language Study)","review":"I am a professor of Spanish Linguistics. I used this book one semester in an undergraduate applied linguistics course and received very negative feedback from the students. In spite of the fact that the back cover claims that the book is for those with no previous knowledge of L2 acquisition research, it was definitely not accessible to my students. It lacks a clearly organized approach in explaining the history of the discipline, existing L2 acquisition theory, what motivates researchers to conduct the studies that they do, and the terminology of the discipline. I have since found that a better choice for real begginers in this area is &quot;Principles of Language Learning and TEaching&quot; by H.D. Brown (1994). Its scope includes more than L2 acquisition theory, as the title suggests, but it provides the basic understanding necessary to then begin to talk about current research."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research (Applied Linguistics and Language Study)","review":"This book was very helpful for master's thesis.

Indeed, a traveler who relies on the stylized Roman script to facilitate reasonable pronunciation will be taking a chance.As an experiment, I enlisted the help of three colleagues to read the Arabic as presented in this book (with native Arabic speakers in the room). One produced fairly good pronunciation, the second was recognizable, and the third gave up because he was incomprehensible.The book is attractive, pleasantly thin, and enjoyable to look at. And the &quot;etiquette&quot; section is good. But to be truly valuable as a language tool, it should come with recorded material.

I need a book that can help me understand how to cook anything. I'm desperate here. My skills are beyond bad. Burning chocolate pudding was bad enough two weeks ago, but now I'm burning spaghetti sauce. Last night I had to walk through the dark and throw my meal in the winter wheat field beside my house as a result. Maybe I could have salvaged the noodles by rinsing them off, but it wasn't a chance worth taking. If you've ever had burnt spaghetti sauce, you will understand how disgusting and vile it tastes. Funny how the juicy meatballs tasted fine, heh.Anyway this book does a remarkable job opening up more cooking opportunities for all the aspiring cooks out there willing and ready to learn another recipe. It's really good. I just wish I had the talent to make my meals as deliciously accurate as presented in this book."},{"Title":"Taste","review":"This is a fabulous cookbook by a talented food writer.

In this book there is a vivid picture of the burden to wage aerial war in Vietnam, a scar still painful in memories of those who fought it. Their stories are well worth a careful reading since they reveal the psychological attitude of the airmen and their lifestyle under the strain of action. This portrait is accurate and gripping, giving many details of how tactics, training and hardware worked under real condition (contrary to the flawless operations of a peacetime simulation). Clearly some stories are edifying experience of servicemen that went beyond the call of duty, but largely most of them resound of day to day life and of behaviour of common soldiers towards the harshness of fight. Compelling."},{"Title":"Full Throttle: True Stories of Vietnam Air Combat Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"A friend who flew out of Udorn AFB in Thailand as a KC-135 navigator gave me this book, as he knew I might know some of the characters in it. I did, and some of the stories I tell in OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM correspond and back up some of these exploits. My tour was in UH-1D helicopters out of Vinh Long in the Delta. The Seven Mountains area is aptly described, as well as the old French minefield at Chi Lang that blew up a Knight aircraft as he depicted. Phillip Chinnery hung out with some of the VHPA aviators a few years back to garner up these stories, and they are well presented. It is unfortunate that a lot of the guys who flew these birds can't write well enought to record these amazing times. Another good book to have on your RVN shelf."},{"Title":"Full Throttle: True Stories of Vietnam Air Combat Told by the Men Who Lived It","review":"I have read several books on aerial combat in Vietnam. This book is as good as those although not the best. I found I enjoyed the stories of the helicopter pilots better than those of the jet pilots. BUT, they were all good...just some better than others. Of course, all of the stories about the sorties into NV, Laos, and Cambodia were very interesting. Nevertheless, in saying that, you do find yourself flying along with these pilots wondering if \\"you\\" were going to get hit and make it back to base or the carriers. Or, hoping you avoid the SAMs as they rise out of the jungle.The biggest drawback to this book is the lack of a key to explain what all of the acronyms mean. You just have to read and hope that it comes up during the story. For example, the pilots mention several times about bombing the POLs. Finally, one pilot said that it meant Petroleum-Oil-Lubricants storage vessels. This book is told by pilots for pilots. However, if you have a passing interest in aviation you shouldn't have any problems with the acronyms. I was familiar with most but not all."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"I read Walter Kaufmann's articles, available in the AMOK publication of this book, in which he explains why this book is a forgery, I'll share some of the reasons: The original manuscript of this book in German supposedly \\"disappeared\\" according to Samuel Roth, owner of the original publisher, Seven Sirens Press. Roth was known for publishing other forgeries of famous authors, including a fake sequel to Lady Chatterley's Lover. Roth claimed Oscar Levy translated it, but Oscar Levy had died 4 years before this was published, and while Levy EDITED his \\"Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche\\" Levy never considered his English good enough to do the translations himself! If you look at Levy's \\"Complete Works\\", he's always listed as the editor but never the translator, so it's very unlikely that he would consider his English good enough for this book but none of Nietzsche's other books, and it's very unlikely that Levy would leave this book out of his Complete Works series and instead sell it to a guy known for publishing forgeries. Levy's daughter denounced the book as a forgery and stated that her father had nothing to do with it. George David Plotkin, a minor author, confessed to Kaufmann shortly before his death that he wrote this book for Roth."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"The preeminent scholar of Nietzsche, Prof. Walter Kaufman, has obtained a written confession from the \\"translator\\" (Levy) that this book was in fact written in English by Levy. There was no original German manuscript by Nietzsche. This book is not by Nietzsche, and is not worth reading."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"Nietzsche's authorship of this work is in dispute. One reviewer claims Levy would not sanction a forgery, but I find it interesting that Levy chose not to include it in the Complete Works of Nietzsche that he edited. I've read it, and whoever wrote it sounds a hell of a lot like Nietzsche. It's an interesting work whether or not it is authentic. I don't quite buy the idea that his sister commissioned it since it does not make her look very good. It is possible that the motivation of claims of inauthenticity is a need to protect Nietzsche's reputation in the eyes of puritanical fans and that the work is indeed authentic, but it is also possible that it is a forgery (it sounds like him, but his style is easily parodied)."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"Of course it would be threatening to academic followers and/or readers of Nietzsche to learn that in the wake of his father's death (as a result of injuries sustained to his head after tripping over the family dog), his sister Elizabeth crept into his bed at night for comfort because their mother had switched off emotionally, and that during their lives Elizabeth and Friedrich developed a very close turbulent and incestuous relationship - which for Friedrich ruled out any kind of intimacy with women for the rest of his life.Whatever arguments are presented in relation to its authenticity, this book demonstrates magnificently that the thoughts and ideas expressed in the accepted works of Nietzsche are based not on the high ideals of the Greeks, but on the psychology of having been left fatherless and under the power of women from a very early age, from the particular contradictions prejudices and delusions that this growing human male had to deal with during that particular life.It is a rather tawdry tale which nevertheless points out the connections between the \\"man\\" and the \\"philosophy\\" - particulary Nietzsche's alleged mysogyny, and that reveals a vulnerable naive and trepidatious human being, incarcerated in an asylum, facing death, already experiencing seizures paralysis and insanity. Having moreover just discovered that his crisp autobiographical statement to the world in Ecce Homo is not going to be published because his sister has forbidden it. At the same time though he is aware that she is already starting an archive of his oeuvre so that the Nietzschean philosophers who are beginning to make themselves known will have some resource with which to work.The one who is supposed to have faked this tragedy is skilled indeed in psychology and psychoanalysis. There are obvious anachronisms in the text, but all of these are explainable in other ways than that the whole book is a fake. What seems more likely is that Nietzsche did write notes that were smuggled out of the asylum or that he dictated words to somebody who then collated them into a manuscript. But that the story presented in the Amok edition of the book's subsequent travels is partial and/or inaccurate for whatever reason. Personally I doubt that Oscar Levy was the translator, and would add that it is not actually a very good translation.Anybody who wants to find out more should read the book for themselves rather than listen to voices for or against its authenticity. That would be a much more Nietzschean approach."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"My Profile- No qualifications as a Philisophy critic whatsoverThis review refres to the spanish edition \\"Mi hermana y Yo\\"- EdafI have not read Nietsche since my days at the university.. and not only him, just about any other philosopher as well, I guess life got in the way and now I had to live it..This is a strange book, for many its a fake and the reasons to claim it are substancial.. others, say its from the thinker himself, me? as I can remember the passion of Nietsche its there and that a hell of a difficult thing to emulate..Once you get past the shock of the incestous relantionship and you have the context of see past his particular anti-semitism and anti-christianism then you can appreciate the personal anguish that its contained in this pages.Strange enough, I am browsing through the book now expecting to see the many highlights and notes I used to make back then, and the book does not have that many...many thought are stirring up, did I really read this? looking over some of the aphorisms I try to picture myself reading this with passion I had back then.. where is that desire now?One of them is worthy of the laughter that only experience can provide\\" Mis necesidades sexuales aumentan, no disminuyen.

The book has some amazing points and theories, regardless of the incest. If this book is a fake, the man who wrote it has been done out of his due credit. The fact of the matter is, people who are honestly interested in philosophy would read the book for its insights. The author does not really matter.

If anything, read it BECAUSE it is controversial."},{"Title":"My sister and I;","review":"A diary from an insane asylum attributed to the most important philosopher of the post-modern era...This book is controversial. Not for whether it is by Nietzsche himself (which it most likely is) but because it confesses to his sister's molestation of Nietzsche, and his subsequent erotic desires for her. If true, Nietzsche would have repressed such issues during his life, and only felt the courage to speak out about them close to his death. And if true, it pokes a gaping hole in the theory that Elisabeth commissioned this work, as it paints an unflattering picture of her.This book would be very entertaining for both casual readers, as well as Nietzsche scholars. It is an interesting look into the mind of a brilliant genius. The fact that this book is often ignored by Nietzsche scholars seems to be a bit strange. Why? I believe that this book represents a diminution of Nietzsche's emphasis on the value of individual strength. Nietzsche in this text shows himself to be vulnerable to an overwhelming need for solace and love from others, values which he denounced throughout his career. (This adds further credence to the belief that this work is truly his, since what single dying man wouldn't wish that he had people who really cared for him around?) It seems that if a conspiracy existed to make one more Nietzsche book, it would have been a further exhortation to the will to power. However, because this book can be read as a parenthetical withdrawal from his espoused doctrines, it shows why theoreticians would decry its legitimacy. It is much easier to understand a man's writings if one ignores a lengthy inner contradiction.But this is all the more a testament to the book's possible authenticity. Nietzsche's work is full of contradiction and reconfiguring of values. As he insists in the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil, why must we insist on the truth? Why not rather untruth?An entertaining challenge to one's perspective on Nietzsche's philosophy, whether it is authentic or not."},{"Title":"Handbook to Middle East Amphibians and Reptiles (Contributions to Herpetology)","review":"Useful book. very detailed taxonomy and identification guide.

Doughty,","review":"Explorer, scholar, scientist, author and poet, Charles Montagu Doughty (1843-1926) was one of the greatest 19th century adventurers, the progenitor of a noble tradition that includes Lawrence of Arabia, to whom he was a mentor, and Wilfred Thesiger: British writers who have been fascinated by the Bedouin, and in particular by that strange, mythic part of the world, the Empty Quarter -- a phrase which Doughy introduced to the West. Born in Suffolk in 1843, the son of a clergyman, in the 1870s Doughty spent two years wandering through Arabia, first with the &quot;Hadj&quot; pilgrimage, then joining nomadic bands of Arabs, sometimes being kept as a virtual prisoner in far-flung desert towns. Unyielding in his independence of mind, the tall, red-bearded Doughty consistently refused to conceal his Christianity, making his perilous travels even more dangerous: he was threatened with death several times, spurned, insulted and often beaten by angry mobs. He risked all many times over, sometimes seemingly possessed by an almost messianic vision of himself; yet he was ultimately to find among the Bedouin a chivalry and honour that suited his own unbending temperament. The story of Doughty's obsessive archaeological investigations and wide-ranging observations of Arabia and desert life were published in 1888 as the vast and celebrated &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot;. Although the book brought him little in the way of financial reward, he was now feted by the literary establishment; but his abrasiveness and refusal to compromise meant he frequently found himself at odds with the learned societies of England and Europe, his work rejected and his genius (as he saw it) neglected. Doughty was far more than an eccentric traveller and adventurer. He was dedicated to his great mission of rescuing the English language from the decadence into which he believed it had fallen since the eras of Chaucer and Spencer, and spent ten years devising, researching and writing a four-volume blank-verse epic about the origins of Britain. He died in 1926, his literary reputation largely restored thanks to the efforts of T.E. Lawrence. His monumental work &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot; was first published in 1888. In 1921, T.E. Lawrence convinced Jonathan Cape to reprint the book and contributed a Foreword to it. Both Hogarth and Doughty were major influences on T.E. Lawrence.Appendix I: List of Books Ordered by C.M.

I decided to buy this book on impulse more than anything else at Dymocks. I just really wanted to buy something I suppose.When I read about the author's credentials in teaching Russian (none), it should have rang a bell (ding! ding!) It didn't.Whilst I'm sure the author's really, really good at... Russian, he's definitely not very good at *teaching* it, which is what I'm more interested in as the student. The way he teaches how to read the Cyrillic alphabet, the way to remembering what's stressed & what's not & various other essentials (some of which aren't covered) are very lax, to say the least. I don't mean to sound too harsh or anything but if you're intent on actually LEARNING Russian, this book won't help you. If you want to learn a word here & there to impress someone, then this book might be the one.The reason I didn't give the book a 1 is:-He can write English well & explains himself clearly-The book looks pretty-Some interesting points are madeI recommend \\"Russian Course\\". That's THE book to use to learn Russian.Richard"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"Once you learn the alphabet (no small feat) you'll have fun with this book. And, you'll UNDERSTAND why Russian-speakers have difficulty learning perfect English (and that will be an epiphany).So, in all circumstances, try this book out. Knowledge of another language that has gender cases for nouns (such as German) is helpful, because you have already jumped that hoop. Get ready to encounter a language with no real prepositional phrases, definite articles (\\"the\\"), and no particular concern about word order. However, it can be fun, and will give you some great insights into one of the world's great and most spoken languages. All thanks to St. Cyril, who wanted to invent an alphabet that took the best from the available ones. He missed on a few points, and those are worth discovering too!One of the best free-standing Russian language books I have uncovered."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian starts where it should: the Cryllic Alphabet, and it gives a good breakdown and a lot of sample words to go along with it. Then it gets into grammar, slowly etching vocabulary into your mind as you read. It's a really good introduction, and the fact that it stays with the Cryllic alphabet throughout lends it a lot of face in my eyes, because in reality you're not really accomplishing anything without using their alpahabet. As always with languages, you'll want to get a good set of CDs or tapes to go along, because without hearing the language there's no point, but I really must strongly recommend this book. It's witty once in a while, fun all the time, and doesn't let you get bogged down in the extreme nuances of grammar. If you want to begin the road to fluency in Russian, buy this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"Because this is labeled as an \\"Idiot's Guide\\" does not mean that you can sprint through the book. The focus is mainly on spoken Russian - how to communicate. It's a good overview of the language, teaches a broad range of vocabulary, gives a decent but not exhaustive explanation of grammar and pronounciation, and keeps it all interesting and fun. Each section stands on it's own, so you can skip around without getting totally lost."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"This book is okay, I mean it was a nice introduction to Russian but I had to buy many other books to further my studies. This book is NOT, I reapeat, IS NOT going to teach you all you need to even be conversational let alone fluent. The book has non sequiter chapters about things that really aren't quintessential to the beginning student of the Russian Languages. One good point fo the book is that it has an excellent chapter on expalining cases in Russian which is a difficult concept to the English speaker. I reccomend getting an outling on Russian grammar and a Russian vocabulary booster to go with this if you want this to be your main text on learning Russian."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"It's cheating a bit, as I wrote this book and therefore have no objective capacity with which to review it. I wrote this little tome when I was a mere 20 years old, fresh out of language school and headed to war in Iraq. Not a defense of the text's weaknesses, surely; however, it is food for my own reflection of the experience of writing this book.The text's organization is its most glaring weakness (in my humble opinion). With only three months to write and edit the whole piece, I must have traversed several dozen major revisions of the structure of the text. With each revision, I tried to preserve the most essential elements of the language even as I had to amputate core grammatical and philosophical concepts.It was an imperfect and rushed process with no opportunity to return for substantive edits later.As a young writer, when faced with even the most inauspicious opportunity to write an Idiot's Guide edition, the cost of sacrificing all ownership rights to the penned work seems so much lower than the potential reward. The real cost becomes manifest within a few years or more. While Wikimedia entries can live and breathe in real time, humble CIG tomes are cast once and left forever to occupy a static space.The Russian language evolves constantly, but it is sadly not possible to capture any of its mutations in the scope of my humble text. I can only say that I gave this book my all while I had the chance, and if I had been (legally) able to contribute more to it in the last 10 years, I would have.If ever any dear reader wants to pursue the Russian language further with me directly, please have at me!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"Why make a kindle version if the script won't show?

I am a bilingual social worker in Portland, Oregon. A part of my job is outreach to our local Slavic community so I decided to learn Russian. I speak, read, and write English and Spanish.This book served well as a survey course of Russian. It reviews most of the facets of the language including culture, grammar, conjugation, and declension. It may well be a decent presentation of the entire language in a single book.I read every single page of the book and completed all the exercises. I then practiced pronouncing the words in the companion audio CD.I can now recognize many words in the every day speech of Russian speakers. I can read some simple sentences and write them too.I think the best approach to this book is to relax and not try to master every phrase or word. The continuing repetition throughout the book will allow you to learn the most relevant information.It was invaluable to have Russian-speaking co-workers to help me learn to pronounce the alphabet and words.There are websites online where you can find words pronounced by native speakers but you need a native speaker to figure out the alphabet.As an investment for about twenty dollars you can learn to read and write basic Russian with this book. If you want to learn to speak Russian you should try the Russian - Rosetta Stone, which our agency has recently purchased.If you are going on vacation and only need Russian phrases you could buy a much cheaper book and do fine. This book is a survey of the entire language.There are three faculties of a language: reading, writing, and speaking.This book is decent on the first two and poor on the third.There are various errors in the English phonetic transcriptions throughout the book for which my Russian-speaking coworkers corrected me.There are answers to most of the exercises in the back of the book. However, there are a few exercises missing.Good Luck."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"The two languages that I speak are English and Japanese, but I am a huge fan of lots of languages and this is a great book to learn a little about Russian.

However, there are many typos and errors which are confusing to learners. Russian words have accent markers on one syllable, but then the English transliteration has a different syllable emphasized, so you don't know which pronunciation is correct. Also, sometimes the transliterations are incorrect (often confusing letters which appear similar in English and Russian, such as P and H. Finally, there are other errors such as giving July 4th as the Russian Victory Day, awkward switches between Celcius and Farenheight temperatures, and actual mistranslations such as ignoring the Russian \\"ne\\" (not).If this book were to be corrected I would give it four stars instead of three."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"this is one of my favorite books for learning russian, it covers the basics and gets you started, i would and have recommended it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"This is a second edition and it still has errors that are obvious even to an novice like myself.

I have a lot of these intro books. Russian is a very deep subject. The classes tend to hang up on a few items forever, and this book moves you along to new areas. The more compressed dense type is Oxford Russian Grammar and Verbs which is maybe too much for the pure beginner. This book also tries to show pronunciation and now has CD of some use. Author has done a service to the beginner. The book is not a large set of tables of endings which might be in a reference book. It is unlikely that one would speak much Russian after reading one book. I think the critics here are too narrow. The book is a good overview of basics. I would buy also an Intermediate next book in Russian in this Idiot Series if it is ever done (such exists in Spanish)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian","review":"I tried to read this book... and guess what?

Alice Sebold depicted one vision of it beautifully and brilliantly in her novel THE LOVELY BONES - Brad Watson has given us another literary treasure that touches the reader's heart just as deeply in his first novel, THE HEAVEN OF MERCURY.Watson's book is, of course, about much more than an individual's vision and experience of heaven - it is a finely wrought, rich tapestry that gives us a living, breathing view of Southern life (although so much of what its characters feel and experience is universal), one that touches on emotions and truths so deeply, yet gently, that we know them as if they were our own. His writing is awesomely beautiful, yet honest and forthright - there is no superficiality here, and I never got the feeling that even a single word was put there to impress the reader. Watson is telling a story that he feels in his soul - and has filled this novel with characters that are so real that their presence can be felt in the room.One of the beauties of his prose is how easily it rolls along, bearing not only the story and characters, but the reader as well, along with it. I found myself re-reading many a passage in wonder, amazed that I had traveled its length to arrive at the end, almost unaware of the journey. In developing his characters in the reader's mind's eye, the author employs incredibly distinctive voices - distinctive not only for their speech and thoughts, but in the narrative surrounding them.What seems at first to be a surreal quality to Watson's writing reveals itself, upon further consideration, to actually be more of an \`ultra-reality' - people, events, emotions and settings are placed so close to the reader's perception that they seem blurred and bent, adding to the mystical/mythical qualities of the tale. The characters' lives are seen not just through their own memories, but also through the memories of those around them, giving varied slants on events they hold in common - personal v. universal memory. Watson's depiction of the \`heaven' or \`hell' we experience after death - those of specific souls often overlapping - is presented in much the same fashion. It's a concept that might seem self-contradictory until one sees it laid out so beautifully and skillfully, in the context of the story - viewed thusly, it makes perfect and natural sense.The story itself centers on the life of one Finus Bates - from his early years to the end of his life - and his life-long love for Birdie Wells. Theirs is a deep, close friendship - and a star-crossed love. The book follows their lives - and the lives of other citizens of the fictional town of Mercury, Mississippi - in non-chronological but perfectly sensible order, through friendships, marriages (each to another partner), trials, tribulations, and the ins and outs of everyday life. Far from being a boring picture of mundane lives in a small Southern town, THE HEAVEN OF MERCURY is a luminous portrayal of memorable individuals living through times of great change - from the early 20th century to the present day. As in most stories set in the South in these decades, race is definitely one of the players - and Watson tells it like it was (and is), doing so with great respect and love for all of those involved. As ugly as some of the things that have happened around the race issue might be, they must be viewed in an honest light if we are to learn from them. Only when we settle with the past can we advance.THE HEAVEN OF MERCURY is an incredible reading experience - one that I can heartily recommend, full to the brim with amazingly good writing. I first read an excerpt from this novel (the chapter \`The dead girl') that was included in the wonderful collection STORIES FROM THE BLUE MOON CAF&Eacute;. I subsequently read Brad Watson's short story collection LAST DAYS OF THE DOG MEN (both highly recommended as well). The talent and promise I saw in these didn't lead me astray - this is an amazing novel (especially for a first effort), and I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"It is so wonderful in our time to find something of such beauty, subtlety and richness as Brad Watson's Heaven of Mercury. The characters and scenes become part of your memory. There is a non-cliche understanding of the South that can only come from a person that is truly in touch with that place and history. Watson taps into all the dimensions of the human condition, with a comic edge like a razor blade. It is quite rare that I read a book that literally leaves me breathless. Brad Watson is one of the greats in the next generation of Southern writers. Thank you and bravo!"},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books I've read in ages. Based on some of the reviews below, this is definitely a love it or hate it book. I'll tell you this much: if you love good fiction with pitch-perfect prose and dead-on dialogue, then this is the novel for you. Everyone says it reminds them of Faulkner or Marquez but this is completely original writing that gets to the meat of the human heart (no pun intended, as a human heart is actually a pivotal plot point). If you like formulaic writing and stitled dialogue this is not the book for you. You should read books like this, though. They're good for you. One of the best books of the year, if not THE best."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Wonderful discriptive writing. It takes a bit to get use to the author's syntax and punctuation peculiarities, but once you get over that, it is rather fun and refreshing. This work does have it's own rhythm and I rather like that. I like the way the author has take very &quot;ordinary&quot; people, and told a story, proving again, that there is merit and a tale in every life. I suppose many may be a bit put off as the the fact that the characters are not all that different from you and me, but that is one of the strong point of the work, I feel. I could not find one character in the book, that I have not meet in &quot;real life&quot; and that was kind of nice. I highly recommend this read and hope we get more of the same."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Many of the negative reviews here seem focused on the disjointed narrative or - unbelievably - a supposed lack of plot. Perhaps those readers would be better served by the latest Patricia Cornwell novel, complete with inciting incident, rising action, climax, etc., all told in linear fashion, each event telegraphed to the reader by the event before it. I don't doubt that these same readers struggled through &quot;plotless&quot; books like The Sound and the Fury or Joseph Heller's Something Happened.Watson is a subtle storyteller who reveals the truth about his characters through a few well-chosen stories from their lives, each rendered in pitch-perfect prose. He does not feel compelled to give us a summation of each character's entire life history, nor does he show us the entire internal world of every person in the book, and for that he is beaten up by readers who apparently are unfamiliar with Hemingway's iceberg principle.As to the charge that the relationship between a black housemaid and her employer was drawn without subtlety, nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, this was one of the most nuanced and deeply-felt examples of human connection (or lack thereof) in the novel.Most of the readers who lambasted the story in the novel at least gave Watson credit for his brilliant writing style, so I won't add anything there.If you treasure southern literature, stories of abiding love, or ruminations on life, death and the hereafter, order this book now."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I Can't think when I've read a book that moved me more, grounded me so in the richness of love in life and affirmed the intuited connectedness of all creaturely existance. This book is the heaven of wherever you are when you read it. (And while you are in the vicinity get a copy of his short story collection &quot;Last Days of the Dog-Men&quot;}!"},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Brad Watson's The Heaven of Mercury is set near Faulkner country, both geographically and literarily. Mercury, Mississippi, is undeniably Gothic territory. The book contains mysterious deaths, mismatched lovers, ghosts, voodoo, and necrophilia. In an early scene, one lavished with lovingly elaborate description, young Birdie Wells is surprised by her first moment of sexual release while innocently straddling Bertram, the family dog, during a family gathering around the fireplace. She cries out, and then embarrassed and confused, claims the gentle old dog bit her. I don't think the act technically qualifies as bestiality because the girl is surprised by what happens and the dog's asleep. Still, it's close enough to make me wonder-and the showily precise evocation of the scene is enough to make me nervous. Birdie's two younger sisters, less innocent than she, immediately understand what has happened, and they tease her about it with wicked glee. \\"Giddyup,\\" one of them whispers, and the two sisters run off giggling, while Birdie, reverting to childhood petulance, can only whisper, \\"You just shut up, the both of you.\\"That last exchange captures what's unique about The Heaven of Mercury: how canny and sweet it is. The dark Gothic convention is evoked, indulged, then neatly sidestepped, and the tension is transmuted to broad comedy as the sisters childishly snipe at each other. Even necrophilia is not played for creeps. When the undertaker's son has intimate relations with the body of a schoolmate, the perversion turns into a life-giving act of love that jostles the girl out of her coma. She awakens, rises, and, draped with a sheet, walks out of the funeral home. Instead of coarsening the boy's attitude toward the corpses he works with when he takes over the family business, his one transgression in fact deepens his sense of spiritual commitment to his work.The Heaven of Mercury possesses as sharp an ear for Southern speech, both black and white, as any novel published in the last thirty years--and I recommend it wholeheartedly.What can anybody say about the silly reviewer who referred to the people who blurbed the book as \\"locally famous no-name book blurbers.\\" The blurbers are Barry Hannah, Fred Chappell, Margot Livesey, Richard Bausch, and Gregory Rabassa. Anybody who thinks these fine writers are \\"locally famous no-name book blurbers,\\" doesn't know what she's talking about."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Many readers and reviewers have mentioned William Faulkner in discussing this magnificent first novel, but the comparison is misleading. While Faulkner's brilliance rolls over us in what sometimes feels like an unregulated rant, Watson's polished prose carries us along with it in a rush of dreamlike precision. Surprising, illuminating, dark and funny, this is the novel that everybody's been trying to write."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Hyped where? I only found it because I was at Amazon looking for something new by *Larry* Watson, and this book came up on the \\"People also bought . . . \\" feature.In fact, if I'd seen it at a bookstore, I'd have passed it up because of the back cover blurbs -- they made it sound like a writer's book more than a reader's book. It's not. The writing's good, sure, but never so pretty that it takes you out of the book, makes you remember you're reading.You'll be glad you read this book. It won't change your life, but it *will* add to your enjoyment of it.It's one of those books that will make you smile and cry and be glad that there are people who look at things differently and who have the talent to share their vision and experience."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I have rarely encountered a book which is such an absolute pleasure to read, line for line, page for page. A friend in the US sent it to me recently and I hope it will be published here in the UK soon. This book really must be made available to book-lovers everywhere. So many of the Amazon reviews limit Brad Watson's immense skills as a writer to Southern Gothic or whatever -- that kind of pigeonholing is absurd. This is world-class writing with a Southern accent and universal appeal - utterly humanising, with a magnanimous sweep across time, character, life and death. If you adore books, don't miss this."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"The residents of Mercury, Mississippi are well known to each other, the once brilliant, but now fading remnants of a town that flourished at the beginning of the 20thCentury, now cast aside by progress. The main street of Mercury, formerly the center of activity, now has empty stores, windows boarded and shuttered like the closed eyes of those who have passed away.But Finus Bates is comfortable in Mercury, lived here all of his 89 years, met the love of his life, married another, and outlived both. In anecdotal chapters, Finus leads us through the streets of a Mercury passed, when everyone was young and unaware of the breath of eternity. Finus works at the local newspaper, lovingly typing obituaries for old friends and acquaintances, and hosts a late night radio show, where he reminisces late into the night. Throughout the novel, Finus' voice is as comforting and familiar as the sound of rain pelting the windows.Other characters, written by Watson in true Southern Gothic fashion, are introduced in chapters interspersed with the main drama. These quirky characters have their own appeal, the undertaker with a deep dark secret of his own, the black maid haunted by the wooden dummy locked in a shed and old Vish, maker of spells and potions in the darkest woods.In the summer of 1916, Mercury is peopled with young folks on the cusp of adulthood. Still believing in the future, they are full of promise and hope. That summer Finus falls hopelessly in love with Birdie Wells, while the intrepid Avis Crossweatherly has different ideas for him. Through a lack of assertiveness, Finus loses Birdie to Earl Urquhart. Earl is handsome, arrogant and successful, but, unfortunately, a ladies man. Meanwhile, through her own clever machinations, Avis lures Finus into a marital partnership, in Finus' words, &quot;as a long and unhappy marriage, and more than thirty years would pass before he would truly escape it... what he came to see as a long journey through a tangled wood.&quot; Looking back on his experience with Avis, Finus considers that they may have done the cruelest thing of all, lived their lives, not in love or hate, but with indifference to each other.Like Thornton Wilder's Our Town, The Heaven of Mercury is a paean to small-town America, especially the South. Mercury is an example of the simple life, the face of downtown Anywhere, USA before industrialization and invention forever alter demographics. The people in Watson's novel have lived through almost a century, witnessed immeasurable changes in the name of progress. And although Finus never divorces Avis, his love for Birdie is constant.For anyone at all nostalgic for the long-ago days at the beginning of a new century, when the sounds of nature were louder than the roar of traffic, The Heaven of Mercury is an excellent choice. Finus is an astute guide to the past, with his dignified gentleman's ways, relating the memories of a romantic young man full of dreams. At a time when everything is filtered through the white noise of television, this beautiful novel quietly opens a door to a past that no longer exists, where faded photographs come to life, if only for a while. Luan Gaines/2003."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"This author, a creative writing instructor, hits the jackpot with his luscious descriptive ability. That is almost, but not quite, enough to carry the reader happily through the convoluted and generally boring lives of his main characters, Finus and Birdie. In regards to form, Mr. Watson's interesting insistence on omitting quotation makes the dialogue refresing, thoug a little difficult to follow, and on at least one occasion I read two entire pages before I could figure out which character the narrative was about. In retrospect, a semi-satisfying work that needs a real story line and decent conflict resolution rather than just petering out in the end when everybody get around to dying."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I am very fond of Southern writing.My favotrite is Erskine Caldwell. \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"God's Little Acre\\" are the most well known; but he wrote about 30 other novels as well as numerous short stories.Tennessee Williams and Faulkner are also high on my favorite list. When I saw this book ,the title really didn't grab my attention,what caught my eye was the line at the top of the book;\\"As mystic and miraculous as Faulkner and Marquez. A novel so fine you don't want it to ever end.\\"That is a pretty big claim,and because of my love of the earthy southern way of life,I just couldn't pass it by.Well,what a pleasant surprise.I loved the book and I wholeheartedly agree ;I didn't want it to end either.Watson has a wonderful skill of observation and a fantastic ability to describe people and their thinking,desires,fearshopes,and all other aspects of living and their relations with one another as they go about their trials and tribulations of everyday living.Either he has an unusual imagination,or he has molded his characters in part or whole on people he has known. I suspect it is a combination of both. Anyway,his writing is so convincing ,that one actually gets the feeling that Mercury and these salt of the earth people are real.As I read the book,I found myself pauseing and trying to visualize the people,scenes,buildings,cemetary,and on and on.I have often wished that the author of a novel like this would include photos of real people that would portray his characters.Also pictures portraying buildings,vehicles,etc.\\"Gone With the Wind\\",that great Southern novel,might be used as an example.When I think of that movie ;it is the vision of of Scarlet,Ashley,Butler,Pitipatand all the scenes like the hospital,the mansion,the burning of Atlanta,from the film that give such reality to the story.Overall,I found this a great Southern novel and I fully intend to read more of Watson's writings.How about this for great writing?\\"Poisons invented by the white folks.Black folks don't need no poisons.Why's that?Well,sir,she said,we got the white folks,poison enough.Then she bared her gums,gave that little wheezy laugh.I reckon I can say that nowadays,cain't I.I reckon you can say whatever you want to.She nodded.Ain't always been the case.\\""},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"Not many novelists can get to the heart of the reader as does Brad Watson in The Heaven of Mercury. Of modern writers David Adams Richards, Richard Flanagan and Roth in his recent American trilogy have been able to achieve this by their understanding of their locale and the intricacies of the human heart. William Faulkner understood the place of home in all his great works.What Brad Watson achieves in this brilliant first novel is simply how the place we are brought up in shapes our lives. The attitudes and prejudices are all there. How do we deal with them? If you read this book you will get more than a clue. As a plus it is a great storyThis novel is not, as some of your reviewers have suggested, Souhern Gothic but great literature. How it failed to win the National Book Award is beyond me.

Brad Watson is like a Southern Thornton Wilder but without Wilder's New England primness and need to tie everything up into a neat package.

Then there's this lovely image of a horse: \\"A long, slow fart flabbered from the proud black lips of Dan's hole, and the smoke from it too trailed off in the air.\\" Curiously, intellectuals praise The Heaven of Mercury for how it \\"illumines every accurate detail\\" and delivers \\"just-right words.\\"The Heaven of Mercury is part love story, part murder mystery, and part taste of the South. These parts combine into a dull and dreary text. The love story offers no payoff to the reader. The murder mystery fails outright. It is so loosely developed, there are no clues for the reader to pick up. In the end the omniscient narrator just tells some back story to explain the mystery. As for the taste of the South, it is bland at best.The Heaven of Mercury does make a solid showing as a feminist text. In this book the men are weak, the women are strong.Finally, The Heaven of Mercury is yet another example of how the academic mind disdains plot. Here the story is not told in a linear fashion. A character who dies in one chapter may be alive in the next. This book of 333 pages piddles along to a dubious crescendo (the bathroom scene) near page 200, then for the next 133 pages the author fills in gaps left by the first 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I just want it to be known that Brad Watson has just been nominated for the National Book Award, and he couldn't deserve it more."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I bought this book expecting to like it. I'd read Watson's previous book--the short stories about the dogs--and never really saw what others saw in it, despite its fair to middling notices, and frankly I found Watson a bit of a bigot. This new novel was heralded so I picked it up, and found it--to my continuing surprise at the pre-reviewer's praise-- a hackneyed collection of over-cute colloquialisms, sentimental trash, and a plot-line that lacks drive and is instead anecdotal and spotty. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and even if I did I'd recommend that you wait a few weeks to avoid paying full price, as the book will surely be remaindered soon and available on Ebay for a couple bucks."},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"This guy can write -- if only he could learn the rules of novel writing: conflict, climax, resolution. There's none of that here. What we get instead is a sequence of gorgeously written character studies, with no real story tying them together. Finus, the main character, is an utterly dull and plodding creature, in love with a woman Birdie Wells, who herself isn't very strongly developed. What's so great about her?"},{"Title":"The Heaven Of Mercury (Large Print)","review":"I can not remember being MORE disappointed with a novel. Mr. Watson's run-on approach to describing events did not pull me in but bored me. The main character, Finus, spends his whole life desiring from afar a woman (Birdie) for no other given reason than he saw her naked in the woods when he was 13 years old. There is only a passing reference to her being pretty- and none to her being particularly kind or fun.Mr. Watson's interpretation of a relationship between a black domestic and her white employer was embarrassingly lacking. No nuisances, no subtleties.My last example of the degree to which this novel is pathetic is that the undertaker in this novel has a thing for having sex with dead people, or people who act dead.

This is the first book he actually refers to by name. Each little poem on each page is beautiful in its own way. The mushy (cuddle, hug) is balanced by the practical (make me clean). I disagree with the reviewer who thought the Papa Papa side was not as good.What I especially love is the image and words that refer to breastfeeding. The lovely words (Give me warmth and give me milk) are accompanied by a beautiful illustration of a cheetah nursing.

Too many books concentrate on only one parental relationship - usually mother and child - or present very gender-biased views of the parent's role (eg, \\"Mommy makes the cookies while Daddy plays sports\\").This is not the case with this beautiful book. We bought it on a whim at the San Diego Zoo and now it is one of our - and our son's - favorite books. My husband and I are pleased to read messages about nurturing papa animals and wise mama animals. I'm also happy that there is a picture of a nursing cub since we're still nursing. My son likes looking at the realistically painted pictures of the parent and baby animals. The board book is sturdy enough to withstand his rough love and gnawing.

There are some terrific vignettes in this book, the Christmas one alone would make a wonderful annual TV special. Conversations between the principals sparkle with good humor and much heart. The only problem I had with the book is the two unlikely coincidences at the end of the tale. It's like the author didn't know how to resolve the issue, so he created impossible chance meetings. Not one, but two of them. However, up until this point, the book is as good as any I have read.

The authors' attempts at analysis are brief and shallow. The lack of footnotes or endnotes make deeper investigation difficult to impossible. The authors are unable to keep the text chronological, especially in the transition from the 19th to the 20th century. In any text like this, it is expected to jump back occasionally, but they should be brief with the past event's impact thorougly discussed and analyzed in its proper place in the timeline. Here, the events are discussed at random.The book's two best features occupy the last quarter of the text. The first is a chronolgy of events since 1492. The second is a list of suggested further reading.Overall, the book is worthwhile as an introduction to the subject and to get a feel for the role of relgion in America's history, development and progress, but you will want to eventually supplement it with a more carefully organized and credited work."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"Phillip K. Dick was one of the classic science fiction writers. His 44 novels and numerous short shories have been made into at least seven films. This film, pioneers a new production technique where the movie was shot using live actors and then converted to animation using an advanced technique called interpolated rotoscoping.The story, in company with the title, is pretty dark. The leading character, Bob Arctor is a drug dealer, going progressively insane from the new drug he is taking himself. The policeman chasing him is himself in another alter ego.This book is produced using screen shots from the movie itself. It serves mainly as a keepsake/reminder of the movie along with giving you time to look at the pictures seeing things that you don't see as the movie flys by. For instance in the coffee drinking scene, show in the book on pages 178 - 181 sometimes the girl has earings, sometimes she doesn't."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"Hmmmm... so this is the comic of a movie of a book?

We follow a bumbling band of hallucinating addicts and morally bankrupt agents that are chasing them in one of Dick's darkest and most autobiographical tales.

Dick, I was not surprised to find it in my parents' collection.This book is like no other. I remember it as one of the books that made me sit back and think once I finished, the same thing that happened to me after 1984. And Maus. I don't wish to spoil the book which needs to be read and not described, so I'll simply say that it is worth your while, and that you should read it."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"Scanner Darkly is an interesting, slightly confusing \\"graphic novel\\" version of a story by master Sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick. It has some interesting twists and turns, but sometimes gets bogged down by lengthy stretches of inane dialogue. Nice plot twists toward the end - it felt like it was going to be predictable, and then went another direction, which was refreshing.This Graphic Novel format is not really a graphic novel in the traditional sense of the word. It was not hand-drawn for the book format. It is actually just screen captures from the film itself. Because of this, it felt like it was missing the motion and immediacy of either a motion picture or a true \\"graphic novel.\\" The panels are also too small and don't show all the detail - the book should have been at least the size of a traditional comic \\"trade paperback.\\" I'm not a fan of the rotoscoping method of animation, maybe because it's been overdone in some terrible Charles Schwab TV comercials.I was mildly disappointed by this book- my expectations were probably too high due to the amazing quality of the actual novel, and even the Blade Runner and Total Recall stories. This book is not up to the standard of either the Scanner Darkly film or the actual written novel."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"\\"A Scanner Darkly\\" is, at its heart, primarily a story about drug use and abuse, told by watching Bob Arctor/\\"Fred\\" the undercover narc as he descends further into the murky realm of use and abuse, falling more into the double role until even he doesn't know who he is. With many blackly comic scenes of mind-tripping conversations, the earlier parts of the story mostly focus on Arctor's interactions with his friends and roommates Barris, Luckman and Freck; as the story progresses, more of the story is told from the outside looking in as Fred watches the holoscans.Fred is undercover trying to track the source of Substance D, a highly addictive and deadly drug, which invariably burns out its users. When first Arctor's cephscope and then his car are sabotaged, he begins to think someone is onto him. Of course, Arctor himself inevitably burns out and is placed into a substance abuse clinic. Who is friend, who is foe and who is creating Substance D? These questions are answered as almost an afterthought, with the bulk of the story focused on Arctor/Fred's breakdown.An interesting piece of fiction, if a bit difficult to get through due to the often jarring switches in perspective and topic. Fans of Philip Dick will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"A SCANNER DARKLY's illustrated version of Philip Dick's classic science fiction novel consists entirely of stills from the animated motion picture of the same name, packing into book for a process which uses live action photography and animation.

Uncover police officer Fred is assigned to prevent Bob Arctor from selling the lethally still illegal addictive drug Substance D by finding evidence to arrest the dealer, who unbeknownst to the cop is also a user. Getting nowhere as he cannot even find his target, Fred decides on a dangerous ploy to masquerade as Bob Arctor, which means using Substance D in order to find the proof. What Fred fails to know is that the brain spits into two personalities when abused by Substance D; Fred seeks to incarcerate himself as he already is Bob.This graphic novel of the animated film version of Philip K. Dick's classic science fiction thriller is a superb entry that fans of the author who love this dark tale will appreciate though it is more comic book than novelization thriller. Though the book is fun to follow it seems it will pale as still frame when compared to the action sequences of the movie (about to be released) and is clearly nothing like the real thing. Still even in comic book form, Mr. Dick's dark vision of a drugged future retains the awesomeness of the original.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"i paid considerably more (several dollars) for this hardback adaptation of the film . i consider it money well spent . others will tell you why .

DICK works turned into film . it's hardly a gamble . very interesting ."},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"Science fiction master, Philip K. Dick, passed away in 1982 but his eerie, haunting storytelling has continued to live on in Hollywood through movies like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, and most recently, A Scanner Darkly.All these movies are based on various Dick short stories and novels, and all show a world that's almost normal but also unfathomably out of control. What's especially interesting about the latest film, A Scanner Darkly, is auteur director Richard Linklater's unconventional cinematic take on the story. Using a four-step process known as \\"rotoscoping,\\" Linklater filmed the entire movie with live actors, then overwrote their images with animation and backgrounds to create a sort of hybrid live-action/animated theatrical experience. While the jury is still out on whether or not that process is good filmmaking, one thing is certain: it makes for a dynamic and visually artistic graphic novel. So, using only photo stills from the animated version of the film, Pantheon Books has released A Scanner Darkly: A Graphic Novel as a companion book to the original novel and film.While it's not unusual to see a science fiction story rendered in graphic novel form (such as Star Wars, Serenity, Aliens, and others), it's something unexpected to see a graphic novel that is almost literally the entire movie affixed to the printed page. The artistic result is stunning (and don't worry, we'll talk about the story itself in a moment). Every page of this hardcover, prestige package of Linklater's film is impossible to ignore. Like the movie, this book \\"stars\\" Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, each one presented in near-lifelike stills, frame by frame, from beginning to end of the book. On artistic merit alone, this graphic novel is certainly among the best out there at present and easily deserves an \\"A\\" rating.However, there is more to a book than it's artful, artistic presentation, and that's where A Scanner Darkly falls short. The story is basically this: Seven years in the future a new drug \\"Substance D\\" has penetrated the underground drug scene, becoming the latest lethal addiction of choice. Fred (Keanu Reeves) is an undercover police officer trying to track down the source of this deadly drug, and in the process has set his targets on drug dealer, Bob Arctor, and his circle of addict friends. What Fred doesn't know is that he himself is a Substance D addict, which has resulted in a split personality and, voila, Fred is also Bob Arctor, drug dealer.Sound a bit convoluted? Well, it is, and it only gets more so. In fact, although Keanu Reeves plays this same guy throughout the story, he is alternately named Fred, Bob, and even Bruce. Winona Ryder plays Bob's girlfriend (SPOILER ALERT) and also his masqueraded superior officer in the police force. Robert Downey Jr. (spouting some of the most interesting dialogue of the story) is James Barris, who is either a criminal mastermind and the true brains behind Substance D, or just a pathetic addict with delusions of grandeur. And all these folks roll around in the squalid fringes of society, needing their next fix just to cope, paranoid, irrational, prone to frightening and absurd hallucinations, and doomed to be forever under the control of the drug that was supposed to free them. And, of course, a government conspiracy lurks in the background...The passion and lesson behind Philip K. Dick's story here are evident: Drugs are deadly. The story, however, just doesn't measure up to Dick's other trippy masterpieces like Minority Report or Blade Runner. The characters are so earnest in their self-destructiveness and the plot elements often seem contrived, as if Dick is practically shouting, \\"Look! Don't let this happen to you!\\" While the sentiment is admirable (and encouraged by this reviewer!), the heavy-handed literary style makes this story feel unsatisfying.As with all Philip K. Dick works, there are some impressively creative elements in this story, however. The futuristic \\"scramble suits\\" that hide a cop's identity by flashing millions of recorded faces in seconds are a cool idea. Also, in an interesting side story, one character (\\"Charles Freck,\\" played by Rory Cochrane) commits suicide only to find that his hellish eternity is to be spent laying in bed listening to an otherworldly creature recite every trivial sin he's ever committed--an experience not so much frightening as it is mind-numbingly boring, like listening to an endless reading of the phone book or math equations. This brief, subversive view of hell resonates more with the reader than all the previous attempts at portraying the bleakness of a junkie's life in A Scanner Darkly. Had Dick brought that kind of storytelling to the book as a whole, this review would be a much different affair.Overall, A Scanner Darkly is a both an artistic masterpiece (thanks to Richard Linklater) and (by Dick's standards) second-rate storytelling. Fans of Philip K. Dick may want to read this just to get a glimpse of the author's sorrow and passion. Most others will prefer the more tightly written works like Minority Report.One final caution before you (or your teens) read this book. Remember that as a film, A Scanner Darkly was rated R for drug and sexual content, language, and a brief violent image. Since this graphic novel is made entirely from photo stills in the film, it also contains those same elements, including partial nudity, frequent profanity, drug recipes, and graphic depictions of the harsher side of a drug addict's life. While not always gratuitous, these elements may be offensive for many readers, so please be aware of them.BOOKBLOG RATING:Artistry: AStory: C+--MN"},{"Title":"A Scanner Darkly [Graphic Novel]","review":"I may be living in a box because I had not heard of this book or the movie before I found the graphic novel. When I saw it was based on a Philip K. Dick book I was hopeful - after all, he is the author of such thought-inducing works as \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" (A.K.A. \\"Blade Runner\\") and he is the inspiration for \\"Minority Report\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" (Not the \\"Total Recall\\" is as deep as the other two, but there are some themes that the three share, including a caste system based on birth, be you an android, a mutant or someone who can see the future).What I hoped would be a thoughtful commentary on the \\"War on Drugs\\" and/or the damage that drugs do to the user turned into a rambling work of several episodes in the lives of some druggie pals and the undercover narc officer who has caught himself in the web of addiction. Sometimes funny, usually odd, this book just never lived up to the other Philip K. Dick works mentioned above. It never gelled, it never reached that critical mass where it started to make commentary on the folly of drug use, or the folly of empowering our government to go after users, etc.Much like its characters, this book never really got off the couch and did anything, despite a series of fits and starts in which I thought that it might finally be going somewhere.I give it a D+."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This was another one of those books which I couldn't put down- to use the cliche. But I admit that this latest Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mystery had me hooked.Like the other books in this series, the plot centers on the historical and political climate of 1893. The city of London, from the highest people in society, are brought to life here, and often, unexpectedly, rub shoulders (for instance, grand dame Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould eating in the kitchen at the Pitt house). What I found truly amazing was the way in which Perry, yet again, was able to make these interactions seem ordinary.The action of this story begins in Myrdle Street, where a row of houses is blown up. The police, including Special Branch and Thmas Pitt, follow a group of men to a house in Long Spoon Lane, where a shoot out commences- ending with one dead body and an injured constable. The dead man, the son of a figure in society, appears to have been deeply involved in an anarchy plot.However, as Perry constantly proves to her readers, nothing is ever as it seems, and soon it becomes apparent that the bomb was intended for a police officer who had been involved in some localized police corruption. Pitt investigates and finds that this corruption stretches to all levels of the police force- all the way up to Commander Wetron of the Bow Street Police Force, where Pitt worked for a time. Wetron is angling to make himself the most powerful man in England by passing several reform bills in parliament which will give police the right to search people's houses and questions their servants- with their permission. If this bill is passed, it will mean the end of personal freedom.Added into the mix is Charles Voisey, member of Parliament and former head of the Inner Circle, of which Wetron is rumored to currently be head. Unexpectedly, Voisey approaches Pitt to help him get rid of Wetron. \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" Voisey repeats, and this statement is true of everything that happens in this excellent novel. Could Voisey be using Pitt, and then get rid of Pitt after they have vanquished Wetron?Charlotte Pitt, her sister Emily, Gracie, and Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould become involved once again in the policework- though they are constantly reminded that this is a case that is way too dangerous for them to be involved in. But the three women add wonderful perspective to the novel, and give us an excellent picture of the lives of women at varying positions in society. I thoroughly enhoyed this novel, as well as the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series, and can't wait for more from Anne Perry!"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"By the summer of 1893, the English have become concerned with the bombing activities of the Anarchists who set explosions recently in London and Paris. A tip has come into the Special Branch, whose mission is to stop terrorists, claiming a bomb is set to go off in East London. Special Branch Chief Victor Narraway and Agent Thomas Pitt rush to the area; they capture two of the bombers. A third, a parliament member's son, is killed.Pitt investigates the crime in an effort to learn who murdered the third prisoner. As he conducts an internal investigationt of the affairs of his office and the police as a whole, Pitt uncovers vast corruption with Bow Street Inspector Wetron of Bow Street seemingly as the untouchable chieftain protected by the highest levels of government. Meanwhile the media goes on a feeding frenzy demanding the arming of Bobbies and invoking patriotism insisting more power granted to law enforcement to intimidate suspected terrorists. Only a devil's deal with his enemy Sir Charles Voisey might stop Wetron from taking advantage of the public fervor, which seems to make this mastermind even more potent and deadly.Highly regarded for her terrific historical mysteries, Anne Perry may have written her most relevant late nineteenth century police procedural in LONG SPOON LANE. The story line is action-packed from the moment the two Special Branch cops race to Myrdle Street to prevent a bombing and never slows down as the hero learns how deep corruption and greed extend in the force. Charlotte, Pitt's wife, plays a lesser role than she did in SEVEN DIALS, but no one will mind as the parallels of 1893 England to modern America is uncanny.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Inspector Pitt returns for an exciting adventure in Victorian England. I won't rehash the plot others have covered. This story benefits from the strengthened relationship of Pitt with his two principal colleagues, Sergeant Tellman and Superintendent Narraway. Pitt and Tellman finally become a real team founded on mutual respect. And the rough edged Narraway softens a bit, avoiding the hackneyed nasty boss syndrome of so many police procedurals.The underlying theme of the conflict between domestic terrorism and homeland security excesses is credible, timely, and well handled here. It is also based on fact, as Anarchy was a major threat in late 19th Century Europe."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This particular series of Anne Perry's is a long-running one and a very good one, and this particular book surpasses some of the later ones even though those were good as well. It is easy to see after reading this book why Ms. Perry is a master of her particular genre. Her books are faultless, and the suspense that she creates in her world is unrelenting. This book has enough espionage, anarchy, murder and bluffs and double bluffs to keep even the most jaded reader's interest. I cannot stress enough how good this series is, and Ms. Perry continues to get better and better. In this book we see Pitt partnered with one of his sworn enemies in order to stop full-scale police corruption. He knows all along the danger that he is in by playing this double hand, but the alternative is one that Pitt cannot let happen, so he teams up with Voisey, who he so neatly check-mated in the last book. Voisey is a very dangerous enemy to have, but Pitt adheres to the adage \\"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\\". Pitt is still working with Narraway in Special Branch, and this special group is trying to stop the deadly bombings that are occurring in London. At first glance it appears that known anarchists are responsible for these bombings, but as Narraway, Pitt and Tellman continue in their investigation, they uncover secrets and corruption that go deep into the highest echelons of the police service. But this anarachy plotline is only one of the plotlines or balls that Ms. Perry so expertly juggles. She tosses out a lot of plotlines as well as some red herrings, and then carefully brings them all in to a final, satisfactory conclusion at the end book. And she does this without dropping one ball."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"One early summer night in 1893, Victor Narraway, the head of Special Branch, awakens Thomas Pitt with an urgent message: There is a bomb threat from unknown anarchists. Racing to the scene, they find people being evacuated and explosions tearing buildings apart.Narraway and Pitt chase after fleeing suspects and end up in the tenements at Long Spoon Lane. Pitt, new to the Special Branch, feels clumsy. He finds himself in a huge gunfight and shooting at a fellow human for the very first time.Inside the building they find two live anarchists and one dead man, Lord Landsborough's only son, Magnus. It's obvious to Pitt that because of the dead man's position, the police couldn't have shot Magnus Landsborough. Did his fellow anarchists kill him? Or was it an escaping murderer who was neither a policeman nor an anarchist?When Pitt questions one of the imprisoned anarchists about the motive for the bombing, he exclaims --- with great passion and terror --- that it was in protest over the corrupt police force. His accusations of evil, vicious, greedy policemen encompass the region covered by Pitt's old station. Surely things have not gone so wrong in the year since he left? The anarchist's claim eats away at Pitt. The morality of the organization he has spent his adult life serving is at stake.While the anarchists accuse a policeman of shooting Landsborough, the police believe that a fellow anarchist was the murderer. Pitt puts himself in mortal danger in order to delve into this mystery as well as the distressing question of the corrupt police.Pitt, his wife Charlotte, and their aunt Vespasia are horrified when Lady Landsborough, the mother of the slain man, supports the move to arm policemen, allow them to question servants in secret, and permit them to search people and their homes without just cause. The proposed measures would make the police too powerful, Pitt and his family believe, and destroy the privacy of law-abiding citizens.Pitt's previous co-worker and friend, Samuel Tellman, steadfastly lays his job and life on the line to assist Pitt while Pitt's old despised enemy, Charles Voisey, appears to be his ally. However, Pitt knows that Voisey is untrustworthy and full of revenge toward Pitt. Is Voisey setting him up?There is much to love in LONG SPOON LANE. The characters are subtly many-layered. Fans of this series, with its amazingly well-drawn historical details, know the delight of time traveling back to Victorian England, while the question of police power against terrorist activity continues to be a timely theme. Unexpected plot points and well-crafted motivations enliven a plot that plods a bit at times, challenging readers as the characters engage in a few too many conversations that sometimes cover previously covered ground.Although I felt that more action would have balanced the slow parts of the story, I found LONG SPOON LANE to be an altogether intriguing and enjoyable mystery.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anne Perry must have had some lofty goals when she began writing LONG SPOON LANE. This book deals with a Parliament thinking about giving its police force unparalleled powers to invade the privacy of its citizens, including interviewing servants without their masters' knowledge.A group of anarchists bomb a building and Thomas Pitt's Special Branch tracks them to Long Spoon Lane, where a gun battle ensues. One of the anarchists is killed in the process, apparently from inside the building. When another blast occurs, the Patriot Act of the 1890s seems to be a foregone conclusion.Thomas Pitt enlists the age of an old adversary, Sir Charles Voisey, to argue against the bill in Parliament. Voisey's enemy, Inspector Wetron of Bow Street, is the head of the Inner Circle, a group of corrupt policemen, politicians, and businessman who work together to achieve political power. Voisey was formerly the head of the Inner Circle and wants revenge against Wetron. Charlotte doesn't trust Voisey, but Pitt has no choice than to work with him.Charlotte's great Aunt Vespacia is also involved as the dead anarchist was the son of a former romantic interest, Lord Landsborough. She had helped to thwart Voisey in a precious episode.What hurts the book is the constant repetition. With Charlotte; Aunt Vespacia; Narraway, the head of Pitt's Special Brance; Voisey; and Pitt's old colleague from Bow Street Tellman involved, Perry is constantly having one character explain things to another character. The reader already knows and the pace is slowed considerably. Thomas Pitt also seems to have more lives than the proverbial cat; he avoids life-threatening situations with improbable regularity.It's been awhile since I've read one of the Thomas Pitt/Charlotte series, but Gracie, the Pitt's maid still lights up the stage whenever she appears. Tellman is courting her, so that gives Perry a reason to bring her on. She has a heavy Cockney accent, but she adds comic relief.LONG SPOON LANE is twenty-fourth in the series, getting a bit long in the tooth. Perhaps an episode with Gracie as the central character would add a bit of spice."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Having caught a second wind, Perry continues what she started in Seven Dials by taking familiar characters to new and exciting places (psychologically speaking.) She's really revitalized the series. However, I wonder if she's switched editors with this one, and for the worse. I noticed a large number of typos and either clunky or downright erroneous wordings that never existed in the previous Pitt novels. It was distracting enough for me to knock one star off my review."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I'm not sure how she does it, but Anne Perry always seems to be able to deliver a Thomas & Charlotte Pitt installment that's absorbing, riveting and simply brimming with historical detail and ambiance. Certainly very few can write so intelligently and capably and also imbue the characters they create (whether they are the chief protagonists or not) with so much depth, strengths and frailties so that it is not only easy for one to empathise with them, but they often feel almost lifelike. And the wonderful simplicity with which the often intricate plot always comes together! Need I gush on?In \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" Pitt once again finds himself coming up against the Inner Circle (a secret organisation that thirsts for complete and absolute power). When his work with the Special Branch brings him face to face with police corruption. And even though he's no longer part of the Metropolitan Police Force, the charge of corruption to the institution still cuts him to the quick. So that in spite of the danger to him and his family, Pitt is determined to bring down these corrupt policemen -- never mind that they're part of the Inner Circle! Fortunately for Pitt he has the able help of his one time assistant, Sergeant Tellman and his superior at the Special Branch to rely on -- and of course the unofficial assistance of wife, Charlotte and Lady Vespasia. It's the ultimate battle between good and evil, and Pitt is determined to win...It's been a while since I've read an \\"unputdownable\\" and \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" definitely was one. From the very first page, when the bomb goes off through the succeeding chapters where Pitt realises that he's battling powerful and ruthless men with an agenda to the very last page where Pitt prevails almost against all odds, you could feel the tension and the suspense. I'll readily admit that I was totally impressed with the manner in which Anne Perry was able to maintain the tension and suspense without once losing ground. Surely that must be one of the trademarks of an excellent storyteller. I was also impressed with the fact that \\"Long Spoon Alley\\" dealt with some of the same issues that we're coming face to face with today: the loss of privacy and the call for increased powers to law enforcement, and thought that the author dealt with these issues in an intelligent and sensitive manner. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can recommend it as a completely riveting and terrifically suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"The first comment that I must make on this book is that one of the lines on the back cover by \\"Booklist\\" review, is the most spot on that I've ever seen. It says \\" Like reading Thackeray edited by Elmore Leonard\\" and that statement is exactly right...wish I'd thought of it! In Victorian London, former Superintendent Thomas Pitt has now been seconded to the Special Branch, to deal with the growing threat of anarchy. It's a sideways move for him as he has run foul of the corrupt Inspector Wetron of Bow Street. For the most part, the anarchists are well meaning but misguided young men who are convinced that all authority is corrupt, especially that of the police. They are encouraged in these beliefs by unscrupulous officials who are seeking to feather their own nests and to follow their own agendas by urging these poor, deluded young men to acts of violence and public terror. Pitt and his old adversary, Sir Charles Voisey, call a temporary truce to get to the centre of the ring of corrupt police, who are financing their terrorist attacks. The story bears a frightening similarity to todays' state of alarm (not with any polce connection), and is a grippeing and absorbing read."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I've been annoyed for some time -- for the past dozen volumes in this generally first-rate series set in London of the 1880s and \`90s -- that the author had served her readers so poorly by inventing the Inner Circle, a secret society trying to take control of Great Britain. The conspiracy became a deus ex machina upon which Perry could blame anything, which removed the necessity of proper plot construction, and Pitt stopped being a cop and became a secret agent, a sort of ur-Bond, in the employ of Special Branch. Sir Charles Voisey, the head of the Inner Circle, especially, was presented as the personification of melodramatic evil -- Snidely Whiplash with a nice house, servants, and a carriage. Pitt (and his boss, Narraway) orchestrated Voisey's fall from power, in any case, and in this somewhat wild-eyed volume, Voisey's rival, Superintendent Wetron, spins his own conspiracy: A group of anarchists (read \\"terrorists\\") are accused (justly) of blowing up houses and (unjustly) callously killing civilians. Wetron's motive is to ensure passage of an Act of Parliament giving the police greatly increased firepower, as well as enormous stop-and-search powers and the authority to enter private homes and ask any questions they like. \\"Snatched from the headlines,\\" as they say. (I imagine Perry is no fan of the present U.S. neocon administration.) The immediate result is to push Pitt and Voisey into a grudging and very suspicious partnership in order to defeat the bill, each for his own reasons. That part of the story is quite well done in its depiction of the very opposite characters of the two men -- and Perry makes up for the unbelievability of much of the rest of the plot by rather decisively killing off the entire Inner Circle conspiracy at the end. Ya-hoo!"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Special Branch Investigator Thomas Pitt must find out who killed Magnus Landsborough, a young anarchist whose group has just bombed a house in an ordinary working class London neighborhood. It's apparent to Pitt from the start that someone within the group committed the murder, an idea that the two anarchists he arrests find shocking. Pitt soon discovers that the anarchists' target was the home of a corrupt police sergeant, which infuriates the former police inspector and even more enrages his friend and former subordinate, Bow Street's Sergeant Tellman, who continues courting the Pitts' maid, Gracie. The last person on earth Pitt would choose to work with is Sir Charles Voisey, a man who not long ago tried to hire the murders of Pitt's family - wife Charlotte, their two children, and Gracie. But for this investigation, he needs Voisey and Voisey needs him. How far can he trust the man, though? That is the question on which Pitt's safety rests....I have to admit that I enjoy the earlier Pitt novels more than the later ones, as far as the cases are concerned. I prefer the more straightforward plots, \\"whodunnits\\" of sorts, to these more recent books built around conspiracies. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Tellman as a major character; and Gracie is always a treat. Perry's gift for portraying the various levels of Victorian society really shines in this novel. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anne Perry has an exceptional talent for bringing the atmosphere of the bygone days to life.Her characters are vivid and memorable. The trouble is that sometimes her plots leave a lot to be desired, and her penchant for details can suffocate the story.This novel suffers from that problem. The trials and tribulations with the Inner Circle are becoming very repetative, and occasional splash of Victorian melodrama cheapens the integrity of the book. There are too many faces that turn purple and blotchy red or white and ashen gray, and far too many sighs and exclamations. Writing three or four books a year, unfortunately affects the quality."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Thomas Pitt is now a member of the Secret Branch having been forced out of Bow Street when Inspector Wetron became the head of the Inner Circle. When anarchists bomb homes, the head of the anarchists is murdered, and members of Parliament are lobbying for a bill to arm the police and allows ad hoc searches and questioning of servants, Pitt is forced to work with his enemy Sr. Charles Voisey to find out who is behind it all.I had actually put off reading this book thinking \\"Oh no, another Inner Circle story,\\" but am so glad I finally picked it up and then I didn't stop until I'd finished it. Perry is a masterful writer and an expert at using an historical incident as the nucleus of a compelling and suspenseful story. It is also timely as it deals with some of the issues of government access and privacy that are in today's news. The plotting is impeccable; the story has several threads and good red herrings all of which are effectively tied up at the end. The usual wonderful characters with strong interconnected relationships are here, but it is the interaction between Pitt and Voisey that is particularly effective. No one creates sense of time and place in Victorian England better than Ms. Perry. She educates, entertains and makes you think. I would read the series in order but feel this book is one of the best."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Thomas Pitt is invited to Long Spoon Lane just before anarchists release bombs in the neighborhood.

Thomas is distressed to learn that the anarchists may be involved with crooked police who are extorting money from businesses in the neighborhood. He finds himself allied with Charles Voisey, an old enemy who promises to help him find the guilty parties and to oppose an act of Parliament which would give guns to policemen. The plot slows down in the middle of the book, but begins moving more rapidly towards the end as author Perry weaves an intricate web of deceit in which no one knows who is a friend and who is an enemy. She also paints a wonderful background of Victorian England in which the reader is treated to sights, sounds, and smells which bring that era alive."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anne Perry takes us back to when anarchists scared the world as they idealistically sought to blow up civilization \\"to free people\\" from the laws that bind us. The parallels to bombings in London during \\"the troubles\\" in Northern Ireland and daily bombings in Moslem countries around the world are startling. You come away feeling like the hue and cry are there to serve selfish interests as much as idealistic ones.The book's plot takes many interesting twists and turns as Pitt continues to find himself as an outsider at Special Branch as well as in relations with his old colleagues at the Metropolitan Force and his various enemies such as Sir Charles Voisey and Inspector Wetron of Bow Street.Someone is blowing up London with dynamite. Can Pitt stop it in time?In the background, shadowy Parliamentary wrangling takes place to introduce laws that could be perverted to make the aristocrats vulnerable to blackmail.Charlotte's great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, and Tellman have exciting roles in the story.Victor Narraway also becomes a slightly more interesting character as well.I thought this was the best of the recent Thomas and Charlotte Pitt stories and commend it to you."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Deeply resonant with just a hint of British about it, Michael Page's voice is perfectly suited to this Victorian thriller. Listeners may tend to think that history does indeed repeat itself as they find London at the mercy of terrorists and police corruption.When intrepid, intelligent Thomas Pitt is called to immediately report to Long Spoon Lane, he has no idea of the mayhem he'll find. Unknown parties, anarchists in all probability, have set off bombs that destroy modest homes and kill the innocent. Very quickly, almost in the opening segments, two of the bombers are caught, and one shot.As if this carnage weren't enough Pitt soon discovers that the police are more than corrupt, and the worst of that lot may be Inspector Wettron.

(Patriot Act, anyone?). I liked the theme of Pitt's having to cooperate with archenemy Voisey, but Thomas comes perilously close to James Bond territory in his miraculous escape. What bothered me was Tellman. In the previous book he was Inspector; now he is Sergeant. Did Wetron bust him or is this just sloppy editing? Inquiring minds want to know. And I couldn't believe Wetron trusted him as far as he did Still, an absorbing read."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Long Spoon Lane: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel, by Anne Perry was another excellent mystery set in Perry's evocative Victorian setting. The mystery in this novel was not of the \\"knock your socks off who would have ever thought it\\" type. It was, rather, a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government's response to the terrorists' acts. It was very interesting to read about a piece of legislation that some of the characters supported. The legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes. The obvious allusion to America's Patriot Act and the debate it has spawned is an excellent piece of the overall picture.This book focused on Thomas primarily, and his relationship with one of his true enemies. His Professor Moriarty if you will.I recommend this book and give it a solid and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I sent this to my mother who is in her 80's and has been an Anne Perry fan for many years.

Thomas Pitt and Victor Narraway, both with the Special Branch dealing with the safety of England, are dispatched to diffuse the situation. Two anarchists are arrested, but a third lies dead of a gunshot wound to the head apparently shot by one of his comrades. The two arrested anarchists vehemently deny culpability instead accusing the police of brutality. The investigation once again leads Pitt into the workings of the sinister Inner Circle, and back into the sphere of his archenemy and bitter rival, Charles Voisey.Anne Perry writes an excellent accurately depicted Victorian London series. The setting is a gritty, realistic portrayal of the times. The characters are evolving, and fully fleshed out human beings. The plot is suspenseful without being overly complicated. My one complaint is that the book is very much a continuation in a series. A first time reader would have trouble understanding who most of the people are since Anne Perry spends little or no time in introducing them."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Having read all of the Pitt-series books (as well as the Monk books), I was very happy with this one. The last several have been less than satisfying, especially the endings ... it seemed as if the author got tired with the story and just wrapped it up to be done with it. In this book, however, the writing was good all the way through, and the story one of the best yet. I hope Ms. Perry can maintain this standard, and will keep writing both series for a long time!"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me."},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"This novel is one of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series, a favorite of mine. It's the Victorian era in London and in this story Thomas has been removed from the police in Bow Street to work in Special Branch. I love the characters, not only Thomas and Charlotte, his wife, but her aunt Lady Vespasia, the Pitt's servant girl Gracie, and Gracie's fiance Tellman who used to work with Pitt at Bow Street.In this story anarchists are bombing poor neighborhoods and no one can understand why. As Pitt responds to a bombing, he and his boss Narraway follow the bombers to Long Spoon Lane where a shoot-out ensues. Afterward, a body is found and identified as the son of a member of Parliament who just happens to be a friend of Lady Vespasia's. What was he doing with the anarchists? Was he a hostage? Surely he couldn't have been one of them.The investigation unearths police corruption in several stations including Bow Street which involves some high officials. Not knowing who to trust, except Tellman, Pitt sets out to get at the root of the problem and discovers very disturbing evidence. As usual, Lady Vespasia plays a vital role in the investigation.Along the way as you read Perry's books you learn about Victorian London. There are scenes with the wealthy and powerful and others with the poorest of the poor. Tellman takes Gracie to the theater and you see what appealed to the masses at the time. There are scenes along the Thames and others in the slums, then the scene shifts to a drawing room of a wealthy family. I love this kind of thing and Perry is an expert at putting the reader right into each setting.I dread the day I run out of Perry novels to read so I save them for just the right time. This one was certainly worth the wait.Source: Trade with friendRecommended reading"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Anything to do with Thomas & Charlotte Pitt written by Anne Perry is a winner for me. &#34;Long Spoon Lane&#34; definitely fits that category"},{"Title":"Long Spoon Lane (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","review":"Set in the late 1800s in England, the story starts off with the bombing of a building and the murder of one of the anarchists believed to be behind the bombing plot. Thomas Pitt of Special Branch is brought in to investigate the bombing and the murder. This starts a long path where Pitt's investigation reveals corruption in the police force and the government. He uncovers that the bombing and the murder were all about an attempt to pass a bill that would give the police more power.Although the mystery aspect of this was well done and much of the plot was compelling, the underlying reason behind all of this seemed really silly, making it hard for me to ever get into the story. The characters in the story made such a big deal about a bill that would allow police to carry firearms. My reaction as I was reading was what's the big deal? Of course, police officers should be able to carry firearms. Going up against armed criminals equipped with nightsticks would be ridiculous. The characters also raised a big stink about the police being allowed to question the servants of rich folk. God forbid, these ultra rich, high and mighty people would have their servants be allowed to answer questions about possible criminal wrong doing. The last time I checked anybody can be questioned if a commoner is suspected of a crime.

This particular play is a treatise on Ibsen's ideology. In it Ibsen is putting forth his very liberal ideas and he does not spare anyone. Both liberals and conservatives are blasted in this play that points out clearly that any individual does not stand a chance if he tries to go public with his ideas, especially if those ideas go against the majority opinion. Yes, it is a militant play, but it is also a comedy that shows real pathos and warm humour."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote An Enemy of the People in fury, after how the critics treated his previous play Ghosts. He had expected the so called Liberal press to receive Ghosts with a some what greater understanding. Instead he found himself &quot;fighting at the outposts of thought&quot;, while the Liberal press were slaves of their subscribers' opinions and following them instead of leading them. An Enemy of the People were written with satirical intention, but became one of his most brilliantly crafted social dramas. I have read it several times and admire every page of it. Ibsen was ahead of his time then, and in many respects still ahead of our time. A solid five stars!"},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Ibsen's play, An Enemy of the People is a classic example of the decision that must be made between telling the truth and doing what is right. Dr. Stockmann faces an extreme moral delema. It really made you wonder; what would I do in this situation? Would you be able to trade everything (your position, money, house, and reputation) just to be able to tell the truth? Even though by not letting it out you could become very popluar. This situation is applicable to many situations in real life ranging from events happening at a high school to things in the government. Even though it was written 150 years ago, Ibsen's characters' problems are still reflected all over the world, making this play a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Dr. Stockman is portrayed as the protagonist who champions himself as the herioc individual who makes a bleak discovery about the community. He thunders to announce the new discovery against the wishes of his opposition Mayor Peter Stockman. Dr. Stockman is characterized as the man of nobility at the beginning of the play and as the plot begins to unfold the townspeople denounce him as an enemy of the people. Mrs. Stockman's character is portrayed as submissive. Will she patiently await the distruction of her entire family? Will Dr. Stockman sacrifice his personal beliefs for the welfare of his family?"},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"This book is definitely not the most exciting book in the world. Enemy of the People has a specific point, a message it is trying to reveal. Dr. Stockmann loses the support of his entire town after finding out that the local baths are contaminated. Just to make things worse, his brother, Peter, is mayor and actually manipulates the situation to turn the press against him. This play shows how the majority is often wrong and, more importantly, that the strongest man is the one who can stand alone. What made this book lose a star is that, in fact, the first act takes a lot to finish because it appears to be so boring. I may have put this book away if I didn't have to read it. However the book quickly improves and, although it is never exciting, it is interesting."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"&quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, has been published as part of the Dover Thrift Edition series (that's the version I read for purposes of this review). The Dover edition is a republication of an anonymous translation. The back cover data notes that the play was first staged in 1883.&quot;Enemy&quot; tells the story of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a medical officer for his town's public baths. When he discovers that the baths are contaminated and pose a health hazard, he is led into conflict with his brother Peter, who is the town's mayor. The tension increases as the drama moves towards its conclusion.&quot;Enemy&quot; is an intriguing piece of literature. While reading it I was struck by how similar the story is to that of the classic film &quot;Jaws&quot;: in both stories, a political leader is at odds with an idealistic public servant who is concerned about a danger involving public waters!The play contains much thought-provoking dialogue. Ibsen looks at the interrelationships among politicians, the press, science, and the general public. His characters question issues of truth, authority, and majority rule. Dr. Stockmann begins as a noble character, but I thought he becomes too over-the-top and in some scenes is reduced to a shrill, dogmatic cartoon (especially when he delivers a bizarre rant about poodles and hens). I honestly wasn't sure what Ibsen was trying to accomplish in some of the doctor's more outrageous dialogue.Still, &quot;Enemy&quot; remains a compelling piece of art. For an intriguing companion text, try &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, which has some similar themes and motifs."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Have you ever watched a movie or play, and at the end of it you say, &quot;I don't get it&quot;? ---&gt; But everyone around you says it was the greatest thing they have ever seen... well, I will not pretend to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ibsen was way over my head with this book.Superficially the book was extremely interesting from the standpoint of: will one man be willing to stand up to a city when he knows what is right? In our story, the protagonist has discovered that the Norwegian baths are filled with a poisonous organism. However, when he voices this, the entire town goes against him because it will cost them economically, and they put the pressure on him to refute that which he knows is correct. From that standpoint - the book is excellent... and we are held to find the outcome.Where it lost me personally was when Ibsen went on his political diatribe. He further alienated me via his pages of discussion on liberalism in a manner that seemed conservative to me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these speeches as well, and they admittedly felt more contemporary Republican than Liberal Democrat.In the end, I would have to recommend this book, but say \\"Feel free to not understand.\\" It is okay to embrace that not everything is clear, and at times his points are lost on minds as dull as mine. Embrace your ignorance, and enjoy it for what it is"},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Henrik Ibsen is the father of modern drama and his 1882 drama \\"An Enemy of the People\\" (\\"En folkefiende\\") was one of his more controversial works. In the play Dr. Stockmann discovers that the new baths built in his town are infected with a deadly disease that requires they should be closed until they can be repaired. However, the mayor of the town (the Burgomaster), who is Stockmann's brother Peter, rejects the report and refuses to close the baths because it will bring about the financial ruin of the town. When Dr. Stockmann tries to make his case to the people of the town, the mayor counters by pointing out how expensive it would be to repair the baths and dismisses the doctor for having wild, fanciful ideas. At the public meeting Dr. Stockmann is declared \\"an enemy of the people\\" by the Burgomaster.To really appreciate this particular Ibsen play you have to look at it in the context of his previous dramas, because they all represent a conflict between the playwright and his critics. In 1879 Ibsen's play \\"A Doll's House\\" (\\"Et dukkehjem\\") was produced, wherein the character of Nora pretends to be a silly little wife in order to flatter her husband, who is revealed to be a hypocritical fraud. The idea that a woman would leave her husband and children was seen as being outrageous and basically obscene. Ibsen upset his audience and critics even more in his next play, \\"Ghosts\\" (\\"Gengangere\\"), an 1881 drama that again attacks conventional morality and hypocrisy. The topic is of congenital venereal disease but the true subject is moral contamination. Mrs. Alving has buried her husband, a degenerate who has left behind a son dying from syphilis and an illegitimate daughter who is probably going to end up being a prostitute. The play ends with Mrs. Alving having to decide if she should poison her son to put him out of his misery or let his agonies persist.Again, Ibsen was attacked for outraging conventional morality. The following year after \\"Ghosts\\" the playwright responded with \\"An Enemy of the People\\" and the character that is most identified with representing Ibsen on stage in Dr. Stockmann. The allegory is quite plain when the play is considered within the context of Ibsen's work during this period, although while Stockmann is portrayed as a victim there is a sense of destructiveness to his behavior. At the end of the play Stockman has decided to leave the town, but then changes his mind to stay and fight for those things he believes are right.As is the case with most of Ibsen's classic works, \\"An Enemy of the People\\" speaks to larger issues than those in conflict in the play. The debate is over the bad water pipes at the new baths, but the true conflict is over the clash of private and public morality. Dr. Stockmann is by far the most idealistic of Ibsen's characters, and that fact that he is opposed by his own brother, the Burgomaster, harkens back to Genesis and the fight between Cain and Able. As was the case with \\"Ghosts,\\" there is an ambiguous ending where what happens next can be seen as going either way given your own inclinations as a member of the audience.Both of the Stockman brothers are flawed. Dr. Stockman's idealism is at odds with the practical realities of the world in which he lives while the Burgomaster ignores ethical concerns. Ultimately, Ibsen is not forcing us to choose between the two but rather to reject both in terms of some middle ground. The Burgomaster is certainly old school, believing those in authority get to make all the decisions and that the people must subordinate themselves to the society. But he was the one who made the mistake of putting the new water pipes in the wrong place, so even his claims that he is looking out for the welfare of the community are dishonest. Dr. Stockman argues for individual freedom and the right of free expression, but his attempt to fix the problem ignores any effort at persuasion or building public support. He also seems to take pleasure in be able to show that his brother made a mistake. Still, in the end we have to favor the doctor over the mayor because his integrity is clearly stronger, while still recognizing that his idealism is tragically flawed."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"This powerful play is my first experience reading Henrik Ibsen and WOW! The conflict is timeless and the leading character Dr. Stockmann reminded me of Sir Thomas More.After I read the play I did not want to put the book down and wanted more. I flipped to the front of my edition translated by Christpher Hampton and read his nihilistic introduction. Mr. Hampton missed the whole point and somehow thought Dr. Stockman really WAS the &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Hampton sounded like one of the townspeople from the mob in Act Four when he wrote:&quot;This is to simplify Ibsen's intent; because however sympathetic Ibsen feels towards Dr Stockmann's cause, he is too subtle and profound a dramatist not to know that there are few figures more infuriating than the man who is always right. Stockmann's sincerity, naivety and courage co-exist with an innocent vanity, an inability to compromise and an indifference to the havoc caused in the lives of his family and friends, as well as his own, by his dogged pursuit of principle.&quot;Hampton's edition is a nice size with print that is easy to read. I loved the story and the characters and I highly recommend it to all. I have lived the experience and have been &quot;the enemy&quot; so I understood Dr. Stockmann but I learned from Christopher Hampton and my own experience not everyone will &quot;get it.&quot;"},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (&quot;If you'll just take back what you said...&quot;). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"The action centres around a feud between two brothers -- Dr. Stockmann and his brother, the mayor of a small town in the northern part of Norway. The issue is the contamination of the local baths by bacilli supposed to cause typhoid fever. The Mayor -- (who is an impossible dolt, whose like can hardly be conceived to be a mayor in any European town) -- argues for piecemeal improvements in the bathing facility. Stockmann, whose name is roughly translated into &quot;The Chastiser&quot;, urges the drastic closure of the premisses. The disagreement escalates into a violent altercation, in which the angry townspeople, in support of their mayor, unite and denounce the self-willed Stockmann as &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;. Stockmann is presented by Ibsen as a fiery, stubborn, brutally honest egoist who would &quot;rather ruin his community than see it thrive on lies and fraud&quot; -- an embattled individual who sees himself as a champion of truth in opposition to the stupidity of the herd of cattle. The last act is a highly tense illustration of the follies and indignities to which anyone can be subject for daring to oppose the social norm. Ibsen has Stockmann eventually succeed in discovering that &quot;the strongest man is mightiest alone&quot;, though this is a naively Romantic notion, the consolation of the defeated in the light of the colossal ignorance of one's fellow beings. Overall, an interesting dramatisation of an individual's case against public opinion."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"I saw the play in London at Royal National Theatre and bought the script. (By the way, the same RNT production, directed by Trevor Nunn with sets by John Napier -- the same director/design team for Les Miserables -- with Ian McKellen in the lead role is coming to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, July 14 to Sept 6, 1998. Hampton has created a new version not a literal translation of the late 19th-century classic play -- as Arthur Miller did some years ago. And it works perfectly as a great theatre piece should. The language feels modern and natural which makes the subject matter all the more vital -- particularly as our culture deals with the same environmental issues; and in many ways the same types of reactions from people in authority, including the engineering of mass hysteria and fear. The critic for London's News of the World said of the RNT production, &quot;a tale of corruption, greed and the responsibility of the press...as up to date as this morning's headlines.&quot; I agree. See the play, get the script."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote this play immediately after his play Ghosts was greeted by mass outcries (see my review of Ghosts). Rather than defend himself against charges of immorality, he pointed out that the multitude are wrong.Dr. Stockmann, a stand-in for Ibsen's views, wants to do the right thing, the moral thing, to tell the truth to the people of his town, a truth that they do not want to hear. He is the medical advisor of the town's health baths, baths that brings wealth to the community. He discovers that the bath water is contaminated because the town officials, against his advice, set the pipes in a wrong place, and the water flowing through the area is causing bathers to become sick. The cost of repairing the pipes is enormous and it would take two years to fix them. The doctor is stopped from revealing the problem to his community by the Mayor, his older brother, who was interested in his health, but not in the health of others, who insisted that the doctor be silent because the community wants the money that the baths will bring, doesn't want to pay the large repair costs, and leaving the baths unused for two years would result in a large financial loss to the community.Ibsen dramatizes the situation by making Dr. Stockmann somewhat flawed. The doctor naively persues his quest without using persuasive techniques to win over the town.The town newspaper and the home owners are behind the doctor until the Mayor explains the enormous loss to them. Then, as with Ibsen who described moral problems in Ghosts, the entire town turns against Dr. Stockmann and vilifies him, calling him a lunatic and an enemy of the people. He tries to explain that he is telling the truth, but the town people refuse to see it. The town argues that they are the majority and they determine what is right. This is reminiscent of the Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas, who is not mentioned in the play, who insisted on holding the community and the church above the individual.Stockmann responds that in matters of right and wrong, the individual is superior to the will of the many. In a memorable line, he says, \\"A minority may be right; a majority is always wrong.\\""},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"One of Ibsen's main themes throughout his works is the conflict between the realist and the idealist. Once again in this play Ibsen sets his conflict up beautifully. His main character Dr. Stockmann is realistically created, and opposed ironically by his brother the mayor. The fun truly begins when we get to watch the two brothers fight-one on the side of the public good, the other on the side of personal morality. Throughout the entire book, you question what makes each character tick, and the reading was really an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"An Enemy of the People","review":"Still being many years since this book was written by Henrik Ibsen, the subject covered is very relevant.

It is a short book, therefore many people can read it, without considering it as a \\"waste of time\\".

However, as a scientist, I can't say that it contains anything substantial. The book starts off by claiming to be scientific, objective and not particularly religious but by the end of it the author is literally asking us to beseech the Christian god for help. The book is filled with endless bar charts (not particularly well analyzed, I might add) that really get in the way of whatever point Dr. Hart is trying to get across. Most of the time he assumes that Christian men of faith are, \\"as good as it gets\\" and morally superior to other men. So, whatever problems Christian men are having imply that other 'regular' men must be having it worse. He presents nothing new in the way of tested techniques to help men deal with their sexuality. Instead, we get the usual, \\"try hard not to do it\\" advice we could get from anyone. Unless you're a deeply religious young Christian man having trouble with your libido, I cannot honestly recommend this book. His survey results would have been much more useful if not tainted by his evangelical interpretations.

As the author pointed out in one portion of the book 'just because all men in a given area have decayed teeth doesn't mean that it is a good thing to have decayed teeth, even though it's 'normal' in that area.' This is very important to remember.I had the general feeling that men that have been struggling with areas of sexual sin in their life may use these results as a way to pacify their feelings of conviction, and this is where I have great areas of concern for them, since, as I have already said, we are gambling with eternity. In Matthew 5, Jesus speaks that &quot;if a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart,he has already committed adultery with her&quot; Remember folks, Jesus said this, not an author. He wouldn't have said this if it weren't serious, and real. This statement alone tells us that pornography is ADULTERY, period. That goes whether you are male or female, looking at Playboy, or Playgirl. Sin goes both ways, and so does adultery. I felt that the author's intent was to have men excuse their attractions to pornography as normal, and not a big deal, rather than the real picture - which is what Jesus said 'adultery'; even though the author did indicate that it would be a positive thing to get past these attractions by being open with your spouse about them (which IS very important - sin grows much better in the dark, so exposing these struggles is a much better way to healing), and dealing with them honestly.

The experiences of my life certainly conformed with the author's conclusions.

He posits (quite accurately) that men wonder all the time if what they desire and practice is normal in regards to sex. Dr. Hart's original research on male sexuality draws data from his extensive interviews with men of religious faith as a psychotherapist, his interviews with seminary students, and more than 600 male responders on a specific survey on sexual practices. All the men in his study consider themselves to be religious and of high moral standing. He does not claim to be writing a book about the sexual practices of the average American male, on the contrary, his data paints a picture of one end of the male spectrum - men who are moral, good, and are trying to live honorable lives. I find it surprising, and somewhat comforting, to know that so many men who are trying to be honorable have doubts, fears, secrets, shame, guilt, and a host of other emotions revolving around their sexual lives. Dr. Hart details these emotional responses in this book. The chapter names are as good a description of the book as any:1. Male Sexuality - The Untold Story2. Am I Normal? (Why men question their own sexuality)3. Why MAle Sexuality Goes Wrong (he comes up with a surprising answer).4. How Men Think About Sex (Surprising answers considering the mostly religious males being surveyed)5. What Men Really Want From Sex (And how this differs from what women want from sex)6. Why Men Love/Hate Pornography (The effect of viewing pornography on the male brain and resulting sexual behavior)7. Teenage Sexuality (how to talk to your teen about sex)8. Sex and the Married Man (Sexual problems and norms in the context of marriage)9. Men, Sex, and the Workplace (Especially in regard to temptation and sexual harassment)10. Religion and Sex (How does one's religious training and faith impact sexual practices?)11. Creating a Healthy Sexuality (Dr. Hart speaks frankly to his readers on how to develop a healthy sexual outlook)He also includes an appendix on the heterosexual male experience, and where to get help for sexual problems.The reading and information is intensely interesting. His conclusions and advice are practical, and are more biblically based rather than humanistic.This is a book for all males to read, but expecially targeted for the male who is religious and desires to live an honorable and responsible sexual life. Since males generally do not talk to other males about the details of their sexual lives, this book is a revelation on how religious men think and behave in regards to this highly secretive subject.

There is a freedom to be found when we find out that we are created this way, of course there are abuses of this and guidelines of morality that we should follow. This is a must read for anyone interested in the subject and provides a great source of strength for those struggling with there own sexuality."},{"Title":"The Sexual Man","review":"Can we as christian men and women be honest with ourselves for just one moment please? The stories of sexual guilt within the five fold ministries and layman alike are real and mass produced by the hour. The Sexual Man book reviewed with the Holy bible has echos of healing.The survey hits direct and the anwsers are sobering. Parents should read and discuss this book to better understand the changes in their children from the inside out.The sexual man also deals with real life solutions to many mythical and often misunderstood sexual basics dealing with males.In closing, there are as many sex books on the market as there are grains of sand on the collective beaches globaly, so let's not fool ourselves here ok? For this sexual male there are only 2 books that are to be trusted. One is the Bible and the other is Dr. Archibalds experiance brought to life application book The Sexual Man."},{"Title":"The Sexual Man","review":"I read a little bit of it but what I read I did not find interesting.I was not what I expected,but it might help some people."},{"Title":"The Sexual Man","review":"While this book is admittedly a bit heavy on statistics, graphs and charts, Hart's findings are incredibly insightful into the mysteries, blessings, joys, temptations and struggles of male sexuality. He covers a variety of relevant topics for men and does a good job of keeping his research palatable. There is something beneficial here for men, women, singles and couples."},{"Title":"The Sexual Man","review":"This book is a must read for all Christian men who are burdenend with guilt due to lust.

Here is what former publisher Henry Holt had to say in 1945: &quot;In recent years, Stanley Kunitz has become recognized as one of the most original and thoughtful of our newer poets. His work is not simple, but mature, directly spoken and vigorous.&quot; The same could be said now 55 years later. Here is a morsel to whet the appetite:An agitation of the air, A perturbation of the lightAdmonished me the unloved year Would turn on its hinge that night.I stood in the disenchanted field Amid the stubble and the stones Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me The song of my marrow-bones.Blue poured into summer blue, A hawk broke from his cloudless tower, The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew That part of my life was over.Already the iron door of the north Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows Order their populations forth, And a cruel wind blows.Older than Thomas Hardy (87) or Robert Frost (88) when still writing and publishing quality poetry (now 95 and counting), this is over half a century of incredible textures, tones, colors,imagery, metaphor, soulful expression in stirring lines making what Yeats called &quot;words set to life's music&quot;. If this doesn't light your fire, go find your wood!"},{"Title":"The Collected Poems","review":"These 'Collected Poems of Stanley Kunitz' were put together when the poet was ninety- five years old. He now is approaching one - hundred and his birthday will be celebrated this year, also with another collection of his poetry.There are many reasons for wanting to read such a collection. First of all, it is interesting to see what a person has done in the course of a lifetime of work. As I understand it Kunitz evolved in style from a complex Blakean kind of writing to a more mature and simple style in which personal elements and reflections play a stronger part. Secondly, it is interesting to understand the accumulated ' wisdom' not simply in relation to his own literary craft but also about life and love in general. It is also interesting to see the kind of universes and worlds a person explores in their lifetime, in Kunitz's case these are of course many of the giants of English poetry, but his interests are also in activities like gardening,Jewish mystics, Russian poets of this century, and of course the passions of romantic love.I think that there is something also here which is especially admirable. Faithfulness to the task, the dedication and the ability to work through many years, is a triumph of the human spirit.This gives an added dimension to the enjoyment of the poetry."},{"Title":"The Collected Poems","review":"I heartily recommend this book of poems, and I especially recommend it to the reader who never or rarely ever reads poetry.

The collection is superb."},{"Title":"The Collected Poems","review":"I would say that this is not &#34;lightweight&#34; poetry and sometimes its rather obscure. I will never read his poems just once. His use of language is pure magic. Sometimes I get lost listening to myself read it rather than even try to &#34;figure it out&#34;. Other times, I'm transported by the imagery he conjures. All in all, its challenging and demanding. There are moments of fireworks and moments of despair. Its everything life offers if we are brave enough to face it."},{"Title":"The Collected Poems","review":"Any fan of Kunitz or good poetry in general will love this.

They combine varied length of lines, 2-3 verses, are both rhymed and free-style; SUMMER SOLSTICE is like Prose with a bit of punctuation. SOTTO VOCE has no punctuation, yet simpler and more personally focused!Regardless from each perspective, anyone looking into Stanley's Poetry, may find he becomes less & less an Enigma!

Beginning Spanish for Healthcare Professionals","review":"This little text we have found to be a perfect way for individuals just beginning to work with Spanish to get started. The thing I like about it is that it focuses the learners' effort on those things that are most important without wasting a lot of time and effort on things that will not pay off. As a beginning text aimed at health professionals it accomplishes another very important thing--it covers the basics without talking down to the learner. It works particularly well as a text to support an intensive week of work in Spanish, which is what we used it for.The negatives for using it are few. It has to be considered an introduction--if you're looking for thorough coverage of grammar and vocabulary, this will disappoint you. I was not that excited by the audio CD that accompanied it, but that was of minimal importance for our application.Overall, I would give this a strong recommendation for what it is designed to do."},{"Title":"Que le Duele?

As i started to read the pages and listened to the CD i thought what the hell, give it a try. I was always a banger (RYTHM) and never was able to fingerpick any notes. I have had the book now for about 3 weeks and starting to play a few nice tunes, which make me sound quite good. I've mastered most of the techniques cept for the darn Clawhammer with pinch but that was lesson 17, and by now (3 weeks) im playing accompanyment to simple tunes (greensleeves etc) very competently (OK i'm blushing) I think the book suits a more mature person, a child still needs some help, and i would think the progressive Rythm Guitar is perhaps a better start for a child or raw beginner I had some trouble with the claw hammer section and would like to have seen a few more tunes in the back of the book. There is an interesting 20 (or so) page discussion of arranging Greensleeves, and although it would e fascinating for older guitarist, younger people might find it a little beyond them. However, the way fingerpicking patterns are introduced and progressed, as well as alternative patterns produced, will make anyone not only play fingerpicking style quickly, but each pattern is so very nicely put togheter so that one gets a lot of satisfaction playing them. The book also contains 10 or so finger picking chord progressions, and here my critisism is that it leaves one hungry for more, more , more. All in all, its money well spend. Im rather upset tho that here in Australia the books sell for 2 times the price you pay in the States (about $18) ($27aus) and maybe I should import direct. I wonder which next one to buy, i hope there is a sequel to the finger picking one. Believe me, it is MARVELOUS!!!!!!!!. ."},{"Title":"Progressive Fingerpicking Guitar","review":"I am teaching myself to play guitar and thought this book looked like a good one to use, along with others.My problems with this book (and some other books in the Progressive series) are:- Emphasis on techniques isolated from their use in specific songs. At the end of the day, we practice in order to learn to play songs, and that's the context in which techniques should be presented.- Many of the exercises are harder than they have to be in order to develop the technique. The songs at the end of the book require fingerings that are just beyong what a beginner is going to be able to do. Not that the fingerings are the point of the exercise---they are not. They just get in the way. Guitar students need to crawl before they walk, etc."},{"Title":"Progressive Fingerpicking Guitar","review":"I haven't read this book, but it was refered to me by a good guitar teacher who has played with Joan Biaz.

There is an up-to-date explanation of the Qumran and the Dead Sea Scrolls as related to the New Testament. There are two charts which help clarify the genealogies, and two maps which depict the physical and political geography of the New Testament world. There is also a complete bibliography, chronological table, indexes of names, subjects, and New Testament passages.It is a very well written book. It reads like a fast moving novel, easy to read for the layman and yet scholarly enough for use by those who have a desire to learn indepth the lifestyles and background of the Near East during the time that Jesus of Nazareth walked this earth.It is an exciting adventure in reading,taking the reader into the very heart of the world of Palestine, Egypt, and Syria.

Calling in Elliot Wray - not only his junior in the firm, but the estranged husband of his adopted niece Phyllida - James orders him to come to dinner that evening. This New Year will ring in not only with espionage, but a confrontation between Elliot, Phyllida, and Phyllida's guardian, James' sister Grace, who runs James' household - as good a recipe for disaster as one could hope for in a month of Sundays.So why is James acting like the cat who got the canary?James certainly seems to be taking a malicious pleasure in *something*, but the stolen plans aren't anything to laugh about - and when he makes a formal toast to the family party over dinner, speaking of family loyalty and inviting an unnamed party to confess to something, he really puts a cat among the pigeons: Albert Pearson, distant cousin, perfect secretary, and young to be such a crashing bore; James' solid nephew Frank Ambrose; Frank's wife Irene, fretting herself into premature middle-age over her children (and being helped along by Grace); Frank's bossy sister Brenda, who feels put upon about sharing the running of his house; Irene's flamboyant, cheerful sister Lydia, who takes Irene as a awful warning, and provides a leavening of sense in the Grace-admiration society; cousin Dick Paradine, continually working on getting Lydia to the altar; and Mike, who's hopelessly in love with Lydia, and would rather be in China than at the family dinner. Last, but not least, Phyllida Wray, who left Elliot Wray a year ago only to fall back into the smothering clutches of Grace Paradine.All in all, not a good group to taunt with an ambiguous accusation and an urge to confession - who knows what might come out. Half the family appears to have visited his study at some point in the evening, and apparently James got more than he bargained for; he's found dead, fallen from the terrace outside his study. Mike, as his heir, falls immediately under suspicion. But Maud Silver, governess-turned-PI, is spending Christmas with her favourite niece nearby - and of all people, the flamboyant Lydia turns out to have met her, and calls her in to tell the truth and shame the devil - no matter what devil turns out to have been the murderer."},{"Title":"The Clock Strikes Twelve","review":"It's time for old scores to be settled and conflicts to be resolved. Mr. James Paradine has laid down the gauntlet to his family and someone has killed him. With two love stories (Elliot Wray and Phillida and Mark and Lydia) and everyone there suspect, Miss Silver unravels the mess and the answer is the twist that Wentworth loves to give us. This is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Clock Strikes Twelve","review":"Once again, we find ourselves in a country house - rather oppressively furnished in an \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" style, but with less taste - surrounded by relatives of varying degrees of likeability and too many degrees of secrets, grudges, and ulterior motives. This is part of what makes the Miss Silver series enjoyable: you already know the basics, but the details are always fresh. You know there will be one or two young couples with real or imagined obstacles in their paths to happiness; one or more villains, but none of them Hannibal Lecter; and an assortment of well-mannered police, doctors, and Miss Silver herself. She's a retired governess of indeterminate age but a shabby Victorian air, who knits constantly and wears hideous clothing. But don't underestimate her keen intellect, as she listens to everyone and sorts the wheat from the chaff, so that all's well that ends well. In this story, I immediately guessed \\"whodunnit\\", but settled in for the pleasure of reading the book and was not disappointed. As usual, the foul English weather plays a role, and it just makes me wonder why anyone chooses to remain among the rains, the fogs and the dreary cold!"},{"Title":"The Clock Strikes Twelve","review":"THIS GAL NEVER FAILS TO SATISFY MY NEEDS FOR A FULFILLING MYSTERY.AN EXCELLENT ESCAPE FROM THE LOCAL NEWS AND EVERYDAY STUFF."},{"Title":"The Clock Strikes Twelve","review":"Don't waste your time on this one.

Covering all three years of the New Revised Common Lectionary, James Kirk's \\"When We Gather\\" provides a Call to Worship and several prayers or litanies for each week of the Christian year. The Calls to Worship, prayers, and litanies can very comfortably be used \\"as is\\" or, even better, could serve as inspiration to those who would like to write their own. The inclusive language maintains the balance between the imminent and the transcendant nature of the Trinity and should serve well in the vast majority of English speaking congregations.I would give this resource 5 stars if either (1) it identified the individual weeks in ordinary time as Propers or by date rather than as Sundays in Ordinary Time. I find the identification by Propers to be the easiest to use. Or, (2) if the resources were provided in electronic format. In this day and age, when bulletins are produced on computers, I see little reason to make our lives more difficult by forcing us to type in what somebody else already has."},{"Title":"When We Gather, Revised Edition: A Book of Prayers for Worship","review":"This book provides helpful alternatives for one planning a worship service and following the lectionary."},{"Title":"When We Gather, Revised Edition: A Book of Prayers for Worship","review":"I have used a previous edition and find this eidtion to be even better than the first.

It is among the most helpful books I have in my library for planning the worship service!When I am struggling with putting together a worship service, it is a winner! I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"When We Gather, Revised Edition: A Book of Prayers for Worship","review":"I work in a city in China where all the Christian churches don't have worship services in English. And my Chinese friends and students (a mixture of theists, atheists and agnostics) gather weekly in my apartment for a Bible study. And sometimes we hold special prayer service for tragedies around the world. This book has helped me create the liturgies that we recite during the service.Each Sunday and every Christian holiday has a list of prescribed Biblical passages for reading appropriate for the day. And the book is divided into three -- Year A, B and C -- so that when the Christmas season is over and the new year comes, you don't need to return to the beginning of the book, which would be a mundane and boring thing to do; the message wouldn't be fresh anymore since you've read it just 365 days ago. However, reading that long-forgotten article after 2 years since first reading it would still be refreshing, so I'm glad this author had thought of this 3-year cycle which he used for his book.I've seen the inside of other similar books on Amazon; unfortunately, by wanting their books to be accepted by people of ANY religious background, the authors didn't anymore recommend Bible readings and just expounded on solely universal (yet sometimes not Christian-specific) values and too many politically correct homilies.I recommend this book for Christians whose church ministry is composing the liturgy and those who worship privately or in groups such as Bible studies or hold services for special events. While some Christians would worship in the Pentecostal way (the kind where people just blurt out praises \\"upon the whim of the Holy Spirit,\\"), I'm the kind who wants worship to be formulated like in Methodist services; my mind doesn't wander this way. And God knows that my prayer is sincere, even if somebody had written it for me. Oh well, to each his own."},{"Title":"Castle (Fast Forward (Barrons))","review":"We got this for our five year old son and he asked us to read it again and again.

Very few books are like that."},{"Title":"Die Tagebcher einer Nanny.","review":"This is the German text edition of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\", a book that I had originally thought was going to be a work of non-fiction in a nanny tell all. It turned out, instead, to be a mildly funny look at the rich and obnoxious and their young children through the eyes of a spineless nanny. While some of this book is amusing, it is not particularly well written. It is the kind of book you read once, and then promptly forget. It is not a bad book, as it is somewhat entertaining. What this book really represents is what happens when a book grabs the attention of the media. It becomes a best seller. Long after the dust settles, I anticipate that this book will be to the publishing world, what a one hit wonder is to the music industry.This work of fiction provides caricatures of selfish, self-absorbed, wealthy parents and a peek into the life of their overly-structured and overly-managed offspring. The nanny in question is also a caricature, as she struggles to be appear good hearted, but in the end is just a spineless jellyfish who goes along with the program, no matter how offensive she may find her employers and their demands to be. The nanny tries to come across as an underprivileged, put upon employee, but is, in reality, part of the problem, as she is certainly not a part of the solution. She is an upper middle class young woman who attends a prestigious university. She is hardly one of the hoi polloi, no matter how much she may empathize with those who are truly at the mercy of employers such as the ones found in this book. As social satire this book falls short. Borrow it from the library. Do not bother to buy it, as it is a one note book. If you feel that you must buy it, do yourself a favor and buy the paperback, as it is not a book that you would want to keep. It is a quick, throwaway read."},{"Title":"Nurturing Good Children Now: 10 Basic Skills to Protect and Strengthen Your Child's Core Self","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read about how to help your child (and yourself as a parent). The author pulls no punches and lays out a foundation of ten solid ways to help your child's development. He talks about different types of children and approaches to use with each one. I liked the expectations of respect and consequences that seem to be lacking in many parenting books written today. I wish I had this book when my children were younger but it's a book you can use from toddlers to teens."},{"Title":"Nurturing Good Children Now: 10 Basic Skills to Protect and Strengthen Your Child's Core Self","review":"Another book on the obvious and commonsense, but still worth your time for its unique perspective on the influence of the outside world on families and possible responses. It is well conceived and put together. Still, it should be read in bits to prevent good idea overload. And it will remind you of things you've heard before. But read it...it will open your eyes and heart to new ways of thinking, above all being the premise that you NEED TO KNOW YOUR KID!"},{"Title":"Introducing Sociolinguistics","review":"There are a number of sociolinguistics/language in society textbooks out there, but they are either too simple or not comprehensive enough or formatting in such a way to make them hard to read. Introducing Sociolinguistics by Mesthrie et al. fits the bill better than any other books I've seen or used for advanced undergraduate or beginning sociolinguistic courses. I like it because it covers an impressively wide range of topics and because it has an open format, with lots of maps and/or diagrams that make the text easy to follow. But it isn't just a a picture book. The book treats its subject in sufficient depth for the levels of students I've cited. I've just started to use it as a textbook myself."},{"Title":"Introducing Sociolinguistics","review":"The book seems to cover the appropriate information well enough, but I wish the authors were American rather than English. Some of their examples (like what dialects are spoken in certain areas of the UK) are not particularly helpful.

This is so much more than what one typically thinks of as photography. Using digital technology, these composed portraits of seascapes, landscapes and the figures who inhabit them exist in some ambiguous realm between representation and myth. This is imagery transformed and refreshed by an exceptional artist's technical expertise and haunting vision. The book presents a truly unique view of the beauty and complexity of this part of the world."},{"Title":"100 Views of the Hamptons","review":"I've been taking summers in the Hamptons since I was baby. I know the surrounding towns, Springs and Amagansett, the beaches, the dunes, the little charming fruit stands; and yet it's clear to me that Mr. Robbins knows the Hamptons much better, on a deeper level. It may be that this book is so special to me because I know the Hamptons and I can go to the places he's photographed, places I've known all my life, and view them as if with new eyes. But I suspect that's just a bonus -- that the photography is really that good. Gorgeous work."},{"Title":"Organizational Consulting: How to Be an Effective Internal Change Agent","review":"With many years working and consulting internally and externally, this book is still a vital resource.

Great Buy"},{"Title":"The Steel, The Mist, and the Blazing Sun","review":"I first read this book shortly after it came out, and I liked it so much I've hung on to it ever since. It is pitched at a high-school comprehension level, but the ending is both philosophically and practically tidy - a way forward even for we who never suffered through the horrors of a nuclear war. But maybe we will have to rediscover an Edwardian political simplicity to find that path, as Arakal and his cabinet do in this book. Certainly the justification for the enforced stasis of the Soviets in this book is sound if only on an Earthly level.By the way, I never buy into those books that project so complete a breakdown after a nuclear war that books and libraries don't survive. I read the studies - while a complete war would kill billions, most of the deaths would be due to systems breakdowns and not fallout or nuclear winter. People might fall ill and starve, but things would survive better."},{"Title":"The Steel, The Mist, and the Blazing Sun","review":"I find it inexplicable that this edition omits the first part of the story, which was published in Analog as \\"Ideology Counts\\" and introduced Arakal, General Brusilov and the rest.

Many equations are missing and other characters are mistranslated (e.g., 2 times pi is translated as \\"2ir\\"; lower-case delta, I guess, is an italic \\"6\\"). I found perhaps 10 typos in the first couple of pages."},{"Title":"Dimensional analysis,","review":"The book itself is very good. However, the printed version was made using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which did not translate the equations correctly. In fact, most of the math is completely unreadable which significantly reduces the value of a mathematical book! You can also find this version of the book on the web."},{"Title":"Dimensional analysis,","review":"This book gives an excellent introduction to dimensional analysis theory. The examples to explain the theory are chosen from almost all areas of applied physics. I think this is the first book written on Dimensional analysis after the publication of seminal papers by Buckingham and Rayleigh.If one needs more examples and theory of models in specific then the book by Langahar 'Dimensional analysis and theory of models' will be an useful reference."},{"Title":"Dimensional analysis,","review":"I'm suggesting not buying this text, not because the content is poor, but rather the publisher has defaced its worth.

Percy Bridgman however did do a great job presenting dimensional analysis and because the text is no longer copyrighted you can find it on Google books for free.[&#8230;]"},{"Title":"Dimensional analysis,","review":"Sadly, not useful. No formulas, but trivial ones, can be read. The preview is of a different (useful) version, though there isn't a proper warning; it does mention that it is a different book you view, but for a math/physics book it would only be fair to inform that formulas were demolished by the OCR handling. The claim in the book that most of their books are freely available as digital copies does not fare much better. You have to pay $9.99 for the \\"free digital copy\\". Luckily, Google Books have the book."},{"Title":"Mathematics, Vol. 3: Its Content, Methods, and Meaning - 2nd Edition","review":"Many mathematics and engineering books today require &quot;relatively modest background and mathematical maturity,&quot; and the text goes with mathematical formalism and compact descriptions. However, this series (three books) is a collection of chapters on single topic, written by top Russian mathematicians in plain language and vivid illustrations. Bright high school students should be able to read them, but the material is no kids stuff, in a sense that every chapter gives at least some real feeling of the topic. I recommend this series only to those who are seriously interested in mathematics but looking for the friendly version of the real mathematics. I think the title describes this.Among the three books, I like Volume 2 the best, because Chapter 10 is on prime numbers (Mardzanisvili and Postnikov), 11 on probability theory (Kolmogorov), 12 and 13 on approximation of functions and numerical aspects, and these match with my interests the best. This volume also includes differential equations, culculus, complex analysis, etc.Volume 1 and 3 contain analysis, topology, algebra, geometry, etc. At this paper edition price, all three are worth keeping.A small caveat is that my review and contents description is based on the original edition by MIT press in 1960s. I assumed that second edition did not reorganize the general construction of the books."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Macbeth (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"I last read Shakespeare in college, which due to the setup of the book, was much more tedious than it needed to be. This edition really shines in my eyes by having all the extra stuff (explanations of reference, definitions of archaic words, etc.) on the same page as the text of the play. This saved me from flipping back and forth continuously, which made this version very worth it. As for the book itself, it is my favorite tragedy by far, as it explores the darker side of ambition and the effects of unnatural acts on the mind. \\"Lay on Macduff, and damned be he who first cries hold!\\""},{"Title":"The Tragedy of Macbeth (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"The book arrived in about a week from when it was ordered, it is in fantastic condition and is the correct edition!!

If you forget the symbolism, the imagery, the metaphors, the similes, the hyperboles and whatnot, it is a greatr play. The youth hates Shakespeare because we focus so much on analyzing everything he did. (Cough, cough, sarcasm) But all in all, he was an entertainer, much as a director is now. He wrote so that people would enjoy, not spend countless hours trying to decipher the &quot;Secret code&quot; that he must have put into every one of his plays, seeing as he had so much time to do this between the 30 some odd plays he did. Just take it as it is, and have fun with it. Or, with Macbeth, be sad, or disturbed, but enjoy it. I'm 16 years old, and I love Shakespeare... just don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"Autobiography of William Butler Yeats","review":"So, why should you read this book? (Especially if it's not assigned reading in your college class.)Because it's a fascinating read, recording (among many other things) Yeats' relationships with contemporaries Oscar Wilde, John Synge, Madame Blavatsky, George Moore, and others. It also lends a great insight into his passions for cabalistic thoughts, occultism, the Irish theatre, politics and poetry.Yeats covers 58 years of his life, from his earliest memories to his winning of the Nobel Prize. The man considered to be 'the greatest master of the English language in verse' comes to life here in his own words. He was complex, preoccupied with seeking answers to life's most compelling and elusive questions, and intensely devoted to his art. This autobiographical account provides an unforgettable portrait of Yeats - and offers a great look at the era in which he lived."},{"Title":"Prayers for Children","review":"I had this same book when I was a little girl.

She vows to deny his next fiasco and comes up with her \\"Barry aversion therapy\\" concept; a series of index cards highlighting how he has abused her feelings for him.Barry feels bad about getting Megan in trouble, but needs her if he is to break out of his exile to the society pages. He also realizes charm will not persuade Megan to assist him on getting a hot story involving a Congressman. He needs to up the ante so he tries a kiss that leaves Megan breathless, senseless, and ready to break and enter the congressman's office just to get him a story that could cost her job and some time if caught.FALLING FOR YOU is an amusing satirical chick lit romance that pokes fun at excesses, but though realizing this, readers will still have a difficult time with Barry's manipulations and Megan's inability to say no even when it jeopardizes her. Readers will detest what he does to Megan although he feels bad for doing so and want to pound Megan for being a patsy. Still in spite of doubts about the lead couple, FALLING FOR YOU has a strong message on dominant-submissive relationships inside a humorous well written tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Classic Chinese Novel: A Critical Introduction","review":"This book (a reprint, it was originally published in 1968) is a critical introduction to the &quot;classic&quot; Chinese novels. Specifically, it has chapters on _The Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, _The Water Margin_, _Journey to the West_, _Chin P'ing Mei_, _The Scholars_, and _Dream of the Red Chamber_. There is also an appendix on &quot;Society and Self in the Chinese Story&quot; and bibliographies of translations and other works about each novel.I found this to be a very clear, informative, and insightful introduction to these great works of Chinese literature. Hsia provides the context necessary to understand the origin of each novel, as well as a discussion of some of the most important interpretive issues raised by each book. I found that I could appreciate these novels much better with some help from Hsia. Part of the reason for this, I think is that Hsia's style of writing is pleasantly &quot;pre-postmodern&quot; (that is, clear and unpretentious).There are good English translations of all the novels Hsia discusses except for _The Water Margin_. Several of them are quite long, so you would not be a total wimp for reading a condensed version. Moss Roberts has both a complete and a selected translation of _Three Kingdoms_ (a heroic war story). Arthur Waley's _Monkey_ is the most widely read selected translation of _Journey to the West_ (a funny and fantastic story of a religious pilgrimage). David Roy's _The Plum in the Golden Vase_ is a partial translation of the erotic novel, _Chin P'ing Mei_. _The Story of the Stone_ is the alternative title of _Dream of the Red Chamber_ a sort of romance/Buddhist parable, that has been translated in five (gulp!) volumes by David Hawkes. _The Story of the Stone_ is supposed to be the greatest Chinese novel, and it certainly has some very great parts, but overall I found it too slow moving. My own favorite of the classic Chinese novels is _The Scholars_, a satire of hypocrisy and immorality among Confucian literati, available in a handsome translation by Hsien-I Yang and Gladys Yang.So buy this book, along with a good translation of one of the novels that Hsia discusses, and sit down for a great read!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords has to be one of the best fantasy books ever written! Through use of subtle light and dark imaging, Jordan has created a series that transcends almost any other book ever written, excluding Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Jordan uses a style that almost makes the books mirror our own lives, yet fulfills that part of us that wishes we lived in a time of magic and swordplay, not guns and drugs. The reader can compare the book with their own life and see similarities between the book and their own lives, something that has rarely ever been done.I give the Wheel of Time a 10 for it's originality and the substance that makes one unable to put it down."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I continue to be impressed by Jordan's characters and multiple storylines. The Crown of Sword's continues the story of the three boys from the Two rivers, but for 800 pages worth of reading does not advance the plot significantly. He does however further develop the main characters by completing their transition from youth to maturity. The reader is left with a good feeling, but I hope that there is more meat in the next book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"i would like to respond to those of you out there that thing the WoT is dragging on too long. Do you actually like fantasy epics??!!. I mean, this is by far the best series of books I have ever read, including Tolkiens lord of the rings saga. Jordan has much more depth and character detail than I have ever seen, and I hope he'll keep it up even if the series takes twenty books. I've read the series up to a crown of swords three times, and it gets better and more interesting each time. Keep up the excellent word RJ, you've outdisdanced Tolkien by far already."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's series presents a world so detailed that it sucks the reader into its reality. Since the characters were not born knowing all about their world, we discover it with them. The characters harbor misinformation and misconceptions in the same way we in the &quot;real world&quot; do, making even the main protagonists' opinions suspect and subject to revision. All of this contributes to a rich texture of plausible character development with people so real that readers cannot help but wonder how their friends (the characters) are and what they are up to during the frustratingly long intervals between installments in the series; so far each book has proven well worth the wait. Jordan continues to create individuals whose complex feelings lead to actions that are not always correct; few characters are entirely good or evil; most show doubt and hesitation just as we do. Realistically, good intentions do not always yield the expected results. I currently share each book with two of my sisters, who fight over who will get it first! Buy it! Read it! Share it! Reread it!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is a great series..Robert Jorden is one of the best..the waiting inbetween books is too long!!!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am an avid reader of practically all genres, and I have to say that this is probably one of the most interesting, and long series I have ever read, and I have enjoyed it immensly. I have read some of the previous reviews and I agree with many, but I have to say that to compare Robert Jordan to J.R.R. Tolkein, is like comparing apples to oranges, to use an old cliche'. I have read Tolkein's works at least three times and have enjoyed them each time. But whereas these works seem to be driven by fabulous creatures and mysterious magic, the Wheel of Time series, though using some of these same techniques, depends much more heavily on adult characters and relationships and how they change over time to further its story. My chief complaint is that there is way too much time between books! I got hooked on the WOT a few years back and it was great! There were a number of books already out and I was able to go from one to the next without loosing much of the story line. But then, after the sixth, &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;, I had to wait for &quot;Crown of Swords&quot; I started to forget some of the story line and character relationships. Since COS it's been almost two years! Again I'm starting to loose some of the story line. I think some of the slowness a few people have been complaining about is due to just this. RJ should put all this Conan stuff aside and finish WOT. I have recently begun rereading the series. I figure that maybe by the time I finish, a new book will be out and I'll be right on top of the story. There are very few books I've read, and enjoyed, twice. This is one. In fact, I'm picking up on things I missed the first time. There is just so much about this story that grabs my interest. I feel I know every one of the characters personally and am pulling for them to succeed. And then there is all the references to our own mythology and religions, Shaitan/Satan, Tarmon Gaidon/ Armaggedon-----it keeps you thinking continously. An intersting thing is, my wife's 92 year old grandmother has read this series too. She loves it! But I think she's more worried about when one of the girls is going marry Rand then anything else. If she was an Aes Sedai she probably would have been a green. I know this was supposed to be a review of COS, but I just found this web site and it's been a while since I read the book, and I haven't gotten that far in my reread, so I'm a little shaky on the details. But I'd have to say to those who have complained about it being slow, get over it. A work this length is going to have slow sections. It has to. Reserve your judgement until the final book. And for those who complain RJ's books are too long (my wife being one of them), look at it this way. With prices for books being what they are today, you're getting more bang for your buck, as the saying goes. I personally just love long, involved stories that help me forget some of my everyday cares. Well. I've gone on way too long------Bye, Chuck in sunny Florida"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"My rating of an 8 was arrived upon by comparing this work to the previous books in the series. The book itself is of superior form and prose but as a male, I don't mind seeing the action found in the last twenty pages throughout the work as well. RJ, through his WoT series, has truly created a world we can all relate to. He has envisioned a culmination of cultures, belief systems and ideas and put ground underneath. In second guessing any writer, the individual wants to touch the reader. Seeing the number of reviews by readers whether good or bad shows that RJ has indeed fulfilled his desire. I have read the series 3 times now and each time I learn something new that I missed on previous reading. That is the point of the breadth and depth of his novels. Everyone can identify with at least one character. Some of us can identify with many of them. To some these characterizations seem incomplete or immature. On the contrary they are very complete. As a reader we see what &quot;everyone&quot; is up to including the villains. The characters do not. Many are away from their friends most of the time and are in a very bad situation. This latest book ACoS allows us a closer view into the actual performances of the characters. Up until now most of what they were doing was reaction. Now they are taking a proactive approach to their situation as the burden of their individual responsibility finally begins to settle in. ACoS although lengthy and slow at points is a lull in the storm that will make the following books more worthwhile to the readers because they will be able to look back and see the turning point and further realize the genius behind RJ's characterization and plot."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Even though this is the best series I have ever read, it is taking too long. I loved the original characters, ( Rand, Egwene,Mat, Perrin, Lan, Moiraine, Padan Fain, Thom Merrilin) but JR keepsadding on new characters, and now must of them confuse me ( espically the Aiel and Aes Sedai). JR is now just dragging the series along, trying to get to the Final Battle.

Everytime I go to the bookstore I can't remember whether or not I read this book. It is not a good sign when I can't remember the book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If I didn't so desperately require some kind of finish to the Wheel of Time, I would say, &quot;Let Jordan never finish this series!&quot; Where Jordan shows the true mastery of his ability is when he can immerse the reader into the story so completely that the action that is happening, though certainly extremely exciting, is not what has the reader continue reading and trying to figure out what's to come in the next book while we wait. When a fictional world such as this becomes alive in your head and lives on even after the book has been finished, then it is truly a great novel. Robert Jordan has made his world my world and his characters mine, through the intricacies of character interaction, setting development, and plot twists. Writing an exciting story about an adventure is comparatively easy, but writing one about a world is much more difficult: Robert Jordan excells at precisely that!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"At the beginning of The Wheel of Time series, the pace moved really well and wasn't draggy at all. During books 4-6, I found it to be really slow and so wasn't looking forward too much to this one, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The only two things I really didn't like, but I think this is a driticism of Jordan's style rather than this book in particular, were first, the amount of characters. There are so many names and people that I found I began to lose track of them all and had to look them up in the index at the back (which is a plus about this series -- the index). The second is that Jordan only focuses on one part of the story for a mere one or two chapters. Just as soon as you really get into a particular plot, you are changed to another and have to get up the urge to continue reading instead of quitting or skipping ahead. I realize that it is important to develop all of the plotlines at the same speed so that they can all tie together properly at the end, but the transition"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Pt'Barnum said that there was a sucker born every minute and now after reading the third book i feel like a sucker. But I am comforted in the fact that i am among friends there are 6b million sucker's with me. This book made it to the new york times best seller list. how???? I have read all 7 books and i feel several points should be made to all readers both the haters of the series and the lovers. Everybody could more or less agree that the first three books were very good, and that we all each awaited the rest of the series no matter how long it might have been. But after reading the 7 th book and seeing how the charcaters generally have not changed it depresses me severly that the book's storyline was killed. LET'S EXAMINE IT LOGICALLY PEOPLE I am not a chauvinist but it makes me sick to see men bashed about so much and then ask more please. All this nineties all men are pigs soo there, is ridiculous. Robert Jordan is using feminism into making a book that exalats women and makes men look stupid, beacuse some stupid survey probably told his publishers women read more fantasy novels. So let's milk them for all the money they can get. Fantasy should be above feminsim want strong females character fine I can deal with that but some where in the book the men and womem must come to terms with each other. Women this book is using you. There is no way that you can tell me after all that that dreay tediuos talking and mundane chit chat done in the these 7 books these women have not changed their attitude towards men and that they are still allowed to get away with it. And please do the guys every grow up, apart from learning to drink shave and have sex. Enough with the whinning about being t'avern do your job. I am tired of reading Matt or Perin complain about their duty. Christ it's all about taking responsiblity and if these two can controll armies but have not learnt that yet then you are left with the feeling that all the &quot;attention&quot; to detail in this book is worthless. In my mind Perin is the best charcter there. We see this charcter going through the procees most good writters put down on paper. Shock, Bewilderment, Denial, Rage, Envy Jealousy, bitterness and then acceptance of his role. Yes finally somebody took rsponsibilty in this 7 ringed circus. You see in Perin the qualtites Rand and all the other Characters should have."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was an excellant continuation of the cliffhanger series to beat them all. Mr. Jordan has a way to capture your imagination and keep it in suspended animation. I feel this series might be getting drawn out more than necessary, but I always look forward to the book with anticipation.This book brought back some of the my more favorite charactures that in previous books in the series left me wondering what happened to them. The chartacture plots and subplots are even more captivating than before. This series is a must for any fantasy collection."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time is undoubtedly the best series I have ever read. Robert Jordan continues to weave his incredibly complex and vivid world. His characters are so well developed that it seems as if the reader personally goes through their miseries and joys along with them, and his complex and realistic world is unparalleled in the history of fantasy. Yes, I would even say it is better than Tolkien's. For those of you who complain about the length of the story, why read do you bother to read it? Go play somewhere else. As for me, I will rejoice with each new book Jordan writes. With books as incredible as these, who cares how long it takes?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's &quot;Wheel of time&quot; series started, for me, in a corner of a used paperback book store. One read of book one and I was hooked. Books 2 and 3 were available in paperback at the time, and I started getting the hardcovers as they came out (note to publishers: used paperback bookstores do *not* cut into your business, at least where series fiction is concerned. The store got my money for books 1 and 2: you got it for 3 through 7, and I never would have bought the first paperback at full price.) Unfortunately, Jordan's series is getting sort of like a blind date that started out really well but has begun to drag on because your date talks too much. By book 7, Jordan seems to have run out of places to go, and the delayed release didn't give the publisher enough time to correct some sloppy editing (in at least one scene a female character is mentioned as part of a group when she's in a different country at the time.) I admit it, I'm still hooked, and I'll probably buy each hardcover as it comes out (are there really going to be 10?) But I won't have nearly the sense of anticipation that I get from, say, the newest Raymond Feist book about Midkemia."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Well, I thought that this book lacked in scope as compared to the other 3 novels. Maybe he is feeling pressured to keep the series moving, and this is evident throughout the text. The book is more on the lines of a filler, and in no way should someone, even a hardcore Jordan fan, should spend the money on a hardcover copy of this book. Of course he is the master, but I do hope that he gets his act together for the next book in the series. By the way, there is a game coming out that will put this story into a roleplaying game using the Unreal engine.

(I actually waited years to start the series, not wanting to start it until I figured it had to be finished. Did I misjudge there!) Overall the series is captivating, but the incessant whining, the lack of personal growth in any of the main characters (how many times do Nynaeve, Egwene, etc. have to be wrong before they grow up and lose the damn attitudes?), the lack of any serious plot development (it took nearly 1000 pages and a full book to get from discovering the existence of the Bowl of Winds to finding it, and they still haven't used it!), and the apparent random introduction of new main characters (it took nearly 7000 pages to hear of the legendary, greatest-Aes-Sedai-of-all-time Cadsuane?) made it very difficult for me to even stay with it. I actually only read about 3/4 of the book because I found myself skipping two or three pages at a time in order to avoid another description of yet another scandalous silk dress, another speech regarding the stupidity of men, another confession about the lack of underdstanding regarding women, etc. The truly sad thing is that I missed absolutely nothing by skipping those pages, and I probably could have saved myself some time and skipped a great many more. I honestly hope the true believers out there are right when they say that this is only a setup to something truly fabulous in book 8, because I don't think I can muster up the effort to force my way through another one like this. Very disappointing at the very least, absolutely mind-numbing at the worst."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords truly justifies everything that anyone has ever complimented Robert Jordan's writing! The plot in the series is growning hot. The Seanchan are already preparring an invasion to reclaim what is theirs, and a split White Tower struggles over whether to fight or join the mysterious Asha'man of the Black Tower, lead my Mazrim Taim and the Dragon Reborn, Rand al'Thor. I truly don't think that even J.R.R. Tolkien could have written this story as masterfully as Jordan did, especially in the ending. I felt chills as Gandalf fell toward his death in The Lord of the Rings, as the Nazgul raced against time toward Mount Doom as the ring neared; as Thomas Covenant was transported to a strange world where the earth held its own mystical powers, and as Belgarion rose triumphantly before Belgarath the Sorcerer and Polgara the Sorceress. I have never before, however, seen such a masterful telling. Read this book, and all the Wheel of Time series. And remember......the storm is coming."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The overwhelming sense I got in reading this book was that the author was tired and did not care to make an effort to write a good book. The story moves glacially slowly. And the women are all insane, repetitive caricatures of themeselves. It's a miracle Nynaeve has any hair left after all that braid-pulling. I read most of this heavy book (and the predecessor book) in amazement that she responded to EVERY situation by pulling her hair, getting angry, and doing something mindlessly idiotic. The only thing at which she should have been angry was her own towering stupidity. This woman badly needs professional help, like electro-shock therapy. I've had enough of all the women believing that all the men are idiots whose every action must be tightly controlled, and all the men believing (correctly, in this book) that all the women should be committed to a loony bin. Mr. Jordan, if you can't give these characters any more depth, please kill them off and concentrate on giving fewer characters more attention. It's hard to stick with the book (and the series, which I have enjoyed) when you make the characters so tiresome."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When I first started reading this series, I couldn't help but notice the Christian simalarities. The dragon dies only to be reborn again and save humanity and hopefully Ogierity from the Dark One's evil clutches. At rate it's going it looks like Jordan is trying to rewrite the bible in Rand Land style, complete with matching number of books. Although seeing as this dealing with the Dragon Reborn, i guess he's just doing the new testament Jordan style. My qualm is when will the man give up?! He has taken an absolutely brilliant story and is seeing how many books it will take him to level it to mediocricy. A crown of Swords ( note the religous context there, as opposed to the crown of thorns ) is painfully trite. The females in the story have become so superficial, pulling braids, lifting chins, and trying to bully everyone. If they carry on like they are, everyone else will turn to the Dark One just so they can do the world a favour and kill them without putting their karma under jeopordy. Hopefull Jordan will realise that detail isn't everything. I could write 10 pages describing a door, but that doesn't make my story any better. Ah well, maybe book 8 will be a return to form for the man. Please God!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Ariod, we heard you the first time. No one supported your view then, probably indicating that most of us don't agree with your rape premise. But, like Nynaeve, say, you're back to bully us into submission! Let's look at some of the aspects of your arguments. First, Tylin is more likely forty than sixty - but so what? Mat's main problems - from my masculine point of view - are that this little affair is being prosecuted on someone else's terms and that he is unsure how Beslan and Elayne and Nynaeve are going to react to it. The first one could get him killed; the girls (as you call them) are hard enough to deal with under the best of circumstances. Since we aren't privy to the actual bedroom scenes, we don't know what takes place - maybe even dialogue! Mat's reactions aren't those of an outraged person, but rather one discomfited. The deal with Rand and Min similarly falls into a reasonable pattern. Rand is pretty traditional (in the terms of tradition developed in the books) in his outlook about male-female relationships. He builds up strong feelings - he falls in love - toward Aviendha, first, and Min, later. But, he represses these severely because he's pledged himself - in his way of looking at things - to Elayne. However, when a crisis occurs that throws him into physical contact with a female who has similar feelings toward him, and who isn't so reluctant to act on these feelings as he is - well, look out! Afterward he is ashamed of himself, and I think, seriously concerned that he has taken advantage of the woman. I liked Min's response: she let him know in no uncertain terms that she is in charge of herself, and that it takes two to tango. Finally, if Robert Jordan is putting sex scenes in these books to appeal to morons and sex-starved teenagers, then the audience reading them contains few if any such people."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I cannot understand people whining about ACOS! In my opinion it is with TFOH the best of the seven. You learn more about the characters, have funny and interesting scenes (see the Tylin scenes with humor, friends, and if not, things like that happen) and at the end, you nearly burst of suspision, what might happen in the next book. What will happen in Ghealdan? Is Taim Demandred? How will the Aes Sedai attack on the Black Tower end?.........There are no holes in the plot, and even if there doesn't happen so much in the CoF...It's good so. It makes the story more real. I bet, in APoD there will be enough of that.And people,...do me a favor...stop complaining about the length! If you think it is to long stop reading it, if you can! If you kept up with it to #7, I think you can't. I think the books are much to short. I hope for at least 5 more, but I have heard, #10 will be the final one.And to everyone who hasn't read the WOT yet.... DO IT!!!!!! START NOW!!!! Only after you started, you will know what you missed. There is nothing similar to the Wheel of Time! Nothing even close. And to those people out there who don't like the series...I feel terrible sorry for you.

I have truly gotteninto this series. I feel as if I am going throughthese journeys and hardships with the characters.No author has done that to me since Tolkien. RobertJordan has done more than create a book series, hehas changed the ways in which I view some aspectsof life.In each book you dig deeper into the plots andhardships. I have reread the Wheel of Time so manytimes I can start to quote scenes from the book.I try to read other books but none match thecunning and creativity of that which Robert Jordanspins from his fingers and mind.I find only a few flaws in this series, forwhich I cannot give it a rating of 10. The first isI rarely see the use of armor and shields. I do seeit sometimes, but it is just a bunch of smallcharacters that hold little sway in the series. Thesecond is that the lead characters appear to beimmortal. I do see some bad guys die sometimes andrarely a hero, but I would like to see somethingmore on real life terms where the heroes DO diesometimes. The last problem is, THE BOOKS ARE TOOSHORT! I love how they have grown longer and I havegotten further into the plot, but the waiting periodsfor each new book drives me insane!Overall, it is a WONDERFUL series. If you haven'tread it yet, get off this foolish computer and getthese good books! All it needs now is for the sequels tocome out quicker and maybe even a well directed movieversion once the series ends. So go ahead, get caughtup in the series.

The rich characters, complex plot, and imaginative creatures are starting to annoy my sense of adventure. Characters learn nothing from their experiences and keep making the same stereotypical mistakes they have made in the past six books. They also must be somewhat dull to miss the obvious connections and clues planted by the author.I was RJ's biggest fan for this series. Unfortunately, it has turned into a dull and predictible plot. My only hope is that as he begins to wrap this series up, it will regain its former luster.My personal plea Mr. Jordan: You have proven you can build a new imaganitive series from your success with the Wheel of Time. Isn't it time to move on and create a new plot and set of characters?I'm begining to doubt my ability to continue reading the next book in this series, but I'll probably give you one more chance (but this time in paperback!)"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time series is doubtless epic in its proportions. In this volume (Book 7), our main characters are split into three basic storylines: 1. Mat, Nynaeve, and Elayne search for the magical artifact that can control the weather; 2. Rand, with the help of Perrin, reasserts himself as leader in Caemlyn and Carhein while plotting the death of the Forsaken Sammael; 3. Egwene, newly raised as leader of the rebel Aes Sedai, navigates the politics of her position. A dedicated reader of the series would cynically point out that this plot summary is, in fact, identical to that of Book 6. Fortunately for readers of Book 7, the problem lies with Book 6 - the slowest moving book of the series and one of the most painful to read. By comparison, Book 7 is a svelte 850 pages, and has more action and resolutions than Books 5 and 6 combined.To be blunt, Book 7 is the story that Book 6 should have been. In fact, it starts with a retelling of the climactic battle of Book 6, told from the point of view of one group of Baddies, the Shaido. Rand then has to repair the damage done by this battle and by his kidnapping - damage to his reputation and to his authority (a new queen has herself crowned in his absence). Jordan then deftly interweaves multiple storylines, and we finally get some resolutions that we've been waiting for since the beginning of Book 6. Naturally, new complications are added, and some new characters, including a wise old Aes Sedai long thought to be dead (who tries to take Rand under her wing). The Seanchan make an apocalyptic return, and the strange behaviour of the Sea Folk is dealt with. We get to see into the minds of some of the Bad Guys as well, including chapters dedicated to Galina (the Aes Sedai leading the kidnapping of Rand), Moghedien (after her escape), and Alviarin and Elaida in Tar Valon.Naturally there are some complaints, as there would have to be with a book this long and a plot this complex. Even I, who have read all the previous books recently (in the past year), find that I'm losing track of people and events. The standard complaint of pacing comes up in several Amazon reviews, but I find this book moves along at a good clip with lots of action. There is still the problem of some characters acting in ways that are obviously against their self-interest (Elayne and Nynaeve are particularly annoying). But all-in-all, this is the best book since the very first one. Sure, these plotlines should all have been ersolved in Book 6 instead, but that's a criticism for the previous book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"&quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; was not one of Jordon's best. He lacks devercity in his characters. Not all women have to be pretty. And not all men have to be spineless around women. Also he opens up so many political plots that it takes away from the story and confuses the reader. Plus he doesn't focus on his main characters, he gets to cuaght up in the lives of sub characters. However I feel many people are being unreasonably unfair to Jordan. Not all the women hate men. Hello, three women are in love with Rand, women are constantly throwing themselves at Matt, and Faile loves Perrin while the First of Mayene is chasing him. I enjoy the atention to detail in this book, but Jordan should keep in mind that constantly explaining what everything looks like is somewhat tiring to the reader.There are certain aspects of this book that keep it intriging and encourage me to keep reading. Like: I'm dying to know what will happen to Matt, who is my male favorite character, I know he can't die he still has to marry the Duaghter of the Nine Moons(who I think is Seanchan). Also When is Gawyn going to reunite with Egwene? They are my favorite couple. Also how is Nyvene(she's starting to annoy me) going to help Lan. And when is Avienda,my favorite female character, going to meet Min."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Not as good as his previous efforts, but a decent book.

After = worse."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Forget those fools who claim that G.R.R.Martin's series is light years ahead of Robert Jordan's - in my view, the reverse is true. But my opinion is to try each series and see for yourself.This book sees a continuation of the Elayne/Nynaeve/Mat thread as they search for the Bowl of the Winds in Ebou Dar. Along the way there are several fight scenes, an encounter with the Gholam, and the much-awaited finding of the Bowl. Sammael plays a large part in this book, and features in the gripping finale against Rand.I won't say that this series keeps getting better and better: it doesn't. It gets more interesting, but less entertaining. The reader is bombarded with information, yet this bombardment detracts from the story as whole and whereas a fantasy book should have peaks and troughs of action, the last few WOT books have had massive troughs with occasional peaks, and a very large peak at the end. All in all, this book is very intriguing so long as you have an attention span. If you want more action, though, steer clear."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is the best! I never thought that I could read fantacy books, but my friend forced me. Now I am hooked. I love the way A Crown of Swords only covered about a weeks time. It gave me a chance to watch the characters a little closer. They are wonderful. It seems like I know them. I really like the way girls play a big part of the series, and even though my friends all think I'm crazy Nynaeve is the best. I didn't think that this book was a dissapointment at all.

WILL it end?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While the Wheel of Time seems to be slowing down a bit with &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; compared to the pace of the other books it is still a very good read. Rand returns to Cairhein after the Aes Sedae kidnapping. Lan retuns to action and a new character is introduced. Mordin is one of the Forsaken reincarnated or maybe the DO himself. It is hinted that he is Nae'blis and the Dark Ones consort in Randland. The Seachan have taken over the Fortress of Light and make their entrance into Ebou Dar. Nyneave and Elyane have found the Bowl of the Winds with Mat's help and Mat's extreme luck seems to be running out. I think the Daughter of the Nine Moons is going to claim him soon (which I feel is a character already introduced in the series) and she will be normal looking to the eye. Forget nonsence about Mat losing his memory and leading the Seachan army. The High Lady Suroth will be uncovered as a darkfiend when Rand binds the Nine Moons as the prophecy predicted in &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;....&quot;What does it mean he shall bind the Nine Moons to him...&quot;. This will take place when Mat marries the Daugheter of the Nine Moons as the door Ter' Angreal in &quot;The Swadow Rising&quot; Prophesied. Rand confronts Samual and has a mysterious savior.

The magic user, sometimes the hero, doesn't ever get harmed. But this book is a trip to a new dimension for magic, taking it to a whole new level. In &quot;A Crown of Swords,&quot; magic isn't just a bunch of flashy potions or powers, but is something that needs to be trained, that can kill, can even turn against the magic user him/herself!

She had me going.'Crown of Swords' picks up where 'Lord' left off. Rand battles his mistrust of Aes Sedai and continues to withdraw from the world. There's not much point in critiquing the novel here (it's well-written by the way) as Jordan fans will buy it regardless and those looking for a real review will be interested in vol. 1.Let me take a paragraph to note Jordan's 180 degree turn in his representation of women. Throughout the early volumes (particularly #4), women are all-knowing and arrogant. Starting with the very first page in this book, Jordan goes out of his way to showcase women's fallacies. Elaida misinterprets a foretelling, all Aes Sedai underestimate Rand, Nynaeve &amp; Elayne crawl to Mat and apologize. Frankly it's a nice change."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I can't believe all the bad reviews aCoS has been getting! Long-winded, definitly, too detailed, ocasionally, but boring? A filler? Never!! Jordan is a hero, dudes, and even if sometimes the pace slackens a bit much (mainly in Perrin's scenes; god, I hate that character - I've heard that Faile just might die in the next installment and I seriously hope she does) the series as a whole, and the individual books, have always been underlyingly great. I find that the description and the attention to detail is part of what makes the books so good. We don't only get to read about the action, adrenaline and adventure, we also get to hear the characters thoughts and find out what they are like. Some people think that the younger characters, especially the women, are too immature, and damn right they are, but I think they've improved throughout - that apology scene in aCoS was absolutely my favourite in the entire series. Loving some characters, despising others - this is just a testament to Jordan's ability to create such realism. You wouldn't like everyone you met on the street, would you? Besides, there were lots of new developments in aCoS - the mindtrapping, the fellow Rand encountered in Shadar Logoth, and I really liked reading about the search for the Bowl, even if they are yet to use it. 7 was just as magnigficent as the other books, I'm sure 8 will be even better."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Insanity beckons!

I LOOOOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! It was TOO SHORT, as many people said, but it was great! The best! I loved it! And it was hilarious! (Every good fantasy writer needs a good humor.) It's a great book in a great series, and if there weren't so many of them, I would say this of all the books- they are well worth any wait, and you have got to read them! The books themselves seem to have personalities. Loved them! The best!I only have one question to Mr. Jordan, and that is: what's the translation for &quot;Sister to Battles&quot; in the Old Tounge?

I remember everything that has happened and recommend the series to every I speak to about these types of books. I read it so often because I love to be submerged into that world. I read many titles and can honestly say that this series has jaded me in a way that I have to compare every book with this series. One complaint is the wait, but i guess that cannot be helped.

I loved everyone of his books. They are imaginative, detailed, and, most importantly, consistent. RJ never loses the main plot though he works on several subplots at the same time. If this is the case, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!!!! The book went no where. He has not started to reslove any of the plot matters. And what pissed me off the most is how he skimmed over the Nyneve and Lan thing like it was of no interest. Their love has been boiling for 6 books and we don't even see the wedding!!!

Each book of the series I have read in a day, and re-read after that, such is the talent of the author for writing compelling reading. But, the wait is a killer, and each new book is regarded with much less enthusiasm by myself, and my friends who read them. I STRONGLY suggest, if you are thinking of reading these books, that you wait until the series is complete, as it is REALLY depressing wondering for YEARS between books whether or not someone is going to live or die. The wait is a really good way for an author to lose a faithful audience."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off i'll tell u that i can't stand waiting from one book to the next but what else can i do, since i love the books and want to continue. If RJ needs that long to write the book so be it, everybody out there has to remember that RJ in addition to being virtualy unparralelled author, he also happens to be a person. Now, i have also been accused of being a person, thus i have a bit of insight on the subject. A person needs to eat, sleep, *$)#, play, and do any number of other things that they are obligated or inclined to doing, the fact that he has to do all this cuts into his writing time, TO BAD. Sure he could forgo all his human and perosnal needs to print books fast as lightning for the leeches out there, but the books would suffer and RJ would have a heart attack, and nobody wants that.... well at least i don't. As to repeated details, its all about being there, its like when your friends act in the ways that define them every day. Thats why we know the charicters so well and love them so much. The Tolkien conspiracy.... GET OVER IT, its 2 different authors, in 2 different time periods, form 2 different countries, and to enourmously different plots and literary levels. Now, don't tell me about how tolkien was the &quot;first&quot; this and that, cause Homer wrote the Illiad and the Odessey a couple of millenia before tolkien was a tiwinkle in his ancestor's eyes. Woops!!!! (actualy homer didn't &quot;write&quot; the oddessey and the illiad, they where passed on oraly and eventualy put to paper, but he did create the stories) .... hmm the book itself is great too :) ... almost forgot to mention it with all this *$@$ about Jordan this and Jordan that, if u are so hard up against what he is writing just dont' buy the book, i admit i have them all in hardcover and i think its kinda expencive, BUT, how many of you people out there go to the movies and fork over 8 bucks to see an hour and a half of HORRID storytelling, NO plot, BLAND humor, charicter developement.... in the movies..... RARELY. and this is for something you got to see once, not a book that as many of us have, you get to read over and over, and with each succesive reading discover things you missed the first times and get reaquainted with old friends. Although i intend to see the series to the end i hope it is no longer then 10 books... i just can't wait longer then that :P but.... if it takes 15(which i highly doubt) i'll still be there on release day and i'll still buy it and i'll still love it... as long as its still good that is.

I demolished the first three books in a week, and continuued plowing through the rest the minute I could get my hands on them. Now, after a frenzy, I am stuck. The action has slowed to a lull, and it's driving me crazy. I wouldn't mind so much if I could go on reading, but there are no more books to read. Now I have to wait another year or two for the next book. I would love this series to go on for a long time if I could continue reading, but I can't stand being stuck with nothing more to read. My advice to the potential reader of this series: Don't start reading until the series is complete. It is not worth the pain and suffering. of the anticipation and immediate dissappointment at finding nothing more happening. To Jordan: Stop your repetition. We have all read your previous books. Also, stop going off about people's eyes and what they mean. I loved it at first, but now it has been overused.

The time frame covered lasts only a period of two or three days. It's true that there are portions of the stories that add significantly to the overall storyline, such as the search for the &quot;Bowl of Winds&quot;, however the majority of the book dwells of the seemingly endless psycho analyisis of almost every character in the story, relavent or not!

It does not compare to the earlier Wheel of Time books but it easily kept my interest. In fact I found it very humorous in many places. I do agree that the series does need to move on. My biggest point of criticism is the battle between Rand and Sammael. There is very little detail and in fact it leaves doubt as to weather or not Sammual was destroyed. Overall however the details of the characters are nescasary to further develop the relationships between them. I will be disappointed however if the series continues with a single encounter per book between Rand and one of the Forsaken."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Once again, Robert Jordan manages to put together a nice paperweight. I don't know how I've managed to do it, but book seven is now behind me. Honestly, the series has been a great saga, but I'm getting a little tired of it and I want some sort of end to it.All &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; manages to bring to the table is the introduction of still more characters. The major characters practically accomplish nothing in the continuing story line. This is beginning to remind me of a daytime soap opera. It's been going on for years and there appears to be no end in sight. As long as people keep forkin' out the cash, Jordan is going to continue to stretch it out.This segement of the epic could - and should - have been about half as long, but I guess Jordan thinks we need to concern ourselves with detailed descriptions of what everyone is wearing. I guess he also thinks he needs to tell us every time Nynaeve yanks on her braid... which is about every other page of the story where she is involved.Note to Mr. Jordan.... Get on with it already! I want to know how this ends..... or does it?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is writing, in my opinion, one of the best series ever.

It has been years since the first book came out and we seem no closer to finishing the series then last decade!Dont get me wrong, I love the series. I just think that the plots are following a formula: Rand gets more crazy, things look bad, women play some politics and each victory leads to a tougher battle...

There are so many people coming and going here, I don't even pretend to follow it. Carhein, Caimleyn (sorry about the spelling), it has gone on so long I can not even remember the difference anymore. I just skip ahead until I find something to hold my interest. I mostly read/skim each of these books just looking for whole paragraphs, and sometimes even chapters, that could have been edited out to make the story move along. I used to recommend this series to everyone, but no longer. I can't bring myself to get someone else sucked into this 10 (15?) (20?) book series.

Jordan's series now contains so many characters that by the time we touch base with each one, we are at the end of the book. Some of the things that were funny or cute in the earlier books are becoming stale. His constant references to switching and spanking are tiresome now in Book 7. In this book Rand al Thor appears more whining as he struggles with the inward Lews Therin. After reading through the intricate descriptions of places and attempting to remember where Carhien and Tar Valon are, one wonders what was accomplished by this volume. Will Sammael reappear? How about Moraine? There are hints she is not dead. And what of this Olver character? What purpose does he have in this book, except for some very minor comic relief? Perhaps Volume 8 which is almost ready to be published will answer these questions. But as a reader of the seven volumes I wonder when Jordan will finally come to the battle we have been waiting for. Sometimes Nynaeve, Elayne, Egwene and Mat are so bumbling and susceptible to childish behavior, how can the world be saved? Come on, Jordan, finish."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is just a continuation of a plot which has been inane at least since book 5. Some previous reviews raved about the superb characterization which even the likes of Tolkein could not achieve. I guess I agree that he has done a fair share of characterization, although there seem to be many duplicate characters in the story, and all of the characters come across as 10 year olds trapped in large bodies. Before even reading the information about the author, I could tell that he was a male war veteran, because of the chauvenistic description of intergender relations, as well as the decent description of warfare and bias towards physical appearance in judging a characters worth. Nynaeve, Morgase, Moiraine, and the women Forsaken seemed the most independent females in the series at its inception, yet now they have either become simpering whining subservient lovers, the epitome of evil, or &quot;dead.&quot; As for comparing Jordan to Tolkein, Tolkein was clearly a scholar of unparalelled skill in the subtleties of symbolism in characterization, which is evident in his revolutionary essay on Beowulf. If you need someone to pound characterization into you because you are too lazy to study and examine the intricacies of the characters yourself, then RJ is the perfect person for the job. Tolkein was a master of subtlely, so if you examine and think, you will see that he created much richer and realistic personas than RJ's,not to mention more taseteful ones. RJ is not a master of characterization, he's not even a good characterizer, and is worse in this book than in any of its predecessors. For good characterization, read Tolkein, Charles Dickens while you're at it, and then spend the time to open a critical eye on their works. As for the flippant horrid 90210esque plot, a long tangled plot can be interesting if everything an integral part of the work. RJ's plot certainly does not fall into this category, as can be seen by the fact that he could have dispensed with the whole search for the weather bowl, and most of A Crown of Swords in the process. He is lacking something called artistic unity, not suprising for someone who is the John Grisham of Fantasy, and has little talent as an artist on the whole. People may say I could just have burned his books and never read them again, and I agree. However, he wasted my time in the first place, especially by misleading me into thinking that he was a decent writer at the beginning of the series, and I hold my time valuable. In all, this is one of the biggest time-waster reads of the past year, and if you don't like to waste your time, I recommend skipping this book and probably the rest of the series at this rate."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Judging from the stack of reviews, there's no middle ground. Either the reviewers want to crown Jordan &quot;King of Fantasy&quot; or they want to abandon him for his betrayal of the promise shown in the first books of this series. I stand in the latter group. For all of those reviewers who gave this a 10, try reading George RR Martin's &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; to see how a well written story is crafted.Having once been an enthusiasitc devotee, I cannot believe how rudderless this story has become. Subplots and multiple character perspectives once gave depth and texture, now they bore and irritate. There are fundamentals of story telling like pacing and balance that have been cast aside while RJ belabors every loose thread of the pattern.The dialog has become repetitive and the characters wholly predictable. Nothing moves forward until the very end, when, with the sudden realization that he better deliver some bang for the readers' bucks, he has Rand face off with a Forsaken and the Seanchan arrive in true deus-ex-machina fashion.After book six, I vowed to wait until the paperback comes out.

Unfortunately, one must plow through tons of pages filled with meaningless descriptions of how everyone is dressed, descriptions also of endless random thoughts of the various protagonists which ultimately have nothing to do with plot or character development. I bet I know why Jordan has done this. His publisher likely can charge more for the sequels if they are of a given length. Mr. Jordan develops a plot, which is not really detailed enough to satisfy the publisher's demand for novel length. Eagar to please his publisher, Mr. Jordan fills 90% of the novel with random thoughts and description. This really would have been a good book, if it were about one fourth as long, and filled with more &quot;pearls&quot;, without so much &quot;seawater&quot;. I wish Mr. Jordan and his fans a more bejeweled future in the upcoming novels."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Normally I would give Jordan a 10. I have loved everything he has written and have read each book at least three times (except CoS). However I have two complaints.. One-- The women are ridiculous bitches that have become painful to read. They give me headaches and I feel myself bored to death of their anti-male hangups. They have seen worse than nudity. so relax. and two-- The delays between books make it impossible to remember all the sub-plots that are constantly being piled on. Lets tie up some of the loose ends!! Anyways, Jordan rules and I will continue to re-read his books. Nothing else can keep my attention long enough.PS - Terry Goodkind should stop reading Jordans work before he sits down to write one of his own. It is sickingly obvious.

First I wish people would stop whining about length. Description is nothing that can't be skimmed through-if you don't want to read about scenery, don't. Nyneave and her braid-SO?? Her braid pulling is something that sets her apart, makes her unique. THe Forsaken-these aren't street bullies-they are the upmost evil, only surpassed by the Dark One. You can't expect Rand to just blow them away with one shot. Bad points-Robert needs to explain some things here-if the Forsaken are lose, why don't they just show up in Camelyn and nuke Rand while his back is turned? There has to be something stopping them. And of course, I didn't pay 30 bucks so Sammuel MIGHT be dead. The action should have been better in the Shayol Guol scene. But the end left you hanging for what is gonna happen with Morgase, Perrin Faile and Berelain, Mat and Olver, and Elayne Nyn. and the rest of the Aes Sedia. Despite some problems with plot, this is a series I am proud to read"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Right. The average rating &amp; rave reviews given here for Crown of Swords is understandable considering that anyone not enamored with Robert Jordan's writing would surely have forsaken the series long ago.Well, I'm the exception it seems. I can't stand Jordan's writing style: plastic characters who, with the possible exception of Nynaeve, haven't changed a hair since the first volume; unnatural dialogue; and completely unnecessary and overly-long descriptions of people, things, or scenery which have absolutely no bearing on the advancement or enhancement of the plot, but only serve to plump what could otherwise be a 400 page book. Let's face it, the action (and I'm not just talking about sword &amp; sorcery scenes), is getting a bit thin as Jordan tries to come up with so much filler to stall the Final Battle that must eventually take place in the Final Volume. I can understand his wanting to stretch this out as long as possible to sell as many volumes as possible, but if he's just going to &quot;recycle the plot&quot; (to paraphrase another reviewer), then I think it's time to put this baby to bed.Okay, that's my beef. On the other hand, I have to admit that Jordan has come up with some very good ideas, and has woven a rich and believably complex world. I can at least admire his work &amp; effort to this point, even if I don't much approve of the execution. And for this genre, he has accomplished what few other writers could even conceive. Still, he ain't no Tolkein.Yes, I am still reading the series, 7 volumes later, despite my pan of his writing ability. I don't recommend this book to people who believe in the traditional character development, realistic dialogue, conflict resolution, the end-of-a-book-is-the-end-of-a-book devices. I will recommend this book (&amp; this series) for those who want to become immersed, without care or purpose (or thought), in a richly populated &amp; complex fantasy world."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've nearly finished reading Crown of Swords, Book 7 of Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series.

In these recent chapters of \\"The Wheel of Time\\", paying close attention to who is where, saying what to who, can REALLY get you closer to an understanding of what the Forsaken/Chosen are up to as well as other characters/orginizations. I don't see how some of these others giving reviews can call it boring with some of the ever-present threat of dangers coming in between Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, other Aes Sedai from Salidar, Elayne, Aviendha, Tar Valon Aes Sedai, and not to mention the Seanchan. Robert Jordan has created an incredibly complex flow of conflict between several different sides and still has been able to move the plot toward the inevitable Tarmon Gai'don. Underneath it all, he constantly shifts the point of view of the reader around between the characters giving different views on the same issue. Not the least of which is the seemingly constant battle of male vs. female view of dominance and understanding of issues in whole. I for one commend the author on his ability to \\"weave flows\\" this complex and still keep a hold on the basic plot."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan has thrilled and excited me with his interesting and innovative fantasy series. But in his newest book, the old charm is growing stale fast. The book suffers from a slow and plodding plot, which covers a week or so of time over 800 pages and ends with very little actually happening. No new ground is broken: the characters have the same conversations that they had in any of the previous four books and Jordan spends too much time describing every little detail, some of which add little or no substance to the characters or story. (Such as Jordan's constant description of the clothing worn by the woman and how they blush if a skirt is too risque). Sure, details are great but when the same images are repeated every ten or so pages then they lose their importance and become just another line to skim over. Jordan is a talented writer and I thoroughly enjoyed his previous books (with the Great Hunt as my personal favorite), but someone has to reintroduce this series to the concept of story pacing. The book has large deadspots and the ending, after 800-so pages, is disappointing and seems a bit contrived. After the dramatic conclusion in LOC, COS takes two or three steps back. My only wish is that Jordan returns to storytelling with a purpose rather than bogging down the books (and me) with the mundane. The Wheel of Time series is a grand and epic idea. It deserves better than this."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The worst of the seven books out so far; this has nothing to do with action (or a lack of), rather the loop holes and slow pace of the whole storyline. I have read many of the reviews and agree with them all: this is a good book that could have been far better. A few pointers to RJ: 1) get Rand of this guilt trip (especially over women!), 2) last ditch rescues (ie Rand's by the &quot;unknown&quot; character) have to stop .... yes, the wheel weaves strangely, but surely some method must stem from the chaos, 3) Rand's going mad? ... stop belaboring the point, your readers are not without a memory, 4) female characters ... seem way too &quot;feminist&quot; (for the lack of a better term) for my tatses (a few is ok, but all of them?!) otherwise they are excellently portrayed, 6) I could go on, but what for? All I am trying to say is that RJ needs to pick up the pace a little, show us some more action .... if Rand is going mad why not show glimpses of that? Is there a &quot;civil war&quot; among the Aiel? And the White Tower ... maybe it is time that it truly/physically fell. If the &quot;last battle&quot; IS approaching, chaotic change occurs ... show us some of it but DO NOT lose touch of the characters.

He is patient as always with the development of his characters and decidedly rich in detail. The one real sore spot in the book is the situation with Mat and Tylin, which did not have nearly enough buildup of Mat as a typical womanizing soldier to make the humorous irony as apparent to us readers as it is to Nynaeve and Elayne.While maddeningly slow-paced at times and often switching POV's precisely when we least want it (a credit to Jordan's ability to get us to identify with various characters), there was very little here that did not in one way or another advance the behemoth of a plot the WoT sports; for the most part, this was like the opening in a chess game--the pieces slowly move into position for a powerful onslaught. The introduction of Shaidar Haran, Cadsuane, Rand's devastating injury, the spy in Egwene's camp, and the final build-up to the long-awaited meeting between Mat and the Seanchan's Daughter of Nine Moons all stand poised to flow over the reader in an avalanche of world-shaking action at the start of the next book, while significant plot points which have occupied the characters such as the Bowl, Lan, and Nynaeve's block were resolved.Everything is in place for an explosion in Path of Daggers.

Anybody know when it is coming out?I agree that the rape of Mat by Queen Tylin was disgusting, and the giggling reactions of Nynaeve and Elayne even more repulsive (Robert Jordan must not realize that most women detest all rape, even the rape of a rather horny young man).Rand has to stop feeling alternatively guilty and arrogant -- has gone on long enough.Jordan needs to do a better job of moving the plot and of character development to produce a sequel of a quality of the first few of this series.

I agree that the plot in CoS is not fast-paced, but I also point out that I have read the seven books at least ten times each, and am still pondering direction and growth...I have one question to ask of the nay-sayers, and it is '...Do you truly believe?...'. Those readers who can suspend disbelief and enter the world have no problem with the plot stalling, nor with characters seeming to hold the same qualities the group to which they are members. After all, the ones most griped about all belong to groups where their individuality is somewhat submerged by the overall group focus. Think on that, and how many characters are/have/will be created and expanded...and learn to spell a little better, please.....

Of course, we live in mortal fear that Jordan will suffer some tragic accident before he finishes. I agree, this wasn't the best book in the series. However, I think it was needed to set up the next couple. It layed a very good foundation for book 8, and began the downslope towards the series' conclusion. Book 6 was the turning point, and Jordan had to take time in book 7 to address things that have been left dangling. And, of course, to dangle us some more. For all those who criticize Jordan for taking too long, I'd advise them to relax and enjoy it.

I become a recluse whenever I read his books. The 7th book might not be the best, but it adds some development of the characters. I admit I get frustrated at the lack of communication between the characters. It would seem to simplify everyone's emotions. Rand is being used by Aes Sedai and can't trust anyone. I feel for him, but I don't understand why he just sits back and takes it when he could force those who want to use him to take a back seat,(like what he did to the Aes Sedai from the Tower at the end of book 6.) He made them swear fealty to him. I wish Rand could somehow manage to marry Elayne without angering Min and Aviendha. Rand does have a right to the throne of Andor, His real mother wasn't a true Aiel. His mother was Tigraine, the queen of Andor who suddenly vanished. She vanished into the Waste and ended up being adopted by the Aiel. Rand holds back from sharing his feelings because he doesn't want to trouble anyone with his emotions. Maybe if he shows a little more of his thoughts, things might be easier to deal with. I am going insane waiting for the next book. Jordan cannot stop now . He is the man.

I love the way new plots and characters are revealed, even if it does extend the story out of sight of an ending. Looking into the thoughts of seemingly unimportant characters is crucial to understanding what is really happening. As an author, the biggest mistake is to make your readers not really know why something happens. Mr. Jordan, I congratulate you on that point.

It is so rich and teeming with life. How could you not have anybody to root for. Even a character who shows up to open the door for the major characters is a real person with a life and background.

In the 'Wheel Of Time' series Jordan shows that he is the master of creating a fantasy 'universe'. Unfortunately the weath of absorbing detail means that the plot starts to grind to a halt, especially so in 'aCoS' (the timespan of the book is only two weeks). If he continues his trend it seems that it will be another 3-4 books before he can even contemplate finishing. The crunch point is that the story showed that Jordan has no idea how to end his epic series and even more important is the fact that aCoS was published in 1996 and the release date for the 8th book is pencilled in at 3rd Q. 1998. Does this mean that Jordan will give up the series as a project to difficult to bother to complete?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown Of Swords, the latest novel in the Wheel of Timeseries begun years ago in The Eye of the World, has yetagain impressed me with its scope and magnitude. Jordanclearly depicts a mastery of the fantasy novel, drawing hisreaders again into his richly detailed and wonderfullyfleshed-out world. His fantasy work is the epitome of anepic novel.Yet I feel that in this latest of efforts by Jordan, thelength and depth of this novel was sadly lacking. A CrownOf Swords advances the action ten days; the first fewchapters are rehashes of events that took place in what Ifeel is the best of Jordan's novels: Book Six, Lord ofChaos. This I found extremely dissapointing. The bookitself is shorter than most Jordan works; in addition, thetypeface is larger and the spacing wider, clearly disguisingthe brevity of this work.It is my opinion that said brevity is no fault of RobertJordan; after years of writing The Wheel of Time, even themost dedicated of authors feels wear and strain. Anyauthor must be given time to replenish his zest for writingand his zeal for the project at hand. Jordan, I feel, wastoo enmeshed in the deadline wars and was forced to feedhis hungry fans, tossing out a half-finished book thatlacks the richness of his previous works.Several issues are resolved in this novel, bringing a senseof closure for some characters, including Nynaeve, whofinally gains control over her powers and finds Lan, herloved one. Rand kills Sammael and takes Illian, closinganother issue left unresolved since Book Five. Yet theaction was paced too quickly, a result of the pressureplaced on Jordan to complete his work quickly.All in all, A Crown Of Swords is satisfying if short,leaving the readers hanging at the end of the novel, withMat's life in the balance. Frankly, I feel that if Jordanwishes time to recuperate from the strain of writing soquickly and so well for so many years, he should be grantedhis sojourn by his readers and publishers.

However, it looks like this isn't going to happen any time soon. Character and plot development (or even subplot development!) are negligible.

His characters, plotlines, and cultures are truly seem real due to his fabulous descriptions. Some may call this being too wordy, but in fact it serves to draw us, the readers, into this magical world he has created.ACOS did a good job of keeping the plot going in the direction it will eventually end, I think. However, so many new questions are raised by the various subplots and new characters which arise in this story that it is difficult to envision this series ending any time soon.So, is that good or bad? Good, in that it means that we will get to enjoy Rand, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene for many more pages. And bad, in the sense that we will probably have to wait five more years for the conclusion. An awfully long amount of waiting. Still, it will be worth the wait, and I, for one, can't wait to see the next one. Thanks for sharing your vision with us, Mr. Jordan!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Mr Jordan does a good job of laying the foundation for: 1) The meeting between Sammael and himself. 2) Setting the stage for the alliance, through marriage(?) with the Seanchen.

Action is slowing down, there are barely any powerful, or interesting scenes, and there is little to no progress except in the last chapter.Most of the people who read this novel, read it because of the previous six books and not because of the novel by itself. Jordan should get back on track in the 8th book though, with the Seanchan coming, and Mat having to fufill the prophecy of marring the Daughter of Nine Moons and all.I'm still looking forward to the next book though, but I hope that Jordan cranks up the action and suspense, and kills off a few more Forsaken"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"All of the Wheel of Time books (in paperback; I'm poor) are sitting on my shelf in a tidy row. So why, when I'm looking for something familiar to read in bed or in the tub, do I reach instead for Tepper, Cherryh, Le Guin, Zelazny, Moorcock?The answer is that this series is getting tired. Jordan has severely lost the focus that made the first three books so good, and I wonder how he's ever going to tie up all these loose ends. Or will he take the sloppy way out and leave them hanging? Certainly that happens in real life, but it makes for sloppy fiction.This book has some funny moments and interesting plot twists, but that's about it. Jordan has also lost his grasp of his female characters, who are in severe danger of being reduced to one-dimensional bitches.

None of his other books/series must be selling, as he milks this one out forever. As good as this series is, and it is very good, I will NEVER pick up another Jordan series again.

In the beginning I was interested and couldn't wait to get to the next book in the series. However, I was unable to finish Path of Daggers...since as the series developed, the author seemed to be dragging out every event so that the series has now become boring and repetitive. He doesn't mention some of the older characters while intoducing newer ones.

However, it's not for everyone. Jordan is probably the most descriptive writer I have ever read and he will describe everything he possibly can in one situation in order to set the mood properly. This makes his books, and the chapters, very long. Some people don't like long and descriptive, elaborate writing like this, I do, and I believe that Robert Jordan is the best author I have ever read. Read the series in order, starting from the first book, and it will make a lot more sense and be much more enjoyable reading.

I like Rand and Min's relationship it was abit anoying to hear Rand say that it would be better to send Min away so she will be safe.(I'm sick of hearing that, and like I said on a earlyer review this is coming from me a guy) I'm no expert on women but if they threw themselfs at me I would love it. Plus Mat still thinks he knows better than Nynaeve and Elanine I loved the way they had to appologise to Mat (especaliy Nynaeve who thinks she shouldn't Appologisy at all) All in all a good book.

Instead of the \\"The Wheel of Time\\", I think it should be called \\"The Never Ending Story\\". The first 4 books were truly outstanding. Robert Jordan was one of the few authors I could justify buying in hardback edition. Books 5 and 6 were still fairly good, but the story was beginning to get bogged down. This book is the first in the series I didn't like at all. Out of habit, I bought book 8 but the idea of reading another of those 40+ page, boring, and in most cases irrelevant prologues was enough to give me a headache. I'm not reading any more of this series. Sometime in the distant future, if I live so long, this series may come to an end. I'll read the last book just to se how things end up. As for the rest of the books, I'll wait for the Reader's Digest version or for the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the first book in the Wheel of Time Series that I have to think about whether I enjoyed it. In the previous books, the climax was always better than the rest of the book and the rest of the book was pretty darn good. I will say the building action in the Crown of Swords is first rate, but the climax is lacking. I am definitely glad I read the first part of this book, but I could have skipped the last 100 pages. I kept waiting for something new and exciting to happen, and nothing did. Even the conclusion leaves you hanging, not in a good way. Jordan was written nine books, and he can't even be definitive on Sammael's fate. He brings back other forsaken whenever he wants, but he won't even tell us if Sammael even died. I have two problems with this novel. One is the conclusion I have already mentioned. The second is Rand's love life. I don't care who he loves or how often he makes love. Many men have loved more than one woman, but I don't think it qualifies as adventure. However, the rest of the novel is much better and makes the Crown of Swords worth reading.What Happens? Mat, Elayne, and Nyn find the bowl in Ebou Dar, but do nothing with it yet. Mat becomes a pretty for the queen of Ebou Dar. Rand is captured by Aes Sedai and severly mistreated. He is rescued by Perrin and makes some of the Aes Sedai swear fealty to him. Perrin continues to have troubles with Faile and Berelain. The Ashaman have increased in numbers and power. Elaida has lost all power to her Keeper. Egwene is on the march for Tar Valon, and is receiving massages from one of the resurrected Forsaken.Mat Cauthon makes this novel. I think the plot of this novel is centered around developing Mat's character, eliminating Sammael, and creating aminosity between Rand and Elaida, perhaps between all Rand and all Aes Sedai. A third of the novel deals with Mat and his views and characteristics. Lews Therin's voice makes this novel even better. The voice is usually funny and ironic, I look forward to pages with italicized sentences. As long as Jordan includes them, I will enjoy the Wheel of Time Series. I have critized this novel, but it was also my second time reading it, which is why I gave it four stars."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This continuation of my favorite series has a lot of new things coming to pass. I did not like some of the things that happened, but I am sure that Robert Jordan's reasons will come out soon. This series will stay on my shelf until I have memorized every word. It is a must have. Though I wouldn't recomend getting into this series in the middle. It really sucks, and be very frustrating."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If you like books concerning mean spirited, narcisistc, condescending, arrogant, man hating women....then by all means read these books.Every time there is something said by a woman, 9 times out of 10 it's a nasty comment about men. It's very predictable now. When I see, for example, Nynaeve says, &quot;......text...&quot;, I know it's gonna be something nasty. There is no if's, and's or but's....it will always be something nasty. So I just roll my eyes and skim,or skip through that part. Maybe that's good after all, since it makes the 900+ page book go by quicker.I can't understand how there are actually pregnancies &amp; children in this bizzarro world of man haters.I think Robert Jordan has real female issues. Maybe his Mother was mean, or he got dumped by his girlfriend in High School...I don't know. But the way he portrays women is disturbing."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While I was reading this book, I was also reading Dickins' A Tale of Two Cities. It's crazy! Robert Jodan writes in the exact same style as Dickins(the long-winded detail, innumerable characters,and innumerable clauses). It's so obvious, that I wonder if Jordan use Dickins as a refernce. Check it out."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Nearly everything said is done so wryly or dryly. Find a page with conversations(getting harder to find in the sea of pointless descriptions, but at least people can think wryly and dryly), and you will find both terms used at least once. I would love to get a digital copy of the book and run a search on them and count em up. I wouldn't be surprised if they showed up 400+ times each. There has to be more then those 2 near identical options. It seems like Jordan thinks of something he believes to be clever(but it usually isn't) and then repeats it ad-nauseum. Like \\"but there it was\\" and \\"so and so looks at someone else as if for the first time\\". Those two phrases were repeated in the first 6 books hundreds of times.This book is mildly decent. But this is one of his warm ups for his successful attempt to write the worst book ever(CoT). Lots of tea, dresses, sniffing and braid-tugging in this one, but is still only foreshadows the massive amounts of them yet to come.Yes, the Mat/Tylin storyline is more then disturbing. Had the roles been different, people would have been screaming over the rape storyline. Jordan simply has an adolescent view of women. He needs therapy badly.The worst parts are the Egwene storyline. The irony of her always screaming at Rand for having a swollen head, and then she does nearly the same things is too much to bear.The books read alot like an school paper that had to be a certain length. It is like the publishers said it had to be a minimum of 12 books, but since the entire story from start to finish could be a good 8 books, we have been subjected to lots of filler and plain bad writing.Jordan is a lot like George Lucas, both took a story and universe that interested many people and destroyed it, forgetting that story is more important then eye-candy. The unending, and uninteresting descriptions in the book and fx in the movie rendered both terrible and are both forever scarred."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was ridiculously eager for this book to be published. And then, somewhat disappointed. To my mind, this is the weakest of the series so far.This being said, it is still a ripping good tale. Jordan should be commended for being able to (more or less) successfully sustain such a mammoth story over so many volumes and such a period of time.Although not the strongest effort, again (as with all previous volumes), the plot takes some interesting twists and turns, introducing new characters and new tensions.My fear, though, is that Jordan really does not know how, when, or where the series is going to end. There are an increasingly large number of loose ends which will need to be tied together or the ending of the series will be a disappointment of major proportions."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This series has gone completely in the tank and A Crown of Swords is where the tanking begins. By itself, ACoS has decent action and some plot developments. But its resolution is ambiguous, unlike each of the previous six books, and it adds more questions to a plotline already polluted with innumerable mysteries, intrigues, factions, and characters from the six previous books (and 3500+ pages) that preceded it.After the end of Book 6 (Lord of Chaos), it seemed that the series had regained its direction. But in ACoS, Jordan introduces numerous &quot;new&quot; characters (most notably Moridin), new concepts, and new intrigues. The pacing slows to a near crawl for nearly 600 pages before erupting to the uncertain ending. Worst of all is the dithering by Rand, the messiah figure who is paralyzed by inaction for most of this book and Book 8.The first five books of this series are great. But book 6 is an interlude from the non-stop action and this book begins the series descent into unabashed authorial self-indulgence. To wit: The Wheel of Time Series is now at 10 books plus a prequel and a guidebook but less has happened to the characters and the plotline in books 7-10 than did in any two books of the first five. The 10 books are probably seven times the length of Lord of the Rings and at least two or three more sequels are likely.If you're prepared to stick it out to a (hopefully) colossal ending, then get this book, the execrable Path of Daggers and the others. If not, get out now and save yourself the grief so many other disappointed fans have endured."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Braids are pulled. Skirts are smoothed. Men are degraded. The three ta'veren are clueless about women. Rand has temper tantrums. Lews Therin cackles madly in the background. The quest for enchanted tupperware continues. Clothes are described in excruciating detail. The required number of Forsaken is killed.Despite these things, some good did happen in this book. It wasn't nearly as slow as book 6. I almost cried from joy last book when they discovered Traveling, no more month long journeys! I was also overjoyed when Elayne and Nynaeve finally began to grow some sense. Adviendha is having a good effect on them. Some of the same phrases are used constantly, do you know how many times Nynaeve pulls her braid and girls smooth their skirts? Talk about irksome. The constant description of clothes is still incredibly annoying. I think the guy wants to be a fashion designer. The World of Dreams was created simply so the he could describe dresses. hem, moving on. Plot does manage to progress. Another Forsaken was killed. Bet ya didn't see that coming! We can probably predict how many books there will be based off the number of forsaken. The thing in this book that bothered me the most was definitely the Whitecloaks/Morgase. We didn't need to know all the political currents of the whitecloaks if they're all killed by the Seanchan! One chapter would have been enough. Many subplots have not been wrapped up, and instead continue to grow. Ah well. Good, entertaining books, but not prime literature."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was somewhat intimidated going into this book because a great majority of the friends who had recommended the _Wheel Of Time_ series to me said that it lagged considerably around the seventh book. Well, maybe I'm the freak of the bunch, but I truly enjoyed this book.While it is true that the more annoying aspects surfaced occasionally (such as the \\"Rand wished not for the first time that he understood women as well as Mat did\\" thing), the action moved on at a canter rather than the walk-gallop-walk pace of the previous books. To me, it stayed at a level of perpetual \\"almost there,\\" reaching points of extreme excitement at times and lagging a bit at others, but still maintaining at a very enjoyable pace. I found that I'd read a hundred pages and not even realized it. Yes, it may have less action than the previous titles, but this is a SAGA, people. At points, it has to explore every aspect of the world... which brings me to my next point. What I think people are chafing at is the exploration of EVERY character. My experience is somewhat different, I'm sure, than most readers out there simply because I went ot the bookstore around two months ago and bought all nine books at once. Ever since then I've been reading them non-stop... and I gotta say that this book is just fin in my estimation. Exposition versus action. It's summed up right there. I, for one, think Jordan balanced those two concepts admirably in this one.But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. :)"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"No, that summary probably isn't very original, but I don't care. \\"The longer the better\\"? Whatever.Actually, if book 7 conveyed the feeling of something actually happening, of plot devices advancing (as opposed to just one device: i.e. that darn Bowl), as the first 6 books did somewhat, I wouldn't mind nearly as much. LoC had an ending that salvaged something decent from the sludge that dominated that book and I was hoping CoS would pick up that pace. But no, all we get is the bowl, some new women (who, like most of the women are, surprise, annoying) who can channel and a new foe, the Golem (which to be honest, is one of the few halfway decent developments in the book).We also get the rape of Mat Cauthon at the hands of Queen Tylin and despite what anyone else thinks, even if it isn't necessarily a brutal rape, it IS a rape. How else would you describe sex at knife-point? Maybe I'm getting too hung up over it, but even if I'm not offended by it, I'm still bored to death over it. I really could care less about Mat's cavorting or how pinchable his bottom is. It's naught but filler material that's not funny, offensive or not.I'll be the first to admit that Jordan has fashioned an IMPRESSIVE fantasy universe here that has a LOT of potential. But I just don't see that potential getting realized. What I do see is a lot of plot threads swaying in the wind and a lot of filler in place of what should be there: resolution and character development. There are about a ton of cool things that could be happening that aren't.But what can I say? If all of you die-hard fans of Jordans' love his style of prose, more power to you. If you love it great, I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise. But please don't tell the rest of us to \\"put up or shut up\\" or \\"have patience\\" or what have you. It simply doesn't work for everyone. Some of us have no use for pages upon pages of descriptions of people's necklaces and overcoats or the number of women about who are falling out of their brassieres.One more point I'd like to address is that of this issue of comparing Jordan and Tolkien. First off, there's nothing wrong with comparing two authors however long between their respective time periods. Fact is, both are in the same genre. Comparisons are bound to happen. Secondly, I'm not going to assume Jordan is ripping off Tolkien, but I do see a lot of parallels that suggest to me that Jordan drew a lot more inspiration from Tolkien than he's been known to admit. 1) Rand's village/ Frodo's shire; not a big parallel, but it's there. Also, both Rand and Frodo are pivotal in defeating the enemy; 2)Moraine/Gandalf - both attempt to recruit Rand and Frodo, respectively, into doing their respective duties. Also, both disappear into some kind of abyss, while battling an enemy. 3)Lan/Aragorn - both of their physical description suggest that they are very similar in appearance and both are revealed to be kings without a kingdom. Furthermore, the last seven letters of Lan's last name, Mandragoran, are an anagram for Aragorn. 4)Padan Fain/Gollum - both have been used and abused by their masters and both have vendettas against the main characters; 5)Myrrdraal/Ringwraiths &amp; 6)Dark Lord/Dark One; no more need be said really for the last two. And that's where the similarities pretty much end (unless anyone else has some others?): Jordan's story goes off in a much different direction than Tolkien's (what that direction might be is anyone's guess, Jordan's included, perhaps), but the similarities are pretty apparent and it seems a bit hasty to dismiss them out of hand.Anyway, enough ranting. Buy Crown of Swords if you are, unlike me, absolutely dumbfounded and tickled ecstatic by Jordan's literary style, but then I didn't really need to say that did I."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In _A Crown of Swords_, Rand becomes increasingly unpleasant. Although this is understandable, given his treatment while kidnapped, his suspicion rapidly grows into a sort of paranoia. Rand's job also becomes increasingly more political, as he meets with Sea Folk delegations, puts his loyal Aes Sedai to work, and tries to find trustworthy regents for Elayne in Cairhien and Andor. A brief and rather unsatisfactory battle with Sammael at the end gives Rand Illian, and yet another set of political responsibilities as he accepts the crown there.Meanwhile, Egwene marshals her power in the Salidar camp, and Moghedien/Marigan escapes, a fact which doesn't seem to bother anyone quite as much as it ought to. Egwene also is involved in all sorts of political exploits, as is only to be expected from the Amyrlin. But she at least starts off towards Tar Valon, making progress towards the Tower Civil War, with her little army. She also finds Lan, hidden by Myrelle, and sends him to Nynaeve in Ebou Dar.Which brings us to the most interesting portions of the book: the search for the Bowl of the Winds, and Mat. Mat is always interesting, but once he's accosted by Queen Tylin, the fun ensues. That, added to his belief that Altarans are crazy for fighing duels over almost anything, makes for some amusing escapades. And, of course, he's dumped on constantly by Nynaeve and Elayne, newly raised and quite aware of it. Elayne, though, lets up when Aviendha makes her (her determination to learn ji'e'toh and have Aviendha be proud of her is hilarious, mainly because Elayne finds it so hard to put away her prejudices) and Nynaeve is much less aware of Mat once Lan returns to her. There are a few encounters with various creatures of the Shadow, including Moghedien, the introduction of a new bit of Tower history in the Kin, and the invasion of the Seanchan at the end to add to the excitement of poking through the Ebou Dari Combat Zone looking for a bowl Elayne and Nynaeve have only seen in a dream. And Mat, left behind in Ebou Dar with a wall on top of him, provides a great hook to book 8."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"\\"This is the lowest rating I have given any of the books of the series. I liked the book, but I don't really think that anything happened in it. Rand fights one of the Forsaken, but we are not sure if that one is dead at the end of the fight.\\" That was what I said when I first reviewed this book three years ago. From further research, I have since discovered that this book was the first to not be fully edited after the author had written it. I think much of the angst and frustration that the author received over book ten he should have received over this one. It is the same old formula of a Forsaken dead every so many books, but now the formula was old and trite, and poorly edited by the author, as well as being the first of the Unedited Volumes by the publisher. Initially, I gave this a four star rating because of the introduction of Cadsuane, but after reviewing, rethinking and re-reading, I had to change mine opinion. Both as a stand alone, and as part of the series, book seven can only be considered a stop-gap, one that we had to wait for and after the first six volumes, one that was not very satisfying.

Whether it be the corruption of the One Power, an overbearing female editor, or a greedy desire to milk the readers from book to book, it is clear that he is losing direction.I commend him on the first 5 or 6 books. A tremendous storyline and plot, a geographic world that he is able to describe without losing coherence, and a cast of characters that far surpasses Hollywood for movie extras. I especially like the way he does jump around. Some storytellers get too involved with sticking to one scene and finishing it, but Jordan is not afraid to bounce around between characters and scenes (it reminds me of the fast paced scene-changes of Star Wars). I do not like his break from traditional grammar, the way he throwes adverbs and adjectives around makes it hard to follow, kind of like reading something from Shakespeare.Unfortunately, the huge breaks in storylines, the micro-stories that don't just evolve, but appear out of nowhere, the meekness of the male characters, the inability to continue hunting arch-enemies have all contributed to a great fizzle. After book 1, I bought 2-8. I am reading 8, but if it continues to fizzle, I may take a break until the next few books are out in paperback to see if Jordan recaptures the flair needed to bring the story to a climax.Other recommendations: Stephen R. Donaldson, &quot;The Thomas Covenant Chronicles&quot;; Raymond E. Feist, &quot;The Riftwar Saga&quot;; Elizabeth Hayden, &quot;Rhapsody&quot;."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In A Crown of Swords, Elayne, Aviendha, and Mat come ever closer to locating the Bowl of the Winds, a ter'angreal that may reverse the endless heat wave sent by the Dark One and restore natural weather. Egwene begins to gather all manner of women who can channel--Sea Folk, Windfinders, Wise Ones, and some surprising others. And above all, Rand faces the dread Forsaken Sammael, in the shadows of Shandar Logoth, where the blood-hungry mist, Mashadar, waits for prey.There are many masters in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien would certainly be lauded highest when it comes to development of the world in which the events he illustrates transpire. Robert Jordan, for all the criticism leveled against him for what appears to be a marketing ploy - stringing the series out as long as humanly possible to generate greater book sales - would certainly have to rank near the top for character development. His series is filled with various interesting folk with varied viewpoints and motivations. While most (decent) authors go well into detail in describing the motivations and quirks of their heroes, Jordan doesn't stop there. Even his villains are thoroughly detailed. Moghidien, for example, one of the wickedest of the fallen, has a history and personality that influences how she reacts, as well as insecurities and frailties. Good, evil, benevolent or malign, all of Jordan's characters are fully fleshed out, and we get a fair view into their minds and motivations as the drama unfolds. Yes, the world is on the simple side, and yes, the plot, of late, has lost its pace; but it's a world and plot filled with only the most fascinating of folks. At a series currently juggling over 50 characters, all unveiled over the last 10 volumes, it's a commendable and laudable feat, indeed.Fans of Jordan's epic series of many volumes of many pages have been whinging since book six that the series seems to have no end in sight. Unfortunately, it's now a race against the clock for Jordan and his publisher, whose decision to prolong the series as long as they have may result in the work never being finished. Ironically, Rand, the hero destined to die on the slopes of the Dragonmount, may outlive his creator. Full sympathies to Jordan, and I, for one, hope he holds out long enough to complete the story he began."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is the undisputed hack, and dick tease of fantasy and science fiction history. When reading his books one gets the opinion that he sits at his computer for a year and prints everything that he types in during that time. One of the other reviews of this book suggests that Jordans character development is superior to Tolkein, Tolkein had a thing called subtlty, by the end of the Lord of the Rings one had an intimate knowledge of the characters, Robert Jordan has spent Buddha knows how many pages shoving so much information down our throats that if you didn't know what sort of characteristics the characters had you would have to be a blind monk living in some outer province of Mongolia. Tolkein was a composer who's work is a masterpiece which had brilliant imagery, when Sam and Frodo climbed Mount Doom the reader was there with them. In conclusion Jordan is tradesman who should employ a decent editor to cure his severe case of literary diaheroa"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Let me start by saying that I love Jordan's work. The wheel of time world is very well crafted and interesting, the characters well developed. The best part of this series has always been the ordinary characters, folks we can all relate to, who rise above their droll lives to really make a difference in the pattern, something we all long to do.There are some great parts to this book, but Jordan's characters begin to get clich&eacute;. It appears that Jordan is loathe to change his characters and allow them to appear complicated and multifaceted or duplicitous, as if personality were a linear construct that develops only along a set of well defined traits, but never really matures or changes (just becomes more \\"powerful\\"). Instead, he tries to make up for the banality of the main characters by continually introducing new characters and subplots, which appear to get increasingly bizarre and difficult to really relate to as the series emerges.VAGUE MINOR SPOLERS FOLLOWThe worst part of this book is the ending. Rand becomes a complete idiot along the lines of the Friday the 13th victim who is too stupid to turn on the light or not go into the tool shed where the sharp objects are kept. Yet, he is saved from his stupidity by yet another mysterious character who of course shows up in the MOST unlikely place in just the nick of time.I want to give Jordan the benefit of the doubt because this started out as easily one of the best series I've read. I hope to read that it has returned to that in reviews of books further along."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The seventh book of the wheel of time series is good. But it is pretty drawn out and there's a hundred charcters you have to keep up with. Though this book has a great ending like most of this series. There are a lot of Ashaman, dedictated, and soldiers dying and it's because of one thing: the taint on saiden. Rand has three loves now, and the Forsaken are getting angrier. Some parts of this book especially the ending won't let you put this book down.A very fun, interesting read."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan captivates the world again in his latest addition to the incredible &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series. In this volume, Elayne, Nynaeve, Birgitte and Aviendha are still searching for the ter'angreal that may repair the weather and rid the land of a dry, stifling heat. Matt tries his best to keep track of the women, but with little luck. Elayne and Nynaeve eventually learn a much needed lesson in humility when they realize that in order to find the ter'angreal, they must enlist the help of Matt and his ta'veren abilities, and this means submitting to his wishes. In their search, they stumble across a secret group of women who can channel, and who share some very interesting secrets. Elayne and Nynaeve also meet with the Sea Folk, and from them they learn that this ter'angreal is a large, crystal bowl called the &quot;Bowl of Winds&quot;, which in acient times belonged to them. Unfortunately, this odd group of women are not the only ones searching for this powerful artifact, and they find that they may have bitten off more than they can chew. Meanwhile, we learn the Black Ajah finally obtains control over the White Tower at Tar Valon, by command of Maasana, one of the Forsaken, who is hiding out at the Tower, disguised as an Aes Sedai. One of Maasana's right-hand women, we learn, is the Keeper Alviarin, and Elaida quickly learns she is not in power any longer. We also learn the full story of Moghedien's escape from Salidar, and her unpleasant visit at Shayol Ghul. But, instead of being destroyed as she assumes, she finds her soul bound to a seemingly young man who calls himself Moridin. He's not exactly a Forsaken, but he draws the One Power directly from the Dark Lord, which can only mean one thing: he's the one in charge, and Moghedien has no choice but to bend to his every wish. Aran'gar, the mysterious, reborn Forsaken is still posing as Halima, and, aside from being the one who secretly freed Moghedien, continues as a secretary to Delaina Sedai in Salidar. Egwene, the new Amyrlin of the &quot;Little Tower&quot; works to prove that, dispite her youth, she is every bit as strong an Amyrlin as any before her by officially declaring war on the White Tower, and beginning the long march to Tar Valon. Rand is still busy planning to kill Sammael, and keep both Cairhein and Caemlyn together, a job he not only finds challenging, but deadly. At the same time, the renegade Shaido Ael plot with a mysterious &quot;wetlander&quot; and his &quot;Aes Sedai woman&quot;---who are really Sammael and Graendahl in disguise---to somehow bring Rand to heel. The story, at first, seems threaded out in a thousand different directions, but most things fit together well in the end like a jig-saw; but there are still many pieces missing, and we are left hungering for more."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords (ACOS) marks the series starting to flounder. On the positive side, Jordan's story-telling skill shines through in many places like for instance the cour'souvra episodes. Also my favorite character Min at last comes into her own and more than proves her worth. Tyelin's pursuit of Mat is hilarious. Egwene's struggle to assert herself with the Aes Sedai is excellent. At long last comes the decisive battle with Sammael, long in the planning, and the choice of Shaddar Logoth as the fateful venue is inspired. But the negatives are starting to pile up as well. The juvenile wrangling of Elayne and Nynaeve is tiresome and just not in keeping with their characters as Wisdom and Heir respectively. Morgase, who has been Queen of a realm behaves in equal immature fashion. RJ does not seem to have a very good opinion of women. His suggestion that Nynaeve, post-marriage, is more sensible when Lan is around is almost insultingly sexist as if to suggest she just needed a strong husband to settler her temper down. RJ is also leaving large gaps. He just informs the reader, almost offhand, of their marriage, performed by the sea folk. Considering the interest in this denouement, it is amazing that he does not tell us more about the marriage itself. Instead, he increases the complications in this already complex plot. In addition to two reincarnated Forsaken, we now have a new Nae'blis pretender called Moridin (who is he? Where did he drop from? No answer). As if to balance the sides, RJ brings in a legendary Aes Sedai, Cadsuane (how come nobody ever mentioned hide nor hair of her before this?). And the Seanchan, after disappearing in Book 2, now reappear in force in Book 7. Still a good book, but one gets the strong feeling that RJ has lost control and is himself not quite sure where it will all end."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I only started reading the Wheel of Time series about 6 weeks ago, and I was fortunate to be able to read them all back-to-back. I think most of the negative comments people had about this book derived from the fact that they were waiting 14 months to read it, and felt let down. I didn't have that kind of wait (though I do now, for &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot;) so I'm a lot less disappointed.Crown of Swords did a lot to further many of the plots we have seen developing over the last 6 books. A lot of questions have been answered, and a few (just a few) more have been raised.The Seanchan finally make a decisive move at Ebou Dar, the Forsaken look like they're getting their act together and enough of the armies and renegade Aes Sedai and rogue channelers have been introduced to make moves against the White Tower inevitable.It wasn't as much as a rollercoaster ride as book 4 or book 5, but then, realistically, that sort of pace can't be maintained forever. Consider &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; to be the calm before the storm. After all, that's how the book ends. With those words... &quot;A storm is coming. A storm is coming.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the most disappointing book yet of the series. I hate to spoil all the surprises, but here I go:- The Aes Sedai are still so arrogant and annoying that you actually start hoping they'll all be stilled. Better yet, collared and whipped mercilessly. All hail the Seanchan!- Rand, Mat, and Perrin continue to regard women as The Grand Mystery of the Universe. Not to mention them acting like a bunch of chaste catholic school girls about sex. Well, with women anyway. Maybe Two Rivers is a place where the sheep are more nervous than the women. Come on guys grow a pair or get out of the closet already.- Infinitely more insignificant characters are introduced that you will never remember if you spend any time between this book and the next. Don't worry, none of the assistants to the Assistant Peon are relevant.- For all the women with low cut attire and men running around with swords, where's the senseless violence or gratuitous sex? Someone kill somebody already! Not even much sensible sex and necessary violence. Even Rand's one duel with another blademaster is over before it begins, with a remarkable lack of description. Tragic- These books are getting cookie-cutter. Hmm, only 5 or so Forsaken left...and 4 more books? Gosh, who could possibly get killed in the last chapters of this and the next 4 books? Rand skulks around talking to himself. A Forsaken plots against Rand. Rand kills Forsaken.- Just skip the last chapter and make up your own climax, you'll probably be more satisfied than with what Jordan wrote.If, like me, you have concluded that the majority of Jordan's writing is fluff, just start skimming for dialog, you won't miss anything important and it will trim this book down from 855 pages to about 55 pages."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"And what's wrong with that? That's one of the strongest realistic aspects of Jordan's writing. Just like life, it has no definite end or beginning. Fortunately Jordan has the ability to conclude this masterpiece which seems to be growing into an all encompassing and unstoppable epic. I put my faith in the writer to determine the pace and flow of his work, yet even my faith was starting to tremble when the story started to lose ground in a sense that past events were moot and would have to be covered again. But Jordan delivered in his latest book, &quot;Crown of Swords&quot; and resolved many long standing issues while the story picked up steam. If the series takes longer than the traditional fantasy, so what? It's not traditional. I've read most of the &quot;landmark&quot; fantasy writers, and they pale in comparison to Jordan's depiction of his characters. They are humans, not heroes. This approach gives Jordan's work the quality and depth of non-fiction. Those who dislike it have reached their level of reading incompetence."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I will admit that I was enthralled from the first this series. I enjoyed the first two to the point where I just bought the next six so I wouldn't have to wait. But when I finished six I realized that the characters had been becoming more and more annoying as the story went on. The women are untrustworthy and as a general rule too full of them selves. Now I have nothing against strong female characters, some of my favorite books center around strong women, but these women just make you want to tear out pages of their Nonsensical bickering. I found myself counting the pages till their chapter was over or even considering skipping them all together. The male characters are weak and forever repeating I wish i understood girls like my two friends. As if the annoyance of the characters and the droning on about unimportant things such as what Random Aeil #1 is wearing wasnt enough the story gos NOWHERE!! Literally almost nothing relevant happens. I struggled to find something, anything that would restore my joy in reading an amazing series but I found nothing to restore my faith. I even tryed listening to an audiobook on the chance that listening wasn't as bad. I WAS WRONG! IT WAS WORSE! I can't struggle through another book like this and from the reviews i've seen it appears I won't be waisting my time.Another amazing series gos the way of the dodo."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Let's get one thing out of the way, Robert Jordan is the best writer in the Fantasy World, is he perfect? No he is not.Crown of Swords is not as exciting as the Lord of Chaos (the last book in the series). I will try to avoid spoiling anything for people who haven't read it yet. Through most of the book the pace is rather slow, but things start to really pick up the last 2/3rds of the book. The ending was OK, but not great.I'll take this opportunity to point of some aspects of Mr. Jordan's writing that is frankly starting to irritate me. First of all, the strong female characters are a refreshing change, but seven volumes of reverse sexism (against men) tends to get a little annoying and ridiculous. Nynaeve is getting to be extremely irritating. Second, Mr. Jordan is making the series needlessly complicated with numerous subplots, how he is going to resolve the storyline without an inevitable letdown is beyond me. Third, why is every other woman described as either &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;handsome&quot;? Are there no average or ugly women in Mr. Jordan's world? And I don't care how Mr. Jordan explains this, but there is no excuse for having all the nations speak the same language and have no organized religion, it is utterly unrealistic (I know, this is fantasy series, but still).Now that all the bad stuff is out of the way, this is still the best series out there and I can't wait for the paperback edition of the Path of Daggers."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"KEEPS ME WONDERING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT..

Lots and lots of talking. But I still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Without a doubt, A Crown of Swords is the point at which the slowing pace and bloat that have begun to infect of Wheel of Time series become far more apparent. That being said, it's not as though nothing happens in the book; there's a surprising assassination attempt, the conquering of an inner demon that has been hampering a character since the beginning of the series, a battle with another Forsaken, the culmination of a search, and much more. But even with all of that happening, there's a sense that events are happening at a much slower pace than they have been, and the payoffs still feel muted, as though we've only cleared the initial hurdles, not the plotline as a whole. More than that, there's a sense that Jordan is still starting new plotlines and steadfastly refusing to close off many of his old ones; given that we're in the back half of the series, that's becoming problematic. With all of that being said, though, A Crown of Swords is still a good read, and if it's not up to the high standards of the first few books of the series, well, that's a high bar to clear. Moreover, the book's pacing is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that it's full of strong character work; admittedly, the characters' perceptions of each other still remain problematic at times, but their internal growth remains compelling, and the addition of several new perspectives - including that of some of the Forsaken - allows Jordan to continue to expand the emotional complexity of his world. If you're not entirely sold on Jordan's world by this point in the series (which seems unlikely, given just how much reading you've done to get here), A Crown of Swords may turn you off. But for fans of the series, there's still a lot of character depth, some rich (if slowed) plotting, and Jordan's boundless imagination. And even if it is a lesser entry in the series, that still makes it part of one of the defining fantasy series out there - and even a weaker entry in that is still pretty solid."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Love the series.

Now that the final book is coming out I am fulfilling a promise to myself, made long ago, to read them all again. It's a very different experience reading them back to back. I feel much less anxiety over the speed of the plot (when will Moraine return?! When will Rand go crazy? What will the three girls do when they are finally in one room together with Rand?!?!!). Instead I am enjoying all the nuances of the story. Also, it is much easier to follow the disparate narratives when you're not taking 2 years off between books.All this background to say: 7 is an awesome installment to the series. Particularly riveting are the adventures of Elayne, Nynaeve, Birgette, Aviendha and Mat in Ebou Dar. It is enormously gratifying to see Mat being treated like a human being by Elayne and Nynaeve. We also get to see how Elayne and Nynaeve begin to fashion their personae as young Aes Sedai as they search for the Bowl of the Winds."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"For some reason I cannot yet fathom, I keep buying and reading the next installment in this never-ending series of books. What I expect from these actions, I cannot say. But finally, my persistence has paid off. With this book, Jordan has gotten partially back on track with what he did in his first 2 books. Yes, I realize that we're now on book 7, and I wasted a lot of time on those 4 books in between. But hey, sometimes we need to read something that keeps the pages turning. Jordan certainly does that, and if you pick this book up you're in for another 850 of them - pages, that is.Several of the negative traits you've come to expect in Jordan's previous books seem to have dried up in this one. At the time he wrote it, he must have taken some of the criticism to heart and done away with the gratuitous breast flashes and idiotic male-female dynamic that was a detriment to the narrative. This book is devoid of that, which makes the read an improvement over the last one by leaps and bounds.Still, the conclusion is weak. The ending is something you know is going to happen before you buy the book. More importantly, the manner in which he writes it is weak. Even though we can be reasonably sure what will happen when the book ends, it still has the potential to be interesting. Sadly, that is not the case here. In the overall scheme of things, the conclusion is a mere wisp of 5 pages in a cloud of a story. The rest of the book was decent, even if he did keep one negative trait of not coming any closer to tying the series up.As I said in the last review, and the review before that, if you've read this far you're probably going to read the next one. There's no point quitting after 6, since one assumes the end must be near and book 7 was the best in a while. I'm not sure it deserves the \\"international bestseller\\" acclaim it gets. But it's a decent read, which helped make the train ride home every night go by faster than it normally would have. For that, it's probably worth the price.Might as well keep on reading, no need to stop now."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"sections from the crown of swords to the crossroads of twilight, meaningful to the orginal story, can be contained in one single book! the rest is all about hair tugging, description of clothes, anotomy etc. robert jordan is probably dead - the publishers are milking it for all it is worth!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While I can't deny that A Crown of Swords doesn't come near the Dragon Reborn, my first and fave WOT read, the seventh book definitely shows that Jordan has something left in his big series. Here's where our favorite characters are:Rand - off managing political situations by the dozen , walloping yet more of the forsaken, and falling in love with Min at the same time. Sheez, stop cheating, Dragon!Min - convincing Rand to stop sulking about his madness and to fall in love with her. Poor Min, she used to be the best character.Mat - He's learned a lot in the Crown of swords, between looking for the Bowl of the Winds, escaping the clutches of Queen Tylin, (who I found disgusting and as evil as the Forsaken), and meeting Birgitte. The high point of Mat's story is when he realizes that he can like a woman, such as Birgitte, as just a friend!Perrin - he's gone absolutely crazy over Faile, and it's ruining some of his reality as a character. He continues to be a strong character, however.Moghieden - THE COOLEST CHARACTER IN THE BOOK! I never thought I'd sympathize with the Forsaken, but Moghieden keeps all of the vitality of Jordan's former books. Caught by a magical mindtrap, Moghieden is forced to serve under Moridin. She has the most sense and character of every woman in the book.Egwene is still Amyrlin, and busy looking for Moghieden. Elayne and Nynaeve are searching for the Bowl of the Winds to save the weather. More about this in the 8th book? I hope!Although it's wobbling, the Wheel of Time hasn't hit a ditch and broken yet.

It is full of twists and new threads, and old threads being untangled. The prologue annoyed me a bit (as much as one of these books can, anyway)because 48 pages were used in giving the viewpoints of Elaida, Gaywn, Sevanna etc on the Battle at Dumai's Wells, which, as you remember, finished &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;. Normally I wouldn't have minded, but when I first read this book, it was the last of the series. Mr Jordan does a lot of that in this book, giving the pespectives of the Forsaken, the Aiel, the Aes Sedai, Morgase, Min (who I don't like- she flirts too much with Rand, while pretending she doesn't, and never has the guts to say something to him-but her viewings are interesting.)Elayne is ...Elayne. Looking for the Bowl, in love with Rand, but worried about Aviendha and Min loving him too. I've never liked Nynaeve, and I like here less here. She is a whining, conceited, can't-see-what's-in-front-of-her-because-her-head-is-too-big, prim and self-pitying fool. For all her talk about sense, she has the least of all the characters. Mat is still himself- carefree and gambling and chasing girls while running from trouble as he sees it. Trouble has formed a habit of following him, though. Perrin is being a dutiful husband to the overbearing and jealous Faile- I acan't wait till the hawk arrives. Egwene is Amyrlin in Exile, slowly and carefully gaining more power and say and respect, even though it means discarding custom. Rand is fighting against the Forsaken, the Aes sedai, Lews Therin... He's worried about what Sammael and the rest of them are up to, about the Asha'man staying sane, about staying sane himself, about what to do with the Aes Sedai, and Andor and Cairhien without rulers and a thousand more things. I think he might go mad from the stress, not the taint on saidin.Read this book if you have to spend food-money to buy it, or if you have to fail maths...Mr Jordan, keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was the greatest of all the Robert Jordan books Ihave read.

Nyneave finally rids herself of her block, and grabs al'Lan with both hands. The delagation sent by Egwene to find the bowl ter'angreal finds the bowl, and comes altogether closer to slapping back the Dark One's hot finger on the world. Mat finally will come face to face with his soon-to-be wife, the Daughter of the Nine Moons. In the end, Rand almost rids himself of Sammael, but with some speculation on my part, Sammael doesn't seem to really die. Jordan leaves some mysterious new characters laying around, such as Moridin, the man who calls himself Death; and Shaidar Haran, the not-quite Myrdraal who can channel the True Source; and the \\"helper\\" to Rand with his fight against Sammael. This book was really great in clearing up some questions, but had that Robert Jordan way of creating more. I look for the next book with great expectations. Hopefully, Robert Jordan will finish this series before he dies!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was disappointed in the seventh book the first time. Now I can't even read it through. It's very hard for a former Robert Jordan maniac to admit that I've gotten over a world I've been in love with for almost two years. First of all there's the slow disintegration of character. You don't notice it the first time - or even the second. But then it seeps in. I LOVED Nynaeve in the first book. I still liked her in the second. In the third I got a little annoyed. By the fifth, she had turned into a braid pulling, futile little baby, which seems to be a trend for the rest of the females in the series. I still like Elayne, though I wonder how long that will last. Min....forget it. And did you notice that every single woman in power has been lowered? Morgase does nothing but feel her heart pound when Tallanvor comes near, Siuan cleans Gareth Bryne's shirts. Min simpers for Rand....Is it my imagination, or is something seriously wrong here?As for plot. Yup, good old plot. Remember that something like that used to exist? Remember when once-upon -a-time what happened in the books made a difference? I mean, it actually led somewhere *gasp*. Does anyone remember Slayer? Or Luc? Or Mazrim Taim? Or Demandred? Does anyone remember when something more meaningful happened rather then &quot;The Bath&quot;?And I'm sick and tired of hearing how guilty Rand is feeling all the time. Or how Perrin is too obtuse to know how to deal with his wife (though Faile is one of the biggest pains in history). While it made me like them the first time, I can now repeat every single one of their speeches after seeing one word. You just have to guess if its the &quot;I'm so guilty and the mountain is awfully heavy&quot; or &quot;why are they bowing to me I'm just a farm boy&quot; or my very favorite - lets not forget it- &quot;Are All Women Crazy&quot; and &quot;I'm Never Going To Understand Women.&quot; That's no surprise, considering the author doesn't. And considering the fact that these women's main goals in life seems to be to confuse the men (except when they're thinking about how gorgeous they are). I mean, after all, what else does a girl have to do with her life?!I don't consider myself a radical feminist, but I've had enough. I'm planning to give the eighth book a chance, if only for old times sake (it IS hard to drop an obsession), but if it repeats the pattern, I'm going to get rid of every Robert Jordan I have, and be ashamed of ever having read this junk. Some holes in a pattern can't be repaired."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan has the habit of bringing the story to a climax and then destroying it utterly. While LoC showed me that the story was finally getting somewhere - Aes Sedai kneeling to Rand made my hair stand from sheer exhilaration - with CoS, my hopes of the series getting better were dashed.Other than long passages of totally useless description, Jordan seems to be trying too hard to explore the human mind by making the characters more complex than ever. Well, he failed. We can only sigh at how many of the feelings and emotions of the characters seem lifted from the previous books.Also, instead of polishing up the storyline now that the Last Battle is approaching, Jordan chooses to further complicate it by introducing new characters and new subplots. The first five books of WoT were superb; most importantly, the story then had a direction. Now, we only see Jordan single-handedly destroying the world that he has created.But the book was not without its pluses, I suppose. For one, Mat develops more as a character and is absolutely hilarious, especially the episode with Tylin, which is strangely disturbing yet appealing. I also liked the part where Rand visited the rebel camp outside of Cairhien, but alas that episode was not rounded up nicely.All in all, I still say, what the hell just buy the book and read it. You've gotten so far, might as well finish it. Besides, it may be amusing to see how Jordan blemishes his series further."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"***2.5 stars***Oh well -- it looks as if the exciting Lord of Chaos was an anomaly, as Jordan is back to excruciatingly slow pacing, wasted space, and not much of anything going on. In fact, the first 500 pages of this 850 page book could have taken 100-150 pages if Jordan had any idea how to write succinctly. Here is a plot summary of those first 500 pages: 1)damage from the battle ending book 6 is surveyed by Rand and the future is pondered. The future of Cairhien is pondered, Rand deposes a would-be Queen, and the future is pondered again. 2) Meanwhile, in Salidar, the future of the Tower is pondered, Moghedien escapes (boy, nobody saw *that* coming eh?), Telaranriod is visited and power balances are pondered. Lan returns. 3). Elayne/Nynaeve/Aviendha search for terangreal in Ebou Dar and Mat goes to the palace in Ebou Dar and is sexually pursued by the Queen. Meanwhile, Darkfriends and Forsaken briefly scheme and plot. 4) A new Aes Sedai confronts Rand and Elayne and Nynaeve apologize to Mat for ordering him around so much. Throughout, Loial incessantly whines about finishing his book. And all the while sedan carts are dodged, skirts are smoothed, and plenty of punch is had by everyone. Joy.Of course, it's entirely possible to write a gripping, thought-provoking novel in which very little action occurs. Such classics as Darkness at Noon and The Stranger are mostly the ponderings of imprisoned individuals sitting in their cells, for example. Closer to the fantasy genre, Frank Herbert's excellent Dune Messiah is all about politics and plotting; little in the way of action happens, yet it is fully engrossing and is, IMO, the best-written book in the Dune series. Robert Jordan, though, seems unable to make his books interesting when the plot slows down, and this lack of ability hurts each and every one of his Wheel of Time novels -- even the more successful earlier entries. This is not one of the more successful Wheel of Time novels, though, and it is killed by his two-dimensional characters sitting around and bickering at each other.Things pick up a bit from there and the last third of the book is interesting, but the first two-thirds come very close to being outright awful, and the question is: WHY? Why, after laying out some very interesting conflicts and important plot developments in book 6 did Jordan abandon it all in book 7 to focus on new issues of substantially less importance to the plot, and substantially less interest to the reader? I have no clue, and I'm wondering if the author does, either."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Once again, Robert Jordan has brought an exciting new chapter into his Wheel of Time series.

Yeah, it is good mostly, but the storyline stretches, and strecthes,and it seems that it finally broke. While reading the books, I always skipped the fill-in stories and went to the chapters about Rand himself.

When ever someone meets somebody or talks to each other, they always seem to underestimate each other. The pace is , at times, EXTREMELY slow, but this is a vital bridge to main plotline. I hope that the eighth (and of course, so far) last book is better paced and I hope the ninth and tenth books finish off lavishly.RJ is Not as good as the Master of Fantasy Tolkien, but he is truly the Master of Detail and long epics.

That's the only real problem with the book, you get some answers but even more questions arise that leave you in greater supense."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I too have read the WoT series and I confess that I am hooked! This last book seemed to be like the last two. They are starting to get bogged down somewhat. Too many little characters and too much detail on trival stuff. The story line needs to start moving to a finish. I worry that something might happen to Robert Jordan and that the series will NEVER be completed. Please Mr. Jordan, let's get this &quot;show on the road&quot;."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The seventh installment of the Wheel of Time is purely transitional. It lacks the excellence of volumes 3, 4, and 5. Even volume 6, which had enough slow parts to make Frank Herbert proud, had an incredible and thrilling ending culminating with the immortal phrase &quot;Kneel . . . or you will be knelt.&quot; Crown of Swords has a completely unsatisfying ending and merely regurgitates the plot devices and dialogue of the previous volumes. I read this series when Eye of the World was initially published. Jordan began raising the bar of quality fantasy and looked like he would redefine the concept of the fantasy series. Now he needs to raise his standards and provide a full, complete and satisfying resolution so that this series will not become an afterthought in the shadow of George R.R. Martin's forthcoming classics."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Maybe not cliche enough? One of the things I feel is missing from Jordan's work are the cliche mano-a-mano testosterone pumping fights. At the end of the book when he fights Sammael they dont even meet face to face. And remember back when they were fighting the Shaido Aiel. Mat falls off his horse and theres an Aiel standing over him. Instead of some dramatic battle RJ cuts ahead to the end of the battle, AFTER Mat kills Couladin. One of the best parts of the series was when Mat whooped Galad and Gawyn in the White Tower.Cliched? Maybe, but cool. In a related issue why is Mat so much more cooler than Rand? Im surprised the Aiel wise women dont wrapped him in blankets and put him in his cradle at night."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is definately the best book in the series. I dissagree with those that say that nothing major happened in this book. Nyneave, and Elain found the bowl, and another of the Forsaken is down for the count. Also, Nyneave discovered how to heal those that have been cut off from the True Source. The only problem I had with the book is the women. Every woman in that book is as nosey, and arrogan as she can be. I don't know why Rand puts up with everything that he does from those women. I wish, just like every one else, that the 8th book would come out already, but I realize that with a series like The Wheel Of Time, that Jordan has to take his time to develop all of the many different plots and characters.

To me, Lord of Chaos was a great disappointment; the momentum of the plot, up to that time admirably maintained, faltered almost to a stop. This book began to recover that momentum, though not quite to the previous level yet. However, the next book in the series promises to get back up to the usual high quality level.Overall, the series has had involving plot, and good characterization. The impact of the story and characters was greater toward the start of the series, I think, but is still there. It is not nearly as powerful, however, as Tolkien's climax, or especially as the first two books of the Sword of Truth series (which is exceptional for emotional effectiveness).I look forward to the next book in the series.

There are too many new characters to begin with and too many new ones being introduced. And with Rand's gargantuan task of uniting all the countries, I have little patience for the unnecessary dialogue and constant bickering.I couldn't possibly care less about how pretty Rand's buttocks are, or how the set of some unnecessary character's nose keeps him/her from being good looking; and I'm tired of reading about how men and women won't ever understand each other and the inevitability of Nynaeve, Elayne and Egwene bickering with one another. That bit with Mat and Queen Tylin (another useless character) was disgusting and something I didn't need to read."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off, let me just say that, while I found this book to be enjoyable, it is probably the least so of the Wheel of Time series. What I felt to be the pimrary problem, however, was not the characterization or a &quot;lack of plot&quot;, but instead the pace of the book. The first 90% could have been a good deal faster, although I felt that there was still a lot of story packed in. The last 10% however, was so rushed that it contributed next to nothing. Rand's &quot;battle&quot; with Sammael seemed little more than a caveat to the actual storyline, and its anti-climatic nature only reinforced this impression. I can only attribute this perhaps to the restrictive influences of real life concerns and publication deadlines. If Mr. Jordan had taken a few more months with the book, the delay would certainly have prompted an uproar from his fans, but perhaps A Crown of Swords would have then been a more solid piece of work. With that in mind, I am perfectly willing to wait until November '98 for the next installment. Yes, it would be nice if the series was resolved within the next few years at a rate of 1 book per year, but I, for one, would prefer that the quality of writing not be sacrificed for speed."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"To keep it short, there are too many characters doing too little in the story.It lacks the motion of the first books and is clogged down in too much detail.

Now i admit, that while ACoS was a little dissapointing, a lot of very important things happened that needed to happen. I think that those who complain about it being too long should just drop the series, because we all know he's at lesast 2 books away from completion. There is too much to cover. For those who thought there wasn't any plot...my only answer is that you are so used to reading simple books, that when a complex series comes along, you're left gaping. The thing i like most about jordan is how he has hundreds of subplots running, all a part of the main plot in small ways. Some have said that you could skip reading this book, or that jordan could have tacked it onto the end of the last book. I think that if he had tacked it onto the end of the last book, when A path of daggers came out, you would be complaining and whining about how confusing it was, and how he just jumped into stuff with no warning. Doubtless, you'd complain that aPoD needed more information to flesh it out. I just have one more thing to say to those who didn't like it. DON'T READ ANY MORE. if you thought it was too long, or not interesting, or if you couldn't find the plot, then burn the books, and never even think of RJ again.

I don't see why some people are saying that nothing is happening in the book and that it's all a bore. Are you kidding me? Nynaeve married LAN! Rand killed one of the Forsaken!

And for those people who think that the book is too long, don't read it, and for those of you who are complaining about how you totally busted all your money on this: did you ever hear of a library??

The Crown of Thorns is the seventh book. While the story seems to be dragging a little, I think it is to be expected. After all this is 3/4 the way through the expected 10 book set. Most any book has a slight lull about 3/4 the way through it.The Crown of Swords is a delightful montage of characters places and events. While truthfully it is difficult to keep track of some events at times, I found the novel to be excellent as expected. Earlier novels of this series are still superior in there focus of intent and there seems to be a great deal more linear direction. This book's non-linear shotgun approach ties up a lot of loose ends that have kept me pondering for several books now.The development of the characters and story line from book one to this current book are accomplished in such a fashion as to force you into a soap opera like addiction to find out what happens next to your favorite character. As another reviewer pointed out, maybe three separate sub series for the main characters is needed, or at least Jordan shouldn't try to keep chronologically current with all the main characters at once, unless he brings them back together.All in all I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a SF/Fantasy Adventure series. A long serie"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was pleased to recieve R.Jordans newest novel in the Wheel of Time seriesbut I must admit I was let down conserning the ending.

But when I got into the intrigue and the complexity of the series I was astonished. I have never read anything that comes even close to creating such a &quot;real&quot; world when it comes to politics, war, powers and love.The 7th book in the series didn't make me disappointed at all. I read through this brick in a couple of days and found myself shocked over how soon I finished it. I can't wait to read book eight.In the series we follow Rand Al'Thor - The dragon Reborn and his struggles against the Dark one aswell as against his own followers. Everybody wants a piece of him and he sees advesaries where ever he turns. In the first book we came to know Rand, Mat, Perrin, Elayne, Moiraine and Lan. (And a whole bunch of others which the story doesn't circle around) In this part(the 7th) Rands powers have increased considerably and does so throughout the continuing battles of Rand.I strongly recommend all readers to feast your eyes on this author. You don't have to be a fantasy fan to enjoy this book to the fullest. It appeals all type of readers, since it simply has it all"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Complexity, relationships, good characters: these were things all the things Robert Jordan's first books shared. Unfortunately, it now all seems to be unraveling. While the book began well, it quickly rolled down hill. Rand is becomimng one of the most annoying, obnoxious, and arrogant creeps that ever walked the face of this (or that) planet. Worse then that, he's allowing his arragonce to make him stupid. I'm mean, who really thinks Sammael's dead? I'm writing all this because Rand was my favorite character, and that is why it bothers me so much. Rand was a great person: he cared about people, and he did what he had to do. Now he's really losing it to his mood swings. As for his relationship with Min... It's better left unsaid. I love to see how an inteligent woman becomes a whiney little - slut? It's rather interesting. Now all we have to so is wait till Elayne shows up. Guess what will happen next. If RJ ruines that relationship, too, it only proves my theory that men have no sense of what goes on in women's minds.Also, many plot twist were raised in the fifth and sixth book that were never resolved. I hoped to finaly find out what is going on with Lord Luc and Slayer, and what about Mazrim Tiam? Is he trustworthy or not? Is he Demandred?I hate reading 700 pages only to find that NONE of this stuff has been resolved. I'm waiting for the 8th book now, but my faith has been sorely tried. Come on, Jordan! Shape up"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In Tolkein's books there are subplots, stretches of character development that do not involve apocalyptic battles, and little unfinished businesses that leave you wondering &quot;what if&quot;. These elements are also present in Mr. Jordan's books. Unfortunately while one can remember almost all of Tolkein's characters, plots, sub plots, battles, allegories and landscape, only a few salient details of Mr. Jordan's books remain memorable through the interminable course of his series.Those readers faithfully purchasing each of Mr. Jordan's books when they appeared in hard cover, due to the fact that his first three books showed such promise, should be credited with a great deal of faith . That promise has not been realized. His most recent book is an indication of a writer who has lost his vision. The original thrust of his plot has deteriorated into multiple competing sub plots with a plethora of unnecessary characters that are, at best, loosely linked together. There has also been a considerable dilution of the strength of the characters. One begins to wonder if it would not be better to separate the stories of the three friends that made up the core of this series into three separate series. This approach has proven to be successful, at least for a short while, for successful television sitcoms and soap operas.Without a doubt Mr. Jordan has produced a prodigious amount of writing during this series. One would hope that if writer's fatigue or greed has fueled this sorry excuse for a novel, his gentle readers' reactions would encourage him to either wait and publish a book that encourages his readers to continue purchasing the series or bring the series to a quick and merciful death.One fears that that the saga, so brilliantly begun, will be spun into a literary limbo. Either option mentioned above would be preferable to the current situation"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I absolutely love the wheel of time! I have read all the books over and over again. The Crown of Swords was as great as the rest, which means it was awesome! I could not put any of these books down no matter how many times I have read them. I sit in suspense for the continuation of Rand, Mat, Perrin and the rest. I could tell you about the characters in this book like they were my closest friends. The plot draws you into all of it so deeply you feel as though you are there. I have laughed, cried, rejoiced, and felt every other possible feeling when reading this book! I can not wait for the next book to come out even if it is the last. All good things do come to an end.

Jordan masterfully weavesfact and fiction into each of his novels. His characters are each uniqueand discernable in such ways that each novel islike a reunion with friends. His 7th book in THE WHEELOF TIMES Series is no different. The action is constant, and characters that one thoughtlong gone, return with determination in a theatric fashion.He is one of the few male fanatsy writers that put power andimportance behind female characters. His deeply wovenplot (which remains constant since book one!), detail of characters persona,and use of historical allusions, makes this one of the best of hisseries. As with any master storyteller, Jordan leaves a pieceof himself with the turning of every page. A must read"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This series has been like a roller-coaster ride for me. There have been definite peaks and valleys, and, after suffering through a valley with \\"Lord of Chaos\\", the series has taken another rise in this installment.Several sub-plots are playing themselves out in this volume, including Rand's successful escape from his imprisonment by the Aes Sedai and his subsequent removal of Colavaere Saighan from the Sun Throne. After her removal, Rand banishes her to a farm, but she ends up hanging herself.Lan, Moiraine's former warder, has returned and has married Nynaeve.Nynaeve, Elayne, and Mat are continuing their search for the Bowl of the Winds, a ter'angreal which may be able to reverse the endless heat wave which has been covering the world and restore the world's natural weather.Finally, the Seanchan have come back and are attacking Ebou Dar.Some interesting new charatcters, such as the Asha'man, men who have come to the Black Tower in order to learn how to channel, have appeared in this volume.I found this book to be better than book six was. Overall, I've enjoyed the series as a whole, but there has been little consistency from one book to the next. Aside from books one and two, the qualtiy of each following volume has changed with each ensuing installment; one book would be good, and the next would be not so good. I hope book eight will break the pattern and be at least as good, if not better, than book seven was."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Wow, A Crown of Swords, what a snoozefest! I'd rather read Kenneth Starr's 455+ page investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. At least I know that THAT story would contain some action. That said, I don't really have much to say about A Crown of Swords. Most people realize that this site, featuring amazon customer reviews of Jordan's most recent books, is little more than a message board. I doubt there's a novice reader out there who's really scanning these reviews in order to make a purchasing decision. Nevertheless, for whoever's interested, I'll sum up the book quickly: for 650 pages nothing-literally nothing-happens; then, finally, Rand awakens from his nearly 30-chapter slumber and defeats one of the Forsaken. Nynaeve and Elayne finally find their precious cereal bowl, the one they've spent 2+ books looking for. Mat gambles. Perrin thumbs the blade of his axe and smells a bunch of stuff. As always, Jordan's main characters continue to embody that odd combination of J.R.R. Tolkien meets &quot;Saved by the Bell.&quot;Rather, I'd like to take this moment to address a difference in opinion that has been voiced by several reviewers here. If you read through enough reviews of Jordan's most recent WOT books, you'll notice that the reviews are nearly evenly divided into two camps: those, like me, who find Jordan's most recent fiction about as entertaining as reading the phone book cover to cover, and those who claim that Jordan is a master story teller and eminent craftsman, an author who painstakingly paints his vistas with a steady, deliberate brush. Those of us who complain that Jordan is the king of bore are accused of being impatient; we're accused of being a bunch of attention deficit-disordered miscreants who can't appreciate Jordan's incredible talent for handling description.Description? Ah, now there's the stumbling block. What some label as description, I label &quot;wordiness.&quot; First, though, a word, however brief, about my own reading tastes. I read fantasy for fun. I read fantasy when I need a break from my studies. My real passion is for literary fiction (and occasionally, though not often, fantasy and literary cross paths (Ursula LeGuin's fiction comes to mind, or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale)). I say all this simply to state: I love description, I love detail, and I love the beautifully crafted sentence. But Jordan's &quot;description&quot; always stays commonplace rather than unique. If a character is, say, slightly older, we're invariably told that such character has &quot;streaks of gray at the temples.&quot; If a female character is less than gorgeous she's described as either A) &quot;handsome,&quot; or B) &quot;attractive rather than pretty.&quot; Staying with female characters, women in Jordan's world come in two flavors: thin or &quot;plump.&quot; I'm actually reminded of those PC role-playing games where you create a playable character, create a name, and then choose a character portrait. Sure, you may have a dozen portraits to choose from, but you're still limited to pre-rendered caricatures. Similarly, Jordan seems to have about a half dozen stock portraits, and he shuffles through them like playing cards. As for non-character descriptions, the same recycling of limited descriptions occurs; for instance, every ornate item in Jordan's universe is gilded: chairs, table legs, painting frames, beds, etc. Every vase or piece of ceramic is &quot;Sea Folk porcelain.&quot; Jeesh, give me novel (pardon the pun) description or else move on. If an author isn't going to provide me with something different-rather than the given, the &quot;already written,&quot; the &quot;I've-already-seen-and-read-this-before&quot;-then I don't want to read it.I'll end this review by venting some other frustrations-kind of related to the description stuff I wrote above-that grate on me and which show that Jordan is little more than an amateur hack. Those who hail Jordan as a brilliant writer should take note of the following brilliant flaws, grammatical and otherwise, that crop up repeatedly in Jordan's writing:1) Misplaced Modifiers-yes, these are difficult to avoid. Even the best writers occasionally let some of these slip out, but usually the combination of a talented author and a knowledgeable and devoted editor stamp out these little bugs before they appear in print. But Jordan and his editor (who, I understand, is his wife) usually miss about one per page (a horrible ratio!). Sure, Jordan's wife should catch these, but Jordan should also learn to write cleaner prose. ***EXAMPLES: A) &quot;At the last, he [Mat] slowed, easing onto the shaded walk bordering the stableyard almost on tiptoe&quot; (grammatically, the stableyard is on tiptoe, not Mat). B) &quot;Six closed coaches with the green Anchor and Sword of House Mitsobar lacquered on the doors already waited in line before the tall arched outer gates with teams hitched and liveried drivers mounted&quot; (grammatically, the gates have hitched teams and liveried drivers). C) Lastly, my personal favorite, (to be honest, though, I pulled this one from The Path of Daggers, but believe me, Jordan has about one (or more) misplaced modifier per page): &quot;Spinning her round-bellied mare like a racer, she [Nynaeve] flicked the reins and galloped after Lan holding her hat on with one hand...&quot; (grammatically, Lan is struggling Mynaeve's hat on his head).2) Wordiness-many of those pesky misplaced modifiers could probably be avoided if Jordan would simply be economical in language. But when you &quot;fluff&quot; up your sentences, you run into trouble. Even when the errors aren't grammatical, they still make for some awkward sentences. ***EXAMPLE: &quot;The day after the Festival of Birds dawned to strong winds off the Sea of Storms that actually cut the heat in Ebou Dar. A sky without a cloud and the red-gold dome of the sun on the horizon gave promises for once the wind died, though.&quot; Ugh! It took me nearly ten minutes to literally-rather than generally-make sense out of what Jordan was trying to say. Here's what Jordan wants to write: &quot;The following morning, strong winds off the Sea of Storms cut through the Ebou Dar heat. The cloudless sky and red-gold sun, however, promised a return to the stifling heat once the wind died.&quot;3) Repetition-several other fine reviewers have made note of Jordan's penchant for using stock words and phrases. Although the impulse is understandable-Jordan wishes to inject his prose with occasional pauses and held beats (think of the way music makes use of rests)-the solution, sadly, is worse than the problem. Relying so heavily on stock phrases makes the work seem amateurish. Here is an incomplete list of Jordan's most overused phrases: braid pulling/tugging, shawl adjusting, skirt smoothing, hands dry washing, eyes popping/bulging, jaw/mouth dropping, Loial's ears tufting, women &quot;planting their fists on their hips,&quot; etc. The list goes on and on. Not only is the repetition ridiculous, but in many instances the description simply isn't accurate. Aside from cartoons and comic books, whose eyes really bulge or pop out when surprised? Whose jaw literally drops to the floor?Yes, we all make mistakes in our writing. And to be honest, I don't get pleasure out of spotting as many errors as possible, and I'm not really this anal (I'm sure, if you comb through this review carefully enough, you'll also find plenty of mistakes on my part). My point is simply this: Jordan's amateurish style and fumbling over the English language were palatable early on, when his books were at least entertaining enough to distract readers from these problems, (I actually enjoyed The Great Hunt as entertainment), but now Jordan's books have become a chore to read, and his flaws, easy to ignore before, &quot;pop out&quot; in stark relief."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Not only was Robert Jordan so in love with his own writing that he could write pages of descriptions that leave the mind numb, in A Crown of Swords Jordan decides to advance the plot only a tiny bit. How does he do this? By having a huge portion of A Crown of Swords describe the events that took place in Lord of Chaos from the vantage point of other characters. Seriously. He is most egregious about this in the Egwene point of view. So let's get this review started.A Crown of Swords has three primary plot lines. The first concerns Rand and his return from Dumai's Wells to discover that Cairhien has been taken over by Colavere. The diplomatic maneuvering that results from this action goes on for hundreds of pages. Sadly, the Perrin-Faile plotline is still entwined with the Rand one and we see the most heinous Faile. But not too much. Still, this is not the only development for Rand. We also watch him make preparations for an attack against the Forsaken Samael. And that attack is probably among the least satisfying of any of the confrontations with the Forsaken. And if you remember the pattern I described in my previous review you should figure out what happens to Sammael.The second plot line is more interesting and benefits from occurring over four straight chapters. Here we witness Egwene consolidating control over the Aes Sedai in Salidar. With the help of Siuan and Leane, newly restored to being Aes Sedai when Nynaeve healed severing in the previous book, Egwene makes a good job of beginning to hold sway over the cantankerous Aes Sedai.The third plot line is by far the most interesting. For fans of Mat, you will like that a plurality of this book is told from his point of view. In Ebou Dar he accompanies Nynaeve and Elayne in their search for a ter'angreal called the Bowl of Winds. With it they hope to be able to loosen the grip of the Dark One on the weather of the world. During this portion of the book we also discover more about the history of the Aes Sedai and learn even more about the Sea Folk. As an aside, I can't decide who is more annoying - the Aes Sedai or the Sea Folk. I do wonder, despite the number of strong female characters, if Jordan was not a misogynist. It's also during this portion of the book that my favorite scenes for both Elayne and for Nynaeve occur in back to back chapters. Without those scenes this book would probably only rate three stars.And in the background, through the points of view of some minor characters who I won't bore you by in this review (since you will have to trudge through their chapters) we see that the Seanchan have returned and are making significant conquests along the western and southern coasts of Randland.So I have been keeping track of sniffs in the books because Jordan has his women sniff way too much. Happily this book was roughly 100 pages less in length than Lord of Chaos so there were less sniffs.Feraighin - IIDeira - IEgwene - IBair - ILelaine - IElayne - IIINesta din Reas - ISignet Ring Fellow - I (another male sniffer!)Joline - ICadsuane - ITion - IRhiale - ICaira - INynaeve - IIISetelle Anan - IBerowin - IGarenia - IFaile - IElaida - IMin - IIMerana - ISamitsu - IRenaile - IMerillile - ITherava - IAmys - IAnd the Total So Far.

Action sequences are just referenced and female bickering and clothing takes up most of this book. I am sick of reading about these interchangable women.I loved books one, two, and three but Jordan now seems to be afraid to do anything with his characters. Nynave,Elyane and other Aes Sedai treate Mat and any helpful man horribly. Most of the female characters don't understand basic manners and dress like whores.Women are rutinely told to run naked and are spanked and punished by other women. Jordan's obsession with breasts and beating naked women gets ridiculous. Men may enter Ruiden clothed but women must go naked. Men incure toh but are never punished women must be beaten naked. I have started hoping that some of the female characters will be killed off.Interesting events happen but we are told of them after they pass and not in detail. Morgase's story takes an interesting turn but we are left hanging.More time should be spent on action and less on bickering. I am worried that the rest of the series will be a disapointment."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the first fantasy series I have ever read, so I know not - nor care - of the endless debates about whether or not Tolkien, etc, are better than Robert Jordan. All I have to say is that The Wheel of Time series, in an of itself, is a very imaginative series, epic in proportions. Yes, on one level it is the same hackneyed plot of innocent (and mostly naive, at least intitally) good guys fighting the forces of darkness. But why is it that no matter how many times we hear this tale in its infinite variations we still come to hear and gather from it what we will? In my opinion Jordan's version of this eternal theme is better than most I have read in the various genres.So much for the series. Now for the book itself. It would seem we have hit the midddle of the series, and as middles are apt to do, this one lags a bit. Jordan's incredible verbosity needs to be curtailed - one would think a former military officer would realize the virtues of brevity. I really do tire of reading about woman's dresses in all their minute details. Added to this, Jordan is beginning to become very repitive with certain phrases and descriptions.Many of the female characters are beginning to get on my nerves. Nyneave, Egwene, and Elaida have grown little, their chief functions remain to torture mat and complain about men.The ending was lame. Shadar Logoth &lt;i&gt; again ? &lt;/i&gt; Please. Find some way other than balefire to kill those nasty Forsaken. And for God sake's Rand - quit being such a wimp. If Cadsuane and the other Aes Sedai get on your nerves again just still them!I certainly hope the next books begin the thunderous climax of the series. Really, the series should have been about 5 or 6 books, and we could have done that if we eliminated verbosity, the endless battles between the sexes, the ridiculous Seanchan and Children of Light Characters, etc. All in all, though, the series is a better use of your money than most of the garbage out there.

Book Seven was the biggest wank I have ever read and I would have given it a '0' if '1' hadn't been the lowest rating. What is the deal with every single woman being a carbon copy of the next? Who the hell gave him the idea that all men think alike and all women think alike? Why are all the female characters so unpleasant? Being female myself, I want to like them and I want to take their side in the battle of the sexes but why the hell do they keep winning with arguments that hold about as much water as a seive?

Looking for the tight writing and engaging style of the previous books? Looking for some real plot development and character growth? Then don't look at this book. Nothing happens. That's right, in a 700+ page book, nothing happens! The story doesn't move forward. It is filler material, nothing more. Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print. I can only hope that future installments recapture the quality of past ones."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Now I love fantasy books, I find the people that hate them to usually be annoying people who are usually wrong in every aspect of their lives, and I have found scientific proof that these people should be avoided at all times unless you enjoy listening to people drone on about how they enjoy poetry and wine tasting classes, or giving their children stupid names that will get them beaten up when they're older. Fantasy books are not a guilty pleasure, they are a pleasure in every way, the description is usually amazing, the plot can be exciting and with some amazingly diverse characters who you not only must learn to love or hate, but understand. Don't get me wrong there are those writers that have made a damn good argument against fantasy books, Terry Goodkind springs to mind because they can sometimes just drag a story on longer than needed, filling it up with pointless dribble that no one really cares about, they just want to know the ending. Sadly Robert Jordan is in that frame of people, and many of you may wish to switch away now, but you all know I am right.Writing this review in light of the fact that I now know it is the half way book solidifies this argument, this story has been going on for so long that every single one of the fans just wants to read the ending now, but by this point in the epic masterwork you realise that you are nowhere near the ending, and it is damn annoying. However we must also look at the writer and how the books have been structured so far to know that we shouldn't expect the end to be near. So here is a quick recap from book 1 - 7 in only seven lines:Book 1:Rand is a farm boy who turns out to be the man destined to fight the dark one and break the world. He has some friends.Book 2:There are lots of bad guys out there trying to kill Rand and his friends. Rand accepts who he is and prepares to fight.Book 3:Rand is going a bit mad, Perrin talks to wolves and finds his love, and this is the first book that focuses on Mat, which is good.Book 4:Rand is the destined leader of other people, Egwene realises she is a dreamwalker, and Perrin goes home.Book 5:There's lots of characters now, but the important thing is Rand is conquering the world and Mat leads an army.Book 6:Aes Sedai capture Rand and he is starting to go mad, he is saved by Perrin and makes the Aes Sedai kneel.Now that isn't that helpful for anyone because it doesn't really explain anything that has happened, but that is the point that needs to be made. These books are so long and clever that they can't be condensed to a few books because it would ruin them. Don't get me wrong, it does annoy me that it hasn't ended because I want to know how it finishes, but upon rereading these books helped me understand just how amazing they really are, and how well the characters develop.The obvious protagonist is Rand, a young man who has the weight of the world placed upon his shoulders, and with the added joy of having a mad man in his head gives us an excellent inner struggle dialogue every time he is featured shows how far this boy has grown from the frightened boy in the first book. Rand is a character that is used in many fantasy books and films, a farm boy destined for greatness, but I cannot help but love the fact that we are reading about a boy going slowly mad and knows it. The reader should pity Rand, because it can't be hard to believe that you must die to save the world, and any sign of weakness could open you to danger, which had been shown when taken captive by the Aes Sedai in the last book. Another reason I don't like this book is because it sets Rand into a frame of mind that keeps with him for the next few books, giving the character little time to grow, just depicting him as a harder and colder man.I can't help but also talk about my favourite character in these books, Mat. Mat in the first two books does very little but drone on about a dagger he found, making him an almost Gollum-like character, which straight away puts these books in danger of following Tolkien, and also gives those idiots the chance to say \\"all are like Lord of the Rings\\" which they're not and anyone who says they are should be shunned like witches in the Dark Ages. I cannot stress how much I hate those people. By the third book though Mat is healed and outshines every other character in my eyes. Where Perrin is too annoying, or Rand too cold, or Egwene still trying to find her place in my eyes, Mat gives a light relief from all the sour moods of the books, and what I love about this guy is that he seems to take the fact that he has the memories of the greatest generals of all time in his head in his stride, refusing to let it boil him down to a serious part. The fact he has an army doesn't depress Mat like it does Perrin, but is another tool he can use in life. This book continues Mat's struggle with accepting the fact that he has to help Rand out, even though he just wants to gamble his life away in a tavern flirting with women, like all men should. Mat is tasked with protecting Elayne and Nynaeve, even though they seem to hate the fact he is around, which only makes him hate the job more, but doesn't stop him relishing in the fact he is annoying them.I suppose I should quickly mention the entrance of one of the most important characters in the series. Cadsuane an Aes Sedai who for some reason isn't really mentioned in any of the other books, which is a bit odd, but arrives expecting much from Rand, but setting up a confrontation between the pair that was inevitable due to Rand's mistrust of the Aes Sedai and Cadsuane's certainty of her role in matters. Cadsuane in my head is that teacher you had in school who no one messed with for no other reason than the fact that she could look at you and see into your soul, and I hope that Robert Jordan (RIP) would like that description of her. She is a smart lady who is angered by the foolishness of the Aes Sedai in their treatment of Rand, and has a lot of work in getting him to love life again, what I particualy like about her is how she treats Rand like a pupil and doesn't show any fear when facing him, which few others have ever done, giving Rand an anchor to reality that is slowly being pulled away from him.The point I suppose I should hurriedly get to in this book is that it is just a steppingstone in this great masterpiece, building every character up to find and accept their roles, bring in new characters who become part of what makes the Wheel of Time series so amazing. There are points in this book that are unmissable, but is sadly the start of the series slowly spiralling down in many reader's views. Every reader has by the seventh book fallen in love with their favourite character, and is awaiting the much anticipated finale, but sadly that ending is still far off. Please read these books, even if you do class them as a \\"guilty pleasure\\" because you will not regret them."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"At last the three-book cycle is complete: Rand has had his fight with a forsaken, his adversaries are crushed (or are they?), the plans he laid in the previous two books have come to fruition, and story gives us a chance to breathe. If I didn't know any better (and in fact I do not), I'd say that Fires of Heaven, Lord of Chaos, and Crown of Swords were plotted as a single book that just grew too unwieldy for single volume. After all, there were so many opportunities for Nynaeve to lose her temper, Elayne to sniff, Perrin to not understand women, (etc. etc.) - how could they all be cast aside in favor of moving things along?The Good: I'm still coming down off the high from Rand's tangle with Aes Sedai in book six, so there's a lot of good will to squander. Tylin's dalliance with Mat buoys me along quite nicely long enough for Nynaeve to finally get herself tied to someone who will keep her in line. Now instead of ubiquitous, thick-headed anger and control issues, we have ubiquitous, thick-headed stony-face and control issues, but it's a good step in the right direction. Elaida's development finally pays off after dealing with such a prickly character for too long. And a new, more interesting Aes Sedai character is introduced (they've leveled up!)The Bad: All of that time to develop, and the end, the real danger and conclusion, feels completely tacked on. Padan Fain who-what? Sammael where? What about all of the buildup with Mat - at the last minute Rand diverts him from the very important role he was playing in the war against Illian, and then they proceed with the original plan as if nothing has changed? Sammael is the big scary for Rand, but, hey - why not just have Rand go running off after him after barely recovering from a near-fatal wound that's still bleeding evil into him, without even stopping for breakfast? The last 10% of the book is like being T-boned through a stretch of road without intersections.The Takeaway: This is where I stopped reading the last time, and maybe if I had to wait three years for the next installation, I'd feel the same way again. But I"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the seventh book in the [Wheel of Time] series; this is already longer than most series get, and it's only halfway done. There are a lot of negative reviews from readers who grew frustrated with the series' length, and it's understandable. It's a serious time investment, and readers have to be willing to make the emotional investment in the characters as well. However, I will object to claims that the writing is any worse. The quality is very rich, with excellent descriptive writing and some very distinctive characters. Old characters develop in a very intriguing manner and new characters add layers to the story. As in the prior novel [Lord of Chaos], this is a fantasy novel that doesn't try to be \\"all action, all the time.\\" However, if the central story element of [Lord] was political conflict in a world approaching cataclysm, [A Crown of Swords] is all about the people, who are beginning to feel malaise from wars past and fear of a cataclysm approaching. It's interesting to note how much the world changes from the first novel to this one, and the nature of the writing suggests that Jordan intended the [Wheel of Time] series to be about more than a few key characters; this series is about the ending of an era, of the world and the people who inhabit it.Why is it that so many fans stop following the series at this pivotal point in the series? A mini-review on this novel from (co-author of the later Wheel of Time books) Brandon Sanderson's blog contains his theories, similar to my own. This quote sums it up:\\"This series, as I've said before, is meant to be read straight through. I think, perhaps, that waiting two years for this book and then only getting a tiny slice of the overall story might be what caused complaints from readers. It's not that the writing quality went down (I think it goes up as the series continues) or that the pacing grew slower. I think that the problem is readers not grasping the entire vision of the story, which is difficult to do when you don't know how many books there will be or how long it will be until they are done.\\"The middle of any book or any series is naturally going to have a lot of setup for the approaching climax. By necessity, the series must technically get a little \\"slower,\\" but that does not at all mean that [A Crown of Swords] does not have worthwhile writing to offer. After playing a relatively minor role in books 4-6, Mat Cauthon plays a very big part in [Crown], so fans of him will be overjoyed to follow the further exploits of this lovable rogue, and shocked when he begins to reform himself a tad bit. Lan makes his triumphant return after being almost completely absent from the previous installment. Readers will notice big changes in central characters like Rand, Min, Mat, Elayne, and Nyneave, for better or worse. And a few of the scenes in [Crown] are among my favorites in the series, particularly towards the end. I'd hate to spoil anything, so I'll end the review here: if you've read and enjoyed the [Wheel of Time] up to this point, I definitely recommend that you stick with it. While you may not love the new direction that this book takes, you have to respect that huge scope of things and appreciate the book for its own merits."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With this book, we have reached the midpoint of the series (assuming that Brandon Sanderson doesn't manage to find another book in there somewhere) and like you might expect of a series this size, this is where things get soft in the middle.If you look at various online reviews of this book and others at this point in the series, you'll see comments like, \\"It was so boring - nothing happened.\\" They'll complain about having too many characters to follow and the story getting stretched out too thinly, which I addressed back in my review of The Fires of Heaven. And as I said in that review, the critics aren't entirely unjustified in getting frustrated - the story has been divided into several major plot threads that don't seem to have any chance of meeting up in the near future. It seems like about four different novels that all happen to inhabit the same world at the same time.Here's what I think is happening: at about this point in the series, Jordan started thinking of this all in terms of a much larger mega-story, rather than a series of books, with the narrative structure that would entail. It does explain a great deal, especially the rather forced nature of the climax in which Rand finally confronts the Forsaken Sammael and wins the crown of Illian. Exhausted and wounded, Rand goes into pitched battle against a stronger, more prepared enemy for no other reason than because he thinks the timing is right. Whether it is or is not is questionable, but there's no real reason for that climax to have appeared at the end of that book.Especially since it occurs four days after the rather exciting opening events of the next book, The Path of Daggers, a fact which we don't even learn about until roughly halfway through that book. I get the feeling that if it had been possible to publish a single 2,000 page book as volume seven in the series, Jordan would have done it, allowing him to place the attack on Sammael and the use of the Bowl of the Winds in their proper order. But the good people at TOR know such a thing to be impossible, so a Climactic Finale was jury-rigged into this text in the hopes that rabid fans would still buy the next one.Which, of course, we did. It smooths out a bit if you're reading the books in rapid succession, but let me tell you - the two year wait between book seven and book eight was a killer.As for the claim that \\"nothing happens,\\" well that's just patent nonsense. Elaida, the Amyrlin of the White Tower, has found herself under the thumb of her Keeper, Alviarin, for the sin of being extremely short-sighted and overconfident. On the move with the rebel Aes Sedai, Egwene starts to build support for herself through means that no one ever expected - least of all her - and lays the groundwork to do the impossible: attack the White Tower itself.The Shaido Aiel have been broken and dispersed, but their leader, Sevanna, still holds dreams of leashing Rand al'Thor and becoming the power behind the Chief of Chiefs. The Aes Sedai who tried to capture Rand have been put under the attentions of the Aiel Wise Ones, and all of the Aes Sedai - from the Tower and from Salidar - have taken an oath of fealty to him. What this will mean in the long run is unclear, but until they are released, they will serve him. Until Cadsuane Melaidhrin appears, with plans all her own for the Dragon Reborn. And with Min, Rand tries to settle the rebellious Lords and Ladies in Haddon Mirk, who refuse to acknowledge him as the ruler of Cairhien, Andor or Tear. What he finds, of course, is blood, pain and death - only some of it his.In the main plot line of the book, Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve are in Tanchico, searching for the Bowl of the Winds - an artifact which could, if they're lucky, undo the Dark One's touch on the weather and finally end the summer that has held the land in its grip for the last three books. What we get out of this plot line is significant in many, many ways - we learn about what happens to women who are turned out of the White Tower, and why being so very strict may have cost the Aes Sedai dearly over the last two millennia. We also get a hint as to what causes the famous \\"ageless\\" look that so many Aes Sedai have, and why the Three Oaths may do more harm than good in the long run.In fact, between the Ebou Dar Kin and the Sea Folk, it looks like the nature of female channelers in this world is going to be radically upended by the time the series ends. The White Tower, which has stood as the unchallenged symbol of One Power dominance, will no longer possess a monopoly on channelers, and this will force a great many changes not only on Aes Sedai, but on the public perception of women who can use the One Power. But all that is in the future. For me, one of the most touching moments of this part of the series is Reanne Corley's simple line: \\"I can be Green.\\" You'll know it when you get to it.What's more, there are some very significant character moments in this book, not the least of which is that Mat finally gets his thanks for saving Elayne and Nynaeve from the Black Ajah way back in The Great Hunt. Elayne asserting herself among the \\"real\\" Aes Sedai is a marvelous scene, as is Mat facing down an entire room of women who would make a king step lightly. The interplay between Mat - the rough-and-tumble rogue/general - and Elayne - the daughter-heir of a kingdom and newly-minted Aes Sedai - is highly entertaining, especially with the help of Nynaeve and her braid-tugging, and Birgitte's ability to drink like the soldier she is.As an aside, we also learn from Mat what must be one of the strongest - and strangest - curses in this world, given the conditions under which he utters it. I have to admit, with invectives in this series such as \\"Burn me,\\" \\"Flaming\\" and \\"Bloody\\" - words that draw glares from the more prim and proper segment of society (i.e. women), I don't really feel the power that they should have. Made-up curse words, such as \\"Gorram\\" (Firefly), \\"Frak\\" (Battlestar Galactica) and \\"Sprocking\\" (Legion of Super-Heroes) feel more, well, curse-ish to me.\\"Sheep swallop and bloody buttered onions\\"? Not so much.They have plenty to curse about, though. The Black Ajah are in Ebou Dar, too, searching just as hard for a cache of artifacts from the Age of Legends, under orders from Sammael, and a whole new danger arises in the form of the Gholam - a creature made to kill channelers. And once the Seanchan decide that it's time to take Ebou Dar, that's just icing on the cake.So to say that \\"nothing happens\\" is to completely ignore everything that, well, happens. It just doesn't follow the forms and narrative structures that we have expected up until this point, and there are a lot of threads left dangling between books. But this is the point where it becomes vividly clear that you are reading a much larger story, and you should count yourself lucky that you can go from one to the next without stopping.This does make me worry slightly, of course, about the last books in the series. The book written by Sanderson was originally supposed to be one volume - A Memory of Light - but the narrative demands of the story led to it being split among three volumes. So my question is this: will we see the same thing in those books that we saw in this one? A hasty climax, put in the end of the book because that's what's supposed to be there? Or does Sanderson have a good, well-planned structure for the final three books that makes each one self-contained yet which makes the final three flow inexorably to the end?We shall see.---------------------------------------------\\"There are no clear paths. Only pitfalls and tripwires and darkness.\\"- Lews Therin Telamon---------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"My Kindle re-read of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time continues with A Crown of Swords.This was the termination of my initial read-through of the series -- at this point Path of Daggers wasn't out yet, and I was in for a long wait for the next volume in the series. I remember being particularly bored and disillusioned with the Wheel of Time by this point, particularly with the Ebou Dar storyline. I've found that on my second reading of the book some 13 years later that I enjoyed it a great deal more than during my original reading -- particularly (and ironically), the arc centered around Ebou Dar and the hunt for the Bowl of Winds. Mat Cauthon is increasingly becoming my favorite character in the series and seeing him finally getting treated with the respect he deserves by the Aes Sedai was satisfying, as was Elayne and Nynaeve's dealings with the \\"real\\" sisters and the Kin.Although more significant events take place in Lord of Chaos, A Crown of Swords is shorter and therefore unburdened by its predecessor's many filler chapters. Not to say that there isn't filler here -- the central storyline of A Crown of Swords is a bit of a cul-de-sac for the series, as the struggle to fix the world's broken weather is nothing more than a distraction from the Last Battle. I found it to be a relatively brief read, and although it doesn't further the story significantly, the character movement was satisfying, and Mat's cliffhanger is still as strong as I remembered. Tangential though the story may be, it comes down to whether or not you like the characters -- I happen to be fond of them, so spending some time with Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve in Ebou Dar wasn't a bad way to spend a week and a half of reading.However, on the negative side, the pacing of Rand's arc was especially uneven. The showdown at the end seemed to come out of nowhere, given that the chief antagonist was barely mentioned in A Crown of Swords before the climax. It does show that Jordan was able to move the story when he wanted to and could have resolved many of his story lines within a few chapters. However, in this case the lack of any kind of build-up to the fight left me a bit bewildered. The ending itself is incredibly rushed, the payoff seemingly unearned given the similar ending (and better set-up) featured in The Dragon Reborn. This is something I remembered from my first read-through, and my opinion has changed little on the second.At this point, readers know whether or not they're invested in the series -- if you like Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve, then A Crown of Swords will be a worthy read. But if you're plowing through the series eager for the start of Tarmon Gaidon, you are setting yourself up for disappointment."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just love Robert Jordan, however I simply can't believe that the publisher has the gall to charge such inflated fees for digital copies of books available in paperback with so very many typos in them."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This series started so well, and I enjoyed book 6 Lord of Chaos even though some claim that was the book Jordan decided to just stop progressing the story line at all. But this one, simply bored me from start to finish with the exception of the parts actually involving Rand.The Elayne and Nynaeve searching for a bowl plot was dull in book 6, and really was painful to struggle through at times in this one. Quite how that plot has lasted over two books is ridiculous, especially considoring it seems to take up two thirds of this one whilst the only things that happens is Jordan introduces a bucket load of useless characters.Whilst there is also several chapters from the point of view of Egwene that seemingly offer absolutely nothing to the story, yet there was three or four of them in a row to be struggled through near the start of the book. Did it really take 3 chapters to tell us they had left their village and started north, and that people still treated Egwene as a child.Even the plot that follows Rand in this book, and there is precious little of it, is dull. He seemingly does nothing for the first two thirds of the book. Whilst then despite building up to it for about three books worth of useless chapters, he eventually goes and defeats Sammael in the same amount of lines as Jordan has used solely telling us Nynaeve was pulling her braid.I'm still making my way through the series, and will read book 8 as I really enjoyed the first 6, but if it as bad as this one I won't be reading on further in the series."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"My reviews of The Wheel of Time novels are getting just as repetitive as the actual books. There's really not much more to say. A Crown of Swords is another long slow installment in which there are too many detailed descriptions of clothing, references to spanking, concerns about bosoms, and people blushing. There are pages and pages which chronicle secondary characters' extensive internal thoughts. But what bugs me most, though, are the constant depictions of people and places as if they have a corporate personality:\\"Men strutted arrogantly along the streets with often ragged vests and no shirts, wearing great brass hoops in their ears and brass finger rings set with colored glass, one knife or sometimes two stuck behind their belts. Hands hovering near knives, they stared as though daring someone to give the wrong twist to a look. Others skulked from corner to corner, doorway to doorway with hooded eyes, imitating the slat-ribbed dogs that sometimes snarled from a dark alleyway barely wide enough for a man to squeeze into. Those men hunched over their knives and there was no way to tell which would run and which stab. By and large, the women made any of the men appear humble, parading in worn dresses and twice as much brass jewelry as the men. They carried knives too, of course, and their bold dark eyes sent ten sorts of challenge in every glance ... Children darted from every second door with chipped pottery cups of water, sent by their mothers in case the Wise Women wished a drink. Men with scarred faces and murder etched into their eyes stared openmouthed at seven Wise Women together, then bobbed jerky bows and inquired politely if they could be of assistance, was there anything that required carrying? Women, sometimes with as many scars and always eyes to make Tylin flinch, curtsied awkwardly and breathlessly asked whether they might supply directions, had anyone made a bother of themselves to bring so many Wise Women?\\"If I found myself in this place, I'd think it was The Twilight Zone!I will say, however, that someone must have told Mr Jordan to quit with the braid yanking, because Nynaeve seems to be attempting to stop the habit. Now, if we could just get all of those ladies to stop adjusting their clothes every time they feel any sort of negative emotion... and I'll be happy on the day that an Aes Sedai can walk down the street without making someone flinch, cringe, jump, squeak, drop something, or run away.With all this detailed description, there's not much time for action. There are only a few significant plot developments. The most important one is an event which we've been waiting for for the last 3 books (at least) which finally occurs very quickly and anti-climatically in the last chapter of this book. But, if you've read this far into The Wheel of Time, that's no surprise, is it? And, if you've read this far, you feel like it's too late to stop now, don't you?I'm listening to this on audiobook (no patience for the print versions) and I should mention that Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are amazing readers. After all this time, I suppose these characters are almost like family to them, and they've got the personalities down perfectly. Their voices and additions of droll humor really instill some much-needed life into these novels."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The first half of the book dragged on so slowly; it was completely tedious but my desire to know the overall storyline pulled me along. Then finally, in the last fifth of the book things started to pick up and things actually started happening. Hopefully the next book starts as active as this one left off.One thing I have really liked about Jordan's books is that he is really good at catching up readers on past novels, he does not waste time rehashing in each new book what dedicated readers already know. Or if he does it does not detract from the story but in fact adds to it--like recapping Rand's rescue but from the perspective of the Shaido. All that changed later on in this book. Other than the retelling of the rescue, all other recap is drivel poorly incorporated and just reiterated stuff--if you have been closely following the series. If this is your first book then these descriptions fill in a lot of holes to the numerous and complex character interactions in the book.

I loved the fantasy action and the whole setting of the first 6 books. However, I think that through the entire book there were very few events of significant value.

I hope that the 8th book isnt like that, the Light Willing!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The seventh book of the 2009 pre Gathering Storm reread and why are we not at the climax yet? Now, as we continue on our way one of the themes that Jordan seems intent on developing is that of evil. We don't have the glimpse into the heads of those characters as perhaps we should to truly see where evil will take us.Is this book a good one? If you are not reading the entire series, then you will be lost, and it will not be worthwhile to read. There are so many plot lines, that the book loses people, and story arcs are barely concluded.Oh, another one of the evil that we are exploring more of, bites it, which is good for the good guys. But that Arc has been going on since book three. What has taken so long.Then in other arcs, barely a word about our tower in exile friends, which is ripe with political strife and turmoil and evil interlaced within its domain. Perrin, moved off stage for later shenanigans. Which is now a precursor that tells us, more is coming, this is not the last book, we are going to make it longer.So here is the big picture. The series is too long, or too much is happening in too short a time. Our heroes are being thrust in an ever accelerated pace, after Rand saves Cairhein, to do more grown-up things then they should be capable of or prepared for given what we have walked down the path with them.All of a sudden our three male Tevern and equally powerful Aes Sedai girls, are still that, boys and girls thrust to do very adult, wise things for which it would take years to master.And the amount of balls they are juggling in the air, would take years also. It is as if FDR looking around on December 8th said, well lets let these six 20 year old juniors from community college handle the entire American war effort. I'll sit back and take the credit, but they can defeat Hitler and the Japanese, no problem.Our heroes are faced with so many challenges that they should have had the years to develop especially as we have had 20 years to wait for the end of the series.Thus we conclude that if you are a fan of the series, this is a transition book. There are some fun and exciting sequences, but even with the closing of some arcs, the book opens new doors and by now we know, that some of the things that Jordan adds, when he adds new things, just can not be finished unless he forces us to read 3000 new pages..."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Alright, to all you would-be book reviewers. What is it we're reading? A one-volume action adventure novel or an epic saga designed to enthrall its readers with powerful emotion, drama, and pain with a world that is turned upside down with evil? To those who say that Jordan's characters do not develop, I will have to ask what book you are reading, because it is certainly not Jordan's volumes from WOT. My mind on reading a story: Let the author tell the story and try not to allow my own desires affect my reaction to plot lines or any other occurance in the story. Jordan, while not the linguistic genius Tolkein was, has created a world with remarkably distinct characters and a history that completely explains the reasoning behind their decisions. A ten-part (and more) series is bound to have its ups and downs, whether intentional or unintentional on the part of the author, but taken as a whole, this story forces us to feel the emotion the characters are feeling, angers us when they do something we would not have them do, and surprises us with new plot lines and old ones made fresh. When all is said and done and the multi-volume work Jordan has created is reviewed as one complete story, it will easily come close to Tolkein's for fictional merit."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordon seems to be wandering through much of this book.

Jordan has used the classic &quot;good vs. evil&quot; plot and developed a world and cast of characters that would make Tolkien green with envy. The fact that Jordan keeps the focus on the same characters through the entire series instead of moving on to their descendants like many other authors do is a major plus. The character development is simply awesome. On a side note- I have noticed many people complaining about the fact that the story is not completely focused on one main character. It seems that people dont like reading about the &quot;side adventures&quot; of any character that isn't Rand. You people are going to have to get a clue. You seem to think that characters like Elayne, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Avienda, etc., are minor characters with no real importance. What you have to understand is that while these might not be as interesting as the Lord Dragon, they are equally important to the story. With out these characters &quot;side adventures&quot;, the story would simply fall apart. That anyone could skip over these sections is completely ridiculous. Not to mention completely impatiant. If you people are going to critique a series of books so unique as the Wheel of Time, maybe you should take some time to learn to appreciate the fact that some authors can write stories more complicated than other authors. If Robert Jordan's writing is too complicated for you to read without skipping over the &quot;boring&quot; parts (which are often the most important parts of the story) then you should stop reading the books and go back to reading books you might understand. I hear Dr. Suess has written quite a selection of books that you might like.

Robert Jordan is one of the great fantasy writers of our time and the Wheel of Time is fast-becoming the new standard in epic fantasy. A Crown of Swords is definitely one of the best books in the series so it gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me. granted, the plot doesn't move too far forward in this book but that's mostly due to the fact that it takes place over a very short period of time (weeks at most). A lot of exciting things happen in this book and the character interactions are, like always, one of the best things about this book and really keep the reader interested. If you've read the first 6 books but haven't read ACoS yet: DO!!! And don't forget to read Path of Daggers and the upcoming Winter's Heart as well :) You may also want to look into Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series which has a lot of similarities to the Wheel of Time but there's not nearly as many characters so it doesn't feel as soap opera-ish as WoT."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is the greatest writer of our time he puts all fantasy epic writers to shame making them look like hacks. His characters are three dimensional and they are not perfect people that never make a mistake. His plots are complicated and well thought out. When reading this series it is important to remember that Robert Jordan has stated in interviews that he doesn't intend to tie up every plot in a nice little package by the end of the series, but to tie up the main plots and leave a few loose ends so that the \\"The Wheel of Time\\" world is still turning after the author has finished the series. I think this is a great idea; it keeps the characters alive at the end and allows the reader to dream about how these plots might unfold. I may also be less judgmental because I did not read the books until this year and have read all of them in row instead of having long waits between books. If you haven't read any of this series YOU MUST start from the beginning."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is a very refreshing addition to the series. Book 5 was good, book six could have been better, but this one definitly delivers. It's up there with the first 3. I've read over half in under 3 weeks, and I hope to finish in another 2."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I started reading Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time series when book 4 was introduced. I devoured books 1-4 in two months to the point of sleep deprivation. The writing draws you in, to the point of actually being there with 'Rand Al'Thor' and the White Tower. Robert Jordan has done an excellent job and I can see where he could continue this series forever. There are so many different ways to expand and bring in new characters. Now that we are still waiting for the next book to come out, I am going back and re-reading the complete series. I have read books 1-6 three times and will re-read again waiting for book 8. Robert Jordan If you read this, Thank you and keep up the excellent work. I am looking forward to your next release."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan has managed to take his readers, kicking and screaming, straight into the lands beside the Aryth Ocean. The protagonists are very likable. One can almost feel the agonizing tension between characters before each decision is made, even if it takes three or four chapters to make that choice. Unlike most other authors, Robert Jordan has a very strong grasp on Good and Evil as they really are, and manages to communicate those concepts to the reader in a transparent manner. Almost all of the characters are either aligned with the Good or Evil forces permeating the Epic; but each character may or may not be performing actions for reasons the cause would approve. Every character is definable by what they do, but their reasoning almost always crosses the gray areas between the white and black of Good and Evil (or is that the black and white... sometimes it is hard to say). All in all a masterful representation of epic fantasy. I just wish that some of the plot diversions from books two and three would be resolved already (e.g. Mat Cauthon wedding the Daughter of the Nine Moons). Luckily Mr. Jordan has at least seen fit to apparently (I hope) have set up Mat to cross paths with the Sanchean. The newly introduced master villains, on the other hand (are they ALL Gholums?), are yet another plot twist introduced in the beginning of a book with no explanation by the end of that book. Suspense is good. Losing hair and nails due to suspense is not good. Excellent reading for anyone with the stamina to read a 900 page book from chapter three to the end without putting it down."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I didn't discover this series until about a year ago, but I'm very glad I did find it. RJ has developed a world that keeps you yearning for more. Like others, I'm frustrated that there is so much time in between books (and I'm only having to wait from 7 to 8). To all those who want the story wrapped up, I say &quot;WHY?&quot;. Sure I want to know the end result as much as anyone else. But I'll be sad as hell to see the story end because I've enjoyed it so much. So hurry up with the next chapter."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I myself cannot understand those who would want him to &quot;wrap it up&quot; in the next book, so that they can leave it all behind. When you read Jordan's epic you feel like the characters becomes friends and acquaintances and I for one would really miss them if the series would finish. A Crown of Swords has gotten some negative criticism for being slow and not as actionfilled as the rest but that is one of Robert Jordan's qualities as an author. To make his fantasy world real and make us feel drawn into it. As in real life there sometimes are slow periods. In those we get the opportunity to get to know the characters not just read battle descriptions. I must say that WOT has really got me hooked and I would love the opportunity to follow the characters into adulthood for a long while to come. Also I would rather get a 1000 pg. book that really details out the world and the characters than a 200 pg. one filled with only the dialogue and action where you never really get that emotional involvement in their fates. The one thing I missed in ACOS was Rand's revenge on Elaida's attempt to kidnap him and her anger over the failure and fear of his revenge. It felt like he just let it pass and that is not a desirable trait in someone who has to lead the world against darkness and destruction towards Tarmon Gai'don."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Book 7 of the Wheel of Time came out in hard cover two years ago.

Enough of the Fallon Crap let's finish this series up."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Now, this wasn't necessarily my favorite books of the series, but I can quite easily understand why Mr. Jordan is doing what he's doing. It's like this: say you're writing a story. OK, now imagine that when you're writing it, you get 3/4 way through, and change your mind about what's going to happen. Now, instead of rewriting the whole beginning, suppose you just change THIS scene or THAT scene. However, now you have other things that happened earlier that have no resolution as you had formerly planned. This is a &quot;loose end.&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, may I say that I truly found Mr. Jordan's books quite excellent. There were times in those books when I identified with Egwene, Nynaeve, Matt, Perrin, Rand and even Thom. Simultaneously in fact! This is what I love about these books. Every time I get to a point when I can see something bad happening to one of the characters, I'd give just about anything to go IN the story, and help them. This intense emotinal involvement in the Wheel of Time series is something to be respected. Not all authors can do that.My parting sally is to those few who seem to believe that the aforementined &quot;loose ends&quot; are bad and evil or what have you. If Mr. Jordan wrapped up each book neatly in the end; if there was nothing happening that you could worry about, would they really be as much fun to read?Now ask yourself this and answer truly: &quot;What bothers me the most about those loose ends?&quot; If it's because they keep me hanging, in suspense, then CONGRATULATIONS! You are on your way to understanding the reason behind the madness of true genius.

All the usual complaints from me too -- Every time we get any resolution (e.g., one of the Foresaken killed) Jordan fixes it so we're not completely sure it took. All the Aes Sedai behave essentially the same and Rand continues to be overawed by any Aes Sedai who barges in domineeringly. And enough with the &quot;He's mad -- no he isn't&quot; stuff.

Those looking for a quick resolution and to-the-next-plot-point writing had better just move along. I find myself grumbling that Jordan doesn't write MORE detail, as I find his world extremely immersive. I have no desire to see this come to an end any time soon. For folks used to 250-300 pp &quot;novels&quot; and form-driven (to steal from WWW terms) characters, Jorden is a terrible, boring writer. For those of us who revel in detail, he's the best currently writing."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Although I am a very big fan of Robert Jordan and believe that his characterisation is first class I cant help getting the feeling that his last two books have been ponderous leviathans. The characters in the books developed excellently, as did the plot, in books 1 - 5 but since them things seemed to have ground to a halt with endless periods of waiting. This would have been tolerable if some of the plot lines had some action in but when all of them involve heavy amounts of waiting reading the book becomes frustrating. I was so sick of reading about Ebou Dar (how many pages does it take to find the Bowl of the Winds???) that I started to switch off after endless tales of Tylin chasing Mat and watching Carridins palace (more like watching paint dry!!!). Enough thing that does irritate me as well is the apparent stupidity of some of the main characters, Rand for instance, was VERY impressive until book 5, he became a good manipulator (Tear) and spotted threats (Kadere and Lanfear) straight away but in book seven he does not seem to even suspect Taim, does not even wonder about Moridin in Shadar logoth and assumes that Sammael is dead....not the desired attributes of a man who is expected, through skill and sacrifice, to lead the world to victory in battle. In short the series is great, fantastically deep and well realized but is now moving a little to slowly which is inelegant and frustrating for the reader whereas and optimized text, say half the length of this, would be exhilirating and leave more room to fit some more story in!!!! I read a review as well which suggested that other authors should not plagiarise Mr. Jordans work (Goodkind). I think this is not an issue as most fantasy work, including Mr. Jordans, tend to borrow ideas from each other. I am sure that Frank Herberts Bene Gesserit, Fremen and Kwizatz haderach would have a lot to say about Jordans Aes Sedai, Aiel and Rand/Dragon/Car'a'carn Whilst on this subject it is also very obvious that Jordan has borrowed extensively from worldwide mythology. Mat is clearly based on 'one-eyed' odin with his ravens thought and time, which are cleverly worked into the inscription on Mats spear. Jordan has made no secret of this which I believe adds to the richness of the world that he has created ( the more analgues you can draw to a fictional world then the more real that world will seem, a good example of this is Verin talking about dinosaur bones and cataloguing species which is clever way to add depth and a sense of history). If you really analyse the work, so many similarities to existing 'messiah' type legends can be made. Well I have gone on and digressed far too much so I will leave it there. I hope that book 8 is more satifactory in terms of action and plot development ..I am sure it will be!!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read the WoT and am pleased with the whole thing. Not only are the characters well developed, but the plot is complex and unpredictable at most times. The end of the sixth book was terrific... I AM THE LORD OF THE MORNING... I love it! But after reading some of these reviews, I have to say that I am surprised some of you ever finished the fourth book. The gripes that some of you people have are very weak! Its too long, you say. Well, how do you people stand the long and tiring act of living? Do you constantly require action to every waking moment of your life? What is wrong with you? Take the time to savor one of the best pieces of literature since Tolkien's time.That's right. You heard me. I am comparing Jordon to TOLKIEN! Heaven forbid I compare two readers! That review where the person asked us to quit comparing these two literary masters is hilariously rediculous!I am, however, a little sick of the females. RJ needs to turn them down once and a while. They seem more than a little spoiled at times.One more gripe with negative reviewers: If you are going to write a review, try to spell1correctly and try to have less grammatic errors.

This is perfect! It mimics real-world randomness of events and mixes them with the seemingly fantastic world of the Dragon Reborn.

Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks. The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the \\"bad witches\\") seen from different characters perspectives. This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing. The author must being paid by the word count and not the content. The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again. I no longer have the patience to actually read each page. I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action. The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell. His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on..... This series had a good basic story.

Something spectacular. Don't get your hopes up. We are now heading into book 12 of this series and the author is still churning our the same tired and repetitive concepts already mentioned in previous books. This book isn't as bad as is generally agreed upon, but you will be cheated. Cheated by the author and cheated by the damn story. This is, from what I could fathom, the point when the author begins to reveal himself as a one-trick pony. Incapable of anything but milking on a now trite and archaic storyline and a fool's logic of a dependence: That of relying on an ever decreasing fanbase who are perpetually groaning everytime a new doorstopper is churned out every f--ng year. I gave up after I read the path of daggers. That book was just frustrating in that I felt like I was reading an instant replay footage that lasted hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of pages. This book has its moments thankfully (I won't reveal any to newbies in case they've come this far) but they are pretty few and a lot is just plain meandering. Buy this if you've invested on the books, but I swear, you will regret it upon reading book 8 and beyond (from what I've heard). I'm still angry over the damn time I spent reading the books, hoping that the author would put this dead horse (or dragon reborn) to rest. Hopefully, the fanbase will decrease significantly enough to make the author realize what a hack he has become. That way, he can actually put together a semblance of change.

Hehas a strong skill in intertwining the day to day happeningsin his story with the epic tides of history.Even so, his inability to knit together a coherent and logicalplot reminds me of the snags in his &quot;pattern&quot; that result in&quot;bubbles of evil&quot; popping out of nowhere. All to often inthis incredibly lengthy account of a young man's struggle tosomehow singlehandly defeat the source of evil in his world,Jordan loses focus and keeps switching back and forth betweenmultiple story lines, many of which have little importance tothe main story. In this volume of the saga he has attemptedto bring the various untidy plot lines into coherence, butended up having to neglect a good portion of what was goingon in previous books, and even so, ended up leaving more ofmess than he had started with. Although, I must say, it isa bit clearer by the end of this book where he is going thanin the previous book where he really started losing his wayin this grandiose epic. The strain of having to output abook a year for the first six books tooks its toll on clarityand direction of this series.Overall, I am glad to see him taking more time with this bookand setting up more situations for future books rather thanthrow vital ingredients into the beginning of the book andgo from there (although he did do that a bit with this oneby suddenly introducing Cudausane out of nowhere). I thinkhe could take a serious cue from writers like Tad Williamswith his &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; epic in which Williams tiestogether all pieces nicely at end with elements that hehad introduced in the very first book--something that I haveyet to see Jordan do."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think that Robert Jordan is one of the best writers of ourtime."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords was as skillfully written as the rest of theWheel of Time series, which is to say the best, bar none,since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy; however, the bookwas not only way too short, but answered too few questions.I also found the end of the book rather anti-climactic...Iexpected a more thrilling battle at the end.

The Wheel of Time series started slow ( I bought it in paper back) and turned into a tornado ( The fourth book started my hard back collection).

Out of all the books this one leaves the most unsaid because of all the new plots and characters that have shown up, and it's strange that it took him so long to write even though it was so short (700 odd pages) but that just means the next book will be even better! Which will be hard because this book was a blast to read and unfortunantly I whipped through it in less than a week.

Of course the book is too short - even if it was 1500 pages it would've been to short. You simply can't stop reading until you reach the end. This book also has some hilarious parts - if you know the storyline well you can't help but crack up. I think this book is great, a must read, as is the entire series. Also check out rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan and the Wheel of Time FAQ. The newsgroup and the FAQ add -alot-. You won't believe how many small things that fit together so beautifully you missed, even if you read the entire series many times. The group might give you new ideas.

I cant count how many times Rand shouted at the top of his lungs that he was the &quot;Dragon Reborn&quot;. AT his point he's become such a pain...i couldn't help but roll my eyes at his moody &quot;im the king of the world&quot; behavior. And the women! What is up with their man hating stuck up ways! it's pitiful how RJ depicts hardly any working relationships between men and women in this book. Even Min's and Rand's relationship...shes the one keeping him calmed down half the time! He has an anger managment problem. I'm starting to hate all these characters now...the older they get the brattier they get. RJ has also gotten super repetitive in his diction...ARE THERE NO COMMON PEOPLE AROUND ARE THEY ALL JUST &quot;BEAUTIFUL AND HANDSOME WITH BEARDS AND HAIR THAT FALLS IN WAVES TO THEIR SHOULDERS! &quot; ugh... hopefully RJ and his characters will redeem themselves in the next couple books."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Just the 3 first of the serie are somehow worth the reading. Following the readers review I bought straight the 9 first books. What a mistake. the Game of Thrones or even Sword of truth series are far better than the Wheel of time serie. It is as if Robert Jordan is paid by the line like the french writers from the 19th century, Balzac, Flaubert etc...So far I have finished 1 to 7. From the 4th (till 7th) they just are impossible to finish. Like chewing branflakes forever and being unable to swallow it.I really regret I went further the third.Do not make my mistake unless slow rythm and low level action is what you seek.Robert Jordan has also the gift for beginning threads of stories with no intention of closing them, creating new characters without really caring to give them substance, depth or real influence on the plot.My recommendation: read the 3 first ones, and then taste the 4th, if you have the patience and like it carry on. If not don't hope it'll get better and you'll get some action or anything ...stop right there.Same with the 5th etc...Don't buy them all at once like me.This a real never ending story, not even close to that, and it just gets slower and slower with more and more characters...I hate it, but may be you won't.My bet ? you will."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just started this series a month ago, and just finished book 6... after reading these, I've been wondering whether to leap upon book 7 or not. I do have to agree that his first 2 were best, and went downhill from there. My main critcisms (if anyone gets far enough down to read this) are: Jordan leaves way too many loose ends, and each book adds about 100 new characters and places without resolving old things. Sometimes he even seems to forget to mention something until 6 books later. And whatever happened to Egeanin? She was held captive by Nynaeve &amp;amp; Elayne in book 4, but disappeared in the next two with no explanation. Another criticism: In each new book, Jordan redefines EVERYTHING, as if whoever's reading it hasn't read all the previous ones. We don't need need 50 descriptions of the Aiel or Aes Sedai. &amp;lt;P&amp;gt; But on the whole, I love the series.

All have been wonderful in there own way and this one is of course no exception. That said I must now complain. I don't understand why Mr. Jordan has to make every women in his books act as if they are the devil. I dread every time that I see the chapter is about them. Every time that they speak I want to strangle one or all of them or at least slap them up side there head. They are rude and mean and usually mess up every thing that they want to do because they don't understand that they don't know everything. I guess that this would be ok if it was one or even two women but it is every single women that Jordan has written in. (Brigitte dosen't count in my rant of course.) Then there is Perrin or I guess the lack there of. Lets face it Perrin is probably the second best character the Jordan thought up next to Rand and he was not in the last book and is hardly even in this one. Besides that he has no purpose so far compared to Rand and Mat.Again I will tell you that I love this book and all of the rest so far but I just had to get that off my chest thank you."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This has to be the most disappointing book that I have ever read. Why? Because after waiting so long for this book to be published it was so badly written that I found myself actually angry at the author. He ignores his own rules, eliminates major characters with barely a sentence worth of explanation, and spends much of the book simply covering ground we've already covered in the previous book. Before this book I would have said Jordan was one of the greats in fantasy but now I am convinced that he simply doesn't know where he is going with his story."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"...of about 6,000 pages that never ends.

After struggling through this book, I swore not to read any more, to stop wasting my time and to read something with a moving story. A friend of mine bought &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;, I looked at it and thought &quot;Why not?&quot;, then decided I just couldn't waste another 3 or 4 or 5 months reading a book I just didn't care about any more.

I have heard this series both praised and (rarely) bagged for its length. People say Lord of the Rings is the best. That is a joke. It was one of the first real Fantasy Fiction books but is does not come close to being the best. With the Wheel of Time, Jordan has managed to indulge the continued reading time of millions of people over a series spanning some seven thousand odd pages. Any other author would have crumbled by now but Jordan just keeps us all wondering. I have begun a novel of my own and after only a hundred and seventy pages, I can understand the difficulty an author faces in writing a good if not great novel. Already I have a list of some hundred or more charachters, accompanying seperate notes and histories spanning thirty pages and a mess of possibilities in my head that sometimes makes it difficult to write at all. Yet I read what I have done and it feels so pointless in comparison with Jordan. He has not only kept track of each charachter and their background, he has given each one a sub-plot almost as intriguing as Rand's own path. When you read the series for the second time, a hundred things that escaped your attention the first time appear. The details are endless and for this I commend Robert Jordan. Any one who has tried to write knows what I am talking about. In order to put together these details you need endless amounts of information at hand to ensure you do not slip up. To actually continue this series without losing its edge is the greatest feat of writing ever accomplished. Nothing can stand up to the intensity of each part and the confusion milling inside the readers head. Robert Jordan has created a series that can only be described as perfect!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love this series.

I just hope for the sake of Robert Jordan's readers that the next one can pick up where Crown of Swords left off. It focused too much on Rand, and the 3 Aes Sadai wannabes. The only reason this book was interesting was because of the mentions of the forsaken, and the brief references to Perrin, Mat, and of course, The Aiel.

I had been eagerly looking forward to this release. I re-read The Path of Daggers so the story would be fresh in my mind. A Crown of Thorns arrived and I settled in to read it.I was very disappointed the story did not progress as in the prior books in the series. Typically, Jordon's books build a complex story around a central theme that coalesces into a spectacular climax. There are problems left to solve but those problems are for the next book.With Crown of Thorns I was left hanging after a great read, as if there were a chapter missing. So here I sit waiting for the next release.

I can still remember how it was to read the first books when they came out. The story-line was nothing new, we have all heard it before. But that didn't matter at all did it? I mean, it was a soap-opera, but a good one. Now after seven books and at least three more to come, the enthusiasm has faded somewhat and when you first never wanted it to end, well now at least I couldn't be happier if it did so. Because just like most soap-operas that has aired a long time, only becomes pathetic. But the worst part about it is that if you begin watching the damn soap-opera, you can't stop watching it, no matter how bad it gets. For me, its the same with the Wheel of time series. The book still have its moment, but there's a lot less of those moments in A crown of Swords than in the earlier books. And come on, do we really need a 200 pages introduction of the characters in every book? And I don't like the development of the characters. Persons that I used to love in the beginning(like Egwene and Rand) have I come to loath and somewhat despise, those characters I didn't even like in the beginning(like Perrin and Nynaeve), I dislike even more now. Well, it doesn't matter that I don't like the turn the series have taken, I'm stuck with it and just knows I will read that hasn't come out yet. But I hope that Robert Jordan will put an end to it soon, or at least cut the crappy parts(there are so many totally unneccesary story-lines and conversations), because in ten years from now, I want to remember the good about the series books in the beginning, and not how it turned out.

However, i remain optimistic for the future. for those of you complaining about the lack of action, did you honestly expect Rand to kill the Dark One every book like he did in the first three? LOC had a better climax than any of the other 6 books, though it wasn't a real climax that topped off any real plot lines. I'm betting that after we read books 8, 9, and whatever comes after, we will be thanking Jordan for putting the boring build up into this one which will hopefully be proved to be necessary for Tarmon Gaidan. however, if TPOD turns out to be just more boring middle work like these last two, i may become disgusted and quit, though foolish optomism will make me keep on reading the rest in the library hoping for the last battle. As i said, this is the weakest yet of the series, but a great and worthwhile read, simply because it is in this series I end this commentary with a fervent prayer that Robert Jordan not die before he can deliver the truly great climax to this truly great work."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm sorry, but I could have just as well skipped this edition.

I found myself fumbling through the pages, wishing something would actually happen, only to be disappointed by more plot and less action. It seems setting up the plot for the next book has its price.

Reading it may answer some of the long awaited questions, and perhaps dispell the myth that Jordan has lost the thread of his plot.To al the faithful out there, congratulations! You show the true spirit of a reader, (one who sticks with a story despite its lulls, and does not condemn based on how your perception of how Jordan's characters should act. Face it, if everyone had reviewed Titanic based on just the first hour, they probably would have kept Dicaprio in his iron mask...To those who see the WOT series as winding down, maybe you should go back and reread the stories from the beginning. Then you may recapture what it is you think has been lost. Of course 'Crown' was slow and stretched out, who said each book had to be more entertaining than the last? The WOT is a series and a world. You'll have to forgive Mr. Jordan if he has to take a pause before embarking on the last three books (which I'm sure will begin the coming of Tarmon Gaidon, (sounds like Armageddon hmm?) Jordan's skill is in utilizing fantasy to entertain a legion of readers who have already read hundreds of similar tales. If you read to COS then he must have succeeded, and please don't tell me you were forced to buy those books.So will Lan bring cause dramatic character changes in Nynaeve, or only give her something else to screech about. Will Rand marry three women as Min predicted so long ago (though she didn't say all of them would live...) Elaida needs a good smack, and Siaun needs to stop folding laundry. These women may be playing passive roles in COS, but count on that to change as the coming war forces good and evil, and men and women in Jordan's world to strike a balance, or die trying.I for one eagerly await the next book. Of course it's not going to stop me from reading Dickson, Fiest, or King in between, but you can bet that I'll clear October for POD. Until then, thanks for reading."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The worst part of any great series (and there can be no doubt that this is one of the greatest of all time)is the fact that it ends. How depressing. RJ has been able to keep this one going without, in my opinion, any lessening of its quality. This is an amazing feat. I have read longer series (such as L Ron Hubbards travesty)and shorter series that just couldn't keep up the story without inserting a bunch of filler. This isn't one of them. RJ has proven to me that he has what it takes to make not only the longest but also the best series ever. My only fear is that he might die before completion.

I read the first five one after the other, then caught up to the authors output and had to wait for each of the rest. They were individually worth the wait, with varied and deep characters. It's not Tolkein (that's what makes Tolkein Tolkein). Far better than Stephen Donaldsons Covenant series (now there's a sell-out by an author). Deeper and more adult than Terry Brooks Shannara series (though I love it dearly for its own magic).

REMEMBER, he started this at least 8 years ago!!!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have been waiting for the 8th book for over a year now, and I'm to scared to pick up the series again in order to brush up on the story. Jordan is by far the best Fantasy writer ever, and yes he is better than even Tolkein. ACoS is indeed a long book that covers only a short time in the story, two weeks if I remember? However, Jordan has no choice but to make the story long and lacking in the way of plot development. The story is out of control. This is of course a good thing and what keeps people reading, it may get slow in the middle of a book, only comparitively of course, but the end of every book always leaves enough suspense to make you eagerly await the next addition to the series. Sure, the female characters in the story seem to be bossy and ill-tempered, but this is because the only females we see are those with power or at least the potential for it. After all, if Egwene and Nyvaene had been the fluttering maids from classical fantasy that many seem to want, they would never have stood up to Moraine in the first place and demanded to be included in the Quest. As far as the character development in ACoS and the series in general it is unparalleled in Fantasy. Modesitt's Recluce Saga and Goodkind's series come close, but still fail to reach the heights to which Jordan has soared. Rand, the true hero of the book is almost universally hated and feared by the various peoples of the world, and is this not true to life. Jordan, with Rand and to a lesser extent with all the characters is showing the evolution of leadership, and in Rand's case maybe even godhood. For, although Rand fights for the side of good, his actions are sonmetimes ambiguous, and by this Jordan is showing how Myths and Legends come about. He shows us the people as they really are, but lets us see how easy it will be for the people in the world's future to see their actions as those of gods or mythic figures. If you have not read this series yet READ IT, for Jordan is not just writing good Fantasy, he is turning the concept of fantasy into Art."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As I can tell by the other reviews I've seen, I'm not the only one getting fed up with the lack of progress in this series. Without repeating the sentiments of others, I believe that the last two books were just stalling tactics, because the author has no real idea how to bring this story to a climax, while also tying up all the loose ends. Beyond that problem, Jordan's characters, who we all know quite well from the first 6 books, just REFUSE TO GROW UP. Mat has received collective memories from military minds through the ages. So when does he stop complaining and get on with using this talent? Egwene is now the most powerful Aes Sedai ever. So do something with it! Perrin is revered by his people, but can't understand why? They all have problems with the way the world works outside of Emond's Field, even though they now are probably the most well-traveled soles in all the land. I guess there is a difference between being well-traveled and experienced. In any case, my suggestion to Mr. Jordan is that the story will move along when all the main characters stop bitching about what they have become, what they've learned, how people treat them, and how different the world is than they thought, and FINALLY GET ON WITH SAVING THE WORLD. The characters are getting harder and harder to like, and I get bored with a story if there is no one to root for. -- Bob Breyer"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the latest in a very long series of god books. In any series where the first two books are really good, the following books get harder and harder to write, all the more so for this series where the first four boks were fantastic. I say only the first four because after that no one can agree on how good the rest are, but the first four were great. For those who have been following the series, I don't have to tell you that stopping now would be a poor decision. For those of you who have never read the series, go check out book 1 &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, a fantastic book, and you'll be hooked on this series. when you get to this book, however, be prepaired for a small let down. The Crown of Swords seems, to most of the die hard fans, to be half a book. The only explanation i have is that Robert Jordan got tired.

If it were not for that he'd probably get a 3 as a rating, b/c as was said by another, one could probably skip &quot;A Crown of Swords,&quot; and not even miss it in the saga. Personally, Jordan is one of my 2 favorite writers...the other being Raymond Feist and his Rift War Saga and it's present continuations...if you have not read these do yourself a favor and do it, b/c they will indeed make the time go by as we wait for that cold front to move through hell and Jordan to release book 8."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I don't understand why so many readers complain about there being no plot in the CoS! A &quot;plot&quot; does not necessarily mean that everybody has to keep trooping across the landscape and constantly finding amazing new helpful items! In fact, I believe it is much more difficult and fascinating to develop a plot in a more stationary environment. All the main characters in this book evelop along their possibilities and undergo interesting changes. For me, that is the most important of all! Nynaeve and Elayne have finally started to act grown up, as has Egwene in a different setting/context. Lan is finally back - and when Moiraine shows up again, the bond will not renew itself. Lanfear must already be back in one of the new bodies - and Matt's cchanged behaviour towards the girls was simply necessary. So all in all I thik in this book happened a lot more stuff than some of you out there are willing to appriciate. Well, one thing at least everybody seems to feel: we can't wait for the next book!

You read epic fantasy for the details of the world, and this is one of the best-detailed worlds I have ever found.As for stereotyped characters, yes, it is a little repetitive and a little annoying, but I'm prepared to put up with that.And how can anyone argue Jordan doesn't know where he is going?

But please, hurry up with #8."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have been reading fantsy novels for about 12 years and believe me Robert Jordan's series is by far the best. I have read David Eddings series' and I have found that his novels come barely within reach of the greatness that Jordan's books do. Jordan's writing style is superb and although slow sometimes still was able to keep me engrossed for hours. Once I picked these books up there was nothing to make me put them down. I ate my meals while reading them. I finished up to #6 in two weeks (not continually reading of course) For those people out there that believe that he should get on with need to stop and give their heads a good long shake. If you don't like the way that he writes or how the novel is going then take my advice and don't read it. In Fantasy there is no novel that comes close to meeting Jordan's standards. I have been looking forward to his next book for close to two years. I have had to read other series and novels to fill the space but have gone back and read his work every few months and it still keeps me on the edge of my seat. All that I can say I guess is that his work is great and there is no need for the verbal abuse that people are throwing at him.

I do have books 8 and 9 to still read and hope they are somewhat entertaining. If both are anything like book 6, I might give it up.... not really. The one thing that I find really difficult, however, is keeping the 50+ characters he has introduced so far straight in my mind. I guess if you really like to read this kind of material, it has been pretty good so far. The only books I have read that came close to this in length were the Dragonlance chronicles by Tracy Hickman. They were VERY good in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Awesome book that keeps the reader interested until the end and then still waiting for more.

I let a lot of things go that I normally wouldn't for other series. Way to much description hurts books. Though with the WoT I give it some leeway. I know it a long tale before I started. I will see it through to the end."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Alright, so anyone reading this book series should already know that you are in for the long haule because there are 14 books (one to be released Jan. 2013; hopefully), which is not including \\"A New Spring\\" which is a prequel to the quite large book series (sidebar: it is short, pretty good [you know how it turns out if you started the series first], and gives you some good backround knowledge about Moraine and Suian's search for the Dragon Reborn and how Lan becomes Moraine's warder).If you are this far you know Jordan can be very long winded at times (possibly an understatement...), and this book is no exception; however, considering you are reading a 14 book series I suggest you sit back and let your imagination run wild with Jordan's extreme detail and descriptive writting style.I have read all the books and am re-reading the series to immerse myself in the story in preparation for the last book. That being said, everything Jordan has put into these books and the series starts to come to fruition around book 11 (this is not to say the other books are not good) and it is LEGENDARY!!! A modern day epic; if somewhat long. You will love youself for reading this series because it is so great at the end; so if it gets boring just power through it because it is worth it!! Sanderson does a great job picking up the series as well.Jordan is always compared to Tolkien, and one of the best reviews I have read for Jordan stated how he infuses politics into his series much more than Tolkien had (thus longer and more detailed). So pay attention to everything becuase as I am re-reading the series I am finding out so much more about the characters and the world that they live in that the story is so much more compelling, interesting, and it does not seem as long-winded/boring as it had the first time i read it. Further, another review mentions how Tolkien has multiple other books about the history of Middle Earth and its different people. Try reading a few of those and decide who is more long-winded.I suggest reading this series to anyone who enjoys reading and has the time and energy to commit to an epic story."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"... and it took 10 pages for him to get out of bed and put on his pants and 5 pages to kill another woman while (almost) killing the bad guy, thus acquiring more paralyzing angst."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After reading the previous book in the Wheel of Time series, I thought I was halfway through, as 'Lord of Chaos' is book six and the series was projected to be twelve books. But now it seems the series is projected to go to 14 books so again I find myself halfway there, I'm like the donkey with the carrot in front of me always just out of reach :).The overall story is still moving forward, albeit at a slightly slower pace. The consensus seems to be that the later books (6-10) aren't as good as the first five or so and I would agree, but I found this book , #7 in the series, still to be pretty good. There is a definite decline but not by much. A number of reviewers complain about the braid tugging and skirt straitening etc. but I thought Jordan actually dialed it down a notch or two for this book (or else I am so used to his particular writing quirks that I just don't notice them anymore). I still find his habit of giving every single character a name frustrating- in most books if a character is named it is because they are important to the story, but with Jordan, everyone has a name, important or not (down to horses!). Specific to this book, I found the long anticipated showdown between Rand and Sammael to be a letdown- poorly conceived and sloppily written. Never the less I am still looking forward to the next book and eventually, maybe some day in the far future, actually finishing the series."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The seventh volume of The Wheel of Time carries us over the halfway point of the series (with the final book now being split into two volumes, bringing the series total to thirteen) in terms of wordcount. However, in terms of the actual story we're much closer to the end. Robert Jordan made a decision in the latter part of the series to reduce forward story momentum in favour of developing subplots and character interactions, a rather controversial choice that has resulted in the series' overall mixed reviews across SF&F; fandom. By this seventh volume, we are starting to see the impact of this decision.The book opens in the aftermath of the massive Battle of Dumai's Wells, when the Dragon Reborn, imprisoned by the Aes Sedai loyal to Elaida, was rescued by his supporters and both sides had to fend off an attack by the Shaido Aiel. During this battle nine of the rebel Aes Sedai swore fealty to Rand to prove their loyalty and the Asha'man, a society of male channellers created by Rand to use in the Last Battle, proved their worth. Resisting the urge to revenge himself upon Elaida, Rand prepares for his much-foreshadowed confrontation with Sammael, whilst at the same time trying to finally win over the Sea Folk and the Cairhienin rebels to his cause. Meanwhile, in Ebou Dar, Mat, Nynaeve, Elayne and several other characters are trying to find the Bowl of Winds, an important artifact that will restore normal weather to the world. In Amador, stronghold of the Children of the Light, a shift in the balance of power puts Morgase's life in danger, and from the south and from the west an even greater threat is emerging to challenge the alliance Rand is hoping to assemble against the Shadow.There's a lot going on in A Crown of Swords, and the book conveys a feeling of momentum and movement compared to the largely static Lord of Chaos, which makes it a moderately more satisfying read. There's also a widening of the worldbuilding, with the Sea Folk presented in more detail then we have seen before, the introduction of the Kin (a secret society of female channellers) and the revelation of a new form of magic, the True Power, and a convincing reason given why we haven't seen it before (although we have, kind of). We also get to meet a deadly new form of Shadowspawn which presents a real sense of menace, just as we were starting to get bored of Trollocs and Myrddraal. As with the last three books, multiple storylines proceed in tandem and build to a series of large-scale, epic climaxes which shift the balance of power in the world and the story and leave the reader eager to plunge into the next book.However, several key problems emerge or are solidified in this book. There is a lot of talk and overlong chapters in which very little happens. Forward character development proceeds satisfyingly for several characters, but others (most notably Elayne) seem to be stuck going round in circles to the increasing frustration of the reader. The fact that one of the most interesting and morally complex characters in the entire series dies in this book is also rather irritating (given how reluctant Jordan is to kill off characters in this series). The introduction of the Kin also feels like a redundant step too far. On top of the Aes Sedai, the Aiel Wise Ones and the Sea Folk Windfinders, we really didn't need yet another group of female channellers and their attendant politics. On the other hand, Jordan sometimes gets criticised for his introduction of a whole new bunch of characters among the White Tower Aes Sedai who are assigned to flush out traitors, but he doesn't devote much time to them and they are clearly essential for the resolution of the Aes Sedai civil war storyline.A Crown of Swords (****) is largely a satisfying continuation of the story despite the increasing longueurs in some of the storylines. Some of the new characters and elements introduced are more successful than others, but broadly there is still the sense the story is going somewhere with continuing hints that we are moving towards a definitive conclusion. Unfortunately, this is the last time for several volumes that this is apparent. The book is available from Orbit in the UK and from Tor in the USA."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"3.5 stars. This is the 7th book in the Wheel of Time series, and only a few days have passed since the conclusion of the last book, Lord of Chaos.At the conclusion of Lord of Chaos, Rand had been freed from the imprisonment by the White Tower Aes Sedai sent by Elaida, the Amrylin Seat of the Tower, to capture him and bring him to her to guide and use as the White Tower chose. It is while on the march to Tar Valon that Rand frees himself, and a great battle is fought there with Rand and his allies being victorious. Due to this event, Rand forces the Aes Sedai there to swear fealty and oaths to him.It's during this book, A Crown of Swords, where I believe the plot slows down considerably. It doesn't move forward much, but there was enough going on that kept me reading and I did enjoy it overall. Like in the past few books, we get character viewpoints mainly from Egwene, Nynaeve & Elayne, Mat, more from Perrin, and of course Rand the star of the series.Rand continues to get more insane, he still doesn't believe the voice he hears inside his head is just that, \\"hearing voices\\". He still believes it is another person (Lews Therin) talking to him inside his own head. I've always wondered about his denial of the facts, with him refusing to acknowledge the fact that, \\"Ya know Rand, you *are* going crazy and it is a symptom of channeling tainted saidin!!\\".He knows the fate of all male channelers, as he knows the male half of the True Source was tainted by the Dark One's touch during the War of Power thousands of years before. He understands this, yet he still believes that the voice he hears is a separate person from himself (although how he manages to convince himself that a separate person could reside in his own head and converse with him....heh).Oh well, I don't think it's meant to be rational, Rand's belief the voice is separate from himself. I think in some ways he's desperate to believe Lews Therin's voice in his head *is* a real person, because in his eyes if it's not, he's already insane. Rand has a lot of struggles regarding this, his fate and trying to come to terms with his approaching insanity, not to mention his impending fight with the Dark One and Forsaken at the Last Battle. So, I can almost understand how he may be going insane already. It's already clear he's got some anger management issues (he flies off the handle quite frequently, rages and temper tantrums), and I thought Jordan did a great job over the last few books slowly giving you, the reader, a glimpse of Rand's descent into madness and how it is effecting him already.Nynaeve & Elayne, with Mat in tow, also continue their search for an object, the Bowl of the Winds, in Ebou Dar that could correct the unseasonably hot weather. Their viewpoints are probably my favorite sections in the book (other than the bits from the Forsaken). Nynaeve & Elayne encounter other women that can channel that may be able to lead them to the Bowl. While Mat is disgruntled and frustrated with having to put up with the 2 women. I enjoyed reading his sections, his thoughts about women, which was hilarious to read about, especially the parts about how horrified he was at the thought of a Queen chasing him. Which was ironically amusing, as Mat's character is very roguish and something of a womanizer. Very funny to be privy to his thoughts concerning what he thought about that!Egwene struggles to be more than a puppet Amrylin of the rebel Aes Sedai, and succeeds in subtly manipulating the Aes Sedai around her (with the help of the deposed former Amrylin Siuan, who is now an Aes Sedai again after being healed by Nynaeve in Lord of Chaos). One interesting thing with Egwene's section of the book, one of the Forsaken has attached himself (or should I say \\"herself\\"?) to Egwene and while it's not clear what his/her orders are, it's obvious the Forsaken was placed with the rebel Aes Sedai and Egwene to cause more trouble for the Light.That leads me to the roles of the Forsaken in this book. Each book has given more glimpses into the Forsaken, so each new bit of information is like a puzzle piece that fits together into the puzzle of \\"What is up with the Forsaken?\\". Like I said before, while their orders aren't entirely clear it isn't hard to piece together what they are doing. Mainly to cause as much chaos and confusion for Rand and his allies. There is also a new Forsaken that appears in this book, named Moridin. It is actually quite easy to figure out who he was before, as Jordan gave clues and if you've paid attention to previous books it's quite easy to solve. Hint hint: the Dark One can bring dead Forsaken back into new bodies to cause more mischief! All the more so because only you, the reader, know this as the characters have no idea about this!This is one thing I liked about Jordan. He teases with various clues, he doesn't outright explain to the reader, you have to take the pieces he gives you and figure it out. That is what makes this series such interesting reading, you can have many discussions with other readers of the series as there are so many theories, answers, and what if's that you could spend forever musing, \\"What did Jordan mean by doing it this way?\\"Anyways, there is a short fight at the conclusion of this book between Rand and a male Forsaken, but despite the slower scenes and less action I still felt this was a good read. Not my favorite of the books, but not too shabby. There is a lot going on, and it just gets more complex as the series goes on, but IMO, in a good way. It takes patience to read this series, but I think it's worth it. The next book is A Path of Daggers."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love the Wheel of Time Series. The new books lack the fast paced action which I liked from the first few books. However, I also love all the complexity and intrigue of Jordan's recent books. This is a reason i have held off from buying the Wheel of Time campaign setting for D&amp;D, i figure I don't need it, as just by reading these books, i would probably be able to make one of my own. Jordan is slowly bringing the story to a climax, introducing more and more threads, in preparation for Tarmon'Gaidon. This gives the world depth. Unlike other reviewers, I think that the main characters are far more interesting now than in the early books. I just wish jordan would speed it up... I mean, the series is extremely interesting, and is my all time favourite, but I can't see this series having a DECENT ending in just 3 more books (This is from book 10). In fact, judging by the pace, I'd say, to have a truly good ending, we need about 10 more books. But that's just my opinion. Until then, I'll enjoy the writing, which is still magnificent, if the speed is much, much slower. Until then, I'm staying with this series, unlike others who are jumping overboard.I liked this book, especially the Gholan and Moridin. About the only thing wrong with it was rand's invasion of Illian, it was stupid.

Although you cannot say that it has been boring!I have recently read the second book of the Belegriad by David Eddings and guess what, the characters seem very similar in the two story lines. There is the rescal/thief who loves gambling, a mysterious sorceress with dark hair and regal/queenly bearing, a very big (physically) individual that has an animal aspect to him, a girl or two thrown in who is either a princess or aot so ordinary girl and of course the understated hero. I found the similarities very startaling, and wondered if anyone else had seen the comparison?I still enjoy these books and have bought all of them so far and can't wait to get the 9th book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As always, Robert Jordan can draw in so many fine threads and tie them together in such a way as to leave you pondering their meaning for a good long time. He is the master of rumor, superstition, prejudice, and narrowmindedness in his characters... you want to reach out and slap them sometimes. The phenomenal depth of character this achieves, however, makes his people and places come alive in a way I have never experienced before."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Oh, zut! I've hit the end of the series so far! Help! I am a 14-year old girl, and I drag at least one of the WoT books off to school with me every morning without fail, and read whenever my teachers allow it because once you get started, you can't put it down. All five Emond's Fielders have made giant turnarounds in every way. Rand, for instance, was a gentle, naive country boy who wouldn't harm a flea if it bit him before that fateful Winternight that changed the course of Jordan's world. Now he's the only one who can face the Shadow to save the world, and he's killing off Forsaken left and right, among other things. Other characters have popped out with surprises of their own. Lan is still Lan, but he's a little looser now. Remember Faile's nickname for him, from #3, &quot;stone-face?&quot; Come to think of it, she changed, too. When we met her, she was a rough, tough Hunter for the Horn, and now she's a fan-holding lady. Some things never change, though. Berelain is still &quot;...a Mayener strumpet...with a neckline cut halfway to her knees...&quot; The remaining Forsaken are still more contemptuous of Rand than not, but I think they're starting to sweat. The Aiel are really cool. They have a great sense of humor, and they use it. Heck, they use it when they're not trying to be funny. Aviendha going to Salidar for any reason was a jerk-around shock. I'm glad Nynaeve and Lan got married. He was asking for it when he tried to push her away! Now let's just get the matter of his bond settled... I think I see what will happen with both Elaida's and Nicola's Foretellings. But RJ weaves as RJ wills, when RJ wills! Anyone who likes a good fantasy series should love WoT.-Master of the lightings, rider of the storm, wearer of a crown of swords, spinner-out of fate, who thinks he turns the Wheel of Time may learn the truth too late."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Along with The Shadow Rising and The Eye of the World, this is one of the best three books of the Jordan series so far. The Eye was a great farm-boy-becomes-hero story, though fast paced compared to the rest of the series. In The Shadow Rising, the intensity comes from the three main characters, Rand, Mat, and Perrin all coming into their powers. Rand learns of his past and the legacy of the Aiel, Mat aquires gifts and pays a price in attempting to take control of his life, and Perrin returns to defend his homeland in a great romantic and heroic storyline. A Crown of Swords is less focused on the big three, but here Jordan shows how much can happen in a very short amount of time (Just a couple weeks, I think). The encounter with the Gholam, a minion of the Dark One that is perhaps more dangerous than even a forsaken, is one of the most exciting scenes in the series. A new and very large group of women chanellers is discovered, though what their future role will be is uncertain. The Seanchan return to show that they have a role yet to play in the series. Some characters, such as Nynaeve, make huge strides, accomplishing things that have been hinted at since the first book. As can be expected from an epic series, many things are left unresolved. But, the best part of this book is the darkness of its ending. Mat's unterminable luck finally runs out, and Rand takes on another one of the forsaken, but the insanity induced by the taint starts to subtley show itself, as Rand begins to enjoy his own power."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just got my computer and have subscribed to AOL. So I've only just started to find out about the customer reviews page featured in Amazon.com. I have to say that the comments are interesting and revealing of the readership. Anyway, I read ACOS over a year ago, I agree with a great many of the readers that this book was slow and tedious. The details it raised were expected and not very innovative. However, as with any fantasy series it has to have a down period in order to settle some points. While I applaud Mr. Jordan's vast array of knowledge of world religions (by the very application of Buddhist ideology and other eastern religions the WOT series), the characters are a bit cliche and soap operaesque. Although he is trying to develop the main characters with as much complexity as he can, he falls into the trap of two dimensional characters with predictable vices and desires. Why is there such a dichotomy between the male and female characters? The trite positions they each occupy gets tedious. A point to the readers that Jordan has a truly feminist view: I don't quite agree with you. While the female characters are ostensibly strong, they frequently revert back to traits of feminine weakness. For example, Nynaeve is the portrayed as the strong-willed one, but her heart melts like cotton candy whenever she sees Lan. Her characterization is so polarized into classical tropes of strong-willed matriarch and subservient jellyfish that I don't feel for her, that is empathize with her. Someone made a comment about the characters, about how immature they are. They can lead armies, take care of the sick, yet when it comes to relationships they're like thirteen year olds who are told that someone likes them by that someone's best friend. And like early pubescent relationships, candor and dialogue are absent. This is what I mean about WOT having soap opera qualities it has a safety net of predictable relationship protocols. In fact, nothing is ever dared in the relationships. While the action of the series could be rated PG-13, the amorous relationships are on the scale of Disney. If Mr. Jordan could possibly start taking some chances with his characters, his series would have the complexity that would allow it to be compared to Tolkien or Donaldson. However, for the comments on the length of his installments and the complaints about the repeated details, they are necessary. Jordan is creating a different world, one we are not familiar with. And so the more details he relates the more vivid our picture of that world. I do hope that Rand's character will get smarter. It's okay that he might be going insane. But it's been years since he found out that he has powers, so he has to deal with it. If I am correct about the Buddhist inclinations in the WOT series, Rand has to come to grips with the idea of emptiness and compassion and suffering in order to control his sanity and his confrontation with the dark one, which won't be the LAST confrontation, mind you. As we are introduced into each book, the wheel of time keeps turning, so this confrontation is just one of the infinite confrontations that will take place...."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I read about everyone complaining about this series is going on too long, but I don't understand why they are indignant. Each book is totally different from the last. Admitedly, book 7 was not as great as the others because it seemed to be a bridging book to lead into book 8. However, it still kept me gripped to the last. The way Robert Jordan potrays the characters is amazing and had me re-reading all the books three times. Instead of near-god heroes and heroines, the characters are believable and have real-life problems. Jordans amazing style of writing lets the readers actually know the characters in a way that even Tolkein couldn't manage. Jordan has the ability to let the reader feel like Rand as he goes insane and to identify with Mat's confusion about women in an extraordinary way. The reader follows the characters through the many clever subplots while never losing an exciting plot and a rich background.The many subplots Jordan incorporates lends to the realism of the series a great deal. These subplots also take some of the lime light off of the main character, Rand. However, this is a good thing because it thickens the secondary characters in a way that I have never seen in a book before.Often I have read fantasy books without any historical background. Not so with Jordan's series. The world in which the characters interact is huge and detailed. This is probably the only series I have read with an actual history.In conclusion, this series is clearly the best I have ever read. All my friends agree. A definite MUST READ!! The only bad thing about this series is that it has to eventually end. . . .P.S. For all you out there who complain of the series running too long, I think you need to read harder into the subplots and foreshadowing. I read the series multiple times and came out with more understanding and new insights on the material."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is the best I have ever read in my life. This book is a fresh release from common fantasy, the kind which usually revolves around wizards, dragons, and the simple hero-takes-all plot. The heroes are often on the very edge of defeat, but by some miraculous bit of luck, they manage to keep their lives, if not always their sanity.This book also features an extremely powerful and mysterious group of women known as Aes Sedai.For those who wish for powerful female charactars, which are rarely featured in the somewhat male-dominated world of fantasy, this book is wonderful. These characters light up and tone down the book to a perfect degree, and it is extremely interesting to follow their separate plots. Aes Sedai are sneaky, royal, amusing-as different as the colors in a rainbow. While most fantasy features male wizards and spells, A Crown of Swords features this all female society who has learned to open themselves to a spiritual light known as Saidar.The central idea is that a MAN has learned to channel. The last time this happened, the world ended. All men who have ever learned to channel have gone insane, but there is one man destined to save the world, and break it again. This man is the Dragon Reborn. The other characters are all trying either to influence, help, or get hundreds of miles away from him.The book is filled with wonderful characters and an extremely complicated plot. It is spicy and sorrowful and even realistic. You can feel real compassion for the characters-feel annoyed, happy, and sad with them. This is a wonderful book, one of the best of the Wheel of Time series. If you enjoy epic fantasy, a long and thrilling read, and mental rollercoaster rides, this one is for you!!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Couldn't put it down!

This one, in my opinion, is the first one where RJ's attention to detail becomes a detriment as opposed to an asset. It begins with Rand reestablishing himself in Cairhien after the events in the previous book (Lord of Chaos) and ends with a pretty important battle.What I liked:*Mat and his adventures are as funny as ever!*Mat vs. Gholam*Introduction of Cadsuane (some people consider that a minus, but I actually like her character). Hers is a thankless job, but necessary.*The battles in Illian and Shadar Logoth.*The return of the Seanchan.What I didn't like:*Mat and Tylin moments. Something about that whole storyline really bothered me.*Elayne and Nynaeve, particularly their treatment of Mat. If someone treated me that way, they'd never see me again no matter how close we had been in the past! Their quest is quite drawn out as well.*Even though the slow parts had relevant information, these parts were too big and quite tedious.*FaileIn Summary:The Previous books in the series all had a certain excitement to them (for lack of a better term) that kept me going even through the occasional slow parts. That edge of your seat excitement was missing from this book at times. It only arose when the battles approached and made itself scarce during the overly descriptive slow parts. Still, there was story progression and the battles & Intrigue were great enough such that after finishing this book, I was greatly looking forward to the next one. I rounded the 3.5 stars up to 4 mainly as an offset to those individuals who rated this book based on their disappointment over the later books and also because the exciting parts were more than a makeup for the slow parts when all was said and done."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book doesn't have a beginning, middle, and end like most. It kinda seems like ONE BIG MIDDLE. But it is still entertaining .. and the plot keeps moving forward (some). Maybe I have been reading too long but what I have noticed in this seventh volume is that Jordan's style has suddenly shifted. There are whole chapters of characters going from city to city .. describing the columns or the dead grass or the scary Aeil and how they don't get along and they think wetlanders are crazy. I think I as a reader I ALREADY KNOW ALL OF THIS. I know that Perrin thinks Mat and Rand know girls ... and Rand think Perrin and Mat do. Oh, how ironic! The 70th time .. well, it is just annoying. There are interesting things .. such as Perrin and Faile's emerging relationship, Min and Rand's relationship, Egwene's struggles as Amyrilin. Mat is always fun. But the fact that Nynaeve, Elayne, Aviendha and Birgitte haven't changed in 3 books bugs.To sum it up ... my problem with Jordan is that he pounds some of these ideas into our heads TOO often. No one is going to read Crown of Swords without reading the other books first ... but he keeps repeating the craziness of the Aeil, the Cairhienin stoicness, the Aes Sedai's nausea at men channeling ... y'know? I'm sure us readers could list a million of these.Finally, the first 6 chapters of this book are difficult to get through becuase he throws out 100 names of lords and Aiel and Aes Sedai and such. The cast of this world is dizzyingly large and I think he uses all of them in those chapters. But get beyond Rand's return to Cairhein and Caemlyn and it settles down a bit."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While Nynaeve tugged her braid, Elayne smoothed her skirts and Egwene folder her arms under her breasts, all of them wishing Rand, Mat, Perrin and/or Lan were there so they could give them the rough side of their tongues and then take off their clothes to admire their pretty buttocks and so on.Meanwhile, Rand, ever mindful of the oily taint of saidin, wished he knew as much about women as Mat and Perrin did. Perrin, ever mindful of Faile's constant nagging, wished he knew as much about women as Rand and Mat did. And Mat, freshly bedded at knifepoint by Queen Tylin, wished lhe knew as much, etc.Elsewhere, in Tear or somewhere, the cleavage was robust, the chamber pots were made of porcelain, the lace dresses with the little silver thingies in them were very pretty and the forked beards shone in the pale summer morning like flaxen straw or some crap. Earrings were bright and sparkly and horses wore intricate, ornate saddles and, and uh...did I mention the cleavage and how firm and robust it was? Darkfriends walked the streets and did...things. Whitecloaks arrested anybody who said the word &quot;darkfriend&quot; and looked at them funny. Several Aes Sedai were stilled and then just as quickly unstilled...then stilled again if they stepped out of line.

Still, I was willing to give the series another chance, and I opened up volume seven with high hopes. Much to my dismay, I found that it was absolutely, astonishingly awful.For one thing, the story goes absolutely nowwhere. Rand is is still complaining, Elayne and Nynaeve(Light burn them!) are still searching for supernatural kitchenware, and Perrin is still as boring as ever. Jordan tries to bulk up his tedious narrative with needless details. Who cares what Nynaeve is wearing!The female characters are even more annoying than ever. Elayne is the same chatering fool she was since book 1, but now she is even more vexing since half the book focuses on her. Nynaeve tugs on her braid some 22,000 times during the course of the book. The female characters are seem to have the sane annoying personality. It seems like Jordan couldn't write women if his ife depende on it.In short, avoid this book at all costs."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was the book where I finally gave up on the series. Some reviewers seem to believe those critical of this book, and the series as a whole, lack patience, or just want a hack-and-slash action novel. This is not the case for me, or a number of the other reviewers. Read Robin Hobbs' series of books, then come back to these novels. Robin Hobbs' novels are large, detailed, and in some of the books, have little action. However, that author knows how to create interesting, involving, rich characters who develop, drawing our empathy as we follow their changing personalities.Jordan's characters do not develop. They are stuck in stasis, forever petty, stereotyped, incredibly annoying individuals. I cared for the first few books about the characters, but honestly, they just don't learn. Their experiences do not develop them. In the end, the characters do not feel like living, breathing individuals, but instead are charicutures that are made to get a reaction from the reader.If you want world building, characterisation, and plot, read Steven Erikson, Robin Hobb, or read the Songs of Ice and Fire Series. If you want massive books with a degree of interest, read Tad Williams. I would strongly recommend that you not buy Robert Jordan past the fifth book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have got to say, reading review after review listening to people complain about how slow the books are, or how tired they are of the characters has driven me to finally write my own review. Yes, the books are sometimes a bit slow, but arent all books that way? If Jordan wrote these books with non stop action, would the important scenes really stand out anymore? This is a fantasy series, not a Jean Claude Van Damme flick.Robert Jordan has created by far the most original and creative world that I have ever seen on print. You can get a feeling for the way people live, friendships, trusts, and relations between many many characters. It is not the cliche fantasy where the whole world is in peril, and 4 or 5 people band together alone and save humanity. This series throws you into an ocean of characters, story and imagination, and then all but drowns you with creativity and originality.One good point I would like to make: yes, the woman all drive me crazy, I wish Nyneave would leave her braid alone, and all leave their skirts alone. I wish they were all nice and sweet to Mat all of the time too. However, that isnt the story. That would not represent the characters they way that they are supposed to be interpreted. The girls are meant to be naggy, arrogant and annoying at points. No appreciation for men is a massive plot point for this entire series. Look, this series is meant to place you into a world and submerge you in story. If the characters just changed traits because it was old now, or boring, or aggravating would that make any sense? Jordan stays true to his characters which is not necessarily true about other books or series.So in closing, yes the books can be slow, and dull at points, but they are what you make them. If you are reading for only the highpoints you will not enjoy these books, and more than likely not fanatsy at all. Try reading from a different persepctive. Take in what he is saying, when he describes something, imagine it. That is how Jordan meant for us to read it, as surely he had a mind full of creativity, and knew his world very intimately. This series is meant to be read slowly, and appreciated so try another perspective, and give it another chance."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After finishing this book, I wondered how Jordan managed to pack 100-150 pages of plot into 600 pages of text! What happened to the other 500 pages?Well, most of that 500 pages, unfortunately, was pointless discussion about things that simply don't matter, like why Nynaeve is starting to dress more revealingly (I guess to make Lan happy, but who cares?). Why does it take the entire book for Elaine and Nynaeve to find the Bowl of the Winds, when they were in the same area the whole time?The conversations that DO matter are written in Jordan's usual suspenseful style that keeps the reader guessing as to the intentions of the speakers (Forsaken, Aes Sedai, etc.). Very few loose ends are tied in this novel and in fact, many more are brought up. The ultra-powerful and mysterious Moridin is introduced, as is the True Power which even the Forsaken don't dare to wield. What is the relationship between Moridin and Shaidar Haran, who was introduced in Lord of Chaos? What about Slayer, what happened to him? What happened to Mat? Still no word on Moiraine and Lanfear.Yet for all the disappointments, it's a must read because it DOES progress the story. You can't really skip it because several important new characters are introduced (Moridin, Cadsuane, etc.).

I've never read a series that has both entertained and annoyed me so much, which is a testament to Mr. Jordan's emotional connection with the reader. But everyone has a breaking point. After this much time and effort with relatively little payoff, I must encourage all new readers who are thinking of getting into this series to avoid it at all costs. And for those of us who are just too hooked to let go. Here's hoping we all get to the promised land some day."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off, I enjoy the series, and RJ has a remarkable gift with language.However, I have a few peeves with his writing. For one, he seems to have a strange, juvenile fixation on nudity, especially breasts. Just take a highlighter and mark every reference; you'll run out of ink!Secondly, his female characters are almost without exception ill-tempered and man-hating. The men, on the other hand, roll over every time a woman snaps at them. Min is about the only female character who is likable. I'm not sure what experiences RJ has had in dealing with women, but apparently they were far worse than mine have been.Jordan has a fixation on the war between the sexes which is unsettling. Use a different highlighter to mark the women-against-men passages, and you'll use up another marker.Thirdly, this book introduces so many new characters and subplots that I don't see how anyone can keep them straight without taking notes. Too much confusion!Despite these very irritating flaws in the book, it's still fun to read. Jordan paints such good images that his novels do come to life. The concept of the series and the way he is unravelling it are brilliant. You just have to put up with some of the author's fixations."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I enjoyed books 1-6. Crown of Swords is just what all the critiques say: boring, verbose, tedious, excrutiating... etc. After the climatic finale of #6, I was excited to see the reactions of all parties involved in the events in the beginning of #7. I was sorely disappointed. It was well more than halfway into the book before Elaida discovers what happened at the battle.Jordan has a bad habit of taking the first 1/4 or more of the book rehashing prior events. Absolutely nothing happens in the beginning of the book, and worse, little if any happens in the entire book.The whole book is a mindless verbose drone (sp) by Jordan. He takes entire chapters to describe converstions that can be contained in 2 or 3 pages. My trick in forcing myself thru the book is to only read the dialogue. Seriously, the book has fatal flaws.Jordan: Quit writing filler episodes! Your reputation has been tarnished enough already.I already bought the 3rd collection (7, 8, 9), so I will try to force myself thru them when I have nothing better to do. I see that #10 just came out and offers most of the same slow pace. Unless Jordan speeds up his books, I will stop at 9 (which I already bought, much to my regret) and read no more of his stuff.My recommendation, if you have to read his later books, browse thru only the actual diagolue (at book store or library). Skip the verbose unnecessary nonsense."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time is one of the two or three best series I have ever read.

I would have to say that I have read this series at least 5 or 6 times, and I still do not get bored with it. It's strange knowing the characters so well. Most authors that I have read do not go into the detail Jordan does....and as most people get into the action, I get into all of it. I do wish Jordan could pop out those novels quicker, but then again, I don't want the quality taken away. I of course say take your time, as long as their as good as all the rest, why should I care if he takes a couple of years with the book.

(I find myself having that kind of trouble with the Breath of Fire fan fiction I'm writing, and that's only 200 pages so far! But then again, I'm not a professional writer, yet.)I loved the first two or three books in the series. The Eye of the World hooked me instantly. I was totally in love with the Aes Sedai and Warders -- so much so that I've underwent the trials of becoming Aes Sedai myself! -_^ But by The Shadow Rising I could tell WoT was starting to lose steam. It's really too bad. The only saving grace of the seventh book is what happens with Nynaeve and Lan. They are the only reason I continued reading WoT, and I found myself disappointed constantly because their relationship is so neglected in the series!

Quite simply, he is the BEST fantasy author in the world to date. Jordan took over from where David Eddings left off, in creating an epic fantasy series set in a real and authentic world. Reading his books transports you into his world and you establish a link with it. You come to care for the characters and their plights, to relate to them and their wants, needs and aspirations. This is not your run-of-the-mill sword and sorcery, it has heart and depth. If you ask me I am tired of the same atypical books on the market today.

Most of COS is centered around either Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve or Min and Rand. The parts with Mat were good in describing his frustration with Elayne and Nynaeve.

You should read this series because it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I want to begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed CoS despite its faults (of which there were a few). I did not find it as entertaining as some of his previous titles, but still worth the time it took to read it.Admittedly, Jordan's 7th book slows down some. Jordan doesn't develope the plot nearly as much as I would have liked. I think the reason for this is simple, he has so many subplots that he has to spend a quarter of the book just reminding his readers what is going on. He needs to finish off some of these subplots so he can develope the main plot (Rand's preperations for the final battle) more fully. I also concur with those that believe that Jordan's characters seem to have become more two dimensional. Note I sain more, I still think that his characters are fairly well developed (if sometimes undistinguishable from eachother), yet they lack the same believability that they posessed in earlier books.CoS also has its redeeming qualities too. Jordan's ability to bring his world to life is uncanny. While I think that Jordan needs to finish some of his plots, I like reading about the many different factions and the intrigue and power plays they use in order to gain some semblance of control over their situation. While these don't advance the plot very fast, they are a part of Jordan's style of writing, and I feel that many of those who would want Jordan to finish his series within the next book or two do not appreciate this. (Here's a hint for those of you who are complaining about this, DON'T BUY HIS BOOKS. I keep reading people who say that this book is horrible as were many of the rest of the series because they were much to slow. If you don't like his writing, then don't buy it!! While this book did move slower than many of the others, it was not so slow as to cause me to lose my intrest.)In closing, I would like to state that while I don't think this book deserved a 10, it was much better than the 2s and 3s that some people gave it"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Beautiful prose; an epic tale.

I started this series with a shorter story about Lan and Moiraine in a compilation called Legends. So I thought this is absolutely a great series. And i kept up that optimistic attitude for the first 3,000,000 pages but it got old. i realized that I was hanging on for Lan and Moiraine's sake and that this plot really blows! I really don't care about Rand (maybe Mat) And if I wanted a bunch of guy vs girl remarks I'd be happy with the typical life of the American teen.So i apologize to authors(like Tamora Pierce) I got mad at for ending where they did and to them i say thanks you make books worth reading."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Admittedly I have not read the entire book, but it is probably one of the more difficult books I have read in a while.

Mr Jordan go read a Guy Gavriel Kay novel and learn from a proper author.The trouble is Jordan's caught in a no-man's land. He's trying to out-do Tolkien by creating a totally believable down to the last little detail fantasy universe. But he's also trying to tell a story. YOU CAN'T DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME! Tolkien didn't try to do this so why does Jordan think he can?And what is it with the females? All of Jordan's female characters are a bunch of manipulative women who spend all day trying to totally emasculate the men - in between smoothing their skirts, tugging their braids and folding their hands under their breasts!!The ideas Jordan came up with aren't terribly new.

It's not particularly long, compared to other WoT books, but it has taken me the longest time to read. The few interesting parts of the book would last about 20-30 pages and then it was back to what some folks call &quot;character development&quot; for another few hundred. &quot;Character development&quot; is not much needed any longer for the same players we've come to know EXTREMELY well over the previous 6 books. (Nobody who has read only this book will be drawn into the WoT series anyway, so forget the newbies, Mr. Jordan, listen to us die-hards. :) I would hate to spoil the book, but a summary of the major plot advancement would take less than a paragraph, with each character maybe doing 1 important thing. There are some characters who seem to be having a change of heart, ie Nynaeve, and there are some minor developments and resolutions, but these would only be interesting to those who remember what happened in the first 6 books. In all, I did enjoy this book, and it did have it's moments, but it's not one for folks who are not too engrossed in Mr. Jordan's world. 4 stars, mostly because I am a WoT freak!!! ;)"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"BORING, but full marks to Jordan. Not only has he written an epic adventure in the first 6 books of the 'wheel of time series', but he has managed to write rubbish for the seventh book and make a lot more MONEY.

Eight might be my last book if the pace doesnt pick up."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With the Crown of Swords, this series has hit rock bottom. It's completely out of steam. Mr. Jordan's prose is repetitive, his women characters are interchangeable and one-dimensional, same as his villains. The sexual timidity/coyness/insecurity of the &quot;couples&quot; grows tiresome after seven volumes. The plot here is badly constructed, more annoyance than suspense. Too many Deux ex Machinas. The payoff was hardly worth 800+ pages. I am done with this series. And so it seems is Mr. Jordan. He had a good thing going for a while there."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I was a bit disappointed by this book. I enjoy Robert Jordan's WOT series and think it is the best series written to date, but A Crown of Swords was a bit of a let down. Starting with The Lord of Chaos, the books have just had the feel of setting up for something bigger, but nothing ever happens. This book was consideribly smaller than the others and I personally think that Jordan put it out just as a quick fix for his impatient fans. The series has become so immense and is constantly expanding it is hard to see it ending anytime soon. Not that I want it to end. I just want some closure on at least some of the issues. I have read nearly all of the comments from the first book to this one and I must say to all of the losers who rate this series with 1 star &quot;What?? Are you on Crack&quot;. This is wonderful reading for anyone! Unfortunately, since we have to wait so long in between books, our anticipation and expectations grow so big, nothing Mr. Jordan could! possibly write will live up to those expectations. None the less, I shall remain a loyal and die-hard fan. Last comment - To all of you who have recommended 'A Game of Thrones'; I totally agree. Anyone who like WOT will love it!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that Lord of Chaos was one of the best books of The Wheel of Time. It introduced some wonderful new characters like Olver and Shaidar Haran. But after the book was done, the unthinkable happened. Robert Jordan must have started listening to the whining wretches. &quot;Work faster! Write more! More! More! More!&quot;(Despite the fact that Jordan is one of the fastest fantasy writers) And so, Jordan churned out A Crown of Swords in record time, and it was a very dissapointing book. It only observes about a week of the characters' lives, and in that week, little happens. The Bowl of the Winds is found, but not used. The &quot;True Power&quot; which seems like just a way for Jordan to explain some inconsistencies late in the game, is revealed. Sammael is &quot;killed&quot;, but we all know he is still alive. And Illian joins the ranks of nations supporting Rand, whoopdee-doo. Maybe I'm just spoiled. Maybe the action and excitement of Lord of Chaos affected my judgment. But if you're going to expect your readers to buy 10 $30 volumes, at least make them exciting! I have high hopes for the future, however. Now that Jordan is taking his time, I bet the next novel will be one of the best. With the Return of the Return of the Seanchan, and the Aes Sedai civil war, I know that The Path of Daggers will be wonderful.May the Dragon ride again on the winds of time."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Like thousands of others around the world, I waited impatiently for the this installment of the Wheel of Time. The amount of time between 6 and 7 seems to me to have been extremely ridiculous, and then when it finally gets here, we all run right out and bey the hardback.($30.00 worth). I started reading with the expectation that greatness would continue (even though book 6 wasn't up to par with the first 5) Well, to the point. Within 2 chapters, I begin to feel very cheated. Mr. Jordan seemed to have rushed through the story with no forethought toward more than a shallow following of the plot. I seem to remember hearing he'd been working on other books (Conan maybe?). Well, the lack of effort and enthusiasm that I found in this book 7 nearly turned me off to the series. I am going to stick out book 8 to see if RJ has himself and priorities straightened out. It's been long enough. I hope, Mr. Jordan that you see difference in the art and enthusiasm of books 1-5 and the downhill slide of book 6 to the seemingly &quot;Let's rush to get something out&quot; job of book 7.

Jordan has always been a master of hanging guns on the walls but none of them ever fires. Sometimes they emit a wheeze or a sniff. Example: this book's ending, or the scene where Nynaeve got rid of her block. The scenes were rushed and even downright annoying.Jordan's build-ups are long and almost never lead anywhere. Jordan simply doesn't know how to resolve a plot. He also doesn't know how to create a plot -- the fact that there is something resembling a plot at all in his books is due to his overuse of a pathetic plot device -- prophecy.Whereas the first books were somewhat readable for the reader had to remember only ten or twenty interchangeable and stereotypical characters, in this book (and a few previous ones) the reader has to remember ten billion such characters. Give or take a few thousand. I am not even going to comment on the infantile behavior of his characters -- others have done it well before me.Many people complain about Jordan's long-windedness. While that is not necessarily a problem, it is in Jordan's case. The Crown of Swords is a prime example of the problem, although the problem has been there since the very first volume. Jordan doesn't seem to know where he wants to go with his story or how to do it. So he just writes pages of filler and meaningless descriptions. He can be painstakingly precise when it comes to describing, say, an arch in the White Tower or Elayne's new dress, but he muddles the important scenes. What exactly happened in the confrontation between Rand and Sammael? Or in the conclusion of Eye of the World? Or all the other battle or fight scenes? It all remains unclear. I will not buy any more !Jordan books, there is more enjoyable fluff out there for light entertainment."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"When I started reading _The Wheel of Time_, the series consisted of only two books, and I've eagerly awaited each new release. I was never disappointed... until now. As occasionally frustrating as Jordan and his penchant for loosening three threads for each one he tied up was, the plot moved along, the characters developed, and, simply put, things happened in the first six books. _A Crown of Swords_ was doubly frustrating -- first, because I spent hours reading hundreds of pages that did none of the things I listed above (develop characters, move the series' plot along, or, for that matter, even just tell an interesting story) and, second, because I'd waited for a year and a half only to find out I'll have to wait another year and a half to see the series develop.With the exception of a few things, this book could never have been written and the series wouldn't suffer. If I have to hear Nynaeve huff again or listen to someone gripe about silly men or cross her arms beneath her breasts or dress someone down with her hands on her hips or otherwise encounter any of the other actions, descriptions, or themes Jordan repeated ad nauseum here, I may just call it quits on what was once one of my favorite series.The Wheel of Time will never be on par with &quot;serious&quot; works like the Book of the New Sun or the Hyperion Cantos but it was, until this book, far and away the best of the more &quot;popular&quot; books like those by Eddings, Feist, and Brooks. With _Crown_, I'm starting to feel as if Jordan knows he's got a good thing going and is content to milk a couple extra books out of this series to ensure his family's financial security forever.

Unfortunetly, while the Crown of Swords is still an entertaining read, the style, characters, and plot seem to lack the same vitality that was in the earlier books. How, many times must the reader encounter Matt's, Perrin's, and Rand's lack of knowledge concerning women, and the assumption that the other two have this &quot;knowledge.&quot; Also, the characters have become static in their interaction. It is too-bad that the reader can now predict how a meeting between Rand and Perrin will proceed. Perrin will accuse Rand of using people without consideration and Rand will get angy and claim that he does what he has to do. These stylistic repititions and predictable character scenarios are compounded by the neverending plot. The series is supposedly headed towards the last battle between the Dragon Reborn and the Dark One. Yet, forsaken are killed, but not killed, countries are conquered, but not conquered, and the toying with time paradoxes, all lead one to believe that Jordan's Wheel of Time series has taken on many aspects of a soap opera. These frustrating plot twists, static stylistic devices and flat characters all lead one to believe that this book does not have the same focus that the previous six did.

I got more of a kick out of his short story A Strike At Shayol Ghul than I did for this one. Let me end by saying, RJ, don't let the pressure of publishers or fans get to you.write how you want to, because I very much believe this book came out to satisfy both your fans and your publishers. I want the old RJ back, give me a continuation of Rand and Co.'s Saga.

One book every two years or so is absolutely ludicrous"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Of all of the books, which are all great, this one is the best. It weaves intrigue, political backstabbing, a magical presence, and all out warfare into a great book. The characters are less like heroes and heroines from a book and more like regular peopl that we would see every day. For instance Matt, Perrin, and Rand all think that the others have everything figured out when it comes to women, but they are just as clueless as each other. Nynaeve is as naggy and stubborn as my old girlfriends, and Faile is as jealous as my wife. Yet at the same time as he shows his characters weaknesses he shows them battling against a force that is more powerful than can be believed, and not cringe in it's face. This is a book I would recommend to anyone that is interested in fantasy or just reading at all. It is a must read"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Whatever guys..we all have different views of what should happen.

If you read a book and you think it's bad, then just stop reading it. The Wheel of Time is and continues to be one of the greatest series of books I've ever read. It is well written, and the characters have real depth. Though some would argue, they change, too. From one book to the next, the characters change, and struggle to hold onto what truly makes them the decent people they are. This series becomes better each time I read it, and the seventh book is as good as the previous ones. It leaves the reader aching for more, and also satisfies what the other books left unsaid. Anything less than a perfect novel from Jordan makes people want to puke. Then, they should read the rest of the Fantasy world. Of course there are great books out there, but then there's the real crap, with no characters or development. Anything less than a perfect novel from Jordan would disappoint me slightly. This one, however, is as perfect as books get, like the previous ones. Do not be put off by the bad reviews: this series is THE series to watch, and it hasn't disappointed me yet."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Those of you out there who seem to like berating authors..... well.... stop.

How ever I do remember that this book in the series like the others before it were excellent. There can be no comparison between Tolkien and Jordan. Tolkiens books except for the first one were so boring I couldn't even finish them. Out of more then 50,000 (I literaly keep track) pages in the last four years Tolkein would be rated amoung the worst. Likely those that don't enjoy the book and complain about character development would be better suited reading Romance or Peirs Anthony (an author of his own fantasy world(a flowery world)). Or perhaps they have difficulty with the words and phrases. I think that every one is intitled to their own oppinion but must wonder if perhaps they should look for a different class of works such as mystery perhaps. I would like to rate this book with higher then 5 stars but cannot. I have recommended Robert Jordan to friends and haven't gone wrong yeat. I being a big D&amp;D fan, though I have read the vast majority of my librarys other fantasy novels, would like to say bravo to Robert Jordan.

Jordan still is writing good books none the less. A lot of people say that nothing important happens in this book. IT ISN'T TRUE! If I didn't read this book I would open up Path of Daggers and be like WHAT? Not to much stuff happens (I could only name 3 off the top of my head) but you should really read this book.

I have read the rest of the series, and the books were excellent, especially the first couple of books. However, ACOS is mediocre for Jordan's high standards. It is still a 'good' book which is why I gave it 4 stars. This book seems to be too long for what happens in the plot. It acts like a connector book, one which just links the last book to the next one, but where nothing monumental occurs. Jordan has been compared to Tolkien, but I think this is unfair to both. While I prefer Tolkien, they are different writers, writing in different eras, with different types of fantasy styles. My favorite fantasy/scifi authors are Roger Zelazny and c.s. lewis. I think Zelazny's Amber novels and c.s. lewis's Chronicles of Narnia are superior to Jordan's because they show just as much imagination in a couple hundred pages (average book size) as he shows in a thousand."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"None compare with the genius of Jordan. I have never thought that any of his books were too-long, quite the reverse! If his series were 30 volumes I would happily make the investment in time and money without a second thought. I applaud the unconventionality Jordan employs (who wants another warriors and dragons false-epic?). To get the character development Jordan envisions, many volumes are required. I seldom read anything under 500 or so pages-whats the point? You might as well read a magazine article for how much it engrosses you (some exeptions aside). Compare for example David Eddings. While his Belgariad/Mallorium series is entertaining, it does nothing to approach the grandeur and style of WOT. Nor does anyone else. And what about the humor? This series is gut-funny and is at-times hillarious. Just thinking about the characters well-drawn idiosyncrases brings a smile to the face. Without the time and investment of remaining with the same characters, book after book, you never feel like you know them. The characters in WOT are more developed (especially Rand, Mat, Perrin, Nynaeve, Moiraine and Lan) than many so-called real people I know . This series merits many re-reads (I have read it 5 times) as it is simply better than anything else (even the sixth time through!!)."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read this book and have found it as entertaining as all of the rest. Granted, some of the previous works have been faster paced and more revealing in character and plot development, but look at the scale of what is being written. In the seven books to date, what has been the actual elapsed time? Four, maybe five years? In that time, we not only had to learn the various cultural differences between each &quot;kingdom&quot; (or &quot;Queendom&quot; in some instances) let alone of the planet (And what planet is this anyway? Maybe Earth in the far distant future like Stephen King's Dark Tower Series?), but two different cultures, past and present (Not only of the Forsaken (or the Chosen depending on whose side your on), but the Seanchan, who have a decidedly ancient view of things.). The characters have to be developed very thoroughly so that some appreciation of motive and action can be understood. I personally think that Jordan can not possibly resolve all of the outstanding plots in under fifteen volumes. Hopefully I will be proven correct."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off let me say this: DO NOT read this book until you've read the first six books in Wheel of Time Series. Start with THE EYE OF THE WORLD, THE GREAT HUNT, THE DRAGON REBORN, THE SHADOW RISING, THE FIRES OF HEAVEN, LORD OF CHAOS and then A CROWN OF SWORDS... Okay, now that we are through that I must say that I'm not really a sci-fi book reader fan, more of a sci-fi movie watcher...but I saw one of these books and hunted until I got to the first in the series and I must say that I'm truly hooked on sci-fi books. I ordered all seven books and read them back-to-back. I think that's the best way because now I'm waiting for Book #8, THE PATH OF DAGGERS and the waiting is killing me... I'm taking this time though to read books by a coupla other sci-fi writers, such as David Brin, and David Eddings. I've read that these are some pretty decent reads...so while I wait for Jordan's next book in the series, I'm enjoying myself. Ooops, guess I'm supposed to be telling about the book, but I personally think that one has to read these books themselves, and the telling of the story spoils it for me...so all I'm saying is....GO BUY THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES BY ROBERT JORDAN....Anyone needing to talk about this series or books in general, and can recommend some good sci-fi books and authors can always drop me a line or two or three. :) SMEA"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"About a year ago I began reading Fantasy novels, I began with the DragonLance chronicles.

Our favoriteThelma &amp; Louise begin to take on true power. As does the ever-forceful Egwene.Rand stops acting like a wool-brained ninny. And Mat begins to understanda certain amount of responsibility.

Instead of trying to match what he had done before, though, RJ changes gears with A Crown of Swords, and gives us his most playful, amusing volume in the series. The key to this shift in tone is the focus on Mat, the put-upon, misunderstood, just-trying-to-keep-his-promise guy who gets the tables turned on him with Queen Tylin, and shows the Atha'an Miere what being a ta'veren is all about. There is an obvious sympathetic connection between RJ and his gambler creation; makes you wonder what he was like in his 20s. Oh, there are other characters, other plotlines to follow in ACOS, but they seem a little pale and less interesting than Mat's trials and tribulations. Who can forget Tylin tying Mat's wrists to the bedposts, or Mat receiving Elayne and Nynaeve's apologies with his usual skepticism and practical good humour? Any poll I've seen has Mat as the most popular character by far, and ACOS is the volume that gives Mat room to grow in our hearts.PLOTTING: Aside from Mat, Elayne, and Nynaeve in Ebou Dar, we've got Egwene trucking the rebels north, and Rand and Perrin returning from Dumai's Wells to discover renewed suspicions. There are a few side-trips (Elaida's troubles with Alviarin - serves her right; Sammael messing with the Shaido), and RJ even tries giving Rand an oppprtunity to goof around (his impetuous jaunt to a certain hideout).CHARACTERIZATION: Queen Tylin is an inspired creation, putting Mat so hilariously in his place, and we finally get to meet Cadsuane, the most imposing presence since Sorilea. We also get a rare treat - a POV with Aviendha, who gives us a welcome glimpse into the mind of an Aiel. Given the sheer numbers of characters, RJ has his work cut out for him in trying to give them all identities and dimensions, and with the major characters, I believe he succeeds quite well.PACING: RJ begins the book by looking at Dumai's Wells from a couple of different angles before delving into the aftermath, and the result is his most patient, thoughful opening to date. From there, things gradually pick up speed; some nice suspense with Egwene's discovery of Myrelle and Nisao's transgressions, which carry us through the middle of the book. Then, two false climaxes before the true climaxes. The way RJ writes it, we're not sure which challenges were more difficult.BEST SCENE: There's no doubt - the scene that has Tylin finally trapping Mat in his bedchambers, and does some tricky things with her wedding knife. The Best Scene We Never Got To See: Lan and Nynaeve's Sea Folk wedding.MOST POV: Even though this is Mat's book, he really steals it out from under Rand, Egwene, Elayne, and Nynaeve, who get about as much time as he does. But because his POVs are usually so much fun, they tend to stick in your mind more than the others do.OVERALL: RJ doesn't try to outdo book 6; instead, he changes the tone and writes a more light-hearted volume. This is all to the good, but as we'll soon see, Mat's character is more necessary to the success of the story than you'd think.Sorry for my rambling on, and making the review so long.

Ofcoarse even with the slow speed of parts 6th & 7th [ as compared to earlier parts 1-5 } the saga is still readable and intrigues as well as charms. But if we look holistically, nothing seems to be moving. Egwene is still slowly moving on towards Tar Valon, Morgase is no way near Andor, Rand did just 1 decent thing of actually attacking illian, no. of forsaken are still as much as there were two books back { even though last two books Rand's only aim seem to be killing atleast one of them }. Even with a Tavern, Elayne & Nynaeve coiuld not finish up the job at Ebou Dar in the whole 742 pages. In the first few parts, one book used to spread across 2-3 months atleast but now it seems, Robert is too bust detailing the daily events so that whole book is finished and only 10-15 days have actually elapsed in that fictional world.

And as every book in the series, it has its moments. But man alive Jordan must be emotionally attached to this series cause he seems to never want it to end. There are so many scenes that could easily be taken out, and are smiply useless. Taking them out would speed up the book greatly. 100 pages can go by without something significant happening and its incredibly frustrating. He leaves the end of the book in a cliffhanger, but oddly it dodn;t really do anything for me. As i have said earlier, the series is becoming way too predictable, whenever something bad happens, it either happens to a minor character (Nalsean, which pissed me off), and if it does happen to a main character, then you know nothing will come of it. Blame it on taveren if you will, but Jordan seems unwilling to take risks.

I think things pick up well in &quot;path&quot;:Cadanswhatshername is messing with Rands mind, the Asha'man are getting unruly, and the chosen are starting to drop off at an alarming rate.

The only way I could get through it was by literally skimming the pages (sometimes *skipping* the pages), stopping at the very rare bit that looked like it might catch my attention. Usually I was wrong though and it was not worth stopping and I could get back to skimming. My wife doesn't know why I persist and at this stage I'm not sure myself - just stubbornness I suppose.

As much as I'd like to say otherwise, I'm afraid Jordan could have compressed this book into something one fifth its length.It's not that there's no plot -- of course there is, but the plot is ten volumes long. It's rather a question of whether or not the plot goes forward in this book, and in CoS the plot just doesn't move forward very much at all -- certainly not 1000 pages worth. Comparing the occurences and rapidity of events in this book to the other six, the &quot;what happens next&quot; factor in the first six that kept me up until dawn reading, there's just not much that happens. For instance, we learned about the Bowl of Winds in the last book, and this book was taken up entirely with finding it -- we don't even get to learn what it does or whether or not it works! Rand does face Sammael, but his (Sammeal's) end is somewhat ambivalent and ultimately unsatisfying -- which brings me to my major point: Jordan's story is in no way original. Almost every fantasy/sci-fi device gets pulled out and used, and many of us have seen them all before. Tolkein and Frank Herbert seem to loom particularly large in Jordan's invisible pantheon of world-creators. But that's not the point. Why we read and love this series is not because it's an original story, but rather because we know and love the story, and we feel fairly certain about the outcome already. It's the execution that makes the series great -- HOW Jordan does what he does, the order in which he tells the story... how he weaves his &quot;pattern.&quot; And CoS is poorly woven. Nothing decisive happens, and the things that do happen happen in a most unsatisfying way. It's as if he decided the the series will be 10 books long, but he only has enough material for 8.5 or 9 books. So he padded this one out with lots of (so-called) character development, which (for me) is one of the most annoying things about the series -- it's to the point where I skip the &quot;romantic interludes,&quot; which have displayed the same infuriating stupidity and obstinacy on the part of his young male and female protagonists for seven books now. To me, character development means that the chartacters learn something about themselves and one another -- and to give Jordan his due, the characters do soften, open up, and discover some interesting things in this book -- but again, not 1000 pages' worth. See &quot;the Dark One's Dictionary&quot; (do a web search; you'll probably find it) for some ironic commentary on Jordan's one-dimensional ideas regarding women and their relationships with men (search for &quot;sniffer&quot; in the dictionary). The unfortunate thing is that you have to read this book to prepare for the next one, Path of Daggers, in which I am anticipating some big payoff."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Enough joys in life are too soon over, don't let's rush another.The WoT series may be long, but it is well worth the time RJ has taken to write it.

I'm in no hurry to destroy this world, are you?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have loved this series forever. (which is as long as Jordan has been writing it) Every character has an edge, they have depth, they do wierd things. The world is tremendously well developed and detailed and original, a difficult task in a field dominated by series filled with elves, dwares, wizards and other, TSR-like creatures. But, nothing is happening. The plot, which progressed steadily through the 1st 5 books, has slowed to a crawl - I think Jordan decided to extend the series partway through. The series is beginning to remind me of Gormanghast - beautifully crafted, interesting characters, but long with no real plot."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I thought the book was excellently written.It left alot of Loose ends which only means I'll hafta buy the next one.Robert Jordan is taking his his precious time writing the next one, but that only means a longer, better book.I don't want the series to end soon, I just want the next book. For you people who don't like it, I guess it's just your misfortune to feel that way.Poor,poor people:)"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The story captivate the mind and free the soul. What happen to Mat! Will the black tower topple the white? I eagerly await the next book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel is definetly the best fantasy series I've read after Tolkien's. Even though books 6 and 7 are a bit slower than the others I think they are still great and the right point of view is to consider the Wheel in its entire structure: while the first books were almost self-ending stories (you cannot possibly sell a first book that does not have an end), these last should not be considered as books in themselves but only as parts of the greater story. If you consider the Wheel as a single book, the chapters 6 and 7 out of ten are those were the plot is deployed, in book 8 and 9 everything is prepared for the final showdown and the last chapter is where everything takes a frantic pace till the end. Please do not compare RJ to Tolkien, even if RJ is a great writer he does not have the depth, complexity and many-layered structure that the great JRRT has. One last word for those who wants shorter books and shorther series, please dont buy the Wheel and let us enjoy RJ and its superbe storytelling, I only regret that I have to wait between one book and another and that one day he will finish the Wheel (when I love a book so much I'd like it would never finish)."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book is exactly what was needed for the series to progress to next stage. After essentially six straight books of action it was time to stop and let the loose ends catch up and be dealt with before continuing. Jordan was able to in one book tie up loose ends that went all the way back to the second book (i.e. Bors the darkfriend who we now know is Carridin the Whitecloack Inquisitor). Yet at the same time that he is tying up these lose ends he is spining entirely new patterns the results of which we probably can't begin to imagine yet. All in all a very enjoyable read, the book is a very good jumping point for the next novel. For all those reviews I read about people who thought this book was too slow because it ties up loose ends I have one thing to say: You are the ones that also complain about all the loose ends that Jordan has left in the first six books in the series. You can't have it both ways. And for those that say that the last four books have been terrible, why bother reading the next one in the series then? Regardless of what is said this is one of the best series to come out in a long time."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I wanted to express my opinion on this idiotic whining most of the people who read this book seem to find so neccasary. Buck up you pansies! If it's so difficult to read a long book I am shocked that you claim to be lovers of fantasy, just take a look at classic real-life(character style) fanasies such as The Odessey, The Silmarillion, and every story of mythology ever created. If you can do nothing but whine because in my opinion it is because you lack the ability to compose anything intelligent. Next time before you complain about something, try to do it. If you can accomplish the task than by all means complain, however if you cannot reproduce the act than you have no buissness complaining. Thank you for listening."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Like the rest of the series. This book was gripping from the beginning to the end. Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time Seriers is the best I have read. It is more compelling than David Eddings &quot;The Belgariad&quot;, and TOLKEN. p PLEASE keep up the writing and release the books a little quicker is possible"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I just bought the mass-market edition of ACOS this week. Picking it up in the bookstore and flipping through it, the only way I could tell that I hadn't read it before was by looking at the release-date tag on the bookshelf. Jordan needs to get his act together and get some plot movement going - I like a long, hefty series as much as the next fantasy junkie, but this is getting ridiculous. It wouldn't be so bad to have our characters doing these cross-country trips in every installment (and thank heavens they re-discovered Travelling and Skimming, huh?) if they didn't behave in such utterly predictable ways when they got there. It's sad that Jordan's characters have been reduced to cariactures of themselves - and that so many of them, especially the women, bear a suspiciously strong resemblance to each other. (Can anyone else detect any more than slight personality differences amongst the Aiel Maidens? What about the Aes Sedai?) I'm in this series for the long haul, but I'm getting more and more disappointed every time. And I would also like to ask anyone with an inside line to Jordan to ask for an updated glossary/dictionary of characters - with this long to wait between books, and plenty of other good books out there to read in the interim, I would like to be able to turn to the back and find these characters who haven't been around in three or four books now. I'm definitely not wasting my money on the hardback of the next one."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have read each new issue in this series with much anticipation. It is one of the few I can't wait for the paperback version of, but, instead have to buy the hardback. Given that, I must say that compared to the others, both volumes 6 and 7 seem to have dragged a bit. Jordon appears to have hit a development crisis as he obviously is trying to lay down the ground work for the final stages, but want's to hide the outlines. The result is a story long on tangled emoting and short on actual plot progress. Too many threads dangling. The final scene was good, but the rest was simply not up to snuff. Tighten up the weave, Mr. Jordan. Loosely recommended, but only to keep up with the plot."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The overall series of the Wheel of Time has been a masterpiece. This book starts a downfall of a legend. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great book and series, but I think that Jordan's peak was around &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot;. If he were to just let the story flow and start letting the readers imagination fill in the details this engrossing plot could still go on for another 5 books. I still can't wait for the end I know it will be very imaginative with all the plot twists that Jordan has already come up with."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It is a good series, but I would like him to wrap it up now."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Um...one complaint. Not at the books, at the reviewers. First of all, &quot;The main characters, Mat, Rand and Perrin won't grow up!&quot; Uh...well, the guys would be in their early twenties by this book, and being in the early twenties myself, I can say this: most men (or women) don't grow up that fast! Sheesh, they're not in their thirties... Nynaeve...yep, she is a bit typecasted these days, but hey, was she ever one of the REAL main characters? I saw her more as one of those people who hang around in the background in Tolkien's LOTR...you know, the ones who don't die, but still get dismissed with a simple &quot;married this and that and died at that age&quot;-bit at the end...and being one of those, she's a lot more well-developed than most of those... Not that I'm comparing Jordan with Tolkien, that would be stupid...not because one is better than the other, but because one (Tolkien) wanted to write a novel using old Celtic, Germanic, and similar tales. LOTR is an extremely good example of that. And besides, it is a classic. And excellent. But Jordan is writing a &quot;Maybe everyone gets killed, maybe not, and I'm gonna keep you guessing till the last page&quot;-series, combining Chinese, American Indian, African, European mythologies in one world...and it works! I mean, yes, we were all there with Sam and Frodo, but did anyone really doubt they would be saved? I mean, puh-leeze, give mr John Ronald Reuel some credit! Whereas in Jordan's novels, we don't really know. Will Rand die? Or will he survive? Will Mat die? Will any of them? And if so, who? It may sound morbid, but the reason people read books sometimes, apart from the adventure, is to see which people dies. Like when you watch a horror movie. Oh, and Rand is allready mad. Hasn't anyone noticed his ups and downs? One moment he spends days in his room, severely depressed, not eating, considering ending it all. And then he says, &quot;Aww, what the heck, let's go make the Sea Folk a part of my followers!&quot; as happy as a jaybird... That's really very reminiscent of a manic depressive...and wait till he gets deeper into the psychosis...heh heh heh... Like I said, not the best book, but still good. And please, don't say Tolkien or Jordan is better than the other. It's comparing apples and oranges."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After having read the first six books of this series I felt I had a pretty good understanding of where Mr. Jordan was going with this. His ability to leave connections that can lead the story in more than one path is astounding. Most Sci-Fi books set a path and go along it even when the reader can guess what will happen next. Robert Jordan has shown his talent by leading us to believe that a battle with one of the foresaken will not happen until another book, but instead occurs within the last 20 pages. The only thing I did not particularly like in this one was the fact that it did not have as much of an dramatic build-up and ending as the others an had too much description of things like emotion and scenery. But I can clearly see that this book was mostly for bricklaying of the next book which I am still anxiously awaiting. I expect the next book will deliver more action and less description of emotion and scenery."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've read every book in the Wheel of Time series, and the imagination is finally running out in &quot;Crown of Swords&quot;. Very little happens in this book, which merely extends (never resolving) his story lines and culminates in the predictable climactic battle whose ending is never final. The book also stretches events out to extremes. Conversations take pages to resolve, every shuffle of paper, every raspy sounding breath, is described in great detail. Having followed up this book by reading Tad Williams' great &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; series, and George Martin's &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, I am wondering why I would ever return to a Book Eight of &quot;A Wheel of Time&quot;. There are simply far more entertaining and smart fantasy books out there. I hope Mr. Jordan feels the ponderous weight of what he has created, and I pray his next (and last?) book in the series quickly moves his story toward the exciting and passionate conclusion that a series of this size, and its readers, deserve."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Some of you whine about how long and detailed this series has become. Face it, it is a long and detailed series with many subplots that are carried out. If you don't like the length then read a shorter series. The only reason that I really can live with the same old story of a noboby farmer boy who goes after the head of evil and distroys it with very little difficulty in under 600 pages is that this nobody farmer boy isn't the only charactor and he doesn't get to distroy the evil villon until he stops being stupid. This is a series that may fallow the general purpose of most fantaisies but it certainly can make the same old story into a compleatly exciting story. The reason this series is keeping my interests is that it is not all fighting and action. Books like that can't be concidered good cause they have such a weak story line. This series holds your attention with suspence as great as any famouse mystery story and if it did not have all the details and subplots then most of that &quot;can't put it down&quot; suspence would be lost to cheesy action that only lasts a page or two. With all the subplots and new charactors constantly being introduced the story never gets boring and all the mistakes made by the charictors just makes the story seem more realistic.True &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; wasn't nearly as exciting in the way of action as the previous books have been, but there was no way that Jordan could have continued on with the series without every page of this book. If he had tried it would only have left a huge gap in the story and all of that realistic world would be lost causing the series into an unrecoverable decline in quality.The way I see it, if Jordan doesn't continue on with the story the same way in the 8th 9th 10th and howevery many more it takes books than this series will bit the bullet hard. So continue on great master of fantaisy, and don't let all the complaints of action adventure lover's make you change your writing style one bit.P.S. to all those people who say that in Tolien books you could always remember all the charictors and events at the end, pehaps you need to read &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; that is a book with an overwealming # of charictors and stories. Fat chance remembering all of them.Josh Barlow"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The Wheel of Time has been amazing.

I don't know about some of you, but I lover the factthese books are long. The more books I read the more problems I have findingmore books in this genre.

It is just the wait that is knawing away at people like a Shadar Logoth dagger. I have just finished ACOS and I loved it! What you must remember is that there are other things to do while waiting for the next WOT book. How about reading other books? Terry, Fiest, Tolkein again, Donaldson etc... What do you mean &quot;did not further the plot?&quot; Humans are so quick to action. The book was excellent. I don't care if he ever finishes the series. It's like the X-Files in that I know there is a specific end in mind but I don't want the show to end! Now I do have some minor complaints about the Wheel like for one I do know what an Aes Sedai is and I really don't need to be reminded of it every other chapter as if I'm some kind of da'stang! I'm also not real into the guy bashing. Personally I think the female characters make themselves less by constantly displaying their ignorance of males. While the males are also somewhat clueless, at least they don't 'browbeat&quot; the females when the females do something &quot;unexpected.&quot; Ah well, just the ravings of a young man unduly obsessed. One last thing though, by reading these reviews you are going to encounter a lot of negative reviews; they are just frustrated! Repeat! They are wishing for the next book to come out right this moment and are venting their anger here"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"OK, so we've all read Tolkien: first, last and only, master of all he surveyed, archetypal fantasy God on high, yada yada yada.... Well, in response to this fiction icon's prostrating zealots I ask only one question: where are all the women? Yes, I know: they're pocketed in there at random intervals. But they are few and far between and, most importantly.... What's the word I'm looking for? Oh yes: expendable. Now, I am not what I would term a feminist. Therefore, it was not until I stumbled upon &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; that I realized just how much my soul had been pining for strong, prominent female characters crucial to the development of the story line. Man-tall warriors, wielders of magic, walkers of the world of dreams: these are not the kind of women to cower behind dainty handkerchiefs and weep uncontrollably while their knight in resplendent regalia battles a villanous foe. Rather, they might turn on any man who so much as offered to combat their nemeses for them. Beautiful, yes -- Would they really be fantasy novels, otherwise? -- but fierce and independent and lovable not only for the splendor of their visage and form, but for their uncompromising desire to contribute the full spectrum of their abilities to an all-out battle against evil. Or the same battle against good, for this series accomplishes the commendable feat of instilling a compatable intellect and tooth-and-nail intensity in its female adversaries; as much as our hearts tell us we shouldn't have such feelings for them, we develop a kind of, if not love, than respect and awe. In my humble -- ?? -- opinion, there has never been created a work of fantasy -- especially on a scale this grand -- that has offered its readers a collection of female characters as varied as a box of 64 Crayola Crayons bound together by the common threads of a head on their shoulders and a fire in their hearts. Bravo"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is an author of unparralled quality, but please stop comparing him to Tolkien. His stories are not even close to J.R.R. yet every time I read a book cover, or even one of the more mundane reviews here on this page, I here yet another idiot saying how Jordan is the &quot;new&quot; Tolkien.Do you ever here people today comparing Barry Bonds or Ken Griffey Jr. to the likes of Babe Ruth or Mel Ott? Of course not! They have nothing in common except the fact that they are and were the best in their times; respective times that is. If published today, I have no doubt that you would never even hear of Tolkien's LORs. The same goes for Jordans books if published in the 40's.So get a grip! Enjoy the books seperately, not comparitively!

I think not. And in almost EVERY negative review I've found that the reader thinks the characters make the same mistakes...excuse me but give some reasons for this line of thought. I haven't even seen one solid reason for thinking this series was bad. Of course some of them thought that series like &quot;Covenant Chronicles&quot; were good, that would explain it.This book was perfect in EVERY way.1st:It had only 663 pages. Myself I'd prefer about 1,000 pages per book.2nd:It had the return of Fain to attack Rand only moments before his strike on Illian and Sammael(Tel Janin), It introduces some more aspects of the Shadow like the appearance of Moridin who's tapped into the &quot;True Power&quot; and tells of many creatures and abilities from the AoL. It also introduces the Seanchean again who take Altara and Amadacia.For those who say there is too much detail then let me remind you that if Robert Jordan had his way he would have put MUCH MORE detail into ALL his books instead of (what he feels is) hasty work to reach the deadline.These books are obviously not for everyone,They're only for those who truly appreciate literature, and have patience with those who want to tell a story and make you feel as though you're in it.On another point I feel that Jordan is in no way comparable to Tolkien because while Jordan can drag at times, Tolkien didn't elaborate on his characters and had no truly memorable villians who frightened or even amused the reader. I didn't really remember his heroes and was thouroughly bored by the middle of the 2nd book.Jordans books are ALL easy 10'sDatchery"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"All of Robert Jordan's books are great and this is just another example.

Not because I think the story was lacking i luster or that it failed in satisfying my need for an interesting, ongoing and cleverly planned array of plots and subplots. Nor was it because the caracters were getting boring, which often is the case in so many (at first) promising series. The only reason I could possibly have to wish this series into conclusion would be my frustration at having to wait so long before i can continue to indulge in the works of this prominent writer. He is Leagues ahead of the competition since the series just keeps getting stronger by the book and noticeably so in this, the latest installment, which many have passed off as &quot;just a means of expanding his series and bank account into the next millennium&quot;. These unfortunates have just missed the whole point and not concentrated on the content (and concept) of the book. All this book did was expand the already thriving, magical world of Jordans genius creation. Visably, not much worth mentioning happened, but the stage has been set for the next book to be (perhaps) the greatest yet in this hard to beat series. I can't wait.

Anyway, Crown of Swords is a masterpiece which not only builds on the rest of the series, but introduces you to a whole new aspect of the Wheel of Time world. Mindtraps, Moridin, and the increasing roles of Ar'angar and As'angar. The reintroduction of the Seanchan element is also a wonderful, refreshing addition to the series.

When an author creates one long tale that is spread out over several books, inevitably there are some books in the series that are stronger than others. I would classify ACOS as one of the weaker books of the series. I must qualify this by saying that I am hopelessly in thrall to this series and even a &quot;weaker&quot; book still manages to captivate me. Still, this one had the feel of set-up rather than of moving forward. Even though i had waited two years for this one to come out, while reading it, I felt as if I were still waiting. It is a curious feeling to read a book and still feel as if I were waiting for it to happen. On the upside I am intrigued by two new characters, Cadsuane and Moridin. On the downside Rand's confrontation with Sammael seemed almost anticlimactic, it had the effect of a whimper when I expected a bang. I am vey much looking forward to &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot; h! oping that this book moves a little better than 'A Crown of Swords&quot; did."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have noticed that Robert Jordan produces excellent books in a way similar to that of growth spurts.

His work acts as a modern day Star Wars, we have our heroes with their flaws and our heroines with their fantastical personalities and annoying stubbornness. Who can bear the long wait in between each title? Personally, I've been reading since the beginning. I've yet to grow tired or worn out from the long, and to some, tedious novels. Every page of his works has been carefully laid down, planned out, and supplemented with wonderful humor and surprising turns of event. Jordan...

The Hobbit was a disgusting book and the character himself was a weak little midgit who got lucky and rode a good wave. Jordan develops his characters like Tolkein never did, with almost day to day detail giving you a feel for their actual lives. This book is an excellent add-on to Jordans series, and I almost want him to end it in the next book because I want to know what happens so bad. Jordan (with the exception of a few slightly unrealistic parts) has kept me on the edge of my seat through all the novels, and this one too. Whenever he gets to a point where I really get bored he hooks me again. The crown of swords is a rollercoaster all the way through, and enticing at every turn. The Wheel of Time including the Crown of Swords are the best fantasy series i have ever read, just as Stranger in a Strange Land (by Robert A. Heinlein) is the best Sci-Fi book I have ever read.

When reading this series of books it is very anoying to have to wait so long for the next one to come out. I know that he is doing the best he can but the wait is still a pain. I also enjoy the way he goes into detail on the characters of this series though. I am also curious to know how many more volumes there are going to be before this series is ended. I know that he is a talented writer and I am looking forward to the series."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book, even though a continuation of the greatest written series ever, is far below what I have come to expect from this series. The ending seemed really forced which disappointed me. Robert Jordan needs to stop wasting time and get on with the series, there is so much more for our beloved characters to do than simply sit around which is what A Crow of Swords was full of. A helpful tip to the great one (Robert Jordan): we're ready for what comes next just get it ON!!! And from the reviews I just read of Path it doesn't sound like it is going to happen any time soon."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Yes, everyone finds one character boring or unbareable, but I've noticed a remarkable lack of consistancy in which character that is. This just proves how realistic these characters are, no two people feel exactly the same way about a third. Like real people, whether you like or dislike the heroes of this book depends on the readers personality. This isn't Star Wars (which I love) where the story itself forces the viewer to like Han Solo, these characters are fully formed people, and being a good person doesn't necissarily make someone likeable."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While I have, and still continue to enjoy as the series unfolds, i felt that this particular book did not accomplish much in the plot.

Most, up to this one, have been good. This installment lacks any substance. The ending seemed like it was thrown together to meet a deadline. Very disappointing. I enjoy a long book, but I feel it should at least capture my attention for some of it. I have talked to a few friends who have also read and enjoyed the series. Most feel, as I, that Robert Jordan has started dragging this out without much thought. I feel the reviews I have read are giving a review of the series, not this book. The series is good, but not this one. One could probably skip this one, and not miss a beat in the series. I'll probably wait for two more books to be written in the series before I start reading again. The books are getting shorter in pages and much shorter in content."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's seventh book adds nothing to this endless stream of mass-market drivel. Most of the people who I know that started the series gave up long ago, as I now have. Jordan's works are written in a manner remniscent of something my D&amp;D buddies would have concocted after an all-night session back in eighth grade - which is appropriate, considering the target audience. Just think, the approximately four-star average review of this book was created from the opinions of those who liked Jordan's previous works enough to drudge through the first six books. Factor in the large number of people who gave up on the series, and the average score would be far, far lower.And please quit comparing Jordan with Tolkien. Comparing those to is similar to comparing the Spice Girls with Mozart, Stephen King with Edgar Allen Poe, or 'Independance Day' with 'Casablanca'.In each case, the former is good clean fun, and a reflection of our time. The later are eternal."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After spending a week wading through about 150 pages, I put this book down as a boring soap opera. About a year later, I picked it up again, and enjoyed it thoroughly. This book has some weak points, most noticeably, the fact that there are 200 or so women who think and act like cartoonish wenches. Every single one. Unfortunately Nynaeve resurfaced and most of the Aiel Maidens haven't been nuked yet by the Asha'man.On the positive side, the best thing about this series is the great sense of paranoia and uncertainty which all the main characters can't avoid. Everybody *knows* they're on the right side, even if nobody else thinks so! Everybody backstabs, plots, and schemes to make things happen their way, but who will come out on top? Even among the avowedly &quot;good&quot; guys, there exist huge tensions and rivalries. Very cool! The story threads involving Elaida and the Black Ajah were among the most interesting. Taken slowly, this book rewards when you savor the subplots like this one. By keeping the ultimate bad guy in the background, the threat seems a lot more real, unlike most of the cardboard villains populating fantasy bookracks these days (See Feist, Raymond).The conclusion w/Sammael, btw, was *WEAK*. Since the plot isn't the main strength of this book, this is not a fatal flaw.This series is something of an elephant - both flawed and grand simply because of its size. For my money, the positives outweigh the negatives, at least in paperback.P.S. - this would make a good TV series like the X-files *if done properly.*"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am captivated by The Wheel of Time series.

I for one think that the characters are execellently developed, rich, and believable. I would like to thank Mr. Jordan for creating a world in which women are not only equal to men but do indeed seem to best them. The one complaint I have is that men are stronger in the One Power.

I feel a bit cheated by Jordan, I've come too far now not to go to the end with this but the story has really become interminable. Leaving aside the repition (if you took out the word 'stout' this series would be three books shorter!!), infantile breast obessession, utterly inconsistant characters (e.g. strong women characters who suddenly decide they want to be dandled on some man's knee and what the hell is 'dandled anyway')... the thing that irks me most is why does virtually every character insist on jumping to conclusions about the others without a moments thought?I read thiat things getter better from about book 10. I really hope so!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It was at this point that the WoT started to suffer from bloated exposition, and drawing out scenes that in the long run didn't amount to anything. What was truly annoying was the scene in Ebou Dar, where the narrative was drawn out incessantly over Tylin/Matt, the introduction of the Kin and the petty squabbling with the Windfinders. Also particularly annoying was the introduction of Casuane-am I the only one who felt her introduction was a little too convenient (after the disappearance of another prominent Aes Sedai in Book 5)? Along with Faile, Cadsuane has become another character that grates on my nerves. Also the Rand/Perrin argument should not have been off-screen (as it were)-that scene deserved to be told in real time, not rehashed from memory.Despite those complaints, Ebou Dar has some funny moments, and the second half of the book really pushed the action. We got to see some interesting Forsaken viewpoints, and the ending fight scene was decent. It would not have been bad if not for the lack of action in the first 200 pages."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Rand has to fight a Forsaken he has fought before, who, in good supervillain fashion, just won't stay down.A quest is also required to do something about the nasty weather that the evil Dark Lord has chosen to inflict upon them.Aes Sedai politics continues to be a pain in the arse for a lot of people."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This series is the absolute best. It is where-have-you-been-all-my-life quality. It only has one flaw; a repeating plot. Nynaeve loses her temper, Elayne mends the damage, the Aiel with ji'e'toh, etc. We can all predict what's going to happen. However, Robert Jordan's occasional twists like Nynaeve's discovery, or a battle with one of the Forsaken spice up the plot. Also, there is foreshadowing buried in the story books earlier that keeps the reader flipping the pages, and picking up new books. It's the BEST series.My only question is, where does Robert Jordan get the titles?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan doesn't try to outdo Lord of Chaos instead he changes the tone and writes a more light-hearted volume. This is all to the good, but as we'll see in Path of Daggers, Mat's character is more necessary to the story than you'd think.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jinkins, The Shannara series by Terry Brooks, The Saga of Darren Shan series by Darren Shan, and the Remnatns series by K.A. Applegate"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I totally love this series, but Mr. Jordan is pissing me off with the fact that I want to know what happenes to all the characters, like will Elayne bond Rand?, will Egwene bond or/and marry Gawyn? The Black Ajah too. I mean continue the story. It is great that you keep the readers in suspense, but Mr. Jordan is streching that too much. Finish telling the story."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The plot was pretty well non-existant.

As it stands now, it appears that Mr. Jordan has quite a few more plot twists up his sleeve, like Thom and his daggers. I commend the author's character development, but at times it seems like he's doing it for its own sake. This book, in my opinion, was the weakest in the series to date. I'll read any book in the series, of course, but the climactic battles in any of the previous books outdistance the one in this one, by far. I mean, Rand can only use balefire but so many times to destroy one of the Forsaken. And if he can save Mat and Aviendha from death with it, as he did in the previous book, why was Liah not saved from the mist of Shadar Logoth in this one? Jordan could have drawn the battle out to a much more fitting climax, if you ask me. I'm hoping that the next books in the series move a lot quicker than this one did."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Finally a series of books that takes the time and does it properly. My feeling when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings was that it all finished too soon. Leaps are made, things just fall into place, characters suddenly learn what it is they're meant to do. Not so with these books. The characters are slowly coming into their own. Slowly learning their abilities and shaping their course. Brilliant. If the story is slow then it's as it should be, frustrating. It just makes it more worth while at the end of the day."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I love the series as much as the next person, but RJ adds toomany new plot twists and then answers the most burningquestions from the previous books in a half a page.

I have much of both, and have an understanding ofwhat RJ is going through to bring these fantastic and beautifulbooks to the readers. But even my patience fled in waiting forbook #7 to reach the shelves, and it nearly drove me MAD. Butwhen it finally did, I was so thrilled that I read the book non-stop until I was finished. And then experienced such disapointmentthat the book was so short, I felt like weeping. I feltthat this book was one of the best written in the series, fullof the detailed, fantastic characters and engrossing, intricateplots that have become the essence of his books. I can't sayenough about it. I think my favorite part is the return of Ishamael,the best of the Forsaken (Yes, he is in the book, if you canfigure out who he is). I wish RJ well on the completion of bookeight, and look forward to the day when I can find the blissand sweet release found in the world he has forged for us once again.I humbly thank him, for giving us such a wonderful place to escapeto.

The seventh has suffered, and sadly couldhave used a great deal of blue pencil. &quot;Crown of Swords&quot; raises thenumber of plot twists one would expect, but integration has suffered somewhat,and each subplot seems a little too shallow. The success of each precedingvolume was largely due to Jordan's ability to enmesh readers with new plotlines as old questions are answered. &quot;Crown of Swords&quot; put few questionsto bed, and does not capture the reader's interest as previous books had.If this were the first WoT book that I had read, I might consider stopping here.Of course it is the seventh, so I will await the next volume, hoping it resemblesthe earlier volume"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is an awesome series.

It still does not compare to the last two books, but it's the best of the series in terms of leaving you hanging at the end. If the next book is as good as I think it will be then I will forgive jordan for the mistake of the last two. But This book does dive more into the character plots and speech instead of dragging the book on with mindless detail which he accomplished sadly with the last two books.

There wasn't quite as much action as in the previous6, I think that this book is more of a set up for the next Wot novel.aCos is satisfying, in that several characters gettheir well-deserved come-uppance, and two key relationshipsare further developed. However, it is also frustratingbecause, for all the loose ends that are tied up,there are about one hundred others questions that arecreated or left unanswered.

I did like the ending with Rand, but I think that he should have written a little more about Mat and the Seanchen. There was some more evidence to support my theory that Olver is Gaidal Cain reborn, and there was a very touching scene with Nynaeve and Lan. (She finally broke her block) And of course, there was Mat and Briggete. I've been waiting for them to discover each others secret since The Fires of Heaven.

Whether this is because Jordan was setting the scene for the final three book run in or he simply wanted to ensure sales until the end of the millenium I do not know. Either way the book adamantly refused to tie up any plot lines, indeed it seemed to convulute threads of the plot that are already so complex that it takes all of the readers concentration just to anylyse the ramifications of a relatively inocuous event...All in all \\"A Crown of Swords\\" is as well written and as full of clever plot devices as any of the other \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, but it left me feeling slightly cheated.

His portrayal of the love between humans,the interaction between the sexes,and the political and social aspects(whitch other books of the genere tend to over look)are as superb as the titanic battles that take place be they physical or on a hihger level. Some say the books are being drawn out,but i beleive that Jordan is simply creating a world were there are people that we love and hate,succes and failure we all may face,and a story ritchly written.

I thoughtLord of Chaos was the best among them. The Crown of Swords was a bit of a let down. I was expecting a lot of plots to be ended in that book, and if not ended, at least bring me out of suspension. A Crown of Swords, like the rest of jordan's books start off kinda slow, and about 3 quarters the way in, you begin to feel the action filled pages. I agree with many of you that Jordan is beginning to dwell on the most obscure details. However, I feel that Tolkien is even more of a detailed writer. Not to Critisize the King of Fantasy, but I believe that Jordan is about to Dethrone him. Jordan's plots so far have been the most creative and unique I've ever read. His characters are rich with life, he makes you have known them all your life. In my opinion, No more plots, no more characters. I mean the current plots, as many as there are, will sufficiently fill his 10 book quota. I long a wait for his next book to come out...A Path of Daggers I believe it will be called...And Mat better be married in this one."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"As usual Robert Jordan captures you into a world only surpasedby your imagination. His books draw you in by their detailedness andthis book only strethens this serie's rapture. By adding more loose ends and braiding in others he sets this book, this series, into book lore. What other series can you name that is so realistic in it's details? The only reason I give this book a 9 is because by introducing new evil characters that can channel, not only women who can channel saidin and men who acn channel saidar, which I think gives the last two books more suspense, but gholams who channel the True Power, he draws this series into a long series of books. This isn't too bad because the books are good, but its costly to the reader. Otherwise who cares if he draws out the series as long as he's got poeple to read it and enjoy. I think it's a great book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The best book out of the The Wheel of Time series yet.

My bigest problem is the lack of attention to Perrin, one of my favorite characters. Yes, it's a long book, and a long series, but why is this bad? Personally, it's one of my favorite parts. Though, it does remind one of a soap opera at times. The plot moves about twice a book, or once a week. Only with better actors. But, with remarks like &quot;there are only two times a woman will tell the truth: when she wants something and when the sun rises at midnight,&quot; how can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A crown of Swords was an excellent book. Rand is still going insane for about the, what, 5th book. He is a really good writer and I enjoyed all of his other books, but I found that this book didn't really acomplish anything. Robert Jorden keeps on building on his characters than on the plot. I think what Mat, and the other Aes Sedai really interesting, but that is the only thing. Rand keeps building on his Black Men magic group for the whole book. I think that Jordan needs to put more of a story to his next book, and close it off. This book didn't stop. Rand gets healed then the book ends. What kind of ending is that. I have read Terry Goodkind and many other Fantasy books and I enjoyed them all. From day one I has read Robert Jordan faithfully, but his last book was dissapointing. I find that I am waiting for Terry Goodkind's next book to come out than Robert Jordan's. I don't know who I prefere because you can't compair two great writers. They are both different books, with different characters, with similiar abilities. Rand can use a sword and magic, while Richard can also use a sword and magic. Good against evil, facing things from the underworld. All Fantasy books coming out, are the same in one way or the other. You can't vary on something, that is difficult to change without going to Sci-Fi.

J. is either draggin on this series or he is a very clever and master writer. Which one do I chose. That he is a very clever and master writer. He has captivated an audience of plenty and everyone is dying for the next book. As you can see though that is the avid thing a writer must do is keep you in so much suspense that you are dying for more and more. I personally like how Robert Jordan has captivated me and kept me awestruck with his marvelous depictions of each character and his flawless description of them as well. I have journeyed with Egwene, Nynaeve,the Daughter Heir of Andor, Matt, Perrin, and Rand. What i most admired was how Moiraine captured all them up and took them (so to say) on the journey of ther life. I was quite disappointed when Moiraine was supposedly killed by Lanfear but I don't really think she is dead. I think she is between the worlds. Some where in Telaranrhoid. The World of Dreams. I have felt each one's pain, fear, struggles, and most of all their anger as with Nynaeve. I can relate with her the most. I have put up the biggest block around myself that no one can get through. But as with Nynaeve her love for Lan is helping her break the barrier. I also liked it when she was able to heal someone who had been stilled.A Corwn of Swords it self. I'll have to admit that R. J. seems to be dragging it out and there is so little about the plot that you question his writing sometimes. But i find that is what captivates me the most I have read the series 5 times in the last 2 years that I started on the series but I do this to keep up so that when he comes out with the next book that I can devour it as I have the others. I am an avid reader I love to read and R.J. has me spellbound I can finish one of his books in three nights of reading about 6 hours a night.I know I am dragging on but I leave with this note. For those who are spellbound as I am you won't complain about the time between books you will look at it with self transfixed awe."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I don't know abot most of you people, but I think this is the best series I have ever read. I don't say that lightly either because all I read is science-fiction/ fantesy! Ok, this book does get a little slow at times but that only helps the plot line! A book does not have to be action all the time! In fact if it was, it would be boring byond belief! Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but this book is the best book I have ever read!! Ok, now you probably wonder why I think it's so wonderful. For the simple reason that Robert Jordan made the story beliveable. The characters feel terrible if they kill someone, and they feel the conflict that being in power puts a preson in. I would highly recomend this book to EVERYONE, even if they don't like fantsy. (P.S. Hey, RJ, speed it up please. I can't wait for the next book. Is it true that the next book is the last? Please say no!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have been reading Jordan for quite a number of years now and I have got to say that this book is the most dissapointing so far. The first four books moved right along developing the characters, plot and atmosphere. The last ones seem to have become stagnated and distant to the reader. Jordan needs to recapture the movement that he had in the first few books. He seems to have become caught up in metaphysical and political conundrums as opposed to further plot and character development. The lines have been drawn in the novel and it seems that people are sitting back and pondering their signifigance instead of doing anything about them. Though this was still not a bad read Jordan must find a way to make things more dynamic or he will his readership will sharply decline."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"What I want to know is why is Jordan slowing down? This volume took over a year longer to come out than the other books but it just seems like the piece of Lord Of Chaos that was chopped off. It didn't even have enough action in it. Egwene disappeared in the first part of the book. All in all it tended to plod until the last chapter where the Rand / Sammael fight took place. As it is a year after aCoS and Book 8 doesn't look set to be released until March, I must say I'm disappointed"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Seven down, another thirteen to go??

It does not always work the way we want it to and is not always filled with action scenes or neat conflict resolutions. It doesn't take one day to find a bowl in a city so why should it only take one page? I'm not saying it's perfect; characters are extremly developed in some aspects one dimensional in others... but considering what Jordan has already given us I don't have time to ask for more, I'm too busy enjoying what there is. I can't wait for the next book even if it's five years from now; there's certainly enough to go over in the seven books there are and I'ld rather a long wait then a book less than the best Jordan can offer."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Ohhh... this is one great book. Due to the supply at my library this was the THIRD of the series that I read and I loved it. Then I went back, read all the others, read this one again and same reaction. A point for the whole Wheel of Time series: I am a very fast reader and can read most books in less than a day. (I'm not exaggerating) I hardly ever buy books, I read them in the shop or get them from the library. This is the first series that I did buy, even after reading them all. Robert Jordan, congratulations, you have set a record! After reading a whole lot of reviews I want to comment on various people's complaints. 1) The characters are immature - Of course they are, most of them are still in their teens. They are young men and women forced to grow up and are doing better than most of the adults in their work, but this does not erase the fact that they ARE young. 2) The books are getting boring - No they're not, end of subject. 3) The gaps between books are too long - Do you want quantity or quality? If you think you can do a better job, go ahead and try. I do have one quibble, though. Maybe because of being rushed, Jordan is neglecting some of his characters. In the first few books Nynaeve was one of my favourites, but in ACOS and parts of the others she is getting stereotyped. We know she argues with Elayne and Mat, no need to repeat it all the time! Mat himself is getting boring with his evading responsibility - Although the scenes with Queen Tylin were funny. And I loved that part where Elayne gets the better of all the Aes Sedai and Kin in the place... Conclusion: This is the best fantasy series I've read in some time, maybe ever, and considering how fast I read that says a lot. Keep writing, RJ, you're doing great."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After reading this book, I feel as if something has been left out and that I was cheated. I think this comes from reading the other 6 books in the series which make book 7 pale in comparison to them. This book does drag on a bit and could use more excitement like Rand battleling a forsaken, aiel fighting aiel, etc, etc. I by no means want to see a book cover to cover filled with battles but those types of things do break up the monotony of the long drawn out plots that RJ seems so fond of. In conclusion.. while not as great as any of the others this book is still a must buy for any WoT or Jordan fan."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan does it again!

If it's too long, stop reading! (as others have said as well) Personally, I enjoy Jordan's drawn out style (get my money's worth). If you're the kind of person that likes to pay twenty-five dollars for a two hundred page book, fine. I'd rather pay the same twenty-five and get 600 to 800 pages of complex dramatic, humourous, engaging reading."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With any lengthy series you must expect some form of deterioration in regards to quality. As is the case with Jordan's &quot;A Crown of Swords.&quot; But I didn't expect it to fall so dramatically. The editing was dreadful and the plot had little to be desired. Jordan seems to have lost interest in finishing this series or he hasn't been spending the time on this series that he should be because of other obligations. The first couple of books in this series were so good that I literally couldn't put them down. This book was just the opposite. I read it just to pass some time. The only thing that saved this book from getting a zero on my chart was Jordan's ability to make the words jump right out and give me a vivid picture in my mind. Unfortunately I have this need (more like a curse in this case) to finish reading a series to the end. The way things look it seems I am going to be living through a slow death. I was truly disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think that this book is a great book.

However it wasnt a suprise on how he acted on those occasions.Returning to Rand there is no way Jordan could have it better(other than adding Aviendha and Elayne to the whole mess in Carhein) and how he dealt with the rebellion in (where else)Carhein was ingenius.It is the GREAT!

Before I read previous installments of this series, I would take the time to go back and read all of the books leading up to it so that I could keep details of the intricate plotlines fresh in my mind for when I delved into the next. However, this time that wasn't necessary. The plot seems to be wandering and has lost its focus. It's not as exciting as it used to be and doesn't entice the avid reader to tear through it from cover to cover. In the past, I wasn't able to put the books down; however, I have easily been able to table reading this volume for weeks, even months at a time.For those of you who, like me, were hooked at your first glance through Eye of the World, you'll want to buy this because it's not that bad.

Several of the major storylines were not addressed. (How can you leave us hanging, Mr. Jordan?) The book was short.

Quite simply, he is the BEST fantasy author in the world to date. Jordan took over from where David Eddings left off, in creating an epic fantasy series set in a real and authentic world. Reading his books transports you into his world and you establish a link with it. You come to care for the characters and their plights, to relate to them and their wants, needs and aspirations. This is not your run-of-the-mill sword and sorcery, it has heart and depth. If you ask me I am tired of the same atypical books on the market today.

The Great Hunt was also wonderful, as was The Dragon Reborn and my personal favorite, The Shadow Rising.Then, all of a sudden, kaboom....the last three volumes have ground this once-great series to a halt. Some won't admit it, but it's true. I'm actually questioning whether these volumes came from the same author. Lots of pages, lots of details, but little of consequence or interest. The problem many of us have (based on several other reviews I have read) is that we've all been sucked into the series by the earlier volumes and feel obligated to see this thing through to its conclusion (which, incidentally, may not happen in our li! fetimes).I recently read George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones and Guy Gavriel Kay's A Song for Arbonne. One is destined to become a great epic series, the other is a great single-volume epic. What impressed me about both of these books is how there is no waste or tedium in the telling. They are interesting and absorbing throughout. I don't like the idea of criticizing Robert Jordan, because I honestly consider him a genius. All I'm saying is that about halfway through the WOT series, the flavor that initially made it great just sort of disappeared."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book was magnificent...even going along with the high standard of the first six books. Robert Jordan takes you even deeper into his wonderful world of fantasy. This book makes you wonder in a way that you dont want to put it down. I loved the great read of this book.

Its intricate plot keeps you want to read and learn more."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am a hard core fan of RJ. I have read the whole series through 23 times and still find new things every time. What I had trouble with in this book was, how much stuff was left hanging.

Aside from what RJ left hanging at the end I think the book was great."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I've read the entire Wheel of Time series 4 times. I stayed up, bleary eyed and very caffinated, 3 days straight reading his first 3 books. Now that was some good reading! The next couple books were good, but I could put them down. Crown of Swords was just there. It didn't excite me, but I must say, it still far surpassed many other well acclaimed authors. I'd recommend it only to keep up with the story line."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The best of the series. previous books lacked plot and drive and were often tedious.

There are those that complain about it being boring and non focused but that's not true. Think about it this way : The whole series is expected to be at LEAST 13 books long. The plot can be summerized as this, characters set out on adventure/quest (to defeat the &quot;bad guy&quot;, the Dark One) , they get ready and there is a final battle. Right now some readers seem to feel that the book has no focus. That is because the character are getting ready for the last battle now. The characters themselves are trying to unify the world.Let there be no doubt that Robert Jordan has created the best fantasy series ever (O.K. , then there's Tolkein)."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I'm sure that by now someone writting a reviews that will say it's the best book so far and that i'm a loser and blah blah blah...well you no what..i don't care...if you want to say it's the best book in the world..well say it...but don't try to undermine our opinion... I've been reading fantasy now for 14 years and i can't remember how many books i've read...that doesn'T make me the god of the review but let just say that i have a background that help.... Now for the reviews...well it's long...too long...way too long..if you look at the series you will see that it's getting harder and harder to make yourself finish the book...i had to start again 2 times with the fifth...three times with number 6 and i don't know how many times with the last...but i can assure you..i've talk to my fellows reader and everyone agree with me...we know Rand getting mad...(for a long times now)...so let's stop talking about it..get mad and be done!!!I don't care now if he lose the final batlle..at least it will be a surprise... So that's it..if you want to buy it..go ahead but let me tell you first...the first quarter of the books is good that after that be ready to croos a long desert where there his no action (you know the i-cannnot-stop-reading-just-one-more-page..)..if you pack lot's of water and make it to the last quarter...you will be pleased..it's filled with action....hope the number 8 will be the last..even tolkien knew when to stop...."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book goes nowhere, slowly. Am I the only one who, after reading &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;, got the distinct impression that Jordan has NO idea where he is going with the series? I hope I an proven wrong, but it looks to me as if Jordan has no clue as to how he is going to resolve the series, and wrote this latest offering as a stop-gap measure, designed to buy himself some time.I may be wrong, but given that &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; came out in 1996, and it is now 1998, I think it is not too far a strech to think that Jordan just CAN'T DECIDE where he wants to take us. Not having a wide enough imagination can be DEATH for a professional fiction writer, but oftentimes having TOO great of an imagination has it's own pitfalls. I, for one, hope that Robert Jordan's next offering will be akin to the first four books of the series, and offer a feeling of destination to the reader; &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; just has too much of a &quot;busy work&quot; feel for my liking."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Lighten Up.

Hey, I thought, atleast I can finally find out some more of the storyline. Well apparently plot wasn't a priority in A Crown of Swords and neither was following up on the loose ends left over from the last novel. This book seemed to be more focused on pointless descriptions that have literally no place in this book and the more and more frequent sexual escepades. The story has sunk down to some awful soap opera, that like soap operas never seems to end. Well atleast the soaps have some intresting turns, but this book goes absolutely nowhere except for the last few pages where Rand just up and fights a Forsaken. Is Rand ever going to fight the Final Battle or is Jordan going to kick the bucket first?

I loved the length and the depth of the characters. I am not complaing about how long the books are or that the story will go on for a long time. I am complaining becuase this book could be removed from the series and I don't think anyone would miss it. This is not Jordan's usual work. In previous books he seemed to dwell too long on some details but the story moved. My plan is to wait for book 8 to come out and then give it to my brother who just started the series without ever giving him Crwon of Swords. I am willing to bet with anyone that he won't even notice that it is missing."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"For those of you that complain about the books being to long you have obviously lost all your attention span by sitting on your couch watching T.V.

The characters are interesting detailed and for a change not all things end happily."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Iwould like to say that first of all I am a rather strong woman who considers herself a feminist. If anyone would like Robert Jordan's attempts at creating intelligent, tough women it would be me. Unfortunately, I find his female characters annoying. Women are much more complicated and we don't always gang up against men. I find all the women rather nasty bitches who are constantly engaged in other people's bussiness. Also, if these girls are really country girls they wouldn't be so hung up on sex. My family, until this generatioin, all worked on farms, or owned their own farms. I know from my grandmother and her sisters stories that most people of her era where surprisingly down to earth and realistic about sex. Maybe, probably not likely, Robert Jordan will add some varity to these women in the next book, and make them a little less narrow minded and judgemental."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This was by far the worst book of the series. I first read The Eye of the World way back in 1990, I was 10 YEARS OLD!!! Now as we enter into 1998 I wonder if Jordan will ever finish this series before the year 2000. I have had to re-read the series each time a new book comes out to stay on top of things since Jordan writes so damn slow. I think I will just skip this book when I reeread the series. Does anyone know when book #8 will appear in the stores? If it isn't better I quit! I have learned I valuable lesson from this series, wait till the author decide to finish before reading."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This book had to have been the best Robert Jordan book so far.

An epic of this proportion has to include the details or it will not be realistic. The length of the series is welcome. It becomes a story of lives, rather than a few months, or one adventure. The WOT is the most &quot;realistic&quot; fantasy I've ever read, and the intricacy of the series is what makes it so great.As for nothing significant happening in Book 7? What about the Bowl of the Winds? What about Rand gathering in the Sea Folk? A Forsaken going down? The attack of the Seanchan on Ebou Dar? Mat's fate left in question. Logain healed and escaped.It seems like a lot of important things happened. And it is definitely a great set-up for the next book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Robert Jordan is continuing with an immpressive series. However, I believe that he has to get to the end of the series soon. From some of the reviews I just read, some readers are getting bored.His last book was pretty good. I was dissapointed that he doesn't bring the series a little farther ahead. He seems to be dragging it on, just to see how many books he can get out.I like the idea of the ghuolm (well the guy near the end that hunts people that can channel). Who is the man that Rand meets in before he kills Sammual? I have so many questions that are going unanswered.The book was great and I look forward to the next. I believe it is called the Throne of Daggers, which is comming out in the fall. Can't wait."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is one of the greatest series out there. Now, I agree that Robert Jordan can be a bit wordy now and then, but I think that adds reality to the story. CoS is not, I have to say, the best one of the series. I personally liked LoC (Lord of Chaos). CoS is great, however, because it leaves you in suspence. You don't know what's happened to Mat, Perrin seems to have disappeared for a while, Sammael may be dead, but then you never know. Of course, this is also infuryating because the 8th book seems to be taking forever to get here. I would highly reccomened this book to anyone who likes sci-fi or fantasy becaue this is another Tolkin type story, if not better one."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"1: Tolkien Vs. Jordan? How can you compare the founder of the movement with one of the newer generation? Why would you want to? Of course the up and coming guys are going to be better ( sometimes) I think it is a testament to the Genius of Tolkien's work that anyone would want to gauge the next generation against him. 2; the first 4 books were great, they moved fast, developed engrossing character, scenery and plot, and just plain entertained me. Book 5 slipped a little by getting a bit more talky and less active. All I can say about book six is that I don't remember much, except some relatively undeveloped characters suddenly took over the plot , possibly in an attempt to rekindle some of the lost fire. Book 7. well, bring on book 8, I hope we start to wrap this up soon y'all. Rand has become a little less than a character I would root for, I think Perrin is wholely underdeveloped, Nyneave and Matt are great to read about, as is the Seanchan ally ( her name escapes me now, I guess I have to go back and re-read also) I guess, basically, book 8 better get back to the enthusiasm and action of the first 3 or 4 or I think it will be time to hang up this series and move on to something a little more focused."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Not up to the standards of the earlier WOT books, Jordan still manages to tell a cohesive story that draws us marginally closer to his tale's gotterdammerung. Unfortunately, he is becoming more and more trapped by his love of irrelevant detail. Part of the wonder of a fantasy world are the stories that aren't told, that lie in the background to add color and depth. By telling us every detail of his entire world, this sense of wonder and fantasy is diffused. I'm starting to feel like Sisyphus, pushing the boulder up the hill only to find that another side-quest or side-issue has left me further from resolution of the story. By the way, why do so many reviewers of this book admit that its not as good as previous installments, but rate it a &quot;10&quot;. Is it perhaps because they give any WOT book a &quot;10&quot;, regardless of its merits? As for me, I'll finish out the series because I started it, but if I would have known in advance where it now sits, I wouldn't have bothered."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I started reading WoT 12 monts ago but i read books 3-7 in the last month, i just couldnt get enough of this series, ive read a lot of good series in my time like Shannara, Memory Sorrow &amp; thorn,Magic of Recluse , Artifacts of power daughter of the empire etc etc etc but none has ever hooked me like this.The first book was good but the 2nd &amp; third slowed a bit AcoS was good but it didnt seem like that much was acomplished. I agree that Robert Jordan put a bit too much emphesis on strong female characters, (not that that detracts greatly from the book but its always nice to have a mix with a few more &quot;vulnerable females&quot; the male lead characters also end up acting the fool too often which is ok early in a series but they should become a lot more mature as it continues and by book 7 they should be a lot further along than Rand, Mat and Perrin are.

Jordan packs his characters to the gills, I know more about the children from &quot;Manetheren&quot; than I really want to, but I find it impossible to skip any word. The fact that the males are completely wrong about their friends abilities in the &quot;courting department&quot; and the females complete mis-reading of their counterparts intentions etc. is a &quot;dead to rights&quot; interpretation of a village upbringing (I was born and raised in an English village of 800 population). My one complaint is of the repetition that Mr Jordan seems to think we need in order to understand his characters. But what characters! They are all unique and gifted, naive but learning quickly. My favorite chapters involve the swashbuckling and the sorcery, and not forgetting the diabolical intrigue. I would definitely rank this work with Tolkien in caliber, I have been reading SF for around 30 years and love many styles, the writers that &quot;hold me&quot; and bring me anxiously back to the pages are the three mentioned on this page. Thank you Robert, &quot;The Crown of Swords&quot; pulled me along and of course left me panting for more. I can't wait to face the Seanchan and &quot;see&quot; Mat Cauthon dragged from the rubble.

Though it is not my favourite book of the series, FoH and LoC actually are, I still found it unbelievable. David Eddings, Tad Williams, Stephen Donaldson and of course Tolkien, used to be my favourite fantasy writers, but no more! For those of you idiots out there, CoS is a setup for book 8 and those following. Another reader said it and I agree, that turning point came in book six and that seven was a setup for the ride to the finish. Also, don't compare him to Tolkien. They are two totally different writers, from other eras and time periods. I love Mat and Min and Moirraine. I hope Rand and Min end up together since she is the only one of the three women who does not try to change him or control him. I wish Moirraine would make her appearance in 8. Call me silly, but I also felt kind of sorry for Lanfear. She is completely evil, yes. But if you pay attention, you'll notice that she was not always that way, and that her obsessive love for LTT, chose her path for her. Lastly, hurry RJ, if you can.

At the Shadow Rising it started being rather dull with the same story going over and over again and now when the 7th book of the series has come, I begin to despair that it will not end. Never doubt, I love the series but I think Jordan will lose a lot of readers if he does not wrap this series up very soon.As to the many comments from women that Jordan writes very flat and boring female characters, I would leap to his defence by saying that it is not as easy as it might seem for a man to write a believable female character. As Jordan himself (in the voice of any number of his (male) characters) say &quot;I will never understand women&quot;. I do not believe it is possible for a man to create a convincing woman in writing.

I've been a big RJ fan for several years now, gobbling up the books as they came out. For the longest time I was a Wheel of Time fanatic with the best of them. Then, you know what? I grew up. I read other fantasy books, and realized, no, WOT is not the best out there. It's not the greatest world ever created. The characters aren't incredibly well done, or even well done at all in most cases. All that said, I still think books 1, 2, and 4 are among the most entertaining fantasies I've read. However, 6 and 7 have fallen terribly.The Wheel of Time was never great literature (face it - comparisons with Tolkien are ludicrous; all you need is one look to see that Tolkien's command of language is supreme, and RJ ripped *so* much from the Lord of the Rings; examples: Padan Fain is analogous to Smeagol/Gollum; the Nym are analogous to the Ents; Perrin's return to the Two Rivers is analogous to the &quot;Scourging of the Shire&quot;; etc., etc.), but it's always been entertaining. Yes, books 6 and 7 are still pretty fun to read, but not nearly as gripping. It took me a week to read book 7! Having finished books 1 through 5 in no more than two days apiece, and book 6 in three, that really says something. When I reread the series I found A Crown of Swords almost boring at times. Coming from a fan like me, that's harsh criticism.Why did I find it boring? Too much filler, too few happenings. Nothing is resolved questionable argument to say the least.For true fantasy, I suggest the average WoT fanatic should broaden his/her horizons and pick up Tolkien, or maybe Donaldson (just finished the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant - wow!), or even Wolfe. For purely entertaining fantasy, the Wheel of Time is still wonderful, but George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones has taken the trophy away.

A HUGE scene involving Egwene conniving her way slowly into more power could have been cut to ribbons in order to restore the pace and development of the first four books. The same with pointless scenes such as the bath, or the endless details as to irrelevant minutae of characters lives. The first four books were NOT like this, and one gets the feeling that Jordan may be trying to stretch such plot as he has left into as many books as possible. The women? A description of Myrdraal from LOC describes Jordans women fitly : &quot;As alike as though cast in one mould&quot;. They have become like thinking, like talking, like acting, annoying cliches. They were alright early on but are showing signs of being too stretched, too generally tired. And the endings : each book ends with the good guys win, the bad guys lose. For an adults book, that is VERY superficial, and reminds me of cartoons I used to watch as a kid. It fails to represent the tragedy of war, and the strength of evil. Just once I would like to see an evil guys plan actually work (gasp!). As it is, as soon as one is revealed there is no excitement watching it unfold because you know it will fail : it always does. Many fantasy books achieve very powerful moments when developed good guys die fighting for their cause. But no, all the developed good guys follow a pattern : start single, have romance, win battles, all survive and presumably live fairytale lives. That is where its headed now, but I hope it can find some less predictable developments before it is too late."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Between September of 1994 and before the end of february of 1995, I read the first six books. They were amazing!! I loved them!! I loved the characters, the world, and EVERYTHING in them!!!! Then, just over a year later, this came out. I waited year for the eighth book, so i could read them together, but it never came out, so i read a crown of swords. Unfortunately, I understood very little of anything that was going on. And now, another year later, the next book still isnt out. Robert Jordan has created an amazing series, but he has gotten too carried away. There are too many plots, subplots, character, lands, peoples. In short, he has created his own little world. It might have worked, and if you decide to read this series, read it all together, but RJ spends way too much time between books. And unfortunately for him, a readers interest cannont be sustained for 10 or so years when there are other authors who atleast give 1 book a year, and they create amazing worlds too. At one time, for books 1-4, this story was unbelievable. In books 5 it slipped, and in Lord of Chaos, it slipped even further. The end of Lord of Chaos made the entire book worth while, though. However, a Crown of Sword has absoutely nothing of value in it. The is so much in this series, and so many things start to happen, you stop caring about each individual event. And individual events are what books are based on. In short, I am likely going to continue to read this series, but only when it is completed, and then i will start from the beginning, and see if i can recapture the love i once had for this series."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is one of the best series I have read.

The book's various story lines pick up where they left off in the previous volume, Lord of Chaos, and either continue or come to a conclusion that quickly leads to a new one taking its place and either bringing together or separating the large cast of characters. Unlike the previous installment, A Crown of Swords seems to be better paced as Jordan stuck with a story line for several chapters in a row until it came to an appropriate place to transition to another story line or for the next book. Throughout the book, a variety of character developments take place with the most important happening with Nynaeve followed by Mat and Rand.There were a few things that were somewhat of a drag, mostly the usual complaints one hears from longer time fans like in-depth detail on clothing, hair pulling by a certain character, the interactions of various women with one another, etc. The one that continues to be a personal problem to me is that the climax at the end of the book seems rushed with all of it occurring during the last chapter of the book. But since these \\"problems\\" or complaints have been present throughout the series an objective reader does get use to it.Overall, A Crown of Swords is a good read and I recommend you continue reading The Wheel of Time series with this book."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"My family and I LOVE the Wheel of Time Series, and needed Book 7 to listen to while traveling. We have all of the books on CD and highly recommend this series which consists of 13+ books to date. This is great reading, and with the CD option, a great listening experience as well! These books are incredibly well written, well read by the narrators, and my family would recommend them to anyone who loves Tolkien, or any other Science Fiction/Fantasy stories. My son got the the first book \\"Wheel of Time - Eye of the World\\" when he was a young boy about 12 to travel to California from Texas and back to read on the plane. He was hooked for life! :-D He's 30 years old now and just as passionate about Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series. My husband is very busy and has long commutes and so I bought him the first of the books on unabridged CD about 2 years ago. He was hooked and has just finished the last book available on CD in the past month. He loves the stories! YOU will love this story! By the way, the man and woman who share the narration of these books are OUTSTANDING as readers/narrators - their diction is perfect, they give emotion when it's appropriate - they make the story come alive! They should receive an award because we've never heard better in any genre! Have fun!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords is book 7 of 14 in The Wheel of Time series. A Crown of Swords is oft-criticized for covering only a very small sliver of time (11 days) from several different POVs. Which is, on its face, a perfectly valid criticism. But Dumai's Wells was a Big Deal. It had to have reverberations. One thing that Vietnam veteran Jordan does as well or better than any other writer, including writers consciously trying to write anti-war stories, is to show the psychological consequences of man killing man. We were not built to do such things, and Jordan knows it; not merely on an academic level, but on a personal level.A Crown of Swords has its weaknesses as a whole, but has some great individual moments. It has one of my favorite scenes--in the throne room upon Rand's return. It has one of the funniest chapters in the entire series--Perrin's thoughts on Saldean farm girls and Rand repeatedly saying Berelain's name (Perrin, by the way, makes an excellent comedic straight man). It has my favorite line of the entire series--a character with prodigious drinking ability is described as having a \\"hollow leg and a hole in the bottom of his foot.\\" It has, I believe, the first POV from Avienda, showing off Jordan's inimitable talents at putting us into the head of someone from an utterly foreign culture. Mat (my favorite character) and Ebou Dar (perhaps my favorite city) are featured heavily.A Crown of Swords is just the sort of book to evoke strong and disparate reactions from fans. Yes, there are the aforementioned Crowning Moments of Awesome. But then there is the lurching halt to the pace. And A Crown of Swords is very heavy on plots upon which Your Mileage May Vary (many of which, sadly, continue for multiple books). It's not that I don't dislike much about those plotlines--I do--but for this book at least they pale beside the great stuff. A Crown of Swords also features the introduction of Cadsuana, whose awesomeness as a hero is unfortunately neatly subsumed by her terribleness as a person.The original cover art is hideous. The new, e-book art is much better.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!'

A darker book than others in the series but you have to consider that the plot is getting more and more complicated."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"A Crown of Swords written by Robert Jordan reveals a wonderful story about the battle against the dark one in a medieval world filled with magic and dark creatures. This book seems to focus on Rand Al'Thors building hatred and ditrust of the Aes Sedai and by the end Rand conquers Illian and despises any and all Aes Sedai. Robert Jordan weaves a fantastic tale around all the main characters. I was not able to put the book down and give it five stars."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"It's been many years since I started to read the incomplete series, and hadn't thought to much about it since Mr Jordan passed. I recently decided to read the latest 2 books and thought I should read the entire series again since it has been so long, and I must admit I had forgotten how good the story truely is. Jordan does a wonderful job developing his characters and I find myself completely immersed in the story. This is a well written story, well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; feels more like a sequel than any of his other books. Some character stories get mini resolutions such as Elayne's &amp; Aviendha's search for the weather bowl, but most only open doors to new and more complex issues. I actually enjoyed this installment more than the last, my only issue with the book was a hasty and neat ending that I'm not sure if I believe is true. Of course you can never be sure of anything in Jordan's world, but here I just felt it wrapped up a little too neatly in the end."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I think this was a more humorous book in the Wheel of Time series. Mat and Nynaeve are ALWAYS fun to read about, and they had the most screen time in this book. Or almost the most, anyway. As usual, there were several different plotlines, but Jordan had a different approach this time - he spent the first half of the book with Egwene and her Aes Sedai, and the second half consisted mostly of Nynaeve/Elayne/Mat in Ebou Dar. Rand gets some screen time in both parts, of course.There are several \\"dark\\" moments (especially at the end...), several plot twists and surprises, and many parts that made me laugh out loud. All in all, a very enjoyable book to read. And of course, what else would we expect out of The Wheel of Time, right?But...come on!! First Moiraine, and now....I won't spoil it, but it would appear that yet another main character has died at the end of this book. YEEAARRRGH! I'll quit reading the series pretty soon if Jordan doesn't stop killing off my favorite characters!But, seriously, do you really WANT this series to end? I was surprised to find out that some people are getting impatient, saying that it's lasting too long. I say that these people are very close-minded, or maybe SIMPLE-minded. Can't you see that there are so many characters and plots, the series ISN'T going to wrap up in just a few books? Maybe if it was ONLY about Rand, but..it's not. The Wheel of Time series is about an entire world, a world with it's own history and politics. It's about an entire cast of characters, and the parts they play in trying to save this world. And most of all, it's about the battle of Good and Evil. There is not a more timeless tale then that."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"With all due respect to the author, I'm glad that Jordan wrote this book because it finally jolted me out of my reverie and made me realize that he is nowhere near writing anything that I want to read. It's been very dissapointing to see the decline of this once-promising series.I recommend trying George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series if you want to see what a talented writer can do with a large group of complex, interesting characters.-Cal"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan continues to garner my interest in this seventh installment of the wheel of time. A Crown of Swords is the first wheel of time novel that I can remember not focusing almost entirely on Rand. In previous novels, Jordan writes other plots along with Rand's adventures, but in this novel Jordan seems to write Rand's adventures along with Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve, who I think were the focus of this novel. Perrin is hardly mentioned, and not much occurs with Egwene. Jordan places more emphasis on knowing the actions of Elaida and the Forsaken then in previous novels.What Happens. A new Aes Sedai is introduced, Cadsuane, I think. Min has a viewing of her, that makes me think we will be seeing much more of her in upcoming novels. Egwene is on the move, recruiting more men for her army. Mat, Elayne, and Nynaeve are in Ebou Dar. They spend months looking for a terangel that will fix the weather. Lan also reappears in this novel. Rand attempts to do stuff, but Jordan leaves us in doubt of any real conclusions. The Shaido are dispersed. Elaida learns the Black Tower is strong and of Al' Thor's escape, which is not good for her.Again, Jordan hints at Moraines reapperance. I think this novel was published six or seven years ago. This time the hint comes from Min saying her viewing about Moraine was the only one she was ever wrong about. The other hint that came about ten years ago was one of Egwenes dreams. This was still a strong novel, but the pace continues to slow and Jordan continues his trend of introducing new characters who annoy me."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"After picking up ACOS, the same feeling enveloped me that I had experienced when picking up the past six books: how was I going to ever get through all of this?After ACOS, I felt much the same after the past six; it felt much too short. Jordan has shown me the joy of experiencing a story that isn't regulated to a 30 minute episode, or the over-edited, market-segmented novel that reaches the golden 300 pages many publishers believe mass readers want to read. Jordan's books, like life, take many twists and turns, and what looked like a simple journey down a well-known path has turned out to be a difficult--though rewarding--adventure in a brand new world.Art imitates life, and Jordan works hard to make his characters both realistic, yet somehow, more evolved than the rest of us. The villans have redeeming qualities, the heros have flaws and weaknesses, and everyone in between live their lives based on their priorities. It doesn't seem too far fetched that any person in a similar situation could make the same choices of a forsaken, or a Dragon Reborn. And at the same time, the characters do more with what they have. They strive for what they believe, and surpass the obstacles that many do not.I applaud Jordan's work and encourage him not to give into the quick and easy ending, but to strive and work to surpass what he has already done. And, though it may bring shudders to many readers, it should be whispered that perhaps the best ending is no ending at all.Just like life."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I really enjoy RJ's work, but I, like many others wonder why he needs to repeat himself over and over. Or give us every single detail about even things that are not all that important. Myself, I really hope that there is only one book left and that RJ finishes it soon. And I pray that Kate Reading and Michael Kramer are still doing the unabridged audio CDs then too.Both Kate Reading and Michael Ramer, the narrators in this book on CD do a wonderful job. Both do a brilliant job of instilling life into the words written by Jordan that you don't actually mind too much when things repeated needlessly by the author. Each narrator's voice add rich dimension to each character so that you can keep track with ease who is saying what while retaining the intended point of view in the written text.The plot, as many other's have already reviewed doesn't move very fast in some sections and in the head, you are left wondering, why wasn't book 6 and 7 just made into one book and some of the needless stuff left out. We have enough character and plots/sub plots to last for the rest of the books. RJ doesn't need to add in more, but he does (Not only in this book but in the coming books).Some things I liked:Matt being chased by a queen of things as a play-toyNynaeve getting over her blockLan's return to NynaeveNynaeve and Lan's marriage - through really I would have liked to have more details about what happened during the actual \`wedding' aboard the seafolk ship and what vows made/etc.Some things I didn't like:Faile's temper and how Perrin reacts with this slow wittedness that borders on stupid at times. Yes, yes, big strong guy, doesn't like to hurt people, likes to think things out. Joy to you, but when is he going to learn that his wife wants him to have a bit of a temper around her. Show her, who's boss, etc. Get a little rough with her, she won't break.Elayne and Nynaeve's childish behaviors. Infact all the women seem to have this, almost foolish notation that they are always right even when it's proven they are not. Nynaeve was head of the women's circle back home. Elayne is supposed to be the daughter hair. These women are not children. Both should have learned, if not before the books started, then by now that everyone makes mistakes and that when you do the best thing to do is make amends and get on with life.Anything with Shaido(spelling) these people are annoying and really don't seem to be doing anything with the over all plot. If RJ plans to make these the group that survice the last battle, I'm going to be really annoyed. Many of the Aes Sedai are the same way, why the heck are we bothering with all these subplots that don't seem to do anything at all.And I'm starting to get annoyed without knowing certain things that would be good to know while being subjected to meaningless details about what people are wearing when we won't be seeing them again or if we do they are wearing something else that we get to hear about again.With the books on CD, all those little details that can be really annoying while reading are far more tolerable. Names and places are easier to keep track of, at least for me. Pop in the CD, listen while you drive, workout, or doing yard work without all that worry about.. \\"is this the same person from earlier, darn I can't remember how her/his name was spelled\\"I have all but book 8 and 9 on CD and prefer this media for enjoying RJ's work above any other.

Ugghh after 3 failed starts, the tech boom/bust, seven years in the Navy I completed it in 2004. Clocking in at 7 years its the longest read of my life. The funny thing is that by this time the popular mass had shifted. Ten years ago EVERYONE loved this series, hell so did I, but after Book 10.... lets just say RJ now had some detracters. The time away from the series allowed me to decompress and severely reduce my expectations for a Fantasy Series. We read these stories to escape from our lives and now that I'm older I can honestly say that I enjoy these stories more. In last month I read LoC and ACoS, and I agree that he does overdescribe scenes to there detriment but all in all his storytelling is ENTERTAINING."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is the fourth book in the Wheel of Time series that I have read back-to-back in trying to catch up. I feel it is written in the most muscular style of any of the books in this series since The Great Hunt, moving briskly without compromising the established approach of heavy world development. I liked that about this one. In this book, also, I was thrilled to see Mr. Jordan surprise me in an unexpected way: he cracked the stubborn facade of one of his leading men, and it seemed to have given the character pause, for growth. In what is probably one of the most suspenseful, imaginative and well-choreographed trials of peril for anyone in the series, we see one of the Seafolk's ships sink under fire, taking Nynaeve down with it. What happens then? Read the book. Few passive scenes exist in it, although the book has its courtly intrigues and road-trips. In earlier books, scenes like this might have cooled the reader's heels. It ain't so, here. I enjoyed this book, and I think it gives hope to Robert Jordan's faithful readers."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Firstly, don't even bother with this review or any of the others if you havent read any of the previous books in the series. Its so complex (in terms of number of characters etc) that long standing WoT readers often have trouble keeping up. Secondly, if you are thinking of writing a review then please, please, please do not give away any plot points. Its very annoying!This book, in my opinion, mantains Jordans high standards and is an improvement on the last book. Once more the pace is slow and you need to be prepared for this. It won't suit all people no matter how detailed a world he is building up this way. Personally I love this. It makes a marvellous contrast to other books such as the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson. Both are different but excellent in their own ways. Its good to read books of variety in pacing.However, Jordan did get a little bogged down occasionally in the last book which I would give 4 stars for this reason. Crown of swords is different. I never once felt that a passage was unneccessary and all the detail simply added up to paint a wonderful picture of another world.Some would say tht nothing happens in much of this book. I disagree, we see a subtle developments in character interaction particualrly between Mat, Elayne and Nynaeve, the intruduction of new elements to the world (true source for example) as well as a cliff-hanger of an ending. This all serves to set us up nicely for not only the next book but the rest of the series.The aforementioned character development helps to negate the fact that Jordan still uses descriptions of Nynaeve tugging her braid, thinking all men are dumb etc. This is because you can see that these developments are leading us away from this. Hence me saying earlier that there are no wasted words. Without this, I would have begun to have become fed up with this but Jordan, skilled writer that he is has advanced things at just the right time.So basically if you love the series then you will love this. It has many classic Jordan moments that stir the soul (a'la dumai wells!). If you are beginning to tire of things then please give it a chance as hopefully you will see the advancements that take place to make this one of the great achievments of fantasy literature.

Many of the reviews would have made me reconsider, because I've seen some of the things in earlier books of the series. That is to say the slow downs and seemingly meaningless running around and smoothing skirts.I'm happy to say I did not get that impression from this book.This books shows Rand as growing in power, ability and intelligence. Not to meantion being able to conjure up good strategies. While all the same being naive and vulnerable in many ways.Mat finally starts to get some respect from those besides the band of the hand, and saves some very disrepectful butts in the process.Elayne and Nynaeve come to respect Mat even if Nynaeve respect is grudgingly.Anoying Padan Fain is still out there, but what's his real purpose. The Seanchan are starting to conquer lands again. The All Mighty Children of the Light are having difficulties to say the least. The Black Ajah get a couple of new weapons how will they use them. Not to meantion some of them get a good spanking as needed. The Shaido get tricked by the Forsaken, but we only know of some of their fate.All of this builds plenty of suspense as well of twists and intrigue in the plots.

His story is involved, convoluted and strong. For six books it has been unwavering, dragging at times, but still holding true to the course of the tale, continually weaving events and people back together, setting up the future and growing from the past. Just about the half way point of this book, Jordan blows that. He sets the story aside to go after something he wants to pursue. Granted, it is the author's prerogative to decide what to write in his book, but this blatant disregard for the story is sickening. Especially after such great effort to stay true to the story. I cannot stomach what has happened here. The confrontation between Rand and Cadsuane does not hold true to the story as it has progressed, or Rand's character, even what he is thinking or saying just pages before. Does Jordan think we are idiots and won't notice? Is this a blatant attempt to drag out the Wheel of Time so he can get more sales?

I like the series. It's very good, however Jordan fill 853 pages, but doesn't say much. I'm hooked on the series, but it seems that Jordan is introducing unnecessary obstacles. It also seems that he has too many irons in the fire. He develops a variety of different plots around each of the characters, but has a tendency of leaving them on hold for a book or two. There didn't seem to be any direction in this book. The end seemed too abrupt and tacked on, almost as if Jordan realized he had met his personal quota for pages. I like the series, but this book doesn't seem to add much to the overall plot. My suspicion is that Jordan is milking the money cow. If you're this far in the series you'll read the book anyway, of course. The book does have some satisfying moments with Elayne, Mat, and Nynaeve, which is where the focus of this particular novel seems to be. I think more attention should be spent on Rand, I also wish that Jordan wouldn't knock down a character once he or she gains some measure of power. (How are they supposed to take on the epitome of evil if they do not have superior capabilities). Jordan has made them more powerful on a one on one basis, but it seems there is always some counterbalance to every step each character makes in their progression."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"First off, I just want to say that I LOVED the first four books of this series, and I really liked books 5 and 6.

I got through some 200 pages and found that I couldn't read any further. It was terrible! A month later I tried to pick up where I left off, moving along another 50 pages or so before I started to feel nauseous. Only recently have I been able to force myself through the entire thing just so I could finally move on to the next book, Path of Daggers. Why did I hate it so much? For one thing, it felt to me like the main characters were just repeating the same lines over and over again from previous books, and the story simply wasn't progressing. So many questions were raised in previous books without even being addressed here, and there are SO many characters now, ninety percent of whom seem irrelevant to the big picture. Do I have to know the name, shoe size and favorite color of ALL Aes Sedai, Wise Women, Asha'man, Atha'an Miere, and every other living soul who has ever stepped foot in Rand's world?

So I read the darned thing again. My conclusion: I was being NICE the first time! A flaw in the Pattern? Hah! How about a gash, a rip, a total mutilation! Even the stuff that seemed so amazing the first time, like Mat\`s relationship with the 'girls' and the stunning opening scenes of the book, are totally drowned out by the awful stuff. And there\`s plenty. No, I am not WHINING about the length of the series--even if I am so petty as to want to know the outcome of the Last Battle before I die--but length has to be justified by the quality of the content. While the earlier books weren\`t perfect, they were beautiful, and I devoured them at the speed of light. I don\`t even want to think about the money I threw away for this piece of junk. I needn\`t get into the fact that the bulk of the descriptions were unnecessary and boring as heck--it\`s been mentioned even by those who feel this book is God\`s gift to planet Earth. But I can\`t believe I used to think RJ wasn\`t the type to stoop to soap opera scenes to impress the morons and sex-starved teenagers in the peanut gallery. The scene with Rand and Min was so forced, contrived, and downright dumb, it sounded like it was coming from a first-time author with marriage problems ('Oh Rand, I need WARM flesh'--spare us, please--I\`ll watch The Bold and the Beautiful if I want to see corny romances enacted). They were so artificial, if you hit them with a piece of styrofoam they\`d both fall over. Min, dazzled by Rand\`s fabulous eyebrows, can\`t stop thinking about him or making slutty remarks to him for two seconds--an instance where it becomes painfully obvious a man wrote this, a man with a case of wishful thinking. If only, oh if only women would do what they\`re supposed to do--moon over men and make themselves available at every possible opportunity.....or so, I suppose, runs the male mentality, at least judging from this book. Robert Jordan can\`t possibly expect anyone with intelligence to take the relationships seriously, not when the deepes expression of love is kisses stolen in corners. Notice there is seldom that good old-fashioned technique for developing relationships--anyone remember dialogue? As for the scenes with Tylin.....anyone who thinks that rape, just because it\`s in the reverse, is funny, is a pervert. Period. I\`m predicting (and I hope I\`m wrong) that the same thing is going to happen again, only with Elayne and Rand with Aviendha holding the knife, and in that case I\`ll probably end up quitting this series. The women in general have become shallow stereotypes, and while people seem to think they\`re expressive of feminist views, actually it\`s just the opposite. Women don\`t sit around thinking about how unearthly beautiful their boyfriends are ( Guess what, guys? Most women don\`t even care much about looks at all. If they did, the world wouldn\`t be populated) and Rand with three women dangling on his shoulder is one of the most sexist plot devices ever encountered by this reviewer. Lastly, I was amused at the comments praising the GREAT PLOT, when I hadn\`t even noticed, even after twice reading it, that there *was* a plot. In comparison to the other books, which had plots intricate as any tapestry, this thing is little more than a loose thread. And frayed at the edges for good measure."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"Jordan's world is full of opportunities for action, epic battles, intrigue, power politics, yet hardly anything happens. I don't subscribe to the theory that he's simply milking the series - I think the problem is, he wants to write about a dynamic, living and breathing world, where any given week every single character reacts to events around them, instead of appearing only when they're needed to carry the plot on. He describes his method of writing chapters as going into the characters skins - rooting for them, being \\"on their side\\" and treating them fairly and equally whether good or evil - while it does create an illusion of a complex and detailed world, going trough 15 different characters equals 20 chapters of pondering the situation from that characters' point of view. Jordan simply likes his characters a little too much to actually advance the story.After 15 chapters and 500 pages of nothing but pondering the future he realizes something must actually happen, and rushes the ending as he did with LoC and now here. OK - he should be financially pretty secure by now and being an artist he can write what the heck he likes, put up or shut up. Vote with your money, appears he don't care either way. So while he's \\"in the zone\\" 80% of time enjoying his time, his readership get bored, complain and quit.I consider myself patient - half of book 5 was sheer torture with the redicilous circus bicker/cleavage -fest but I just barely managed trough it without skipping entire chapters. Book 6 was thoroughly slow and the 30 last pages just didn't make up for it but at least you felt the story was going somewhere - MUST go, but it didn't. Spending some 50 pages to Mat's march south anticipating attack on Illian and canceling the show was the height of folly.To be fair, Jordan does improve all the time in some things. Book 4 introduced humor to the series. Book 7 the male-female crap is much less dominant, thank light. He even makes jokes about Nynaeve's braidpulling. But I had serious trouble finishing this book at all, after already witnessing the impossible with book 6 - hardly anything happening with so many pages. So I no longer had the useful faith into Jordan's judgement.I bought books 1-5 and I'm getting the rest from library, will stick with the series but with the reviews of book 10, I doubt anything happens in book 11 either. Jordan is currently taking us to Tarmon Gaidon \\"by latest\\" book 13 - I suspect the climactic end in book 13 is resolved in another abrupt & rediculous 50 pages (after 2500 pages of nothing in 11-13)."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The good thing is, Moiraine is dead.Sadly, this is the only good thing. A Crown of Swords is the most horrifically, disgustingly awful book of the Jordan series I've read yet. And it isn't just that you're extremely bored during it, the book could have been written better by a fifth grader. Jordan must have been in a tremendous hurry writing this, because I don't think he went back to check over his poorly constructed sentences, and I doubt the editor even read the book, since some of the parts are so obviously contemptible a real editor would have died before letting them get by. I wish I could have remembered some of the really good examples that had me reeling in disgust, but here's one of the better written sentences: \\"To her, all people were Aes Sedai and the nobility, and their upper servants.\\" This is barely a sentence...If to her all people were Aes Sedai, nobility, and their upper servants, then what about all the people that don't belong to those three? And why those three classifications? They seem a little unrelated. Plus, I had to read the sentence a few times before getting the gist of what the heck he's rambling on about, and even now I'm not too sure. Even worse, Jordan probably was unaware that he was repeating himself, such as in the sentence: \\"By her book, no one else mattered; perhaps no one else thought, by her book.\\" Yes we know it's by her book, by her book.If you can ignore the inferior writing (somehow), all the description will still bog you down. I was finally and desperately skipping whole paragraphs by the end of the book. Here is an example of Jordan's rambling. If the sentence had been: \\"Had Nyneave and Elayne been cavorting with Jaichim Carridin and Elaida in the fountain, he would have passed by without a second look,\\" it would have been a decent, even droll, little sentence. Instead, it was like this: \\"Had Nyneave and Elayne been cavorting with Jaichim Carridin and Elaida in the fountain beneath that statue of some long-dead queen, two spans or more tall and pointing to the sea, he would have passed by without a second look.\\" We're never going to see that statue again!!! Why do we have to know so much about it!!When I started the book I was instantly reminded why I hated the last ones so. The prologue was fifty pages long the prologue was. No, excuse me, fifty-four. It was stupid and boring and all it did was show how different people were all stupid and boring. It started in the White Tower with Elaida who's fretting about how no one respects her and goes to the Aiel who want to capture Rand. I'm not sure what excuse the leader gave for why she's capturing Rand, but she actually wants to sleep with him. Everyone wants to sleep with Rand in this book, it's one of the main plot lines.Actually there is a woman in the wide world that doesn't want to sleep with Rand, by her book her name is Tylin, she's a Queen and she wants to sleep with Mat, by her book. She tries to woo him with endearments like \\"my little rabbit,\\" \\"you little piglet,\\" and \\"you're a succulent little duckling.\\" When this plan fails, she moves on to raping him violently.The dust jacket of A Crown of Swords says: \\"In this volume, Elayne, Aviendha, and Mat come ever closer to the bowl ter'angreal that may reverse the world's endless heat wave and restore natural weather. Egwene begins to gather all manner of women who can channel-Sea Folk, Windfinders, Wise Ones, and some surprising others. And above all, Rand faces the dread Forsaken Sammael, in the shadows of Shadar Logoth, where the blood-hungry mist, Mashadar, waits for prey.\\"This is hopelessly inaccurate and just proves my theory that no one actually read this book before it was published. First of all, there's about fifty other people with Elayne, Mat and Aviendha looking for the bowl so I have no idea why just they were chosen to be on the dust jacket. And for what it says about Egwene, she does no such thing! I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote that! As for the last part, and above all Rand screws Min and orders people around in his spare time. He doesn't go to Shadar Logoth until the very last chapter of the book, and since it was a scene only a few pages long, it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the dust jacket. I guess, though, that since the editors only skimmed A Crown of Swords and none of them actually tortured themselves reading it, it's the most one can expect, I guess.I had a really hard time keeping track of the forty or more different characters for each different story line (ever though they're all described to their toenails). As for the main characters from earlier books, they're as annoying as ever. Egwene is the leader of the rebel Aes Sedai and everyone hates her. Rand thinks he's insane and in his confused state Min finds it easy to take advantage of him and watch him bathe. Sadly, Perrin married \`Faile' and is utterly whipped by her, sadly.Elsewhere (the entire series having become one big soap opera) Lan has finally been suckered into marrying the ever stupid Nyneave, who goes on and on the next day to Elayne about the great sex they had.I suppose if you're really into the series, you might like A Crown of Swords, but if not, never read this. As a book by itself without the rest of the series it's astonishingly horrible. This is such a wretched book it should be banned, nay, burnt..."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"In an age (is it the third) full of 90 minute Hollywood &quot;thrillers&quot; which leave little room to the imagination and even less to plot quality, A crown of Swords is a refreshing change. Some say the book is too slow and nothing much happens. Perhaps it is slow, but it is intricate and interesting. When you consider World War II took six years, had many battles and even more characters and stories, most of which are untold, can we expect the last battle to be over in a flash? Jordan's characters are so detailed, you almost feel you know them. The sheer political depth of a world-wide conflict cannot, and should not be expressed without the utmost thoroughness. Jordan's depth of character development and understanding of the political and military fabric of the last conflict are unparalleled and worth enjoying, for as long as he chooses to write."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I am a late comer to this series and this is the first review I've written. I started this journey in January 2009 and it is now September. My goal was to read one book a month and finish by the end of the year. (Of course, I've since learned it will be a 15 book series...) But about book 3, I realized I wasn't recalling events and characters that were being referenced and became really frustrated by that. So I slowed down...about 2 months to a book. Unfortunately, the books slowed down too. Books 4 and 5 were quite tedious and I wondered if I'd find myself starting to agree with the 1-star reviews err the end. But then Book 6 came and for me, the story became extremely intriguing and the pace picked back up. And now I have Book 7, \\"A Crown of Swords\\" under my belt, having it read it in less than a month. The complex weavings (pun intended) that are the Wheel of Time story are so engrossing! Certainly this series is not for the faint of heart. It is like \\"The Silmarillion\\" in the respect that it is for hard-core fantasy readers only. I've since learned of a good web site that has chapter summaries and detailed character listings when I find myself not remembering an event or not sure about what I just read. Sure, the books have many tedious parts, what seems to be repetitious descriptors (Nyneave's braid tugging, each of the boys thinking the other knows more about women, etc), and odd grammatical choices...but good grief. I can easily look past those because of the immersion. This is escapism at its finest. So if by chance you are reading this review having not started the series, I would honestly say be sure you are ready to commit to it, and if you do, stick with it. It is well worth it so far."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"While I rate this book highly, this is the first book in the series where I really began to feel that the story was being stretched out deliberately to yield more books in the future. Many of the subplots advance slowly and more subplots are introduced, leaving more loose ends to tie up later. Don't get me wrong, this is still a wonderful book and worth your time. If you're a fan of the series, this is a book you need to read, just prepare yourself for a story that is still as long as previous volumes but not as deep."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"This is an excellent work of fantasy. There is little room for question, but it is limited in the sense that it is nothing more than a work of fantasy fiction. The detail is rich and the language flows well. Robert Jordan has found a style all his own and has persisted. It is understandable that some readers find the present plot movement slow and unsatisfying, but that development began with the very first book. Now that the characters have developed their own niches and have branched off from one another, as people often do, Jordan has to squeeze 8 books into one. All things considered, he makes very smooth shifts from different points of view. The barrage of seemingly insignificant detail he gives for the speech, actions, and clothing of each character is just an attempt to make us, the readers, know the characters better. It is the reason the world presented in the books becomes so real.On the other hand, Tolkien did not require such detail to make his world real. His tale grew in the telling primarily out of his study of language and myth, language being the most important factor. Language made the world real -- the poems, the shadows of the past. It all added up to a myth or a legend that was to be purely for the British Isles consisting in a linguistic history more than anything else. The novels thus take on more of a historical / fairy tale kind of tone. Jordan, however, writes pure fantasy fiction. Speaking about Jordan expanding upon any world Tolkien began to reveal is like comparing apples to oranges. There is a different motive, a different style, and exceedingly different men with the pen. The Lord of the Rings is the book most read in the 20th century next to the Bible. Children and adults from everywhere and from all walks of life read it, and that was before the film phenomenon. Jordan will likely never achieve such status for the 21st century. He will dazzle the hearts and minds of fantasy fans like myself and all of those who read this review, but that will be the limit -- a great work of fantasy, but doomed not to be in the literary hall of fame because of the narrow target audience. I love it, and I would recommend it to anyone, but at the risk of being called a geek. The series just does not carry the universal appeal of Tolkien."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"WELL,where do i start,the first 4 or 5 books in this series were brilliant and i was begining to...dare i say it think that perhaps this could be something to rival the might of Tolkien BUT slowly but surely that kind of outrageous thinking has been washed away.The problem is at times the series and this book in particular are brilliant, while at other times it is utter boredom,the women characters i would love to see all end up dead,more annoying characters i doubt could be found,the arrogance of some of them is astonishing.without question the charcter that keeps things alive is matt,just a shame that too much time is spent on the women.at times this book was very good indeed but the ending left a lot to be desired and was a let down to say the least.IT TAKES REAL COMMITTMENT to read this series,the books are frustratingly long,i have just heard that jordan hopes to finish the series in 13 books,regardless of what happens i will read them all but he desperately needs to turn it around as at this stage it looks as though good will triumph without any casualties of note,i strongly believe a main character needs to be killed off and the light only send that it is Nynaeve OR Elayne.the wheel weaves as the wheel wills so they say,i for one will not abandon ship just yet!!!"},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"I have seen mixed reviews of ACoS and PoD both. While most readers agree that the first 6 books are excellent, there are naysayers to the next 2 volumes that Jordan has produced. A Crown of Swords and a Path of Daggers are both books which Jordan has used as a transitioning phase from which the Two Rivers Crew (TRC) will be thrown into a larger game of global domination and destruction, as opposed to the localized feel of the previous books. Both books are not meant to further develop the personalities of the characters in a major relevent manner, as all the characters have come to the peak of their power and prestige, and now must face down the evils that come with the release of the DO. Although I did miss Mat in PoD, as he is my fave char, it was necessary for Mat to be left for another days writing as events on the mainland must come to a head to not only invite the coming of the Seanchan, but also the impending release of the Dark One (Four more books I say). Besides, when the Seanchan come and Mat is leading the army, Rand and company are gonna wish he was outta the rest of the series too. While there is not the same development of character as seen in earlier books such as TFoH or TSR, both ACoS and PoD have adequate development of character, such as Mat's change from reluctant general to brash battle leader and dependable (GASP) friend in ACoS, Perrin's continuing development as a husband to Faile and the continuing humanization of Lan (*Sniff* I miss the cold blooded killing machine). The cliffhangers are necessary to setup Book 9, which will be a turning point in Randland, and all the dreams and viewings true fans have argued and speculated over will be shown in the next two books if things continue to develop at the pace Jordan is writing. All in all, a great continuing read and a must have."},{"Title":"A Crown Of Swords (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Wheel of Time (Pb))","review":"The first 5 books of this series were amazing,but things started slacking off around the time 100 new characters and subplots were introduced.ACOS made an absorbing,humorous read, though I wanted to kill RJ for totally destroying Rand\`s relationship with Min(He just summarized her feelings,his feelings,and put them together--subtle!),and it was only when I was left staring stupidly at the last page that I realized that NOTHING HAPPENED.The entire book was a loose breeze,with all the major events taking place in the last 20 pages--out of 700! Another fascinating discovery I made upon finishing this book is that Robert Jordan\`s women get on my nerves.They\`re all the same (except Nynaeve):obsessed with power,how stupid men are,and how beautiful the men they\`re in love with are.Believe it or not,Robert Jordan,MEN do not occupy 100% of our mental struggles.Furthermore,the scenes with Tylin were NOT funny.She\`s at least sixty,and rape is never funny,no matter which way it goes.

Granted, Crown of Swords does advance the plot somewhat: Nynaeve finally broke her block, and Rand has both conquered Illian and the Sea Folk. But I feel that a lot more could have been said. Instead we're &quot;treated&quot; to Queen Tylin's &quot;seduction&quot; of Mat (which was at least a bit vulgar, seeing as how it was done at knife point), not to mention detailed examinations of women's dresses and how men and women can't understand each other. What is this, Melrose Place? Things which are important, strangely, seem to be lower on the priority ladder such as the finding of that damned Bowl, the result of which is that there isn't any room left to reveal Mat's fate in Ebou Dar or to even show the use of the bowl. I guess I'll just have to give Jordan the benefit of the doubt and hope he has something sensible planned, concerning the Bowl and other things. And granted, the return of the Seanchan and Perrin in Ghealdan both look promising as setups for important revelations in the next volume. I just hope RJ keeps his narration of layered petticoats, plumply pretty women, and foolish wetlander customs to the barest possible minimum.

He is trying to create the bigggest, most wonderful fantasy world ever, and in my opinion, he is succeeding.

I'd like to see 'The Adventures of Mat and Perrin' some time in the future.Again, I must reiterate that I do like the series and there is great potential in the story to still create something truly fantastical. Jordan has proven he can write an excellent story. It is time to bring to plots in line, though. Pull the main characters back together. The Final Battle approaches and time is running out... for Jordan.ps- If you haven't started the series yet... don't.

Does it provide a few hours of enjoyable fantasy? Yes. Does it bring us any closer to understanding the main characters? Not really. Does it answer any of the questions we had after fininshing book 6? No. This book is a filler and nothing more. I also dread the day when the series is over and there is nothing more, but that is part of fiction. There is an end. Please Jordan, don't tease us like a high-school prom date!

In such a highly-regulated industry, there are a lot of questions before someone moves from the comfortable environment of paper-based clinical trials to the less-familiar ground of electronic records. This book addresses such topics as data quality and data integrity, safety surveillance and IRBs, and the regulatory environment's intent and impact on clinical trials. The material in this book is presented in a way that can help a researcher understand the implications using the new technologies and processes in planning and implementing a clinical trial."},{"Title":"eClinical Trials: Planning and Implementation","review":"Given the relative dearth of clear, accessible, relevant literature on applying electronic technologies to clinical trials, this book is a rare find. It begins with a comprehensive and easy-to-understand overview of the clinical trial process and then methodically moves through the process of applying electronic data capture and other electronic technologies to existing workflows. It paints a realistic picture, giving credence to the advantages of using EDC and CTMS while including frequent reality checks, acknowledging the relative infancy of these technologies. I used this book as a part of my study curriculum for preparing for the Certified Clinical Data Manager (CCDM) examination, and I believe it helped immensely. I especially recommend the book if you're preparing for that exam."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Dental Remedies","review":"If the word &quot;dentist&quot; brings to mind a certain song from &quot;Little Shop of Horrors,&quot; you may have avoided your twice-a-year visits to such a professional. Sometimes, it catches up with you. What do you do if your filling falls out or you break a tooth? Don't panic. But don't avoid taking action.Grab this book. California dentist Flora Parson Stay says she wrote this helpful volume after finding few references on dentistry for her patients.And she's right. Hey, the only remedy for toothache I can ever remember reading is in Mark Twain's fictional Tom Sawyer -- out-of-date information from the same kid who took dead cats to the cemetary to get rid of warts. Not to worry. Dr. Stay, who has more than two decades' experience as a DDS, gives modern advice for toothache sufferers.This is stuff we need to know. Too often, we have our family first aid kit equipped for every kind of emergency -- except dental ones. This book needs to be kept right next to your regular First Aid manual.If your Little Leaguer gets popped by a bat, or fields a fastball that knocks his tooth out, did you know you can re-attach it? For real. Stay's on son suffered such an accident. His tooth reattached itself -- yours can, too. Surprise!Knocked out teeth may be successfully replaced if done within a half-hour's time, Stay advises. Never hold the tooth by the root. Simply rinse off any blood or dirt and replace it in the socket. Then, get to the dentist immediately.If you can't get to the dentist within that golden 30 minute time period,she says, keep the knocked-out tooth wrapped in a moist cloth or gauze, or placed in a container in milk. Dr. Stay says adults can simply leave the tooth under their tounge until they're seen by the dentist; this is a potential choking hazard for children, however.Dr. Stay tells you how to put together a dental first aid kit, and what to do if you have an abcess, a cracked tooth, a lost filling or problems with your wisdom teeth. If your temporary crown falls out, stop by a drugstore for a temporary fix-it kit. There's information for denture wearers and people who may have suffered a broken jaw. Advice when to -- and when not to -- use over-the-counter painkillers for the hurt in your mouth.Don't call the Tooth Fairy, consult The Complete Book of Dental Remedies instead. You'll feel better fast and have reason to smile."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Dental Remedies","review":"This is a comprehensive handbook for consumers which describes conventional, homeopathic and herbal remedies as they apply to dentistry. Most dental patients are never fully informed about the real causes of dental disease, and most patients are unaware of the variety of remedies available. Dr. Stay explains that bacteria, especially streptococcus mutans and other organisms, produce plaque-forming toxins from ingested sugars. Consumption of refined carbohydrates feeds bacteria, leading to dental cavity formation which is the most common disorder in humans; about eighty-five percent of the population has some form of gum disease. She provides detailed descriptions of the various filling materials which can be amalgam, composite resins, porcelain, or gold; explains why different metals should not be present in the same mouth; and that some dental procedures may affect an unborn baby, particularly at certain crucial times during its development. Amalgam fillings may be the major single source of mercury exposure. Gold inlays are the best filling material and may last more than twenty years. As far as I know, this is the only book of its kind and is well worth the money. Unfortunately, it's very difficult for most people to find practitioners who offer the choices of remedies described in this book, and most dentists refuse to discuss the amalgam controversy with patients."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Dental Remedies","review":"I have to admit, I haven't read any other similar books, but we were given this book by a friend, and have found it very helpful. I'd give it 5 stars, except for the fact that it's getting a bit dated now. (I'm surprised there hasn't been a revised edition.) Anyway, it's full of helpful information and explains just about everything the layperson would need to know. The author has also studied acupuncture and some alternative medicine, so it is informed with that too i.e. helpful herbs, acupressure points, nutritional prescriptions, etc. It very well organized, and the author is clearly knowledgable and at the top of her game. I think she has a good integration between traditional dental advice and more \\"alternative,\\" for lack of a better word.

Here are some excerpts from that review:Children's Writer's and Illustrator's Market has established itself as an inexpensive \\"yellow pages\\" of children's publishing for authors and illustrators in the United States.... This year's edition seems to me to be at least as good as its predecessors.As usual, the core of CWIM is the Markets section, which includes listings of publishers of books, magazines, greeting cards/puzzles/games, and plays, with a special sub-category for young writers and illustrators. The Book Publishers part is just over 100 pages long, as it was last year, with short profiles of 9 \\"insiders\\" (writers, illustrators, editors) interspersed throughout. This year, a sub-section of Canadian and International book publishers has been added.... The magazine section is also quite sizable.Before the Markets section come 19 articles, of which the first four--\\"Just Getting Started?\\", \\"How to Use This Book...,\\" \\"Before Your First Sale,\\" and \\"The Business of Writing and Illustrating\\"--appear every year. The remaining articles cover a wide variety of subjects, such as writing query letters, how to deal with rejection, whether unknown and unagented authors can get published, and self-promotion for illustrators. Two I particularly enjoyed--though everyone will have their own favorites--were \\"Writing Through Rejections: Advice from Jane Yolen & Vivian Van Velde,\\" and \\"When Size Matters: The Synopsis....\\"After the Markets section come a variety of materials in the Resources: listings of agents and art reps; organizations, conferences, and workshops; book, magazine, and web resources; a glossary; and a useful index to the publisher listings, which enables you to find publishers by age level or subject.Comments: As I have said before about CWIM (this quotation actually appeared on the cover of their 2003 edition): \\"You need a market guide with detailed information you can't find elsewhere. This book is the best available.\\" CWIM remains the leading market guide for children's writers and illustrators with the 2004 edition. All active US children's writers and illustrators should get this guide, and should strongly consider buying a new edition every year. Yes, you could gather much of the information you'll find in it on your own, through diligent searches online, phone calls, and guideline and catalog requests to publishers.

There are only six such projects covered. They include,- a product demo- an interactive holiday card- two web sites done in Flash- LEGO game- Furniture.com's Room PlannerEven though the book promises source code on the CD, the Room Planner project relies heavily on ASP/database backend and they DO NOT include this code. The result is that the Flash source included for Room Planner will not work.When someone from our firm asked the author about this he replied that his former employer owns that code and would not allow it to be published.You can still learn from the Flash source code but its value is a whole lot less because you cannot see the application working. And, given that Furniture.com is now out of business you cannot see the application in action there either!Our main reason for this review is to simply alert others BEFORE they buy this book about the missing source code. If this is not an issue for you this book may benefit you. In our case, we purchased the book to learn from the Room Planner source code so the book has little value to us."},{"Title":"Flash for the Real World: E-Commerce Case Studies","review":"Breaking the mold of the how-to and step-by-step approach this book looks at the business side of building a succesful Flash project.

The introductory story and much of the book focuses on explaining that the Devil Tigers are Demons or think that they are Demons. This makes for a pretty dark book. On the other hand, the thing that distinguishes them from western vampires is that they have something to do--punish the wicked. The only flaw is the pages on using Crimson rituals and artifacts in a live action game--the information appears identical to the info on how to run these artifacts in a standard game."},{"Title":"*OP Dharma Book: Devil Tigers (Kindred of the East)","review":"I really like the KoE system, but unfortunately the Devil-tiger book seems to be going into a lot of what White Wolf has been doing lately - let's get more graphic and outrageous when it's not really needed, and we'll sell more stuff. I like the CONCEPT of the devil-tigers, but frankly they go into unnecessary depth. It's one thing to involve violence such as rape in a plot, and say it happened, it's another to actually go and play it out in painful detail.

While all the other Tradition, Clan, Tribe books always have someone who assures you that they are the meanest of all the groups, they are ussually lost in their own schemes and petty politicing. That's not the point with the Devil Tigers, they have their feets firmly planted on the ground and of all the supernaturals around the World of Darkness, they have the realest agenda.

I am would like to point out some things about the book so far:- The book is very current. It compares Jini and RMi etc.. to new technologies such as JXTA, .Net, and Web services.- The author is very intelligent!! He has an excellent grasp of the role of distributed object systems and is not just repeating hype. He said that (paraphrase) \\"XML is a time-bomb becuase its not polymorpic enough, just describing the data is not powerful enough\\". Wow, good stuff.- He presents the RMI stuff the best Ive seen but in the process gets ahead of himself. His code is not 100% complete. By this I mean he doesnt include all the extra stuff like package statements and he refers to scripts like compile.bat that start these services that are not printed or downloadable or included. In the book it refers to [URL] to get the code for the book and extra files and there are not links and I cant hack the path or find them..So, I am hacking together some scripts and packaging this jarfiles the old fashioned way.- Also, Mr. Flenner is VERY good about actually describing all the services that are part of the Sun GUI StartService tool. Now, the reader can understand what all these services are such as: mahalo, norm, reggie, mercury, etc..I'll write more later as I read more though the book.."},{"Title":"Jini and Javaspaces Application Development with Other (Java (Sams))","review":"The book has a lot of good information though you need to be familiar with basic distributed programmins.

Other than that, I can't wait to get to it."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"\\"The necessity of shunning prolixity forbids my setting down all things.\\" So writes St. Augustine in the \\"City of God\\" book 12, chapter 14.The great saint - perhaps having long held back his answer to sundry pagan attacks - erupts in a volcano of words, and as much as any single theologian, very nearly has set down all things in defense of the Church.The focus of the first part of the work (chapters 1 through 10) is primarily on responding to the claim that Christianity is to blame for the sack of Rome by Alaric in 410. He provides many examples of Rome being cursed before the spread of Christianity, and many examples of it being blessed after Christianity - not least of which the mercy shown by the Visigoths to Christians seeking asylum in churches throughout the city: nearly all were left unmolested, while pagan temples were toppled. St. Augustine also points out the inconsistencies and logical errors in pagan writers and philosophers like Porphyry, Cicero, Varro, Seneca, Lucan, and others.In the second part of the work, St. Augustine puts forth his theology of two cities, the city of God and the earthly city (I don't believe Augustine ever uses the term \\"the city of man.\\") Catechized Catholics will recognize the two cities as the Church Triumphant (along with the Church Suffering; i.e., Purgatory) and the Church Militant and the temporal world it inhabits. In book 12, chapter 3, Augustine defines one of the theological jewels of the Catholic Church - the doctrine of the origin of evil. He explains that God did not create evil, but that through free will mutable natures can become corrupted. He builds on this doctrine through the next three books. C.S. Lewis gives a wonderful synthesis of the doctrine of evil in \\"Mere Christianity\\", but it is from Augustine that he borrows much of that thought.The following books, 13 - 22, were a pleasant surprise, being exegesis of the Old and New Testaments to explain the origin, nature, and final end of the two cities, beginning (appropriately enough) with Genesis and ending with - what else - The Apocalypse.This edition from The Modern Library is attractive, sturdy, and very well made. I do have a few comments on the translation by Marcus Dods, a Protestant. First, every use of the word \\"catholic\\" is lower case. I know that there are two meanings, one meaning \\"universal\\" and the upper case denoting the Church itself. However, there are instances where the clear use of the term by St. Augustine is \\"The Catholic Church\\" - no there weren't Protestants at this time, but there were Arians and Manicheans and other schismatics, and the author is clearly trying to make a distinction from these to the true, or \\"Catholic Church.\\"A more obvious case of ignorance is in book 22 chapter 7, the second footnote referencing Isaac Taylor's \\"Ancient Christianity\\":\\"In the Nicene Church, so lax were the notions of common morality, and in so feeble a manner did the fear of God influence the conduct of leading men, that, on occasions when the Church was to be served, and her assailants to be confounded, they did not scruple to take upon themselves the contrivance and execution of the most degrading impostures.\\"I tracked down Isaac Taylor and \\"Ancient Christianity\\" and it's laughably shallow in its understanding of Catholicism. Just scanning through it, one finds gems like the following:\\"Every right-minded traveler in Spain, Italy, Ireland, and even in the more enlightened quarters of Romish supremacy, has been compelled to allow that popery, as to the vast majority of the people, is nothing better than a gaudy polytheism.... this same worship of demons, in all its elements, such as invocation, votive offering, veneration of images and relics, pilgrimages, tutelary dedications, and miraculous attestations.\\"With such blind adherence to fables about the Church, is it any wonder that the whole world - Protestant and Catholic - is falling away? Taylor, by the way, was trying to square the use and verity of the Early Church Fathers while at the same time denying Rome and the Catholic Church. The twist people can get themselves in when they try to affirm only a part of the Truth.\\"The City of God\\" is not a trivial undertaking, but I don't think readers should shy away from it. It's not inaccessible as much as it is thorough. St. Augustine was not one to give way to ambiguity on any topic. I enjoyed this book a great deal, and have a sense of accomplishment having worked my way through it."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"I am not sure who to credit to regarding the eloquent flow of ideas in this book. It is just pleasing to read. Whether it's due to Agustine (I can't read Latin) or to the translator making sure the English reflects the original Latin, this book reflects the breadth of the authors experience and knowledge such that it has universal appeal across the ages. Indeed, the new age garbage that's being touted nowadays as being new and enlightened are the \\"has beens\\" in Augustine's age and usually came from the gutter and vulgar culture of his age."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Since the beginning, the Seeds of the Woman and of the Serpent have been at war. Augustine, in this defense of the early Christian Church, tells the story of God's people through history and it's glorious conclusion. The two cities will be in conflict throughout history, but the gates of hell will not prevail against the onslaught of the victorious Church of God. In the end the Word of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.

Confessions another early book of his largely a psychological look at his life is probably the book i would read first it is smaller and more personal and i recall reading it in an english course in university but he is a theologian. Probably the most famous and well read christian theologian of the past. He had a child and was very close to his mother as i recall and was a famous teacher/lecturer but gave that all up and entered a monastery and devoted himself to christian learning. This book is a daunting read at 1100 pages but though he was catholic it is a very christian book,there is nothing particularly catholic about it,and the church was just starting out when he wrote so structurally it was nothing like it is today. He was a male theologian,but his books though he wrote so long ago woman would probably be receptive toward more than older christian theologians,and his introspective volume Confessions,i recommend everyone read just in terms of psychology. The present volume was written after the demise and sack of the roman empire. Empires when they are powerful,allow their authority to be felt and eagle like spread their wings,and the roman empire was famous for its roads,where all roads lead to the appian way,and it was a shock that it declined and crumbled to nothing. Augustine examines christian theology and he goes through it in some depth,and those interested in christian past may be interested here,but he also spends much time on politics and finds the leaders morally lost,incompetent and nominally paganbut really not much of anything,and he hopes to show in his book how becoming a christian could restore the lost city of rome,and it was christianized under constantine,at the empire's end,by becoming a moral center and developing a strong characterand family structure,learning and strong moral principles,how it could become a 'city of god.' The book is quite learned,you will see over and over the words 'experience' 'contrast' as he builds a scientic world view of learning,based on sense experience and rationality as a structure on which to build his christian theology,and he concludes with a treatise on life in heaven which is mainly conjecture,based on his faith. He does state his metaphysics,although not proved its not scientific though that does not mean untrue,its just beyond the scope of our mind to comprehend and perceive such thoughts,though he finds it perfectly reasonable though not provable,and that's really the gist of his book.

The most interesting aspect of this work seems to me, to be that the utilization of such an ingrained, classical tradition as rhetoric was being applied (and rather effectively so) toward what was to become the new paradigm of Western Heritage. All things classical would be replaced by all things Christian, but thus so by the influence of powerful speakers--who were trained in the Classical tradition! This book is an enjoyable read; both for aspiring religious scholars AND lovers of classical culture."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"This is one of the great statements of Christian thought. It is the work which will define for many throughout the generations the fundamental Christian way of thinking about the world. Unfortunately this means it too is tarred by a fire- and- brimstone replacement theology which ruled Christian thinking in regard to the Jews for close to fifteen hundred years afterward.The work sets up the basic contrast between the Good and the Evil, those who are part of the City of God( whether on Earth or in Heaven) and those who are in the City of sins, condemnation, and death. Augustine is a great teacher of doctrine, and his doctrine divides the world into the saved and the damned. If you are not going to be with the Church then you are not going to live. His idea in short is an absolute idea, and his great intellect argues to support a way of understanding the world which is total and complete.The intellectual challenge presented by this book is great indeed. And in it one of the great minds of religious history expounds his fundamental teaching.As one who belongs to a people and religion condemned in this book I cannot simply sing its praises. But it is impossible not to recognize the great scope and power of the mind at work here."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"If you're looking to buy the actual book, or the $9+ Kindle edition (which I haven't seen, so perhaps this review doesn't apply), ignore this review. 5 stars, Dods translation is fine, Tolle, lege, and all that.Foolishly I bought the cheap Kindle edition, which turned out to be, apparently, a scanned version with an autocorrect run on it. Typos abound. Sometimes you can reread the nonsensical sentence, figure out that \\"or\\" should be \\"of, \\" and move on, though it slows your reading quite a bit. Sometimes you can't figure out where it was messed up, guess at what the sentence originally said, and move on. Sometimes you're forced to laugh, as when \\"Roman republic\\" is replaced by \\"Korean republic.\\"Four dollars wasted. I'm off to buy the paperback from the used book store."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Augustine wrote the City of God to respond to pagan charges that Rome fell to the barbarians because Christianity had made it soft and removed the gods' (small &quot;g&quot;) blessings. Augustine uses devastating (and occasionally tedious) historical reasoning and sheer deductive logic to demolish that view. Those who know little Roman history will have trouble understanding the allusions. There are, however, footnotes for the more obscure references.Thomas Merton, probably the most activist contemplative in the 20th century, surely read the book in the original and felt he could make a more readable translation. This version is almost painfully literal. He adopts Augustine's Latin style, which tends to be very verbose. Forty word sentences, such as we would &quot;ding&quot; a 9th grader for, are the result. And those are the short ones! Nonetheless, blame the Latin original.Still, shortening the sentences will in many cases lose some of the meaning. Latins thought a lot more rigorously and logically than we. Augustine was their leader. Don't read this non-stop, and have a history of Rome handy, just in case. This is a Christian classic that every educated person should know, but that doesn't mean it's as easy as, say, something by Tim LeHay."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"First of all, I am writing this review for the 1958 abridged edition by Image Books (City of God), but I know that this review will be posted on the product pages for the other editions, most of which are unabridged. So, I want to make one quick comment that is specific to the abridged version: I think this was a great copy to read. The editor cut out some of the digressions, which made the book about 300 pages shorter than the normal length (over 800 pages). I was reading this for a research project, so I was thankful for an edition that got rid of some of the less central points so that I could quickly get through the work and still get exposed to Augustine's main points.That being said, whether you read the abridged or the unabridged version, this book is an absolute classic. Most people don't know this about Augustine, but he lived in Northern Africa (today's Tunisia) while that area was part of the Roman Empire. He started writing \\"City of God\\" shortly after the city of Rome had be sacked by the Goths in 410 A.D., and this book is a response to the claims being made by the pagan population of the time that Rome had been sacked because as the official religion of the Empire had been Christianity people had stopped worshiping the pagan gods. Thus, they claimed, the pagan gods allowed Rome to be sacked; they withdrew their blessing from Rome, as it were.Of course, Augustine thinks this notion is ridiculous and he spent the next 14 years of his life writing \\"City of God\\" to refute the pagan view. This work is a great exposition of classical Christianity. The influence of the book was (and is) beyond measure; it remained an important work in terms of influence at least until the end of the Middle Ages. One of the things I really liked about the book is that the translation was really good; you really get an insight into Augustine's character. Furthermore, since Augustine wrote about previous philosophers (Plato, Varro, etc.), you get a great idea of how this work fits into that context.A thick read, a read that makes you think, but a very enjoyable one nonetheless. I would recommend this book to anyone curious for some exposure to classical Christianity at its best."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Thomas Merton did many great things in his life, but he didn't \\"translate\\" the City of God.

Dyson, available at Amazon in PB."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Recently read St. Augustine's City of God. It's a pretty good workout; my impression is that I've only sampled something, without having enough time to properly consider his wide-ranging discussion. It's simultaneous a work of Christian apologetics, theology, philosophy, historiography, and Biblical criticism. Its influence, overwhelming in medieval times, persists to the current day. It's a demanding work, but it can be read without any specialized historical knowledge.Augustine reflects deeply here on human nature and the meaning of eternal life and eternal punishment, within an explication of the \\"meaning\\" of history. He writes of all human history as a single narrative. This also a work of Biblical exegesis, as Augustine treats Scripture as a historical document. For Augustine, creation is good, creation exists in time and has a history. Indeed, since God enters into history to show man His love, history itself is sanctified, through the City of God.The book contains the parallel histories of what Augustine terms the City of God and the City of Man, both descended from Adam. The City of Man is founded on murder (specifically fratricide, the murder of a brother, viz. Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus). The City of Man has been deceived and debased, fallen under the sway of pagan gods, which appear to be either demons or, at best indifferent or benign spirits that are mistakenly worshipped. The City of God, on the other hand, is a pilgrim on this earth, toiling here in the joyous expectation of final salvation in God's Kingdom.Augustine wants to explain the ways of God to man, but he does this from some humility, expressing his speculation in doubt. City of God also shows Augustine to be interested in the goods of Greek and Roman philosophy and rhetoric and in purging the negative elements of these while and Christian revelation. He's always intent on removing the possibility of gnostic/Manichaean distortions of Christian texts, such as St. Paul's admonitions not to \\"live according to the flesh\\" but rather \\"according to the spirit.\\" Augustine is clear that this does not mean disdain for the body, but that one should refuse to live according to human ways, and consent to live by God's will.Again, there's no way to give an adequate summary of a book like this, but it is surprising readable (if voluminous). I'm sorry I waited as long as I did to read it.The translation here is readable, the abridgement makes the work as a whole accessible to a casual reader, and Etienne Gilson's foreword and Bourke's introduction are good companions."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"St. Augustine wrote this work in the fifth century AD, but it might as well be addressed to modern societies (including the one in which I live) and may even show a possible future.This e-book includes a minimal table of contents which links to each book. Each book contains many chapters however. The text is well laid out and easy to read and each chapter is well named/described.Reading this work will show that humanity has not changed. Also, it shows that the evils of this world afflict the good as well as the evil, and why this is so.This work is very easy to read (as far as theological works can be) and very clear."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"The City of God is a work for both the scholar and the Christian; it pours light, not only on the struggle between the early Church, but also on the bases of the faith and Augustine's belief's concerning God, man, heaven, hell, angels, law, sexual behaviour, and the practise of the faith.Laid out in articles within chapters, this excellent translation of Augustine's monumental work flows from sentence to sentence, giving each word and phrase the flavor of the original. It draws from both Augustine's lively prose and his spontaneous poetic sense which is always built upon his prodigous knowledge of scripture. For the academic, the student, the priest, or the fellow-man; this is a work worth reading and cherishing.St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo around Carthage, was not always the revered father of the Church as we know him today. First, a liberal youth, then a believer in and defender of the Manicheans, and finally a staunch catholic, he searched for truth wherever he could. Here, in his City, he lays out the difference between the world of faith and the world of mammon, i.e., those who live by worldly standards and those who live as if they were not true citizens of this world but only pilgrims on their way to the great city.The book is a beautiful exegesis on the scriptures, a treatise on many theological points, and a manual of moral guidelines. St. Augustine addresses the world and ideas of his time, and yet his work remains timeless, for the same truths apply today."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"This is a difficult read. It is worth the effort because it is highly educational and very enjoyable. Some familiarity with Roman history and mythology would be helpful but is not necessary. Augustine shows his reader the superiority of the City of God over the city of man. With Biblical and historical examples, Augustine shows that citizens of the City of God have characters and hopes that set them apart from the ungodly. He exposes the ugliness of paganism and the folly of men outside of the City of God. Today's reader will see that these differences between the two cities manifest themselves as clearly in our day."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Wonderful book, No doubt about that.And it has good touch or click table of content.But it is problem to return to table of contnets in the middle of books.\\"Go to\\" in kindle does not show anything."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"I bought this book in order for researching porpuses.

Augustine does an excellent job (though unintentionally) of showing how religious doctrines do not come about by an organic, bottom up process, but are the products of artificial acts of committees and compilers. And he also shows how large institutions are necessary in order to keep a doctrine going once it gains a modicum of acceptance. But honestly, I found this work overall to be hopelessly reactionary (to be fair, it is a defense), but his arguments are piss-poor and he cherry picks evidence in a manner which comes across as being childish and willful. It definitely gave me a better understanding of why Christianity is such a fragmented belief system. Any religion which claims unfocused crap like this as being \\"foundational\\" is going to have huge problems down the road. Throughout all of the sections I read, I kept getting the feeling that on some level, Augustine really didn't seem to have the energy or the will to make something this ambitious work. I guess if your obsessed with early church history then it might be bearable. Otherwise, look elsewhere"},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Excellent book of St. Augustine's writings, just what I wanted to read."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"I read this for a book group I was in, and was rather peeved at being forced to blow so much time on what is essentially useful only to the Classical historian or Scholasticism buff. Realistically, Augustine is just a particularly eloquent proponent of a religious argument we all get in Sunday School at age 10: The things of this world are transitory and passing, but the things of the next world are eternal and more valuable. You can almost hear the monotonous cadence.If what you want is to add to your already-considerable knowledge of the particulars of late Roman civilization, then this is the book for you. If you're in seminary and reading Aquinas, and you're thinking, \\"I'd certainly like to know more about his major intellectual influences,\\" then this is the book for you.But if what you want is an increased familiarity with the major ideas of Western civilization, then do yourself a favor and go pick up a pair of textbooks: one on ancient history, the other on classical philosophy. Augustine of Hippo will get a few pages in each one, and that's honestly all he's worth. Plowing through the entirety of The City of God for simple philosophical or theological curiosity would be like reading the complete works of Louis Agassiz just to see what scientific racism was like. Both efforts would be fruitful, in one sense, but in another sense you'd have spent an awful lot of time learning about antiquated theories."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Well, I'm a Pagan and I did not like this book. It was written at a time when the Christians were starting on a major campaign to slaughter Pagans and bring us into the Dark Ages. But rather than say all the things I disliked about it, I'll just let anyone who wants to know what I think of it e-mail me."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"In about three centuries since its inception Christianity had grown from a marginal Jewish sect on the eastern coast of Mediterranean to the official religion of the Roman Empire, thus eclipsing a millennium of unbroken pagan religion and culture. However, the paganism didn't disappear and continued to exert important influence on the public and intellectual life. Christianity, on the other hand, found itself facing new challenges as a dominant social force and it was unaccustomed to such status. The uneasy relation between the Christian authorities and the secular imperial authorities further complicated the matters. In today's language, the issues of separation of \\"church and stare\\" were coming into focus. Furthermore, the empire was in a decline and within two centuries the western part of it would finally dissolve. All of these developments forced Christian thinkers to rethink the place of Christianity within the world history, and come up with a coherent and meaningful view on these matters. By far the most influential of such attempts was St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\", an extensive and detailed treatise.\\"City of God\\" is broadly divided into two parts. The first ten chapters are polemical and they address various pagan intellectual and religious issues. The second part of the book consists of twelve chapters that broadly deal with what St. Augustine perceived to be the origins of the City of God and its contrast and comparison with the Earthly City. One of the main points that St. Augustine promulgated was that the two cities, although they may overlap and sometimes reinforce each other, remain distinct and will likely be so until the final Parousia.\\"City of God\\" is a monumental work of theology and philosophy that took St. Augustine many years to complete. This is not a book that can be read over a weekend, or even over the course of a week or two. Its intricate arguments and ideas that might be unfamiliar to modern readers require a careful and methodical perusal. The first part of the book was very interesting to me for several reasons. The pagan theological and cultural practices that it addressed are largely alien and unfamiliar to the modern readers, at least on the surface. This part of the book gave me a fresh insight into the external forces that had shaped Christianity in its early stages, mostly as a foil against which to present Christian religious and ethical norms. However, despite the appearance, many of the pagan attitudes and norms have never truly gone away, but have only metamorphosed into different cultural practices. In other words - the more things change the more they remain the same. Today's Christians don't have to reinvent the wheel: many arguments in favor of the culture-defying aspects of Christianity can be directly borrowed from the early Church fathers, such as St. Augustine.If you decide to embark on the journey of reading this theological masterpiece I would recommend doing so as a form of devotional reading. Theology can be a devotionally fulfilling activity, and reading a book like this one over a long period of time can help you appreciate and understand its main themes and messages. I would particularly recommend this book to anyone who wants to think deeply and systematically about the nature of Christian vocation in the World and its relation to our ultimate abode, the City of God."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"This abridged version of St. Augustine's work is great for casual readers who are looking to brush up on their classics or, as in my case, for students who either don't have time to read and decipher the text in its entirety or need help doing so. If you want to truly study &quot;The City of God,&quot; you should probably stick with the Modern Library edition (ISBN 0679783199) which provides better explanatory footnotes, one sentence chapter summaries, a collection of commentaries, and a much more comprehensive subject index. This Image abridged version, however, benefits from simpler and more fluid prose. After reading a chapter of the Modern Library edition, I often found myself referring back to this edition to reinforce and/or clarify what I had just read.

He postulates a new world order centred on the Christian revelation, but including all that is good from Roman and Greek civilization.Since Rome fell, the kind of fantasy world of Roman myth and lore kept in the popular imagination by Virgil's Aeneid and related art and literature could no longer hold water. It was time for a stronger focal point for patriotism and self-definition. That would be a Christian one, including Rome and Greece, to be sure, but the major element would be Christ. The Bible would gently nudge aside Virgil, and perhaps Augustine, aware of his own extraordinary literary prowess, saw his own monumental works edging aside the other great Latin writers such as Cicero and Sallust.This would all be quite some bit of bombastic or farsighted folly were it not to prove true. Augustine's work was indeed adopted as the 'mind' of Christendom, his City of God being read to emperors and kings, and leading the thoughts of the leaders of Christian Europe for over a thousand years.His 'grand unifying theory' of Western civilization, uniting the organization of Rome with the thought of Greece and the revelation of the Bible, has been accepted as the de facto definition of what it means to be Western until only the very last few decades of our time.Augustine, apparently aware of his talents, must have been aware that his epic work outshone anything written before, and is itself a testament to the civilization that he advocates: a fully coherent combination of Greek philosophy, Roman civilization and Biblical wisdom. This seamless blend of literary prowess from Rome's greatest scholar and highest ranking professor generates for the reader a powerful education in philosophy, history and theology, tied together with awesome rhetoric, that is uniquely powerful, erudite, insightful and useful all at once.From a historical and literary perspective, this may have been the very most important book ever written by reputedly human hands.As it is written for the leaders of society and not for the average citizen, be ready to be intrigued, challenged to thought, and impressed with every line.By no means must the reader have any kind of religious belief to benefit from this book, nor must the reader agree with all that Augustine postulates, nor can the reader, due to the great distance of time seperating him from us and improvements in scientific knowledge since his time. The importance, greatness and power of the writing itself commend it to us."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"I can add no further comments of real value beyond that which have been stated throughout the centuries by some of the greatest scholars, leaders and saints.

For instance... did you know that when the visigoths sacked Rome, they spared the lives of all who claimed to be Christians and took refuge in a Christian place of worship? I didn't. Do you know why?

I loved reading this."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Saint Augustine (354 - 430 AD), was born at a time when the Roman Empire was in its nadir, a situation quite antipodal to the heydays of the glorious times of the philosopher emperor Julius Caesar and a few others that, for the glory of Rome, spread the wings of the Roman conquest to the borders of almost all the civilized world, from Britain in the West to the occidental limits of the Persian Empire in the East. The barbarians hordes were already knocking at the gates of Rome and many other important cities and eventually got there invadind Rome trough the auspices of the Germanic barbarian Alaric, who, along with Atila the Hun, was one of the cruelest of his kind. The \\"Civitatis Dei\\" was written a few years after the first sack of Rome, a thrilling background to and the starting point of many of Saint Augustine ideas concerning God's attitude toward the city and its citizens. Despite the impending fall of the Western Empire, Christianism was steadily gaining ground as the official religion vis-&agrave;-vis Paganinsm, which began to suffer all the burden of (unofficial) persecuted by some Roman emperors. But Paganinsm still had strong adherents in many important places, specially in the Senate, and the purpose of Saint Augustine was to counterpoise the ascending fortunes of Christianity.Augustine, born in the north of Africa in the city of Hippo, was one of the most important theoreticians of Christian doctrine of all times, a great thinker in his own right, who could be compared to great Catholic thinkers as Saint Thomas Aquina and Saint Paul, being one of the true founding fathers of the Catholic tradition and religion along with the Gospel four Evangelists. His written output is impressive, even outstanding, both from the point of view of its quantity as from the point of view of its inner quality. His most important works, written in Latin as usual at the time, are \\"The City of God\\" (Civitatis Dei) and \\"Confessions\\", the former an impressive book of 1,100+ pages of teachings concerning various aspects of the lives of Christians and pagans in the V century he lived.The book's lenght notwithstanding, it is a very pleasant and easy reading, not losing the elegance it should have in Latin, with all the quotations necessary for the full understanding concerning some allusion of Augustine to the recent or remote history of Rome, ROman and Greek mythology and philosophical citations from authors renowned at the time but almost unknown today. A good introduction to the life and work of Saint Augustine is also provided.TO sum it up, the book is a very good one and an essential reading to anyone interested in the importance of the philosophical thinking before the Middle Ages, most certainly influenced by Plato instead of Aristotle. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book of all time.

Ultimately, our spirit turns to one of two loves, upward toward the City of God or downward toward the lesser values in city of earth.

Much of the structure of the Catholic church is based on the ideas of St. Augustine. However, one need not be a Catholic to believe or be influenced by his writings as they as universal to all Christians.The first sections of the book draw into question the abandonment of the worship of pagan gods for the one true God as the reason for the fall of the Rome. Some of the more eloquent arguments against this idea follow. If Christianity is to blame for the fall of Rome, what caused all of the previous wars? Why would the gods not prevent these wars?The remainder of the book is a somewhat condensed history of Christianity as told in the Bible. Some of this is dry reading as even St. Augustine is willing to admit that he carries on too long occasionally. If one has difficulty reading philosophers such as Plato, the author argues against them to support his argument. So reading these sections may be problematic to some. The discussion of the last judgment is among those that caught my attention, stating that the separation it caused from God is like dying a second death.Some of the discussion in the book one may find disagreeable. For example, St. Augustine states that intercourse should be limited to procreative purposes. Believing there to be shame in the act, he can see no other purpose.As another reviewer stated, this is a heavy read for which one may need some background in the customs and life of the Romans.

Many saw the sacking of Rome in 410 as retribution by the traditional Roman god's for mass conversions to Catholic Christianity. Personally affected by the siege, Augustine sought to defend the Church from her critics and paint a picture of ideal, sanctifying faith. Arguably the most important and certainly the most influential of the Church fathers, Augustine laid the foundation for the doctrine of Sola scriptura (by scripture alone) which was abandoned by the Catholic church throughout its history. Augustine believed that the Church needed a metaphor to frame complex theological nuances of Catholic tradition. He did this by explaining the imperative of all sinners to repentance as a duty to forget the sins of the world, named the City of Man accordingly, and flee to constant prayer for the imminent arrival of the Christ (parousia) and for entrance to the wonders of heaven, named the City of God. As scriptures indicate, all who believe in Christ know that the latter will win over the former and that Christ and his bride will be restored in the end times. Penguin does a wonderful job in arranging essential pretexts and useful prologues to frame Augustine's dated but relevant text. Care has been taken to note subtleties in textual translations and definitions for unusual words."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"City of God is a Classic by the Roman-Egyptian Augustine of Hippo -- it laid the foundation for modern Christianity, and destroyed the basis for that religion as established by Jesus, Peter and James, then set down, in what became Canonized Gospel, by Saul of tarsus.I utilized it as a minor reference during the writing a portion of SAINT PAUL'S JOKE ... which might well have been called Augustine's Curse.In it you will learn the philosophy which turned the Romans away from those scriptural teachings which became Canon, and Gnostic texts ... and created the the philosophy of a State Religion that evolved into the Inquisitions, Pogroms and Reformation -- eventually leading to the Holocaust.Read in parallel with SAINT PAUL'S JOKE, you can immediately see where he digressed, and thus created the history of Europe and, eventually, of the Modern World."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"The City of God has been more beneficial in my preparation for preaching a series on the Revelation of Jesus Christ than any commentary, ancient or modern.

It was not only a great apologetic to the Christian faith of the 5th century; it is an apologetic to Christian faith for all centuries. It is the story of history unfolded in two exact opposite cities. It is the struggle between the two cities against one another. It is the story of the fall, grace, redemption, and salvation of man for those who live in the city of God. For those of the other city, it is the exact opposite. It is the story of the fall, judgment, damnation and ultimate destruction of those who loved themselves more than they loved God. This was the story of love, by one of the greatest saints of the Catholic Church, Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.The reason I give 4 stars out of 5 is because of the amazing difficulty that comes with reading this book. This is a VERY VERY heavy read, and one should be familiar with the prevailing Roman philosophies of the day, as well as Roman history.Augustine talks of Plato, Cicero, Virgil and others frequently through the book. He also talks of the history of Rome, and these factors play a heavy note in his book. An few survey classes of Philosophy, and a World Civics class as well as a decent understanding of Christian history at this time, and theology is also a must. You should be familiar with the scriptures. Because of all these factors, you cannot just pickup and read this book. You'll have to know what Augustine is talking about to some level before you read this.Other than that, this book is brilliance, and while some parts will be a little dry, it is very inspiring. You see Augustine write, sign, and stamp the doctrine of Original Sin, Amillinialism, and doctrines concerning Grace, the Trinity, and various &quot;problems&quot; concerning the Canon of Scripture.He setup Christianity for the next 1000 years, and is still felt strongly today in Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox circles."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Like one of the reviewers above, I, too, set about the daunting task of reading this book from cover to cover, and it took me a good six months to complete it. But what a wonderful and worthwhile investment of time it was! It would do the modern Church well to read this book since Augustine places the City of God (i.e., Christ and His Church) within the context of the pagan world in which we live, and its message is as applicable to today as it was 1,500 years ago when he first wrote it. Most impressive, his grasp of both classical and biblical history and his profound understanding of Scripture is unparalleled by almost any author I have ever read, from Jerome's time until the present. If for no other reason, Christians should buy this book to gain an appropriate understanding of the last days and the rightful interpretation of the book of Revelation. Most of today's books on this subject pale in comparison to Augustine's exposition of this lofty and (sometimes) arcane subject."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"Although I am normally a quick reader, it has taken me about six months to finish The City of God. At times I was frustrated, and believed that the book was imbued with a generative power, and grew longer the further I read.And yet I am a little sad to have finished it, for no matter what was going on in my life, like Scripture, the City of God had relevance. How to summarize such a monumental work?First of all, I do not concur with the dimishment of the early parts of the work. While Books 1 through X are indeed more clearly tied to the dissolving Roman world, it is extremely helpful for us to get our minds into a time when pagans were more than countercultural \\"post-Christian\\" teenage losers. Augustine's vivid arguments against the pagan \\"theology\\" are incisive. More notably, they bring into focus a world that was both ultra-rational in the Platonic/Aristotilean tradition, and \\"superstitious\\" in its belief in household gods, demons, curses, and magic. That both a very advanced science and such beliefs could coexist is a lesson to us in our secularized, smug modern world.The temporal proximity of Augustine to Christ and the Apostles brings another level of clarity. While Augustine emphasized that \\"none shall know the day nor hour,\\" it is clear that there is an apocolyptic undercurrent in the Christian society he inhabits. The urgency of Christian life seems to me to have diminished.Particularly striking are Augustine's arguments against those \\"tender-hearted Christians\\" who hold various levels of Salvation for even the most depraved. In our world of ecumenical outreach, guitar-Mass hippy communalism, Augustine's defense of the limited Salvation is a necessary wake-up call.Certainly there are moments of \\"how many angels on the head of a pin,\\" which I suppose Augustine inspired in latter theologians. The various discussions of the form, age, and physical condition of post-Resurrected faithful seems unworthy of discussion. And yet he was writing in direct argument against contemporaries. This, at least, is fascinating; that anti-Christians of Augustine's day tried to build a rational case against particular aspects of Christian doctrine, rather than against the underlying thesis of Christ.The more history you know, the more mythology you have read, and the better acquainted with Scripture you are, the more you will get out of The City of God. But such things are not necessary. Augustine is a patient writer (as exemplified by the vast scope of this and other works). He walks his readers painstakingly through each subject.I must agree with other reviewers that the last two Books are worthy to stand alone, treating of hell, purgatory, and heaven. As vivid and daunting as the discussion of hell is, so is the beatific vision inspiring and easing. Augustine above all knows the value of true peace - the peace of Christ. And he knows too well the limits of the City of Man in attaining this peace. That he has indeed \\"tasted and seen\\" is wonderfully clear, and he inspires and encourages his readers to share in that faith and hope which motivate his life.There are so many details of note: from the Christ-prophetic visions of Greek sybils to the independent trinitarian philosophy of Plato. Such details are commonplace to Augustine, but we have forgotten them. Truly, The City of God must be reckoned among the necessities of catechismic formation, mostly for Roman Catholics, but if certain later prejudices can be ignored, for all Christians as well. I would caution Jewish readers that Augustine makes no bones about the deicide and subsequent temporal punishment that he believes the Jews endure, until their conversion with the Last Judgement. As to pagans and heretics of all stripes, you've met your match in Augustine... he outwitted you 1500 years ago.Lest I be as prolix as Augustine himself, I will conclude by referencing the great spiritual help that this book provides. Particularly in modern times, though American Christians (and even American Catholics) are notably free from persecution, the City of Man calls us ever more away from Truth. Augustine's book helps us walk, not on the path of our own disordered priorities, but toward that greater and infinite blessedness we have been promised in Christ."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"\\"The City of God\\" is Augustine's most famous work. I agree with Thomas Merton's introduction to the latest Modern Library version, which says that an uninitiated reader of Augustine may wish to read his \\"Confessions\\" first to get a good background on the author. \\"The City of God\\" is long and deep, covering many philosophical and Biblical debates (many that are still alive today), so one who has been introduced to Augustine through his auto-biographical \\"Confessions\\" may find it easier to follow his logic as he discusses the numerous topics of \\"The City of God.\\"The first few hundred pages of \\"The City of God\\" may be very slow and difficult for the average modern, Western, reader. Augustine is speaking directly to the average Roman citizens of the time (413 AD), so the first several chapters of \\"The City of God\\" are spent debunking the Romans' beliefs in polytheism, a mindset long since abandoned by most in the civilized Western world (thanks mostly to... Augustine). But the difficulty of these first few chapters should only make one appreciate Augustine all the more for having helped dismiss such a convoluted belief system. Once Augustine has broken down the problems with Zeus and friends, he moves on to discussing Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers. Augustine discusses why these founders of Western culture came close to understanding the idea of the Judeo-Christian God, but he shows where they too eventually fell short of total comprehension of Him.After Augustine has dealt with these religions and philosophies of the Romans, he begins to address the Bible and how it concerns the City of God and the earthly city (Rome, which had been sacked by Alaric in 410, was the best example of the latter). Augustine outlines the differences in the beliefs and actions of believers and non-believers, or in other words, the citizenries of the two cities in question. In doing this, Augustine discusses numerous debates and questions, including figurative vs. literal interpretations of Old Testament stories, how the Old Testament prophets pointed towards Jesus Christ and how Christ fulfilled their prophesies, as well as many other questions that are still discussed every day, nearly 16 centuries later. Ultimately, Augustine gives us the beautiful picture of life graced by Christ through the faith he gives to the citizens he elects to join his city. Augustine shows us how Christ's grace removes his predestinated citizens from the worries of the earthly city, while (paradoxically) energizing them to care that much more for the inhabitants of this city (as the Christians in Rome did for non-believers they sheltered from Alaric's invaders).One note of recent relevance: The City of God is often referenced today for Augustine's discussion of \\"just war\\" theory. While Augustine definitely believed that war can at times be just, and therefore morally obligatory, he does not really go into great detail about \\"just war\\" theory in \\"The City of God.\\" In nearly 900 pages (in the Modern Library edition), he writes about war for no more than 1-2 pages.I highly recommend \\"The City of God\\" to everyone, Christian or not. Just for the history of it, this book is fascinating, but the theology makes it one of the greatest works ever written."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"In about three centuries since its inception Christianity had grown from a marginal Jewish sect on the eastern coast of Mediterranean to the official religion of the Roman Empire, thus eclipsing a millennium of unbroken pagan religion and culture. However, the paganism didn't disappear and continued to exert important influence on the public and intellectual life. Christianity, on the other hand, found itself facing new challenges as a dominant social force and it was unaccustomed to such status. The uneasy relation between the Christian authorities and the secular imperial authorities further complicated the matters. In today's language, the issues of separation of \\"church and stare\\" were coming into focus. Furthermore, the empire was in a decline and within two centuries the western part of it would finally dissolve. All of these developments forced Christian thinkers to rethink the place of Christianity within the world history, and come up with a coherent and meaningful view on these matters. By far the most influential of such attempts was St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\", an extensive and detailed treatise.\\"City of God\\" is broadly divided into two parts. The first ten chapters are polemical and they address various pagan intellectual and religious issues. The second part of the book consists of twelve chapters that broadly deal with what St. Augustine perceived to be the origins of the City of God and its contrast and comparison with the Earthly City. One of the main points that St. Augustine promulgated was that the two cities, although they may overlap and sometimes reinforce each other, remain distinct and will likely be so until the final Parousia.\\"City of God\\" is a monumental work of theology and philosophy that took St. Augustine many years to complete. This is not a book that can be read over a weekend, or even over the course of a week or two. Its intricate arguments and ideas that might be unfamiliar to modern readers require a careful and methodical perusal. The first part of the book was very interesting to me for several reasons. The pagan theological and cultural practices that it addressed are largely alien and unfamiliar to the modern readers, at least on the surface. This part of the book gave me a fresh insight into the external forces that had shaped Christianity in its early stages, mostly as a foil against which to present Christian religious and ethical norms. However, despite the appearance, many of the pagan attitudes and norms have never truly gone away, but have only metamorphosed into different cultural practices. In other words - the more things change the more they remain the same. Today's Christians don't have to reinvent the wheel: many arguments in favor of the culture-defying aspects of Christianity can be directly borrowed from the early Church fathers, such as St. Augustine.If you decide to embark on the journey of reading this theological masterpiece I would recommend doing so as a form of devotional reading. Theology can be a devotionally fulfilling activity, and reading a book like this one over a long period of time can help you appreciate and understand its main themes and messages. I would particularly recommend this book to anyone who wants to think deeply and systematically about the nature of Christian vocation in the World and its relation to our ultimate abode, the City of God."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"St. Augustine's immortal classic is incredibly long and very, very hard to follow at times. When I set out to read this a few years ago, I had no idea what I was getting into. I read it because a professor I had in college that I greatly respected told me he'd never been able to read it all the way through, and I thought my reading it would impress him, or something. It took me forever, but I read it from cover to cover, and it was a rewarding experience. The book is essentially a very long examination of Christian theology, contrasted sharply with Roman paganism. There are very few theological questions that aren't at least touched upon; many of the ideas that would vex Christian philosophers for centuries are first addressed here. Augustine brings a fine, lucid mind and good instinct for argument and rhetoric to the discussion. This book is a must-read for anyone who takes the intellectual component of their Christian faith seriously. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"In this massive post-classical/late antique work, St Augustine exposes the follies of Rome's Pagan past, while revealing the mystery of the Church throughout the ages and unto eternity.

Later on in this work he explains many prophecies that were fulfilled in relation to Christ and the Church.

He anticipates many of the great existentialists by over a millenium and a half in his treatments of the Old Testament. At the end of an exhausting journey, one is left with a reaffirmed faith and renewed strength in the promise of our Savior. No man should be deprived of the nourishment of the mind and spirit contained in this book. Happy reading"},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"With an eye to bypassing some of Augustine's many redundancies and digressions, the Image/Doubleday edition -- \\"abridged for modern readers\\" -- is nonetheless a major commitment for the reader. Augustine began writing The City of God at age 59 and worked on it, off and on, for much of the next 14 years. The impetus for the beginning of this vast work (and its recurring focus) was the charge of Pagans (polytheists) that Christianity was responsible for the decay and demise of the Roman Empire. The charge put forward the claim that the prosperity and social stability of the state was dependant upon polytheistic worship. In response, Augustine arrays several lines of argument, rebutting the assumed 'goodness' of the Pagan state, as such, and detailing the ethical/moral and logical failings of Paganism. Augustine displays tremendous scholarship, employing the writings of Paganism's greatest historians and philosophers in his case against their religious claims. The result is a giant literary, philosophical, historical, theological and exegetical work. In this abridged edition, some redundant and digressive texts are omitted with notes indicating this and summarizing their content. The integrity of the book and chapter divisions is retained.Against the 'city', i.e., society, of many gods, there is but one alternate society, this Augustine calls The City of God, adopting the expression found in several of King David's psalms. Not only is the society of many gods the society of polytheists, it is also the \\"city\\" of pantheists, atheistic materialists and philosophical Cynics. In the case of the Cynics and atheists, these false gods are the myriad gods of self, indeed, at least as many gods (selves) as there are believers in them. Thus there are two \\"cities\\", two loves, two ways to understand the big questions of existence, two destinations. Says Augustine:\\"The one City began with the love of God; the other had its beginnings in the love of self.\\" XIV:13. \\"The city of man seeks the praise of men, whereas the height of glory for the other is to hear God in the witness of conscience. The one lifts up its head in its own boasting; the other says to God: 'Thou art my glory, thou liftest up my head.' (Psalm 3.4) In the city of the world both the rulers themselves and the people they dominate are dominated by the lust for domination; whereas in the City of God all citizens serve one another in charity. . .\\" XIV:28.Among the many philosophical (and historical) passages of interest are Augustine's general recountings of the history and development of Italian and Ionian philosophy, in Book VIII, particularly as regards ethics, theology, physics and cosmography.For the reader whose serious interest is Christian theology and scriptural exegetics, Augustine needs no introduction. It would be fair to describe him as the most influential human voice of the Christian faith, post New Testament. I'll sketch my 'take' on his views in just three areas of interpretation on which there were conflicting views within the Christianity of late antiquity and which are yet disputed 1600 years later. These being (1) interpreting the Genesis creation account, (2) the balancing of determinism or 'predestination' with freedom of the will, and (3) the doctrine of 'hell'.(1) Although he devotes the matter more specific attention in other of his writings than he does here, Augustine finds a literal interpretation if Genesis 1-2 to give rise to paradoxes and conflicts within the text that make a literal interpretation unworkable. His understanding is sometimes called 'literary', as opposed to 'literal'. Rather than being an abrupt history, the account is understood as being essentially an introduction, a theological primer, presenting a literary exposition of God's primordial separateness, non-dependence, intimacy with the created ('hovering') and ultimate sovereignty 'over' it (Gen. 1:1-2), in other words, a framework for understanding the nature of God's relationship to his creation. In more recent times, those who hold for the so-called \\"framework\\" understanding have claimed this \\"non-literal\\" view; for an earlier but similar exegesis, read Philo (c.20BC-50AD). For Augustine, the physical and temporal facts of creation are a mystery known only to God (see Job 38ff). While he does not place the creation of man temporally six solar days after the original act of divine creation (\\"As for these 'days,' it is difficult, perhaps impossible to think -- let alone to explain in words -- what they mean\\"), he does use the genealogies of the Pentateuch to roughly estimate a time for the creation of the first man in God's image (Adam). He spends some effort examining inconsistent points in various genealogical accounts (both within and between the Septuagint and the Hebrew) but concludes that this is no significant difficulty as the genealogies are intended to establish lineages (e.g., for the patriarchs) and not to establish complete temporal histories. They are accurate for the purpose intended, inaccurate only if their intent is not recognized.(2) Today, many Christians who hold the strong 'Calvinist' view of \\"predestination\\", claim Augustine as a proponent of this view. While many succinct statements will appear to support this claim, we should understand such statements within their given contexts. In this regard, Augustine is no denier of the freedom of the human will or the omnibenevolence of God. Although he does use the term 'predestine,' he would certainly agree with Anselm that the meaning of the word when applied to the omniscient God is simply not the same as our understanding of the concept for which we appropriate the word. Augustine's wrestlings with the thorny openness/determinism question, as regards the human will, is not as \`cut and dried' as the \`Calvinist' often insists! Wesleyans and other so-called 'Arminians' can look to Augustine too, and will understand him in a broader and more contextual manner than the strict Calvinist can permit himself.(3) While I personally find no major difficulty in Augustine's approach to the two doctrinal issues considered above, I disagree with his doctrine of Hell. For Augustine, Hell is relentless, eternal, sensory, bodily torture, wherein one is, in his words, \\"pounded by perpetual pain.\\" He tries to engage the opposing view of 'hell' being, in St Paul's words, \\"eternal destruction,\\" but here he fails (Book XXI). It seems clear enough to me that Hades' chamber of pain and torture was adopted from Paganism and not scripture. The two texts that are often held to support Augustine's view are better understood as literary than literal. Either the 'worm that turns forever' and the \\"smoke of their torment\\" that ascends forever are metaphors (they obviously are), or the \\"second death\\" and the \\"eternal destruction\\" are metaphors (they do not have that sense). When commissioning His disciples, in a direct statement Christ himself calls \\"hell\\" the ultimate destruction of the soul (Matt. 10:28). I think it is evident that a large number of Christians, including Augustine, have on this issue chosen the wrong verses as metaphorical ('literary' as opposed to 'literal'), and the wrong verses as literal. The opposite of eternal life is eternal not-life, an eternal punishment to be sure, but not eternal torture, which, after all, would require eternal life and not its contrary. Augustine errs because he sees divine justice as necessarily trumping divine mercy, a view that cannot be well argued from New Testament scripture (\\"God IS love\\"; 1 John 4:8/16; and \\"Mercy triumphs over judgment\\", James 2:13). [Yes, I am a so-called 'annihilationist', many religious traditions stand against this understanding, many religious traditions are wrong.] Christians have been disagreeing on these issues for a long time, and obviously some readers will disagree with me.In Book XXII, concluding this great work, Augustine speculatively considers the nature of an eternal life reconciled finally and completely with God. Here, the text simply soars. Of course there is much more of interest in this expansive volume -- its historical importance, or one of Augustine's famous treatments of the physics of 'time' (Book XI), for example, than I can touch on here. \\"Thus, it is the love of study that seeks a holy leisure; and only the compulsion of charity that shoulders necessary activity.\\""},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"City of God is a difficult, complex, and wide-ranging book, which makes many references to persons and places that will often be obscure to most of us. But I think anyone can learn something from the genius and wide-ranging observations of Augustine. One of the first things I noticed when I began reading this book about twenty years ago was, &quot;Hey! I recognize that faith!&quot; Him, a Latin-speaking north African &quot;Catholic&quot; of the 4th Century, me, a 20th Century English-speaking Norte Americano WASP. City of God showed me that the Church of Christ is more united in its diversity than I realized. And in a sense, Augustine is broader still; he writes not only as a Christian, but as a human being. All of us can learn something from him, I think:The skeptic. You will find a few ideas here based on an out-dated &quot;pre-scientific worldview.&quot; If you're looking for something to laugh at, and aren't intimidated by his intellect, you may be able to pull out a few quotes. But if you're looking for truth, you'll find much more, in every way. Augustine's love of truth burns from the pages of this book like a flame. The scope of his curiosity is broad, and his intellect first-rate by any standard.The missionary. In the tradition of Paul and John, point people to a God not entirely unknown. Remind people how their own ancestors sought God, and knew something about Him before we got there. Quote the oracle of Apollo, or the Platonists, to prove Christ. Expect God to do miracles.The New Ager. The period in which Augustine wrote City of God bares a striking resemblance to our own. &quot;Many civilizations had met in one civilization,&quot; as Chesterton put it. Augustine argues against reincarnation and channeling and other modern fads. His solution is neither complete negation nor complete affirmation, but a more subtle synthesis that allows truths of many cultures to meet in Christ and find fulfillment; a solution that modern Christians have applied in an interesting way to redemptive truths in Buddhism, Hinduism, Marxism, and Islam.The debater and apologist. This book is a model for those who who want to make an effective argument. Know your opponent's arguments as well as they know them themselves. Admit when they are on the right track.

Here is one of the rare 1000-page books that not only deserved its length, but could have been longer.What astounded me about reading St. Augustine was how relevant he is, even after 1600 years. The vast majority of what he discusses throughout this monumental book still matters--only the particulars have changed. In his day, pagans blamed Christians for wars and the collapse of civilization. Rationalists and materialists denied the supernatural, insisting that all religions were the same, and mocked those that believed in it. And Christians themselves, under pressure and guilt from what seemed to be the entire known world, expressed doubts about their faith. Sound familiar? Only the particulars of all these situations have changed--in the broadstrokes, Christianity is still fighting many of the same battles in which Augustine saw combat.This edition from Penguin Classics (I fully realize that Amazon will post this review on the Modern Library edition and other places that it doesn't belong) is very good. Henry Bettenson's translation is smooth, fast-moving, and heavily footnoted. While I found the footnotes very helpful--especially in the hundreds of places in which Augustine quotes from scripture and other authors, like Virgil and Plotinus--some of them struck me as unnecessary, particularly those criticizing Augustine's etymologies and those pointing out which gods or goddesses are or are not found outside Augustine's work.

However, the paganism didn't disappear and continued to exert important influence on the public and intellectual life. Christianity, on the other hand, found itself facing new challenges as a dominant social force and it was unaccustomed to such status. The uneasy relation between the Christian authorities and the secular imperial authorities further complicated the matters. In today's language, the issues of separation of \\"church and stare\\" were coming into focus. Furthermore, the empire was in a decline and within two centuries the western part of it would finally dissolve. All of these developments forced Christian thinkers to rethink the place of Christianity within the world history, and come up with a coherent and meaningful view on these matters. By far the most influential of such attempts was St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\", an extensive and detailed treatise.\\"City of God\\" is broadly divided into two parts. The first ten chapters are polemical and they address various pagan intellectual and religious issues. The second part of the book consists of twelve chapters that broadly deal with what St. Augustine perceived to be the origins of the City of God and its contrast and comparison with the Earthly City. One of the main points that St. Augustine promulgated was that the two cities, although they may overlap and sometimes reinforce each other, remain distinct and will likely be so until the final Parousia.\\"City of God\\" is a monumental work of theology and philosophy that took St. Augustine many years to complete. This is not a book that can be read over a weekend, or even over the course of a week or two. Its intricate arguments and ideas that might be unfamiliar to modern readers require a careful and methodical perusal. The first part of the book was very interesting to me for several reasons. The pagan theological and cultural practices that it addressed are largely alien and unfamiliar to the modern readers, at least on the surface. This part of the book gave me a fresh insight into the external forces that had shaped Christianity in its early stages, mostly as a foil against which to present Christian religious and ethical norms. However, despite the appearance, many of the pagan attitudes and norms have never truly gone away, but have only metamorphosed into different cultural practices. In other words - the more things change the more they remain the same. Today's Christians don't have to reinvent the wheel: many arguments in favor of the culture-defying aspects of Christianity can be directly borrowed from the early Church fathers, such as St. Augustine.If you decide to embark on the journey of reading this theological masterpiece I would recommend doing so as a form of devotional reading. Theology can be a devotionally fulfilling activity, and reading a book like this one over a long period of time can help you appreciate and understand its main themes and messages. I would particularly recommend this book to anyone who wants to think deeply and systematically about the nature of Christian vocation in the World and its relation to our ultimate abode, the City of God."},{"Title":"The city of God; (A Doubleday image book)","review":"This is an apologetic text in defence of the Chritian faith. In this book, Augustine persuasively informed his audience (readers) regarding the history of creation from the fall of humanity to their redemption provided they recognized him as God of their lives. This is possible only as they abandon all forms of idolatries lest they experience a catatrosphe similar to what led to the fall of Rome. Augustine's concept of the two cities are in contrast to each other, viz, the city of God versus the city of Satan. The former is governed by God, and the later by the Devil that also governs the minds of many un-regenerated. Thus, Augustine appealed, in his 22 volumes that are now in a single volume, to us all to join him \\"in rendering thanks to God\\" through this great work!

Whereas Chaucer writes to entertain and incidentally edify, Langland's writing aims squarely at the reform of society: his poetic genius is ever bent on conveying his message in the most effective ways it can devise. That those ways are diverse, and that the poem entwines itself around the reader's mind with a fine webbing of delicate strands, makes a first acquaintance with this work for the student of Middle English a potent, provocative, but somewhat overpowering experience. Help is needed. Goodridge's translation into modern English beautifully renders the sense of the poem in a direct and lyrical way. This may be contrasted with most verse translations that tend to be glosses rather than translations. Consider one fragment from the prologue: &quot;Ac of the cardinales atte courte that caught of that name / And power presumed in hem a pope to make, / To han that power that Peter hadde inpugnen I nelle: / For in loue and letterure the eleccioun bilongeth -- / Forthi I can and can naught of courte speke more.&quot; What are we to make of &quot;can and can naught&quot;? A verse translation by Donaldson renders this as follows: &quot;But as for the cardinals at court that thus acquired their name / And presumed they had power to appoint a pope / Who should have the power that Peter had -- well I'll not impugn them. / For the election belongs to love and to learning: / Therefore I can and cannot speak of court further.&quot; No doubt this has merit as poetry, but of what value is it as a translation? Any student could replace the Middle English words with the modern equivalent, and be no better off in understanding the sense of the piece. Consider, on the other hand, Goodridge's prose translation: &quot;But as to those other cardinals at Rome who have assumed the same name, taking upon themselves the appointment of a Pope to posses the power of St. Peter, I will not call them in question. The election of a pope requires both love and learning. There is much more I could say about the Papal Court, but it is not for me to say it.&quot; While one may disagree with Goodridge's interpretations, one is never in doubt as to what they are. His prose is perfectly lucid, and often poetic. This is a wonderful introduction to Piers Plowman, and the notes and commentary that accompany the translation further enhance the value of this book, and serve even more as a key to unlocking the gates to this magical poem."},{"Title":"Piers the Ploughman","review":"The poem of 'Piers the Ploughman' is often considered to be anonymously composed, as the name William Langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript - it would be as if I would be assigned the authorship of the O.E.D. because, in some future time, the only remaining copy was missing the title pages, but still had the hard-cover with my 'ex libris' impression on it. Be that as it may, Langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other, and becomes a sort of stand-in, an 'everyman' for his time period. A few details of this Langland are known - he was a wanderer, a constant reviser (the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts A, B, and C (and some argue for Z). This is not a spiritual autobiography, as J.F. Goodridge states in his introduction, but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text. That the lead character is named 'Will' helps in this identification.This poem stands alongside Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' as one of the great products of Middle English; this also has the character of being a different sort of Middle English than Chaucer's more courtly, continental influenced variety. Thus, it gives breadth to the history of the English language. Goodridge ranks Langland as a great English poet on a par with Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth and Yeats, as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility.This epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time - like Dante and Milton, Langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind. However, unlike Dante and Milton, Will and Piers the Ploughman do not go through a mystical, otherworldly adventure or journey, but rather stays rooted to the earth. These are dream sequences, but these too need not be otherworldly - they are things that can happen to every person. The ideas of the seven deadly sins, the virtues, the church, and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same. The discussion of the allegorical characters, aptly named Do-Well, Do-Better, and Do-Best, does much for the moral teaching of this poem, which would have been of primary concern to the author.Langland's text is often more Old English than Chaucerian in ways. It is far more alliterative, a strong component taken from Old English. Also, it is less metrical in rhythm than Chaucer - there is a pause in each line akin to older English poetry, but the metre is less secure.There is much to dispute in Goodridge's introductory essay and notes, because this is that kind of text that invites such disputation. There are over 50 non-related texts of the poem that have survived the Middle Ages, that vary from minor to major changes throughout. Reconciling these is rather like attempting to reconcile the gospels of the Bible, and then adding to that task the discovery of other non-canonical gospels. It leads to rich discussion, but less agreement.Goodridge does a good job at introducing the text and translating the text into a prose style. The one drawback of this is that the sense of the poem is lost. However, as an introduction and student/study version of the epic, it is a good text. The notes are generous and useful.This is one of the classics of English literature, perhaps the least known among them."},{"Title":"Piers the Ploughman","review":"Items were in excellent condition however, they didn't arrive when needed....snail mail was the only option and requests to pay for expedite mail unanswered.

With compelling and painful clarity, Leon Dash peels back layer upon layer of false images and beliefs about the human beings who are most likely to become America's addicts, prostitutes, and &quot;street&quot; crimnals. The primary location or &quot;home&quot; for these persons has a clear meaning that should not be overlooked or dismissed: our nation's capital, i.e., center of government power and policy.Scientifically, as an investigative reporter, Mr. Dash has produced independent data with commentary that conceptually replicates the theory of differential oppression (e.g., in Robert Regoli &amp; John Hewitt's book, &quot;Delinquency in Society: A Child Centered Approach&quot;). As a morally sensitive individual, Leon has added one more powerful human voice that tells why and how the first victims of any war typically are both the truth and initially-innocent persons, including children.Leon Dash's work also conceptually replicates Jonathan Kozol's (1967, 1968) report from a teacher's perspective on the Boston school system in his book, &quot;Death at an Early Age.&quot; What Dash's commentary adds to both Kozol's analysis and to our understanding of crime and drug abuse is a neglected but critical key: the crippling effects and burdens of intergenerational poverty (e.g., pp. 252, 260, 273) that only two of Rosa Lee's children managed to overcome.

I suggest that everyone, especially politicians, read this important book"},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"Mr. Dashs treatment of Rosa Lees life course achieves a highly deserving goal by apparently paradoxical means: it exposes the traps of initial and subsequent living conditions by showing an individual's life shaped by it's decisions and choices. He never allows the reader to wallow in simple compassion or anger, and he never resorts to the true but useless explanation that the system is responsible for Rosa Lees miserable life. He always keeps your mind active and attentive.A good example is his report on Rosa Lees trial for shoplifting: while the defence insists that Rosa Lee might be a thief but is a very unfortunate woman and had to steal in order to support her family and her addiction, Dash points out that Rosa Lee has been shoplifting already in her early childhood while none of her siblings did shoplift. This suggest that her behavior might have had a functionality within her relationship with her mother, not only in her relationship with the system. By never letting individual dynamics and decisions, however constraining their contexts and however dismal their consequences, be covered up by the overwhelming explanatory power of economic deprivation, he manages to show in a touching and revealing way how a person's place within a system translates into his or her behavior and behavior outcomes. Especially by never denying the individual Rosa Lee or any of her children their agency in shaping their lives, by never reducing them to inevitable victims unfortunate-but-now-beyond-redemption, by describing extensively how two of teh children escaped addiction and poverty, he exposes the systems' crushing cruelty."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"What started out as a project turned into a genuine friendship that made me like this book all the more. Mr. Dash as Rosa Lee liked calling the author Leon Dash interviewed several families before settling on Rosa Lee's family. He initially wanted to write about a few other families, but quickly realised that following that many lives was only going to allow him to skim the surface. He wanted to write about the intimate details, so he had to dive deep becoming devoted to only one family.While reading this book I became aware of just how little I know about African American history, and it has given me a strong desire to learn more. In my opinion this book shows the lasting effects of slavery, a scar that runs deep through many lower class African American families. A scar that until I read this book was invisible to me.Rosa Lee told the author Leon Dash that she wanted her story to be told so that it could possibly help someone to avoid the mistakes she has made. Leon kindly let her know that the type of people who would be reading this wouldn't be the ones living the same lifestyle as Rosa Lee.

Rosa Lee Cunningham is fifty-two years old, a hardcore junkie for most of her life, who has a long police sheet of multiple arrests for theft and drug dealing. Starting at the ripe old age of fourteen, she gave birth eight children by six different men.Totally unprepared to be a mother, Rosa Lee introduces her children and grandchildren to crime as a means of survival. She takes them on shoplifting trips and teaches them how to sell drugs. Education seems to be a totally alien concept to her. As her children follow her well-beaten track through the criminal justice system, we can see here a family that was broken down before it even had a chance to get started.Rosa Lee doesn't live in any world most people take for granted. She's never voted. She knows nothing about how the government functions and cares less. Her life and her children's lives bounce from the street to temporary shelters to jail and around and around it goes. The whole concept of a stable life is alien to her. One could say Rosa Lee and her family don't even live -- they just exist from one day to the next.And yet... Of Rosa Lee's eight children, two boys manage to stay out of trouble and away from crime, hold steady jobs and create fulfilling lives for themselves. How did they manage? This is the part Dash doesn't explore in nearly enough detail -- how these two boys, against all odds, managed to grow up to be productive human beings. Was it an internal strength the other children lacked? Or did they have special role models or mentors the other children didn't have? This whole issue needs to be explored in much greater depth -- how a child brought up in the worst kind of environment manages to succeed in spite of it.Dash is a highly gifted writer and he manages to keep a non-judgmental tone in the book. \\"Rosa Lee\\" is a very good book about a very damaged woman who, in spite of all she has been through, manages to keep an upbeat attitude about her life.

Rosa Lee has made some very poor decisions in her lifetime, ones that will have far-reaching effects on the generations that come after her. The book gives you the insight as to why she made those decisions without excusing her actions. I came away from this book with more questions than I had when I started reading. It's almost a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg?\\" scenario...it makes you wonder if Rosa Lee created her own problems or if her problems created her?

There were many subtleties of African-American culture that a journalist of a another ethnicity may not pick up on. Really appreciate that he looked at this not as just a point of defaming Rosa Lee and her family. What he did was to truly examine the stereotype of the &#34;welfare queen&#34; and dive deeper into the racial, educational and economic struggles that pass down from generation to generation.

I knew, but never shared my secret.One night in 1995, I &quot;heard&quot; a story on TV (PBS) about a black woman in Washington, D.C. who reared two generations of socially maligned offsprings except for two sons. &quot;Heard&quot; because I was engrossed in a project which demanded most of my visual attention. By the time I focused solely on the program, it ended. I caught enough to shake my head in sheer disbelief. The realism was overwhelming.....drugs, prostitution, penal institutions, shoplifting.... thoroughly depressing. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder how this happened to Rosa Lee.I searched for and bought the book the following year. I could hardly finish reading it because it was inevitable that the children had very little chance to escape the pattern of crime established by their elders.Light bulb flashed overhead. How in the world did I escape?In the introduction to my book, Mr. Browne's Roses, which is distributed through Amazon.com, I explain a painful fourth grade discriminatory experience. Why tell the world? Because I suppressed the truth for too long and writing for others would be meaningless without honesty. I could have easily become another Rosa Lee, but my mother gave me confidence to rise above my environment. When Rosa Lee had problems, there was no one to &quot;band aid&quot; her emotions. I doubt if anyone truly understands the importance of nurturing. Society continues to pay a hefty price via welfare, incarcerations, counseling, legislation, etc. when a simple act of love and compassion given in the formative years would ward off or at least, lessen the consequences.I decided to face my demons and write fiction for children. Hopefully, my success will somehow encourage others to maintain a positive attitude when challenged with unfathomable situations of social, racial and or religious discrimination.Mr. Dash, I sincerely thank you!"},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book was horrible. I have never been disgusted with any book since Red Badge of Courage. The author had to state in the prologue what the purpose of this book even was as it wasa not clear the entire time. Rosa Lees flagrant abuse of the American system made me even less interest to help the the underclass. The only reedeeming attribute of this book are her sons Erik and Alvin. Would not suggest this book to anyone"},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book was a learning process for me, I read it for a class I was taking at the time and found how much I did not know about her stuggles in her time of life. Good book for young adults to read."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"I did'nt want to be judgmental, so I when into the book open mindedly. What I found out was Rosa Lee was Mentally abused by her mother and was loved by her father! When she has children, she overcompensates for everything they do. If you want Drugs, drama and reality you've got it. Three generations!! I found a silver lining in Rosa Lee's cloud, NOW YOU HAVE TO FIND IT!!"},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book made me incredibly angry. In a nutshell, it is the horrifying story of one woman's life and legacy of ignorance, immorality, illegality, and vice. It's a very compelling read and well-written in terms of the subject matter, but there is a consistent theme throughout the book of \\"failure of the system,\\" which I found insulting considering Rosa Lee and her family's grave manipulation, exploitation, and abuse of every helping hand extended."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"In recent years, welfare and the underclass have become a prominent part of the national conversation. But pundits' portrayals of the urban poor are often distressingly simplistic, usually presenting the underclass as a mass of indistinguishable brown and black people inhabiting a murky, foreign land. In 1988, Washington Post reporter Leon Dash began a seven-year project that he hoped might dispel reductionist thinking, trying to make this unfamiliar world complex and real by focusing on a single case, one that shows many of the facets of underclass life. He tells the story of a single Washington, D.C., woman and her family-four generations of poverty, pathology and crippling dysfunction. Rosa Lee Cunningham \\"is fifty-two years old, a longtime heroin addict, with a long record of arrests for everything from petty theft to drug trafficking,\\" Dash writes. \\"Her eight children-the oldest of whom she bore at age fourteen-were fathered by six different men, and six of the children have followed her into a life of teenage parenthood, drugs, and crime.\\" Rosa Lee's story is hardly inspirational-and yet in it there are glimmers of brightness. Amid the sadness and squalor, Dash leaves room for hope.\\"Rosa Lee\\" grew out of a controversial Washington Post newspaper series that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994; about half the book is fresh material. Dash paints detailed portraits of Rosa Lee and her children; presented nonjudgmentally, his depictions are founded on ambiguity. He makes it clear that-in the name of \\"survival\\"-she condemned at least two succeeding generations to follow her example, alienated from broader, productive society. \\"Rosa Lee exposed all of her children to her criminal lifestyle, the underworld path she argues was her avenue to survival,\\" he writes, \\"and four of her six sons followed her onto the same path, with ruinous outcomes for each of them.\\" One chilling example: Early in the book, Rosa Lee describes a shoplifting trip with an 11-year-old grandson and how a 5-year-old granddaughter had once helped her sell heroin. \\"Rosa Lee has introduced her granddaughter to the drug trade,\\" Dash writes, \\"as something to do to earn enough money to eat.\\" Despite her behavior and legacy, though, Rosa Lee remains somehow likable and sympathetic throughout the book. \\"I can't help but think that if circumstances had been different, if she hadn't faced so many obstacles in her life, her drive and her charisma might have caused her to create a different life for herself, her children, and grandchildren,\\" Dash writes.Facing poverty, dysfunction and ruined lives, Americans weaned on tabloid TV tend to look to assign quick blame. Who's at fault for Rosa Lee and her children? \\"There is something in her life story to confirm any political viewpoint,\\" Dash writes. \\"Some may see her as a victim of hopeless circumstances, a woman born to a life of deprivation because of America's long history of discrimination and racism. Others may give her the benefit of the doubt in some cases but hold her personally acountable for much of what she did to herself, her children, and her grandchildren. A third group might say that Rosa Lee is a thief, a drug addict, a failed parent, a broken woman paying for her sins, and a woman who seemingly was so set on placing her children on the path to failure that it is amazing that even two of them manage to live conventional lives.\\" If Rosa Lee is invisible to lawmakers who-only a mile or two away-see her as only a nebulous parasite, they are equally intangible to her. She \\"has no interest in politics or government. She has never voted,\\" Dash writes. \\"There is almost no connection between Rosa Lee's world and the world of Washington's policy-makers and politicians.\\" She is unaware, he notes, that elections even take place. Though wards of the state, entirely dependent on government subsidies and handouts, the family is completely alienated from civil society: They don't seem to recognize that their drug abuse and shoplifting have larger societal costs-indeed, that their actions affect others at all.Dash shows us the most troubled of Rosa Lee's family: \\"Bobby, Ronnie, Richard, Patty, and Ducky live a kind of nomadic existence, bouncing from friends' apartments to jail, to the street, to Rosa Lee's. All five are addicted to heroin or cocaine, or abuse both drugs,\\" he writes. \\"Their lives and choices provide an intricate blueprint of just how bad guidance and bad decisions so easily ensnared them in lives of drug addiction and criminal recidivism.\\" But he also focuses on Alvin and Eric, the two of Rosa Lee's sons who \\"found a different path and moved up out of poverty into conventional middle-class and working-class respectability.\\" Somehow, \\"they rejected the lures, avoided the pitfalls, and got around the obstacles that they faced in their home and in their neighborhoods from the day they were born.\\" Dash attributes much of the family's continuing poverty to its lack of education and frequent teenage parenthood. Rosa Lee had her first child at 14; so did her daughter Patty. Rosa Lee's mother Rosetta gave birth three days after her 13th birthday. All dropped out of school still illiterate.Dash's writing is nonjudgmental, enviably clean and straightforward, without pseudonyms or euphemisms. He never pretties up his language with gratuitous adjectives or unnecessary color; he never clumsily writes around a clich&eacute; if the clich&eacute; is clearer. The only stylistic flaw is his confusingly frequent tense shifts to accomodate his jumping back and forth in the chronology. As a black, middle-class journalist, he is an inextricable part of his own tale, and it's fascinating to see him run up against his own journalist-subject boundaries. \\"I lay down ground rules that I will buy them meals and even cigarettes, but I will pay for the purchases. I explain I will never give or loan any of them any amount of cash. I know from past experience that drug users go to considerable lengths to collect small amounts of money from many people until they gather enough to buy drugs. The drug-users among Rosa Lee's children boast to her that they will eventually get some money out of me. They are sorely disappointed.\\" Dash fights not to show feelings, to remain scrupulously impartial, all the way through his realistic and informed book's-end discussion of remedial action. \\"Viable solutions to poverty will never be simple,\\" he writes. \\"As Rosa Lee's story shows, immense difficulties await any effort to bring an end to poverty, illiteracy, drug abuse, and criminal activity. In the poorest neighborhoods, these problems are knitted together into whole cloth. . . . Reforming welfare doesn't stop drug trafficking; better policing doesn't end illiteracy; providing job training doesn't teach a young man or woman why it's wrong to steal."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"Rosa Lee Cunningham was a relative of mine. Although I really did not know that much about her, it was still sad to read what she, my cousins(her children) went through in urban Washington,DC. I feel sad for my grandmother(Rosetta) as well because even though she moved from North Carolina to Washington, DC to get away from the abuse of white people and make a better life for herself, she suffered too. As an African-American woman, we are considered the low man on the totem pole. Black men think they have it bad to survive in society-no no! Black women such as my grandmother and my aunt Rosa Lee have carried the weight of America on our backs. Both my paternal and maternal grandmothers have endured so much growing up in the south. My maternal grandmother raised 13 children and had aspirations of becoming a teacher but let people including her husband who could not read. She and her children worked in the fields to make ends meet. My paternal grandmother however, raised her children often by herself but managed to sell dinner plates and own an ice cream truck when she was not cleaning houses for whites in Washington,DC. Listening to my family members tell their memories of my grandmothers has inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I can see my grandmothers and I cry from sadness as well as joy because of them, I am a strong black woman and I am raising my daughter to be one.

ROSA LEE is a lengthy and well-chronicled look into the daily lives of one multi-generational family in an environment of poverty and drug-infestation, where routine crime and imprisonment are accepted as normal, and where escape is possible, but extremely rare. I'd recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the mentality and hopelessness of drug addition. This story couldn't have been written any clearer than Leon Dash did in ROSA LEE."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"Leon Dash outdid himself on this writing. As an educator within the school system I have seen these families and the devastating affects that drugs and crime have on their lives. Dash cuts Rosa Lee no slack in telling her story, he does not seek to excuse her behavior by blaming a racist and oppressive society, nor does he condemn her for the hiddeous behavior she exhibits and has exhibited over the years. He simply tells her story with the bone chilling truth that must be told. The underclass in America has not just begun it has been hundreds of years in the making and Dash allows his readers to understand not only the past forces that helped create this class but the current forces as well. This is a powerful writing and should be required reading for every Urban Planning, Social Work, and Sociology major in this country. Excellent writing, five stars does not begin to give this book what it deserves."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"As someone who studies poverty and race relations, as well as the devastating effect of drugs on urban America, I found this book to be just enthralling. I could not put it down once I started, and although I found myself shocked at many of the things I discovered about this mother and her relationship with her children, I felt a bond with them. In the end it was hard to be disgusted, just saddened by what had happened to Rosa Lee and her family. Leon Dash did a fantastic job with this story."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book draws you in, in every way. Exceptionally writen to the point where you feel a true connection to the story whether or not you agree or disagree - it will bring out emotion either negative or positive from its reader. Dash delves deep into the real lives an urban family and their struggles and sheds light on situations that many don't realize are the everyday lives of some Americans. This book will make you think deeply about poverty and the decisions that some are forced to make on a daily basis. Whether you agree or disagree with the issues in the book, it is DEFINATELY worth reading."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"What makes this book superb is how it examines how what our ancestors did affect our lives. It demonstrated that those trapped in poverty remain in poverty because of a cycle of misfortune caused by the environment and the urban subculture of poverty itself. Professor Dash created such a strong bond with Rosa Lee and her family that he was allowed a real inside look at how the family dealt with their day to day situation, immersed in a world of drugs, prostitution and urban isolation. I had the pleasure of having Prof. Dash in a U of I journalism class, and he truly cares about his subject, and it comes through in this writing. A must read for any student of journalism to learn the immersion journalism technique that made this book a success."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"I thought Mr. Dash did an excellent job of writing about Rosa Lee and her family, because he created a bond with Rosa and even some of her family.I have read many books similar to this one and always am interested in the choices that others make in their lives. The fact that two of Rosa's sons made different choices certainly proves that it can be done. But I do think that the general population has little sympathy or compassion for the Rosa's of the world.I have both and sorry that Rosa and her children lived as theyy have. Rosa did have some regrets at the end, that she had not been an example for her children and that she had not valued education. Education is the answer, it enables all of us to change our lives by having a means.One thing that the book did not show is what it cost the the people of DC in welfare etc. to raise Rosa and her children and is still costing them because Rosa lives on in children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren and all with poor examples of how to take care of themselves."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book spares nothing and no one in its depiction of life in urban America. So much of what I read seemed like it could not possibly happen in OUR country, and yet it does. I was shocked, moved, and changed by this book."},{"Title":"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America","review":"This book was downright painful to read at times, and I found that I had to be in the right frame of mind to read it because it was so depressing.It would be much too simplistic to state that this family was in the position they were because of racism or poor schools. Even if the schools were excellent, education must be valued by a child's family for it to become important in that child's life.Although I was filled with compassion for Rosa Lee, (she was very honest about the role she played in the pathetic plight of her family), there is no way that throwing more money at this family would in any way help them. Rather, this family would certainly bolster the claims of the right-wing that welfare ruins people. Intergenerational welfare certainly does do that, but I have no clue as to what the answer is. Making people dependent on the government, or allowing them to become that way, is certainly no answer!"},{"Title":"Surviving With Serenity: Daily Meditations for Incest Survivors","review":"this handbook of daily meditations is a remarkable compilationof profound depth for those set back by the profound injury ofsexual trauma, especially childhood sexual abuse.it has been my spiritual guide or handbook for many years now,accompanying me gently and sweetly through the complex journeyof recovery from incest. i cannot speak highly enough of thislittle 'prayer book'. the crime of incest is so terrible andsocially alienating, the discovery of this book one day in alocal bookstore just thrilled me and has been a companion readersince.the writings are creative, provocative, deeply thoughtful.with incest, it is so critical to think forgivingly of everysurvivor about the 'unforgiving' set of symptoms survivors havesuffered, be they panic, nightmares, depression, flashbacks,social withdrawl or stigma. this author accurately describesthe horrors of incest and its persistent symptoms but, still, lovingly describes the challenge of discovering hope amidst thepersonal ruins and chaos of the soul of a survivor. there isconstant love and concern for one's younger self, inner child; the author communicates to the reader to cherish and behold that young inner child.this is not a flimsy or saccharine account of meditations.the author gets the confusion and the torment, the complicatedand sometimes twisted inner dilemmas of the survivor. there areno lapses of judgment and no leaps into fantasy. the authorrespects the issues of ptsd and the integrity of the recoveringincest survivor.this is a gutsy, heartfelt, profound piece of work in a littlehandbook. this rare book for this terrible crime has been a blessing in my life. i thank God for it each and every day."},{"Title":"Surviving With Serenity: Daily Meditations for Incest Survivors","review":"I am a survivor of sexual abuse.

In his first battle, he loses his brother-in-law but gains a knight's spurs for his courage. His future looks very bright, but soon his prospects sour through no fault of his own.

She mainly wrote domestic novels, but ventured into historical fiction as well. The historical works of hers I have read are as a whole better written, although several of her domestic fiction works are quite good (The Heir of Redclyffe, Dynevor Terrace). The Lances of Lynwood is an excellent tale set iin the Middle Ages that explores the fortunes of the Reginald Lynwood and his house.

Taking the literal approach brings the Revelation alive and better viewed in light of the rest of scripture.

We are keep aware of the fact that world events change but the word of God and his plan are forever. This view keeps you focused as you read the Apocalypse. Different views are spoken to in this book, and they are always rejected based on scripture not opinion. Seiss is honest enough to speak about his lack of understanding when necessary.

Right now, it's just a solutions manual: if the question doesn't ask for it, they won't explain what the output means. What would have been most helpful is a detailed discussion of all the outputs that are generated after running the codes.If you are learning survival analysis on your own AND you use Stata (maybe a bit of SAS as well), then this is a great companion to the textbook.I haven't bought the book yet - got it from a library - but will when I return the book to the library."},{"Title":"Solutions Manual to Accompany Applied Survival Analysis: Regression Modeling of Time to Event Data","review":"Dear Sir/Madam:I ordered the book (Order #058-9070537-7702134) \\"Solutions Manual to Accompany Applied Survival Analysis: Regression Modeling of Time to Event Data\\" on March 15.

When I've seen the example, I just compared it with our compact disc(music CD), and I gathered every little bit of information that are needed in my catalog entry. And at last, I've done my work.The book gives layman explanation, you can't find here straight rules, there's an explanation for every technical terms that the author used.

I absolutely loved the story. Ten years later I became a teacher, and wanted to share all the best parts of my education with my students. I read many books to them, including The Lost Prince, and they loved it as well. (I taught third through seventh grades, in one room.) I did need to explain/define a fair amount of the text since it was written at a time when children were expected to have better than a sit-com vocabulary. This provided great teaching moments because my students were already engaged in the story and had the desire to understand it.The Lost Prince is not just the adventures of two boys, it's really about the best things in life-- loyalty to family and country, commitment to friends, being true to oneself, honoring one's heritage...It could be a bit of a 'culture shock' experience for people who are accustomed to think of 12 year olds as children, as we do in modern day America. It's much more understandable if a little context is given, along the lines that adulthood and marriage used to be entered into in the early teen years, so 12 was the cusp of adulthood.Thus, the expectations of the story's time period are quite different than the experiences of most modern teens. The absolute, unwavering respect Marco shows for his father was clearly something his father had both earned and cultivated. The devotion of Lazarus is also clearly voluntary, and quite justified when you finally learn exactly who Loristan is and what he has accomplished in his life of secrecy. As for the Rat, it's a great thing to see how Loristan is able to help him into manhood. The Rat's prospects are pretty grim at the beginning, yet by the end you can't help but feel pride in his transformation.This book is a great stroy for anyone who seeks the best things in life, or for anyone who hopes to inspire children with good character."},{"Title":"Lost Prince, The","review":"I read this book many years ago, as a 10 year old, but still haven't forgotten the excitement and sense of adventure it conveyed. My recollection of it is as a fast-paced and superbly narrated suspense thriller."},{"Title":"Lost Prince, The","review":"I am a 13 year old who loves to read, and so when I saw that this book was by the author of \\"The Secret Garden\\" and \\"A Little Princess\\", I was thrilled. However, it would probably have been a lot better for me if I had gone into reading it with different expectations. The main fault of this book (in my opinion), is the authors confusing attempt to go back and forth between two genres: fantasy and mystery. I thought this would be more of a mystery, but trying to see clues and peice together answers is NOT the way to read this book. If you take it as a fantasy, it might be better.\\"The Lost prince\\" begins with a very \\"real\\" setting, a grungy street in London. The story is centered around Marco, a boy who is very obedient to his father what he has taught his to do. Too obedient/perfect, in my opinion. Part of what makes a story interesting is characters who change throughout... however Marco was just too good the whole time! And eveything he said, did, or thought, was something his father taught him to say, think, or do. Then there's Loristan, Marco's father who is always talking about Samavia, his war-torn country and the lost prince that could save it. Lazarus is the last in the house, the extremly loyal servant who is obedient to Loristan to the point of being dog-like. the most interesting character in the story is The Rat, a boy Marco meets on the street. Together, they go on a quest to find clues to the lost Prince story.However, after the first few chapters \\"The Lost Prince\\" went from a semi-realistic mysterious story to a fantasy fairytale that spiral into something totally unreal. For example, two 12-year old boys traveling all over Europe alone? Another pont I found very interesting was that even when Marco and The Rat were off traveling, they kept referring to what they were doing as \\"a game\\". Even when they were doing all these dangerous things and acting like spies they still called it a game. And when they finally get to Samavia, this place that they have been dreaming about (and talking about nothing else besides it!) they don't go into much discription about it. by that point, I was practically dying of curiosity but once they got there it didn't seem as important.I did like the description in this book, which is very like Frances Hodgson Burnett. The scenes describing the country side were very well written too.All in all, I think that this is a good book to read, especially if you like the writing style of this author (which I do, I promise!) Keeping in mind that it is a fantasy book, I think this is a book people of almost any age can enjoy."},{"Title":"Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind","review":"It's a sorry state of affairs when great talent,inspiring teachers as Jacobs doesn't get more comprehensive treatment. Mr Frederiksen has done the best job he could,but only about 20 pages,(as the other reviewer said) are valuable. That's if you are interested in the art of Arnold Jacobs: how to become a virtuoso wind player,a consummate musician.There seems to be a lack a support for books like within the corrdors of established music in the United States.I also know that music books are not great blockbluster sale items,so they frequently get edited to hell.Well this book should have been edited that's not the problem.The problem is focus and funding. There should have been other writers,those who have shared Jacob's craft for teaching,the various problems in playing a wind instrument,and more on the theories he developed for respiratory situations and breathing,which were quite unique to the world of brass.That's here,but not fully explicative and quite sketchy.The Chicago Symphony should have found the money to produce a more indepth study of Jacob's art. Instead it seems Frederiksen has much filler material here, biographies of conductors and other brass players which reallylooses a focus and is not important for this study.Also the hardcover price keeps it out of the reach of the multitude of student wind players throughout the country,those who could really benefit from a study like this.(There is no paperback,nor is one contemplated)There are such similar situations in music where funding is misplaced. The composer Ralph Shapey,as another example, also from the Chicago area should by now have a book length analysis and discussion of his profoundly powerful music."},{"Title":"Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind","review":"This is a book for the Arnold Jacobs devoted fan only. Full of seemingly everything the author could find on Jacobs, it will leave the reader who wants to get a sense of Jacobs the musician, teacher, or person feeling empty. For a serious musician who wants ideas on how to improve his playing, practicing, musicality, etc., there are about 20 valuable pages buried in the middle of the book. While we have had many great music teachers, there have been far too few books that capture any of the essence of their teaching. While clearly this is difficult to do, it is something that needs addressing. What a book like this should do is to give a sense of what it was that made Arnold Jacobs great. It should analyse what in his methods, psychology, personality, made him what he was. It should give a sense of what a lesson with him was like, how he would deal with various pedagogical problems. I would reccomend this book, because there is information in it that needs to be published. But it also points out the need for further study and publication."},{"Title":"Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind","review":"As a former student of Arnold Jacobs, reading this book brought back many fond memories of this giant of tuba players.

Any former Jacobs student who wants to have a &quot;refresher lesson&quot; as our friend smiles down on us from heaven will find a treasure trove of knowledge within these pages.

The most prominent fault with this work is that it does not actually address the title's claim thoroughly: that women are natural rebels. In fact, all of the slaves exhibited rebellious behavior, and should be recognized for it. To highlight women as \\"natural rebels\\" seems to indicate that men were not. This is of course ridiculous.

A better browser than reference tool and accordingly recommended as such."},{"Title":"The Chronology of Words and Phrases: A Thousand Years in the History of English","review":"As a previous reviewer stated, this book will disappoint you if you are looking for a definitive list of English word origins. But once you accept its eclectic nature, you will love it, if you have an interest in words.The Flavells trace the history of many common words in an entertaining manner.

Moses' role in transforming the Jews from runaway slaves to a nation, the Jews' reactions to his leadership, and the impact of the above on key events in the biblical narrative are analyzed in detail. Wildavsky brings to bear on this formidable topic his considerable expertise as a political scientist.As an observant Jew who has studied the Pentateuch for over 25 years, I can honestly say that &quot;The Nursing Father&quot; opened up a brand new perspective for me on the inner meaning of the Torah. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Murder in the Mummy's Tomb (G.K.

So once I was hooked, I couldn't put it down. But the beginning was difficult because there were so many characters to remember. It was also several chapters before the murder occurred. So by the time the murder happened I still didn't know who everyone was and that made it really confusing. But needless to say, I enjoyed the book. Knowing and understanding the characters was my only dislike of the book."},{"Title":"Founder of Christianity","review":"C H Dodd, now dead, was one of the greatest biblical scholar's of the last century. His work helped to defeat that other huge presence in the 20th century--Bultmann.This slim volume starts with a forward by the famous John A T Robinson, perhaps every Christian's favorite biblical scholar.First of all, I was surprised by how readable Dodd is. Many, if not most, biblical scholars may have breathtaking arguments to make, but their writing is awful. It's like slogging through wet sand to get to the end of a chapter. Dodd writes in an interesting, logical style that's easy to read.He starts off the book by imaging a time machine going in reverse, through the Middle Ages to Constantine, to, finally, Pliny, where he starts his discussion of Christ. Pliny complains about temples now deserted, and about a slump in animal markets because so many people had stopped sacrificing to the gods.The Christians Pliny persecuted celebrated the Lord's supper, an act of remembrance. \\"The continuity of memory within the church nay be illustrated by an example. Round about 200 AD there died at Lyons....Irenaeus....(Irenaeus) recalls how they used to attend lectures by Polycarp...who used to tell them stories about 'John, the disciple of the Lord...Irenaeus, then, was able to recall at only one remove a man who had known Jesus intimately\\" (p 26-27).Much of the information here is still valuable. The one chapter that seemed the most dated is the one on the documents of the New Testament. He assumes a sayings gospel prior to the four gospels. This was likely based on the idea of the Gospel of Thomas, which so many argued should be dated early. Now, of course, it is usually dated to around 170 or even later.In the end, Dodd has reversed the time machine until he comes to the original apostles. \\"Clearly, something had changed these men\\" (p 176)."},{"Title":"Testing the Limits: Aviation Medicine and the Origins of Manned Space Flight (Centennial of Flight Series)","review":"This is a definitive review of the history of aviation medicine. It is well written and a good read, even for people with casual interest. The individual contributions of Randy Lovelace and others to the US space program are fascinating."},{"Title":"Testing the Limits: Aviation Medicine and the Origins of Manned Space Flight (Centennial of Flight Series)","review":"Maura Mackowski has written a very interesting, readable, and significant book that I am proud to have published in the Centennial of Flight Series that I edited for Texas A&M; University Press. This very fine book, based on Mackowski's Ph.D. dissertation, describes how the United States and Germany became the leaders in aviation medicine, and how those two strains of scientific research, merged after World War II--with some significant implications from Nazi research on concentration camp prisoners--to create the modern aerospace medicine discipline.This book is significant for three main reasons. First, the birth of aerospace medicine as a discipline was a very important development. It made possible human movement into the upper atmosphere and eventually into space. The human body is a very fragile biological system that cannot take even minor changes in pressure, oxygen, temperature, speed, gravity, and the like. The ability to survive in places where humans do not normally reside is has proven remarkably difficult and we still don't do it very well. Without the rise of aerospace medicine, however, we would not be able to do so at all. Aerospace medicine emerged in the 1920s and 1930s as a means of ensuring that pilots could fly in a variety of physical settings. The development of technologies--oxygen masks, goggles, heated suits, gravity suits, pressure suits, etc.--made it possible to fly higher and faster, and ultimately into space. This work is the first systematic attempt to relate the history of this important effort.Second, Testing the Limits is an excellent reading experience. The author is a former journalist who then went back to Arizona State University and earned a Ph.D. in history. She brings to the project a verve and style that let's one sail through the manuscript. It is, in essence, an important story well-told. She also understands the tricks of writing--scene setting, chapter linkages, characterization, transitions, etc.--as well as the general means of hooking and keeping a reader.Third, there are significant analyses of little known and quite controversial, topics. One that is most important relates to the incorporation of former Nazi biomedical researchers into the American aerospace medicine arena after World War II. Particularly Hubertus Strughold, head of the Third Reich's Institute of Aviation Medicine during the World War II, could be considered a war criminal. He subjected concentration camp inmates to abuse and torture, thinly disguised as aerospace medicine \\"experiments.\\"Strughold, like the more famous Wernher von Braun, came to the United States and was recognized as one of the pioneers in his field. The New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo even inducted him into its space hall of fame. This work goes far toward reconsidering his place in the history of aerospace medicine. Likewise, the Testing the Limits does an excellent job of dealing with the American giant in the field, Randy Lovelace, whose clinic in Albuquerque was a center for research into the effects of flight on the human body. The Lovelace Clinic served as the critical testing area for the Mercury astronauts, and for a series of women who underwent those same tests in 1960. Many of those women believed they were destined to become astronauts as well, and one of them (Jerrie Cobb) continued to lobby for a shuttle flight for many years. All of this forms a major part of the book.In sum, this work offers an exceptional analysis of an important but little-known story."},{"Title":"Joy and Strength","review":"Last Christmas I gave a dozen copies of this book away to friends and family, and without exception each recipient thanked me profusely for the gift of transcendent yet realistic hope and encouragement they received.

If you're like me, 90% of the content in any DBA book in the store is 'old hat'.This book is refreshing. It doesn't waste time going over all of the stuff you learned years ago.Knowing how to read an execution plan or when to pick a hash join over a nested loop join is not what this book is about. There are plenty of books on the market that cover basic, vendor specific, query tuning. I personally have about 20 of these books on my bookshelf here at home. (Over the years I've worked on Sybase, SQL Server, Informix XPS, & Oracle.)Here's the deal...Anyone who has worked with really big systems will eventually run into an optimization problem that seems to be unsolvable. You can try histograms, compressed key indexes, partitioning, pre-joined indexes, and materialized views, but you still can't get the performance that's being requested. For a DBA, it can be a very frustrating dilemma. This is especially true when you know from the data volume that you should be able to get there.The truth is, optimizers can't always get the right solution, even with correct statistics. There are some good technical reasons why this is true, but that's out of scope for my review. In any case, that's where this book comes to the rescue. I feel that it gives you some insight into the optimization problem and tells you how to correct the problems that your optimizer can't figure out.This book is NOT for use on 95% of your queries. Most optimizers will pick the correct access plan if the DBA does his/her job correctly and collects the appropriate statistics.In my experience, I get two types of problems that I have trouble getting the optimizer to solve:#1. Joining together a large number (8-14) of tables. At least 1 or 2 of the tables have over 30G of real data. By \`real data', I mean that 30G of data is actually populated.#2. Making high transaction queries read the fewest amount of buffers in order to get rid of latching problems.After I read the first few diagramming chapters of this book, I thought I'd give it a try on a problem that was recently solved at work. I was surprised. It worked, and even with my clumsiness with the method, it only took me about 2 hours to get a solution. It took us about 3 days at work. Our trial and error solution was slightly better, than what I came up with using the author's method. However, it was so close that had I used his method, I most certainly would have gone on to another problem. (The author's solution was strange because I would never have solved the join order the way that he did. His solution actually had me pick the largest table, out of 10, to drive the query. I thought this was odd because my test query had some very good filters on smaller tables.)These were the results per execution:Optimizer - 100K buffers.Trial & Error - 1700 buffers.Book method (basic graphing) - 2000 buffers.If I had known about this book, I could have solved this problem in a few hours. Instead it took several DBA's, a few day's time to come up with a solution that was only marginally better.Since this method appeared to work so well for OLTP, I went back and looked at a very large OLAP query that I had worked on last year. I and several developers had spent days trying to get it to run faster. Even with the author's method, I still couldn't make it better, but I was happy to see that the join order picked by the optimizer was almost identical to what I had calculated using the book.I plan on studying this guide over and over until I've memorized this method. I don't think it will solve every problem, but I think it gives you an edge over using experience alone.Before you purchase this book...Keep in mind, that SQL tuning is fundamentally *not a simple problem*, so readers should not buy the book expecting an easy list of simple tips and tricks. (If the problem was easy, the optimizer likely would have got it right in the first place, and you wouldn't be tuning!) The correct solution to the problem is fairly complex, as complex as it *needs* to be.Also, it's not noted anywhere, but I gathered that the author assumes that the reader will have basic high school Algebra skills, and will have taken a basic statistics course in order to fully understand the reasoning behind the explanations. Although, Algebra and statistical knowledge are probably not necessary to learn the tuning method presented. I state this because I told a good friend about this book, and his first question was, \\"Does it have a lot of math to go through?\\" So, if statistics is not your thing, don't worry. The author only presents enough information to give you a level of comfort that his method is based on mathematics. He doesn't require that you know \\"graph theory\\" or anything like that.By the way, our change from 100K buffers per transaction to 1700 buffers, dropped the CPU utilization for the website that was running the OLTP query by about 70%. That was on a 16 CPU, Sun/Solaris box. So proper SQL tuning can save you a lot of $$$."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"I have withdrawn my earlier review because I did not properly understand the importance of this book until the second reading. That is a difficult admission to make since my business is database performance tuning.This book is about tuning SQL queries in a systematic and scientific manner. It is above all about determining the optimum order in which the query engine should access the tables involved. My quibble was that join order is only a part of the whole tuning problem and most of the time the query optimizer got it right anyway. While this is true, I see now that it misses the point.The fact that the optimizer gets it right so often allows us to take join order for granted. But how do we know the optimizer got it right unless we know what the optimum join order is? That is what this book teaches, a methodology and an elegant system of notation that allows us to determine the optimum join order of the most complex query. As the author points out, the number of possible join orders increases factorially with the number of tables involved. An 8 table join has 40,320 possible join orders. That rules out trial and error for all but the simplest queries.It turns out that analyzing and diagramming according to Tow's method gives you a deep architectural understanding of the query and the problems that face you. It gives you a plan to which you can apply the tools of the trade, indexes, code optimization, etc.This is a book that will be on the shelf of serious performance tuning professionals for as long as SQL is the language of data manipulation."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"For many years the process of SQL Tuning has been considered an &quot;art&quot;. SQL tuning books written to date have presented guidelines and &quot;things to try&quot; but &quot;SQL Tuning&quot; by Dan Tow is different. This is the first book I have seen that presents a clear methodology to attack the problem in a scientific/mathematical way and includes a diagramming technique to visualize the components of a query that affect performance. Dan's book has gone a long way in helping to transform SQL tuning from an art to a science.The first four chapters of the book cover some of the subjects that are found in other SQL tuning books, and focus on the important points without delving too deeply into database internals. The really &quot;good stuff&quot; is covered in chapters 5 through 10, which includes how to &quot;draw&quot; a query diagram, and the procedures to follow to derive an optimal join order. The problems/examples presented and resolved in these chapters help the reader get a start on understanding the methodology, which can then be applied to actual tuning problems as they are encountered.So far I have applied this technique to about 20 tuning problems I have encountered on the job using the Oracle RDBMS. I still consider myself a relative novice in using the methodology, but for each of the 20 problems I have been able to significantly reduce elapsed time and resource consumption (gets/reads). Also, these results were achieved in a matter or hours, rather than days. The query diagram has even facilitated finding &quot;missing joins&quot; in some of the queries without having a knowledge of the particular application.This book is a &quot;must have&quot; for DBA's and developers and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"Like Dan, I have been doing Oracle for a long time (since 1984). I offer three opinions about Dan's book:1) learning how to do query diagrams is great for people who have never done them and this book is the best (maybe even the only) book for learning this. In learning to do the diagrams, you will understand the basic logic and basic math that an optimizer must do in order to get you a good plan. Do not worry. It is not a deep math book and there are no complex calculations. Indeed Dan shows you how basic it all really is. This gives you a deeper foundation in optimization and brings you closer to having that INFORMATIONAL CRITICAL MASS which is required to do good tuning.2) the book is outdated. As I said, I have been doing Oracle since 1984. For two decades, Dan's method of tuning and relying mostly on NESTED LOOP JOIN was the only real game in town. And Dan explains it well. Unfortunately about the time Dan published the book (2003), Oracle was entering a revolution in its design. Most notably, databases were increasing in size dramatically and this made the need for PARTITIONING strategies and PARTITION WISE HASH JOINS very high. Dan's techniques of query diagraming are still useful for understanding a query's needs, but the book is today outdated because of its lack of treatement for PARTITIONING and HASH JOIN techniques. Don't get me wrong, even outdated, this book has great value because it clarifies what you need to tell other people, why certain things happened.3) Even outdated, I learned one neat join trick which alone is worth the 20 dollars I paid for this book. Page 146 has a gem of a trick that I never considered but which I can see as offering massive benefits in a few special situations which I have faced in the past but could not solve. Thanks Dan. It is even easier to do in today's 10g and 11g databases because you need no hints to make it happen.This brings me to my last commentary. The reason I say the book is outdated is because Oracle has come so far in the last five years with its optimizer that the trick to getting Oracle to give you the right plan is to feed it good information. If you do this then it will do what Dan shows you in this book (only better than you could) and give you a great if not best plan. Thus you will rarely build a query diagram these days. Instead you will try to figure out where information was not provided to Oracle correctly and fix that. If this turns out not to be the case, then the problem is likely because the SQL is crappy and you need to rewrite it. I would say that given the right information (stats collected right, constraints created for PK,UK,FK, indexes built to support the constraints, datatypes correct for columns, not null defined when data is actually required), Oracle will produce a great or best plan 99% of the time. The other 1% of the time you will 99% of the time be doing SQL rewrites. That leaves 1/100th of 1% of queries to be a real problem. Many times your system won't be that complicated.Not being an expert in DB2 or Sql Server I cannot say how up-to-date the material remains on these databases but since I doubt their Optimizer Technology is as advanced as Oracle's there may yet be significant value retained in these two spaces. I can say that it is true that Dan's diagramming methods are universal for any database and that reading the book will provide you with that boost towards critical mass I mentioned earlier regardless of what database you use.If you are an Oracle Developer/DBA and you are new to tuning, or want to see what you know and don't know, you can't go wrong by getting this book. After reading the book, start reading about PARTITIONING and PARTITION WISE HASH JOINS. Understanding what is in this book and understanding the details of PARTITIONING and PARTITION WISE HASH JOINS in various scenarios will put you at the forefront of tuners. Maybe its time for Dan to do an updated version of the book.One last comment. I don't want this to seem like a negative review. Remember I said I have been doing Oracle since 1984. As \\"expert\\" as I am with Oracle and in tuning it (I am a reasonably good tuner for most things), I learned stuff from Dan and his book. Twenty Five years of doing it and this book still taught me things. I am very happy to have purchased this book and you will be too.Hail Flavius!"},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"Having read most of the Oracle performance tuning books on the market, I have to say this is absolutely the best pure SQL tuning book you can buy. The author teaches a unique approach to SQL tuning. He uses 'graphs' to map out the best sql plans. Though the author is an Oracle specialist the technique works with all SQL databases. He does not provide tips for the best type of join or whether 'in is better than exists'. He teaches a repeatable methodology that works. So you can solve your SQL tuning issues without guessing.I saw one negative review of this book and found the persons comments amateurish. His complaint was essentially that the author did not include information specifically about SQL Server that Microsoft gives away for free on their website and that many other books have repeatedly rehashed."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"Disclaimer: I am the CTO of youDevise Ltd., a firm that distributes a product of the author's former employer, TenFold Corporation. I worked with him on performance tuning projects several years ago during his employment there.I have been running high-volume performance tuning projects for the past four years, using both SQL Server and Oracle. Our products generate their SQL, so we cannot edit it; nevertheless, our job is to make that SQL run faster, normally with hints, indexes, and parameter changes.I have observed Dan apply the method he describes in the book to help us resolve our performance problems, and it really does work as quickly and effectively as other reviewers describe. My teams and I have also tried tuning SQL ourselves, and _that_ is as difficult and ineffective as you might expect - on more than one occasion we've had to resort to hacks like denormalisation. The difference really is a few minutes versus several days.After reading the book, I finally understand what Dan was doing that let him tune our SQL so effectively. The method is highly algorithmic - you follow a series of fairly simple steps to draw a graph and out pops a near-optimal query plan. Dan also describes how to influence your database to use the query plan you found with his method.My team and I haven't had the chance to apply Dan's method yet, but it's very simple and I'm confident we will be able to do so. I plan to make the book required reading for the team before our next project.My only complaint about the book - and it's quite a minor one - is that it doesn't cover open-source alternatives like mySQL or PostgreSQL. Applying the method to these alternative databases would be fairly simple, but coverage of the basics like identifying the query plan or influencing the optimiser would be nice to have under one cover."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"Most all database driven applications are going to use an SQL RDBMS.

This book instead teaches a methodology and does it well. No quick fixes or cookbook style approaches are presented. This book teaches action through a deep understanding of the topic at hand, and if you use SQL on systems that require high performance then this is an understanding relevant to you.Here are the key chapters:Chapter two presents the internal of the database in a solid introductory manner.Chapter three teaches you how to read execution plans.Chapter four teaches you how to control those plans on Oracle, DB2 and SQL Server.Chapter five teaches you a way to diagram the plans to understand the in more detail.Chapter six shows you how to analyse those plans then then turn that into a new execution optimized execution plan.As you can see, no quick fixes here. This is a book about a methodology and how to apply it. Bravo O'Reilly and Dan Tow for this important and unique work."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"I was entangled in the web of horrible response time queries, not knowing what to do (except the darn hit ratios were maximum). In utter frustration, I was putting an index here and dropping an index there, inserting a hint here and then setting a parameter there.Within 1 day of reading Mr. Dan Tow book, I was able to bring my biggest thorn query from 8 hours response time to just 10 minutes. Boy was I blissful. Certainly Dan Diagrams rock."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"I applied the method from the book to one of the queries used in the project I am working on (3 levels of subqueries) and successfully reduced the query time from 15 sec to less than 1 sec (I only spent 30 minutes on it). I highly recommend this book to any developer who works with SQL queries."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"I have worked with Oracle databases and SQL tuning since 1987, and the reason I recommend Dan's book so highly to anyone working with SQL is that his method is the first real method I've seen in this field. There are many approaches out there, but they all fall into the Guess & Grimacing or Checklist categories. Dan's is a REAL method, and it works for all SQL-based databases. It's so far the only SQL tuning book I can recommend. Any DBA, developer and troubleshooter working with database-centric systems should know this stuff.Mogens"},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"If you are a DBA or developer, working daily with databases that support SQL, you need this book. It covers in better detail than any other book I've seen, all the behind the scenes aspects of SQL. What happens when you join, union or correlate queries? How do you know you're hitting your indexes? What new indexes do you need? Unlike most IT reference books, this one should be read cover to cover but it holds up well as a quick reference on a topic as well. Together with O'Reilly's SQL pocket guide by Jonathan Gennick, you have a formidable tool for creating and refining good SQL statements."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"I found this book helpful, and have started to use these techniques with success.

Most of them giving information about facilities of the databases but not real life examples of how to use them. Now after reading this book I can tune SQL statements longer than 5 pages in length in just 2-3 hours. I did tuning for SQL statements having more than 20 tables in 2 hours. I am getting 4 to more than 10 times better run time performance regularly. I think this book turns black art of tuning to an engineering method.I know it will be seem to like I am working for Oreilly but definetely not. I should also recommend another Oreilly book \\"Optimizing Oracle Performance\\" together with this book.If you read both books I am sure you can do a great job.To be able use this method of tuning effectively, I created a small perl script which generates the basic frame of query diagrams needed to tune SQL statements. It works on top of Business Objects Universe metadata(eQM) to get the all join related information needed. Therefore it is a BO only solution."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"This is an OK book to get you started with SQL tuning. It is not an easy read.

With complex queries, it is often uncertain what is the best query plan. Dan Tow takes the mystery out of that process.

He also provides insights into how to achive the desired query plan."},{"Title":"SQL Tuning","review":"This book doesn't offer a practical approach to tuning Microsoft SQL Server 2000. If you want a generalist book with minimalistic theoretical ideas, this may be the one for you. If you need to become an expert at practical tuning of Microsoft SQL Server 2000, take a look at &quot;SQL Server Query Performance Tuning: Distilled&quot; instead. SQL Server 2000 has powerful Profiler and Query Analyzer tools which can be used to effectively diagnose performance bottlenecks and get SQL Server 2000 working at the high performance levels it can achieve. Those tools are basically ignored in this book. Oracle, DB2 and MS SQL Server each have specialized tools and unique performance characteristics that must be understood to get each of them performing at peak potential. In one example the author states that simple loop joins are preferable to hash joins and he even gives instructions on using join hints. This approach will get you in a world of performance trouble in the vast majority of instances. The cases were SQL Server can run out of hash join memory are virtually NIL. The facts are that it is better to understand how the cost based optimizer works and be able to tell when it has gone in the wrong direction (not real common) and coax it (not force it) into a better query plan. Learn how to use Query Analyzer to understand what the optimizer is up to.

I have to admit, this was one dramatic and overall astounding conclusion to \\"Circle of Three,\\" and I would reccomend it to anyone. Whilst Cooper and Jane are busy with their 'Bitter Pills' plans, Kate and Annie are undergoing thier final initiation as witches. Cooper, who didn't make the initiation class, seems to be wasting away her sorrow in her hard-rock guitar; but Kate and Annie are more interested in which coven they will join and what the right choice is. Little does the circle of three know, their choices will soon merge into one as the conclusion of the fifteen-book series comes to an end. And as it draws near, Annie fears that the circle of three she, Kate and Cooper had formed is really going to break up after all. But the end is full of surprises, like Cooper's decision to become initiated and the forming of a brand new coven. Like I say, this is truly the beginning of the end. I hope to see more books by Ms. Bird, but if not, I'm glad I read the Circle of Three. This is truly excellent for all young Wiccans who need a good read, a good laugh, and time to enjoy themselves."},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"I was glad to see an extra-large book to tie up the loose ends in this series in a great finale. It lessened the blow of this possibly being the end of the series.The whole series is well written, character driven, mostly realistic, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"I hate when I get hooked on these series, especially young adult. I still read young adult books, even though I am one of the few people that I know who still does! But I got hooked on this series when I was working at my Crown Books before it closed, and I unfortunately only was able to read the first three before I had to look elsewhere to find these books.The last one of the series... I think... not my favorite, but a good ending. Who knows, maybe there will be more. The series is about three girls who begin to learn about witchcraft. Some of the ideas are silly, and some of the ideas are profound. Isobel Bird has taken a subject that is a taboo to many and made the reader learn about the Wiccan religion while the characters themselves learn. Does it work? Most of the time. There are some fantasy events tied in with what is real life. A spell from a library book works, a ghost contacts a living girl, a group of fairies torment a girl. These perhaps do take away from the novels, because you want to believe in what Isobel Bird speaks about the Wiccan religion, but these supernatural events are tied in with the truth.But, otherwise, the series is awesome. My favorite one dealt with wearing a pentacle to school. The girls go through the same obsticles that I faced in high school. The real life situations are believable. The dialogue is hilarious. The endings are pretty predictable, but who cares?These 15 books have been a great read. I have learned much, and I hope there will be more."},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"I must say, this entire series has been surprisingly informative and interesting (there are even a couple of ideas that I'm interested in adapting for public rituals). I'm a 29 years old practitioner or Wicca (I've been studying for 12 years), and although these books are aimed at teenagers, I've read them all, and so have many of my friends (ages 22 to 35).As the series evolves, we see the personal growth and studies of three teenage friends as they struggle with adolescence and with their increasing interest in the pagan religion which is Wicca. This series presents their experiences as members of a study group organised by an eclectic coven (a year and a day of studies, possibly leading to initiation) and as members of their own \\"circle of 3\\", how their friendships and personal goals develop with time, how they become stronger, more mature individuals, how their families and friends react to their interest in this path, etc. The books are informative in the ways of eclectic Wicca, if I had children I'd feel completely comfortable in letting them read them, there is no gratuitous sex or violence or any such thing. Very well done, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AT LEAST BOOK 14, The Challenge Box.I bought both of those books on the same night, and I'm soooo glad i did. The way book 14 ends sends you for a total loop and you really have to start reading this one right away (at least you feel like it) This book is awesome ... the ending is soooo cool. I couldnt put it down until the very end!!"},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"In Initiation, the 15th and final book in the Circle of Three series, the time that the three girls thought they'd be excited about is here. But now things are different. As we found out in the last book Cooper isn't going to be aloud to be initiated and she doesn't understand why. Her life gets even more complicated when she finds out her father is dating again, and it's the woman she hates the most in the world. Everything that's she's looked foreword to all year is falling apart. Life is no picnic for Kate and Annie either. They are faced with the difficult decision of choosing a coven and chances are they will be separated. Kate doesn't know how to react and she's caught off guard when her ex-boyfriend Tyler starts to spend time with her again. And Annie's helping her aunt prepare for her wedding, what happens when everything falls apart in the end. Will the girls even be initiated? Read this book to find out.Just like many fans I was very sad to see this series end, but in a way I'm also happy. Isobel Bird has managed to deliver 15 strong books into a supernatural teen series without having them die out before she ended the series. This book is just as great as any of the books in the series, amazing things will happen that will change the three girls lives forever. It's amazing to see how much all of the major (and some minor) characters have grown in the series. I'm really glad I've read this series it's helped me understand a lot more about wicca as a different but beautiful religion. If you're a fan of the series reading this book is a must. Good luck reading and as one of the witches in the series would say, Blessed Be."},{"Title":"Initiation (Circle of Three, No.15)","review":"1st of all i would just like to say i am NOT 1, i am 14, there was just a problem with the regular review form. Lol. But anyway, this last book was a great finale for The Circle Of Three series. I can't believe it's over. It may not be, but there's usually a title for the upcoming book and even a passage, but it was not there. Basically, Kate, Annie, and Cooper have to deal with their Initiation...Kate will have to decide between her life in wicca, or being in Wicca for an old flame...Annie must choose the right coven also, but the upcoming wedding and her new sisters will show her what's the real path, one which will let her find her way....Cooper was not offered initiation in The Challenge Box, but finds renewed faith, but it may be broken once more... Each witch-to-be will together face a shocking revelation, including facing rejection...but the question is for all of you who haven't read the book yet, will they find the light to their destined paths?

I am 30 years old, i started reading them with my niece who is 15, she is just now starting book 6 while i am finsihed. Some might think why would a 30 year old want to read these books, well thats just it, the writer is great, and she put alot of detail and correct information in her books about Wicca, you dont find that much any where.

About this particular bool I am glad the author addresses at last the issue of solitary practitioners. Granted the series was written during a much earlier time but the references throughout the series when characters keep saying they are not Officially a witch get a bit tiresome although Ithink a lot of it is that the author felt she had a responsibility o the teens to encourage them to train with those who knew what they were doing rather than atching The Craft then deciding they were witches. But young people are also entitled to know that self study and self definition are also quite valid. I will miss this series and the circle of three.

Campbell and their involvement in Operations Desert Shield and Storm. While, on one hand, he touts the book \\"as a teaching tool... to provide insight into the African-American experience in... [American] military service\\" what is in the other hand paints a very different picture. His characterization of a female African-American pilot (LT Sharps) as one who is controlled by her hormones for a Special Forces officer and one who continually makes decisions not in keeping with flight regulations and what is best for her soldiers and the Army. His portrayal of the Sharps family as one that can never do wrong, one that has no black sheep or deviants in 130 years, rings of \\"positive racism\\" for lack of a better term. Mr. Willard's lack of knowledge of Ft. Campbell, Clarksville Base, Fiddler's Green, Sabre Army Heliport, and the surrounding communities indicate that he has not been to any of them. His lack of knowledge about military equipment, Army procedures and Cavalry traditions indicate that he has not done the necessary research, even though most could be obtained on the Internet. He referred to an OH-58D Kiowa Warrior as an OH-54D. He has the Kiowa Warrior in the book when the 2-17th Cavalry did not get them until 1996. He never mentions what Troop LT Sharps is in or if she has a Stetson Cavalry hat and spurs or not. He has LT Sharps allow a sick pilot to attempt a flight. He has LT Sharps fly a reconnaissance mission in her Kiowa by herself because the sick pilot couldn't make the flight. He has LT Sharps fly that Kiowa in a flight of one aircraft. All of the three preceding points are against flight regulations. The first is a demonstration that LT Sharps does not take care of her soldiers. The second is physically impossible because one person cannot fly the helicopter and operate the reconnaissance equipment at the same time. He has LT Sharps allow a reporter impersonating an officer to continue his deception. He does not explore the professional working relationships LT Sharps would have with her Troop Commander, Troop First Sergeant, fellow pilots and crew chiefs. He had a recommendation for an award for LT Sharps be submitted to LTC Cody who was the commander of an Apache Battalion, not the Squadron Commander of 2-17th Cavalry. He implies that the Kiowas and Apaches are part of the same battalion named the 101st Aviation Battalion. In reality, the Apaches are 3 battalions and the Kiowas are 1 (battalion-sized) squadron that are part of the 101st Aviation Brigade. He has the Commander of a National Guard water unit personally deliver a three-day pass to a specialist, thereby bypassing this soldier's Platoon Leader, Platoon Sergeant, and Squad Leader. He has C-17 cargo planes in the book when they did not enter full active service until 1995. There are more errors than what I have listed. In the light of these errors and the character flaws of LT Sharps, I am not sure what positive lessons this \\"teaching tool\\" is intending to impart, if any. I will not be recommending this book to my fellow soldiers."},{"Title":"Sword of Valor: Black Sabre #5","review":"I personally know the author of this book and i was told by a friend to read this book.

HOOAH!!!!"},{"Title":"Sword of Valor: Black Sabre #5","review":"SWORD OF VALOR by Tom Willard is the fifth installment of the Black Sabre Chronicles. In this highly educational and entertaining installment, Willard showcases women in the military during the Operation Desert Shield entanglement in the Middle East. He focuses on the role that women played in times of wars that is often left to speculation. Furthermore, Willard continues the saga of the Sharps family. The Sharps are an African-American, five-generational military family and with SWORD OF VALOR, Argonne Sharps is the focal point.As Argonne heads off to war in the Middle East, SWORD OF VALOR takes you into the life and history of her family and the contribution the family has made to the military for the past 130 years. Reflecting methodically on their upbringing as members of the military and as members of a military family, a historical account is laid before our eyes. Added to this account are the genuine feelings and reflections of the non-military members of the Sharps family. Through them we come to the realization that some only imagine as they wait and learn the fate of their loved ones during times of battle. Written in a descriptive and definitive language, readers receive a lesson in patriotism, loyalty and familial ties that bind.Reviewed by Dawn R.

Buy this.Do you want to relive a magic moment in the past, or want a better understanding of what the spirit of the 60s was all about? Buy this!Do you want to laugh, cry, and have a great time? Buy this!!Spit in the Ocean #7 brings to a conclusion a project Ken Kesey started more than a quarter of a century ago. In 1974, he laid out plans to self-publish seven issues of a literary magazine by this title, each issue to have a different theme and editor. By 1981, six issues had appeared, but the leader of the Merry Pranksters was ready to move on to other ventures.Now, two year's after Kesey's departure at age 66, his friend Ed McClanahan has edited that final issue of \\"Spit,\\" appropriately all about the man who gave the world so much joy. There are contributions from famous names like Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe and Larry McMurtry, but there's also lots from others who were touched by Kesey's boundless spirit and zest for life.There are letters, interviews, memoirs, song lyrics, photos and more between these covers. I bet Kesey would have loved it. If they could have somehow included a DVD and scratch-and-sniff, he would have loved it even better. This book does a wonderful service in keeping alive the spirit of the writer, painter, filmmaker, jester, teacher, activist, wrestler, leader and lover of life named Ken Kesey.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Spit in the Ocean, No. 7: All About Ken Kesey","review":"This book is loving remembrances of people who knew Kesey. Halfway through the book I forced myself to slow down, because I did not want to finish the book so fast. I wanted to savor the innate wisdom and humor of Ken Kesey for as long as possible. The world is a richer place because of his passing through it, and this book shares some of his life with us. He truly fought the good fight. His spirit is carried on by the many friends he had, and I thank them for sharing with us."},{"Title":"Spit in the Ocean, No. 7: All About Ken Kesey","review":"Only two reviews for this (well, now three)? How unfortunate. A lovely, insightfully odd, and sometimes twisted tome. Good reading for this distant admirer of the thoughts and processes of the time, the place, and the man."},{"Title":"Spit in the Ocean, No. 7: All About Ken Kesey","review":"I don't know how it all got started. Going back at least 25 years, a friend and myself were in his garage listening to the Dead and building stained glass windows on a hot summer day in preparation for a Dead show that he was going to be selling at. The Dead were almost always playing out of the Ghetto Blaster in his garage while we worked, and on this one particular day, Bob began talking about this guy Kesey, and how he was such a huge influence on the Grateful Dead, as well as dozens of other people during the 60s counter culture, of which Bob himself was completely immersed at that time. While cutting and bending lead and placing pieces of beautiful colored glass together to form what soon would become the face of Jerry Garcia, I stood listening to his fascinating, if not obscure details, of this guy Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. I don't remember him mentioning the fact that this was the guy that wrote One flew over the Cuckoo's nest; a fact which until quite recently was revealed to me in a book called: On the Bus: The Complete Guide to the Legendary Trip of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and the Birth of the Counterculture by Paul Perry. Regardless, I learned a few things about Kesey from listening to Bob, but just could not envision his personal experience and knowledge of the now late Prankster. Ahaa! That's how it all got started! I got to thinking about Bob again, all these years later, and his portrayal of Ken Kesey. LSD was part of that conversation, so naturally, I read Huxley's Doors of Perception a few months ago, then one thing led to another; the next thing being: On the Bus! I then read The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, which led me straight to this heartwarming wonderful book, Spit #7, which describes the many life situations from close friends of Ken Kesey, and the sometimes hilarious things that went on in those days of discovery and creation. Dear reader, I say heartwarming because by the end of the last part of Spit in the Ocean #7, I was literally wiping tears from my eyes in great happiness, as well as sadness at knowing that here was a man I knew very little about that had influenced me in ways that I could not have imagined, until reading all of these books about him, and that nearly everyone that walks the streets today has most likely been indirectly effected by him as well. Those things he set into motion, so many years ago. Knowing what I know now about Kesey; those things that Bob was trying to convey to me, all those years ago was the fact that this wonderful soul was so important an influence in the past, present, and hopefully the future, should not be the unsung hero that he has become. He was a multitalented artist; lover of life and people that did so much for personal freedom and expression, yet has unfortunately; like the counterculture of the 60s, gone the way of the tie die t-shirt. He should rather be taught in schools as a great American figure that was dedicated to the proposition that all humankind should be able to create equally. Perhaps in some small ways, the things that Ken Kesey started in the 60s is still with us, but the more we know, the better, so read this book. If you should read those aforementioned books in the order that I did, this book will be the topper.

No such luck. Unfortunately, I bought all four of the books right off the bat and have an acute sickness where I feel obliged to finish what I start from beginning to end and this unfortunately includes these four long, drawn out, christ clone trilogy wanna-be-but-falls-way-short books. My overally recommendation is to save yourself the time, energy, and frustration of these 4 books which could be and SHOULD BE summed up in one book of about 400-500 pgs. no more, no less. If you really want a VERY similiar and WAY more exciting version of these books - I strongly urge you to pass these over enroute to the Christ Clone Trilogy which keep you guessing for awhile and are about 1 Million times more intellectually stimulating. A word of caution, however, the down-sides of Christ Clone Trilogy is that it ends far too abruptly after so much build up to the final battle (as stated in Revelations) and becomes over the top preachy in addition to leaving a number of questions still unanswered. It gives the impression that the author just got tired of writing on the topic and looked for a quick way out. However, far preferred over the Prodigal Project Series which unlike the Christ Clone Trilogy will not leave you at the end of each book hungry for more."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Project Book II: Exodus (Prodigal Project (Paperback))","review":"I've been looking forward to reading this book since GENESIS captured my imagination, and I wasn't disappointed at all.

Completely different from the Left Behind Series but along the same time frame."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Project Book II: Exodus (Prodigal Project (Paperback))","review":"Let's get it out of the way- I have to force myself to read this novel, the second instalment of Abraham and Hart's Prodigal Project series and I held very little hope that it would improve at all. Not to mention that if his style of writing continues into the remaining five books then this entire series could have been condensed into one single two hundred or so volume.The beginning didn't bode well for the rest of the book, nothing more than a rehash of previous events and sermon, which had been repeated unnecessarily more times than I'd like to count in the first two hundred pages of Book One. Fifty pages could be turned into one and his point would still be pushed sufficiently to proceed. The question is, what is the point?I stick firmly by my opinion that Abraham and Hart are crazy, Bush loving Republicans- the sort that would have changed \`French' fries into \`freedom' fries because of their objection to an entire nation (yet I have to wonder, if they hated the French that much then why not just remove the object of objection (the \`fry') rather than rename it?). They even have some more than obvious PC attacks on homosexuals, pushing the notion that this is a \`two sex world' and one goes with the other- even adding the obligatory new romance which is enough to bug me further.The only thing of consequence to happen in the beginning was Thomas Church's miraculous (and thoroughly ridiculous) discovery of his son. This is the only incidence in when I think it would have been appropriate to add a few more pages to a scene.Around ninety percent of this book is a reiteration of everything that is said in the instalment, and other than the confirmation that no, Noir cannot be killed, the fiery hail and one hint towards something sinister in Azul, nothing (and I mean nothing) of any consequence happens and this entire book could have been edited out.I doubt that I will read the next instalments- even though I could probably skip three and five without missing anything, because this is nothing more than a repetitive, Republican piece of propaganda. I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Force is With Us: The Conspiracy Against the Supernatural, Spiritual, and Paranormal","review":"I've read hundreds of books trying to answer many of life's plaguing questions. What Dr. Walker has done, is to put into one volume the important information from all those many books. He has worked tirelessly over many years researching and uncovering facts to bring to the reader the scientific evidence available on many topics regarding vital force energies. This vital force is key to who and what we are and also to what we can be. Dr. Walker has written this book in a style similar to the Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot. If you enjoyed Talbot's book, you'll love this book even more because Dr. Walker keeps the reader turning pages almost as if you are reading a fast-paced mystery novel, all in a simple-to-understand language. A great go-with book if you enjoyed the movie \\"What the Bleep Do We Know? Topics covered include everything from cold fusion to the Egyptian pyramids; the power of prayer to heart transplants; psychokinesis and ESP to the Cydonia pyramids on Mars; Ch'i Gong; Tai Ch'i; chakras; holographic images; Kirlian photography and something called orgone; scientific discoveries and inventions from the Wright brothers to William Reich; Edison to George Lucas. All this and much more crammed into the book's 450-plus pages. Underneath the wealth of information in this book is the story of what happens to scientists who provide facts against the status quo of the scientific community. The reader discovers that many of our greatest questions about life have been studied, but the answers have been repressed, destroyed, and discredited. This is one of those books you will want to keep within arm's reach. One of my top 20 favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The Force is With Us: The Conspiracy Against the Supernatural, Spiritual, and Paranormal","review":"A riveting,exciting, highly readable book which without doubt will generate renewed interest in the supernatural by both belivers and non believers.For anyone who wonders WHY this book is a must.

I give ittwo thumbs up !"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society field guide to North American butterflies (Audubon Society field guide series)","review":"This field guide has significant strengths and weaknesses. First, the strengths. This book provides what most casual butterfly enthusiasts want, page after page of photos of butterflies (several hundred photos as a matter of fact). The photographs are good, for the most part, showing differences and similarities between many butterflies included in the book. (Most taxonomic characters are not readily seen in photos though.) One particularly helpful feature is that for many butterflies, such as skippers and those bearing eye-spots, both the upper and underside of wings are shown.The butterflies are arranged, for the most part, by wing coloration or shape. This can help with more rapid field identification. There is also a section in the back of the guide that provides more information on butterflies listed.The book is a convenient size, readily able to fit into a jacket or back pocket.OK, now for the weaknesses.As with other field guides published by the Audubon Soc...I can't figure out why the editors didn't include the scientific names along with the common names by each photo. If you want to use this book for any kind of taxonomic work, it becomes an annoying exercise in page flipping from the front to the back of the book. More serious entomologists will, of course, use taxonomic keys to identify specimens, but for the amateur collector who may not have or know how to use such keys, the format of the book can be frustrating.There are too few photos of caterpillars, chrysalises, etc. at the front of the book. I know of no field guide that provides much on early life stages, and this guide is no different. Don't get me wrong, I'm pleased that they included a section on caterpillars, I just wish there were more.There is very little information on the kinds of characteristics usually used in butterfly taxonomy...antenna type, wing veination, etc...presented in the book. A significant weakness.Even with the large number of photographs, a photo cannot, in my opinion, do the same job of a well-done illustration in helping someone identify what they are looking at. As photo-based guides on butterflies, this is probably one of the best out there. Still, I wish there were a good general guide based on illustrations.With that said, it is important to realize that no single field guide can ever hope to be comprehensive in treating the butterflies. There are simply too many species and variations out there to make a portable field guide.With all that said, I think that this is a good, useful guide, but with a few changes it could be even better.4 stars.Happy butterfly spotting!Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN"},{"Title":"National Audubon Society field guide to North American butterflies (Audubon Society field guide series)","review":"I use both Audubon Society and Petersons small wildlife identification guides and find that are quite good with their own plus and minuses. Petersons is better for taking into the field for things that move (animals and insects) due to the layout which allows for quicker identification. Audubon is better for things that can't get away (plants) and with animals and insects, for obtaining data about the creature's habitat. This guide is as good as any other in their series, which is to say that it is very good."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society field guide to North American butterflies (Audubon Society field guide series)","review":"This book covers all of the native and introduced species of butterflies in North America north of Mexico. There are good quality photographs taken in the field of most of the adults and some of the caterpillars and eggs. Not all of the variations are shown but showing many variations of each species in a national guide would make it too big and confusing to easily use in the field. Ranges are described verbally but there are no maps. Host plants are named and listed alphabetically in the index. The volume is a convenient size to carry and has a sturdy plastic cover.As a national guide this book is a good next step from the Golden Guide. It is also a good source of information for planning a butterfly garden."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society field guide to North American butterflies (Audubon Society field guide series)","review":"Good comprehensive descriptions of all the North American butterflies - same ammount of info as, say, a typical Peterson bird book has on each species. The pictures leave a lot to the immagination. Try to identify half the N American 'Sulphurs' with these photos. Colour illustrations would be much better - they don't go out of focus either. I had to use other books as well for more difficult species. This book with plates in the style of 'European Butterflies' by Higgins and Riley would be the perfect field guide.

That being said as the enthusiast continues in the hobby and their library on butterflies grows it is not the type of book one will discard, \\"re-gift\\" or consign to the back of the shelf.

First, there are countless numbers of species listed, which is essential to identify a particular specimen. It is also very detailed in the description of the species in the back of the book.

Anyone stating that this is for the very beginning amateur must have the wrong field guide altogether!

We got them to identify butterflies, insects and spiders in our midwestern back yard. It is often difficult to find the bugs we are looking for. We've had much more luck with Kenn Kaufman's \\"Field Guide to Insects of North America\\". In some ways it's more user friendly, with lots of bugs photos on one page and descriptions that are on the opposing text page. The Audubon guide is set up so that you have to flip back and forth between images in one section and text/description in another - which can be tedious - however, the Audubon descriptions are much more thorough than Kaufman's."},{"Title":"National Audubon Society field guide to North American butterflies (Audubon Society field guide series)","review":"Author Robert Pyle's butterfly cred is impeccable, and the photos are mostly very good, but I was disappointed to find that this guide lacks range maps.

It's comprehensive in terms of covering many species across the whole continent, but since the first half of the book is just color photos with no range maps and the last half is just dense text with no pictures, you will spend a LOT of time flipping back and forth. Since the book is arranged by color within category for the whole continent, things can get tedious. For example, there are over 120 photos of folded-wing skippers, all of which are tiny and brownish. By the time you've flipped back and forth, back and forth to figure out which one you saw, it probably has grown-up children.If you're lucky enough to be in one of the states covered by a guide written by Jaret C. Daniels, you'll find those guides much easier to use: Each species is on a double-page color spread with photos of the butterfly and larva, and extra photos of the male and female where appropriate. You'll also see a range map, a calendar of when it's out and about, a full-size silhouette, list of host plants, and more.

Marti gives numerous examples, suggested clauses, and pointers in how to best use trusts. Further, Marti gives the reader suggestions on how to broach certain estate planning and trust strategies subjects to one's attorney.I must, in all fairness, say to the reader that this is not a book that will show you how to prapare your own trust. If the reader desires such a book, perhaps he/she should look elsewhere. There are quite a few books that will show the reader how to draft a legally valid living trust. I especially like the one published by Nolo Press which is available right here at amazon.com. However, if the reader would prefer to have a very broad, comprehensive, detailed and in-depth discussion of the subject of trusts, that is very readable and user-friendly, I would very highly recommend Marti Shankman's The Complete Book of Trusts without any reservation whatsoever.In sum, The Complete Book of Trust is a great value. So, here is what I have to say: buy it; read it; and use it by bringing the subjects relevant to your own estate planning concerns, to your attorney's attention; so that you can accomplish your very own estate planning goals."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Trusts","review":"Read &quot;Beyond the Grave, The Right Way and the Wrong Way of Leaving Money to Your Children&quot; instead of this book or before you read this book.

Reason being, I could not wait to get my hands on a reference book to help me conceptualize projects and cases that I presently deal with at work as a new estate and tax planning attorney. I hear about ABC trusts, GST trusts, Living Trusts, just to name a few, every day. Yet I don't have the slightest idea about the particular mechanics of many of these valuable estate planning and tax saving tools.I have only begun to read this book, but so far it has impressed me with its clarity and simplicity in explaining the particulars of the different types of trusts available. It is great for someone like myself who is beginning to practice law in this area. Additionally, I would recommend this book to a law student interested in entering this field or one who is currently taking a trusts and estates course.A word of caution, this is not a book to assist you with drafting your own trust. Although it is a good prep material with which to study up on before consulting with an attorney. In my short experience, clients with at least some knowledge of what is available to them benefit more from the time spent with lawyers and consultants who will actually draft their trusts and related documents.I also recommend this book to people that are wary of attorneys and who are intimated by the complex jargon of the legal industry. The more one knows about what trusts are available and which may be more advantageous, the likelier they will feel confident in their estate planning documents."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Trusts","review":"The Cmplete Book of Trusts is an excellent reference for general knowledge about a very cmplex subject!

He helps the reader understand which assets should be transferred to a trust, what the legalities are, the limitations of trusts, and most importantly, how structuring trusts effectively can assist with saving taxes and assuring your family is taken care of in the manner you desire. Be advised, this is not a book that will help you write your own trusts. Shenkeman is clear that effective planning really requires coordination among the financial professionals that you trust--your attorney, CPA, financial planner, insurance broker etc. However, if you are thinking about setting up trusts and you read this book, you will be positioned to have an intelligent and productive conversation with your financial team members. You will be part of your team, part of the decision making process, and not a passive bystander to the planning that affects your life and the life of those you love.I would also say that The Complete Book of Trusts, is a great book for any professional who is working in this area. His observations, insights and specific analysis make his book an excellent reference tool. It is definitely a book for your library.James Lange, CPA/Attorney and author of Retire Secure!

The action kept the story moving very well, and while there was certainly some Biblical/Historical elements that were key to the plot, this wasn't nearly as 'eye-opening' or 'controversial' as other books in this genre.

I actually found this book while looking through a bookstore and read the reviews on it. I was amazed that there were reviews from Steve Berry (who is currently my favorite writer), and James Rollins (2nd favorite) wrote some great reviews on it, so I decided what the hell I would try it out.Well I was not disappointed at all. Wow!! I have to say I liked it better than the Da Vinci Code. Now I know a lot of people might disagree with me but the way it is written was fantastic. It kept me wanting to keep reading it and not put it down. And the way that he left little hints about what was going to happen at the end of some of the chapters, I loved it. Loved the characters and really didn't want the book to end. Great contraversial subject just loved it.

That raised him from three to four stars in my estimation. This was a great book right up to the end when it wimped out with a one-paragraph flop of a conclusion.Second, I am persuaded that religions as now organized are a form of organized crime, and that we would all do better going with unitarian communitarian approaches in which we deal direct with God on a personal basis, and direct with one another on a community basis. With a handful of exceptions (Rabbi Lerner, Archbishop Tutu) most church \\"officials are in my view santimonious frauds, and any fictional book that helps portray that is inherently useful.The author himself recommends the following books:Holy Blood, Holy Grail Illustrated Edition: The Secret History of Jesus, the Shocking Legacy of the GrailThe Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of ChristRosslyn: Guardian of the Secrets of the Holy GrailJesus and the Lost Goddess: The Secret Teachings of the Original ChristiansCuriously, he does not mentionThe Da Vinci Codeor the Gospel of St. Thomas (not a book, search for it).I also recommend:Founding Faith: Providence, Politics, and the Birth of Religious Freedom in AmericaThe Left Hand of God: Taking Back Our Country from the Religious RightAmerican Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On AmericaDVDGandhi (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Little did the author know that his constant use of the phrase 'little did he know..' and its ilk to foreshadow his absurd plot would cause me to hurl his book into a garbage can after 186 pages."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"The author attended the University of Pittsburg where he played football, wrote for three newspapers.

When I first picked up the book I thought oh no another writer jumping on the Dan Brown band wagon, but I thought this book was far better than the Da Vinci Code and although it now seems to be the done thing to knock Dan Brown's offering, I am not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code very much.A Vatican priest is found on the coast of Denmark. He has been nailed to a cross not far from Hamlet's castle. He is the first of many victims caught up in a cruel and vicious spate of killings that happen across the world. Each killing replicating the crucifixion of Christ.At virtually the same time deep in the Roman catacombs of Orvieto, an archaeologist uncovers an ancient scroll dating back two thousand years.

I recommend it, with some major reservations.On the one hand, SIGN OF THE CROSS has a remarkably ambitious and inventive plot. It is similar to THE DA VINCI CODE in that sense. Like Dan Brown, Mr. Kuzneski has done a great deal of research on alternative histories of Christianity. He does a very decent job weaving much of this historical research into the storyline. By reading this novel, I learned a lot of interesting facts about the Christian religion, as well as Roman history.This novel, like the DA VINCI CODE, is very fast paced and contains a number of exciting action scenes that are well done. This novel also takes place in a variety of countries, like Denmark, Libya, China, Italy, Thailand and the United States. The chapters are relatively short, and this novel is hard to put down once you get started. This book also has a relatively good climax -- there is a major revelation at the end of this novel that I thought was highly creative.The major flaw of SIGN OF THE CROSS is the characterization and dialogue. There are too many characters in this book, and Kuzneski keeps switching the perspective from character to character. As a result, no single character is fully fleshed out, and many characters comes across as little more than cardboard cutouts that rush from one action scene to another. Some of the supporting characters are downright cartoonish. Also, much of the dialogue in this novel is rather stilted and kind of clunky.I must also admit that I didn't really care for Jonathon Payne, one of the \\"heroes\\" of this book. Payne is supposed to be a good guy, but has few qualms about using extremely violent tactics (i.e. torture) to achieve his goals. Payne is also a bit too invulnerable and superhuman for my tastes, more of a bland action hero than a real human being.As a result, I felt very little emotional engagement in the story since I didn't feel very much sympathy for any of the characters. If Kuzneski had made his characters more three dimensional and vivid, this could have been a genuinely great novel.Overall, though, I was impressed enough with the plot of this novel to recommend it. I think Kuzneski has exceptional plotting and research skills, but he needs to work more on his dialogue and characterization. If he does that, he could become the next Dan Brown or Steve Berry.Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"It's not a literary classic by any means, but I just found the book to be extremely entertaining in the best way,I could compare to watching Terminator 2. It's not gonna win any Oscars for Arnold's acting or the direction, but it's a blast while you're watching it."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I did not like this book and it is my own fault for succumbing to curiosity; I did not see how anything could be new on the topic after DA VINCI CODE and Kathy Reich's BREAK NO BONES....The subject of whether Christ died on the cross or not has been stirred too many times and no real thinker will buy these suppositions anyway.But while the author is gripping in his descriptives of the crimes ( i.e: crucifictions, helicoptor crashes, etc) that seems to be his only forte.He gives in to name dropping, mentioning Stephen King and Dan Brown for example, as if to alert us that he knows his story has been done before and that he is a reader, too. It is amateurish.A maddening error is seen when a character asks himself a question and it is answered for him by the author. Then there are the teases at chapter ends and the sudden yanks back to reality when he reminds us he is writing a book, when the hallmark of a good novel is that the reader enters into it completely and loses touch with the world of reality for the duration. It is my belief that it is never wise to attempt to mix humor with drama.I tossed the book aside but then a few days later leafed through the parts I had not read, but it did not improve my opinion."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"The overcrowded shelves of Anti-Catholic action-packed thrillers with obvious plot twists and Da Vinci-esque secret histories and a video-gamers indifference to body counts and gore finds its sophomoric expression in this forgettable page-turner.Kuzneski's action starts with a detailed crucifixion, and then follows up with live human bodies melting into asphalt while a flamethrower wielding henchman cackles in glee. Every time a violence passage came along I thought \\"video game transition\\" and wondered which one it was...\\"Commando?\\" or \\"Grand Theft Auto?\\"Kuzneski's formula is someone dies every seventh paragraph and the tough guys hijack a car or pick an impregnable lock every other page.The Anti-Catholic plot surrounds archeologist Dr. Charles Boyd and his (beautiful, naturally) assistant Maria Pelati who discover a 2000-year-old scroll underneath the Papal retreat of Orvieto that contains \\"a secret that would change... the history of the world--forever.\\" If you guessed that the secret is that Christ Jesus is a fraud, well just add \\"Da Vinci Code Fan\\" to your pieces of flair!My old roommate Moby was once in a comic punk rock group called \\"The Vatican Commandos.\\" Swish-Swiss guys in colorful puffy pants don't cut it, sooo Kuzneski, ever the laugh riot, creates real Vatican Commandos, who callously slaughter innocent folks right and left throughout the book. If you are still looking for hints on where to find the blatant Anti-Catholicism in the book, here is a hint....check out those crazy Ten Commandments that Faithful Catholics are supposed to follow. Oddly \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" is still there and strangely fleshed out in the Catechism, if Kuzneski would have bothered to read it.Catholic bashing is too much fun though, so he adds piles of corrupt and clean Western European law enforcement agents and two freelance CIA agents into the mix as hard guys and detectives (ooopss...by the end of the book, so many folks are CIA agents it reminded me of the original Casino Royale spoof where everyone became James Bond).There are a lot of page-turning cat and mouse games and alliances change so quick you need a bulletin board and push pins to follow it all. This packs the plot of a thousand pulp fictions and a cast of thousands together, detail is always the sketchy \\"gee whiz\\" kind, and never fleshed out beyond the most superficial of treatments, but it is an action book after all. But anyone who knows anything about Italian and Roman history, the Church, or the way real law enforcement works will find this frustrating. This is an Adam West and Burt Ward version of the Vatican-Plot-To-Enslave-The-World-With-Their-Fabulous-Riches-Secrets-And-All-Powerful-Lies.VaticanSecret+CIA+GameboyViolence+SexyBabe = Obvious page turner that is offensive and ignorant every other paragraph. Marshmallow Fluff has more substance and nutritional value."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Although he claims in the Author's Note to have first come up with the idea for Sign of the Cross back in 1998, it is clear that Chris Kuzneski's novel owes more than a little to The Da Vinci Code. Both books deal with millennia-old conspiracies that, if revealed, threaten the existence of Christianity by calling into question the nature of Jesus. There is also at least one direct reference to Dan Brown in Kuzneski's book.From a publisher's standpoint, distributing a novel like this makes clear sense, as it exploits the popularity of the hottest fictional work in the last decade or more. And in ways, Sign of the Cross delivers, as it is an action-filled novel much in the same vein as Brown's book.The story starts off with three separate plot lines that only slowly converge. In one, Nick Dial, an American homicide detective working for Interpol investigates the murder of a priest in Denmark; the victim has been crucified and there are a number of clues that point to a religious nature of the murder; soon, other, similar killings will occur.. In the second storyline, archaeologist Charles Boyd and his beautiful assistant Maria Pelati unearth a hidden catacomb in the Italian town of Orvieto; among the artifacts they find is a scroll about Jesus and how the Roman emperor Tiberius intended to deal with him. No sooner do they make their discovery than they are ambushed and almost killed by assassins; while they do escape, they are suddenly fugitives. In the third storyline, Jonathon Payne and his sidekick David Jones, two heroic characters from a previous Kuzneski book called The Plantation are forcibly recruited by the CIA to track down Boyd. Payne and Jones are your stereotypical ex-superspy sorts, formerly members of a secret government agency (called MANIAC of all things) who now do private adventuring.This is not a great book; it is actually subpar. It is fast-moving and somewhat fun, and Kuzneski is a good plotter. Unfortunately, he is not a very good writer. At times, he seems to forget some of the fundamentals of writing: for example, when Nick Dial makes a phone call - and the narration is clearly from his point of view - we cannot be told that the person on the other end is rolling his eyes. Kuzneski also has an annoying habit of ending his chapters not with mini-cliffhangers but rather teasers, such as \\"Of course, that was nothing compared to the evidence that Frankie was about to uncover next.\\" Once or twice, such teasers might be okay, but in multitude, they are just unpleasant. In general, his dialogue is flat and his characterization is rather superficial.There is an epilogue that seems like Kuzneski's wishy-washy attempt to avoid angering Christians (at least Brown doesn't shy from controversy). Despite the many problems, however, I was actually entertained much of the time, so as I wavered between two and three stars, I will favor this book with the higher rating. Nonetheless, it is not a book I can really recommend; if you enjoy Dan Brown, you're better off looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I buy books in an odd way.. if I find a new author to me.. and they have many books out.. I sit and read a few chapters in the bookstore.. and if I'm hooked on the book.. I wander BACK to the aisle.. and pick up EVERY book they have.. and buy them all. This is the book that I started reading in the store! It is extremely fast paced. Unique in today's world of publishing! This author.. must be madder than a hatter.. as I've never read anyone quite like him! lol. (that's a good thing!) 'Sign of the Cross' took me a day to read.

While the subject of the mysteries of the Catholic Church and Christianity have been done many times, one more can't hurt if it's done right and if it's believable. Unfortunately, this story wasn't which is why I can't give it more than two stars. It started off with promise, a mysterious crucifixion of a Vatican priest on a deserted Danish coast, then went progressively downhill from there. There are several flaws with this book. First, there are no clear cut protagonists or antagonists. Payne and Jones are supposed to be the main investigators, yet they spend most of their their time running around Europe clueless and incompetent. I'm still trying to figure out why Nick Dial, Mr. Interpol Man was even in the story. He spends his time chasing crucifixions in the four corners of the globe, yet never made the connection until the last man was strung up. So much for good detective work. There were too many other characters in the story for the reader to keep track of who's who and their relevance. While the book itself was an easy read, the language was choppy, faked and childish at times. No good author writes a descriptive paragraph then begins the paragraph following it with \\"Anyhow\\" or \\"Anyway\\". You're telling a story, not having a conversation over latte at Starbucks. Even the profanity seemed forced and fake and if I read one more \\"little did he know\\", I wanted to scream. Kuzneski has potential, but he definitely needs the guidance of some of the heavy hitters in this genre like Dan Brown and Nelson DeMille, who ironically gave this book rave reviews, along with some other well known authors and critics. Reviews that seem to be as fake as the story in his book."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"It was difficult to put down once you started reading it. I enjoyed it and have purchased his other two books. He is a good young writer!"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Sign of the Cross is an engaging and fast paced story. Author Chris Kuzneski writes complex plots and rich characters. I know readers who enjoy Christianity conspiracy theories will enjoy the book. For readers who don't, read Sign of the Cross anyway. The conspiracy theories aren't my favorite fare, and I loved this book.Multiple story lines can be confusing, but the readers will care about the well written characters. Some characters stand out like the tough guy Payne with a sense of humor. From the first line, Kuzneski sets the pace with a story that doesn't end until the last page. It's not a story that you can coast through--not only will you miss some nugget of information, but you'll miss getting everything the book offers. Kuzneski does an impressive job of research, plotting, dialogue, and rounded characters. He makes characters and scenes believable and exciting. When you think you know what side everyone is on, you're wrong. That's a feat, and a sign of a great author!"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I have read a lot of these historical thrillers that blend fiction and facts; Dan Brown, Douglas Preston, Sansom, Mariani, Adams, Khoury just to name a few. Some have been better than others - but this is the first time where I wonder, how and why the author/book has become a bestseller. The blending of fiction and fact is quite poor, the story is not gripping (the thing that is supposed to turn the world upside down is not that big a thing) and the language is not convincing at all.Some more specific examples: Several times (in two books, also Plantation) he talks about how the heroes don't have to follow the procedures of the police and the law, and he argues: \\"the beauty of it is that unlike the police and law, they are just looking for the truth\\". Hello, what is the police supposed to be doing?Furthermore, again a minor but to me annoying note: A specific person had to ask 3 different people in Helsingr in Denmark (at the castle) before he found someone who could speak English. Well, unless he approached the 80 years old gardener, everyone working at that tourist-site can speak English. Just goes to show, for me at least, that this person has not done any extensive research on the countries and settings his scenes take place in.If you like these kind of novels and heroes, go for John Rollins or some of the above."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Thirty miles north of Copenhagen in Helsingor, Denmark, Father Erik Jansen is crucified on a cross with a sign nailed to the top: \\"IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER\\". By the time touring students find the deceased, his corpse is rotted gray and birds are dining on his flesh. The next day, identical homicides occur in other parts of the world.At the same time of the crucifixion murders, archeologist Dr. Charles Boyd leads a dig at the Middle Ages \\"Vacation Vatican haven underneath Orvieto, Italy. There he believes he will find a depository of scrolls; that is if he and his crew can locate the Catacombs that most of his peers classify on a par with the Loch Ness monster. Boyd proves right as he and his assistant Maria Pelati make a discovery that would destroy Christianity. Now they are targets of several diverse groups, one of which is killing priests already and another is sanctioned by the Vatican. Their only hope to stay alive long enough to show their finding from first century Rome to the world reside in the penitentiary in Pamplona, Spain where former MANIACS Jonathan Payne and David Jones linger waiting for \\"official\\" intervention.Loosely echoing the Brown phenomena, SIGN OF THE CROSS is an action-packed Christian conspiracy thriller that goes full speed from the onset (with the murder of Father Erik) and never slows down until the final explanation of the finding. The fast-paced story line grips the audience as the plausibility of the discovery seems reasonable so that the too many cat and mouse encounters that follow appear possible. Though the cast in some ways come out of Brownian 101 casting, readers will appreciate Chris Kuzneski strong thriller that refreshes the Christian conspiracy sub-genre.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Pros: Action, fast-paced, keeps you readingCons: superficial, testosterone enhanced, \\"guy\\" novel"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this one.

Sometimes it was hard to tell what was fact and what was fiction. His books always make me think if things are possible."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Compared to the later story I read first, he keeps getting better with each book. This, one of his earlier works, shows his flaws as it jumps all over the place. It's hard to tell who the main characters are and it turns out, there are at least three. There are Payne and Jones, the two main-main characters. Then there is the Interpol guy, Nick Dial. He's the main character. Then there are the transient characters for this story, Maria and Boyd, the two archeologists. They are real archeologists, but both also have secrets, secret lives, secret whatevers. All of this converges into a story about the biggest scam of all time, a scam that will shake the foundations of religion, at least one religion.Of course, the author has to leave openings or he would obviously alienate a good chunk of his audience. That being said, he has a lot of fun with theories that have been suggested by others and turned them into a rousing adventure. The resolution still leaves plenty of doubt as to what really happened and should keep those more devout from going off the deep end. After all, this is just a story, and he makes no claims that it is anything else.As for the story, my only beef is that it seems a bit disjointed in spots. It jumps around so much before things start to flow together. Once it does, about halfway through the book, the story picks up pace and it works. I really like his style for the most part. Short chapters, mostly short paragraphs, plenty of dialogue and plenty of space on each page. He doesn't try to lecture his reader too much. The grammar is not bad though he tends to head-hop a lot which can be a bit annoying. Otherwise, his writing is a real pleasure.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Kept my interest from begining to end.Have already ordered more books on CD by this author."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"If this novel had been written before all the hoopla over 'The DaVinci Code', the plot would have seemed innovative and provocative. However, 'The Sign of the Cross' is yet another Dan Brown clone, posing all the standard ideas of the divinity of Jesus, conspiracy by the Catholic Church, and protagonists who battle amazing odds, but in the end, don't expose their findings to the world.The plot deals with three main storylines: an archaeologist and his assistant who find hidden catacombs and a mysterious scroll (very 'DaVinci'); an Interpol agent trying to track down the perpetrators of several crucifixions of seemingly random men; and two characters apparently from Kuzneski's first book, Payne and Jones, the action heroes who help save the day after being liberated from a Spanish prison. The elements are pretty complex, and Kuzneski does a good job bringing the characters together. However, there are a few too many twists and turns that stretch credibility. Also, I got tired of too many sentences starting with \\"Anyhow,...\\" Worth reading, but don't expect any major revelations."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Given that this author is still probably on the lite side of 30, or was when this was written, it must be acknowledged that he has a major talent in the super-charged, religious conspiracy theme novels that are still earning tons of $ for those able to write them well. Though not quite as good as say Dan Brown, or Steve Berry, this is a major contender. With a pair of former MANIAC operators racing all over the place, and other high spirited characters, including a really outrageous Italian family, a Texas Cardinal of the Catholic Variety, scenic descriptions, long lost art, helicopter and auto hijinx, this author throws just about everything in this high voltage cocktail, even the Molotov kind. For rip roaring adventure this is hard to top. There's even some wacky humor, and high camp for good measure. My only minor complaint is that the book seems to drag a bit towards the end, and the characters, including a Brit archeology scholar and part-time CIA man, tend to laugh off all the blood and guts, so the plot and heroics get close to cartoonish on occasion. Having said that, for interesting perspectives on early Roman and Christian history, some Indiana Jones type spelunkering, and lots of other fun and games, this one is a fine read, and there's some controversy as well..As close to five-5-stars as you can get!"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I thought this story had great fun, witty comedy, and a clever, action-packed plot.

If your looking for a christianity-conspiratorial-Jesus-scandal, high-speed and intense action, with some clever twists, and also excellent dialogue--specifically between Paynes and Jones...you will not be disappointed!

I did find it very thought provoking however I do not believe it to be true. Again, it's a fiction work.Some folks have bashed the characters in this book, but again, I don't want every major character in every book I read to be the same and have all the same characteristics.

There were jumps in point of view that were off-putting (that I believe it was the editor's job to fix) and the heavy forshadowing at the end of some chapters seemed out of place to me. The dialogue was occassionaly clunky and the coincidences/good fortune that helped the characters pursue their individual goals seemed a tad too constructed. The whole thing gave me the impression of an over-acted play. That being said, I was able to enjoy this as a light, escapist read but I won't go so far as to recommend it."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I HAVE JUST FINISHED READING ALL OF CHRIS KUZNESKI'S BOOKS. THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEM. GREAT READS. NOW I'M WAITING FOR HIS NEXT ONE."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"I must say that I enjoyed this book overall. It was an entertaining read. The story was an interesting one and might prompt readers to look into some of the assertions made to see how valid they might be. However, there are some pretty glaring flaws that made this book just an entertaining read rather than a thought-provoking must-read.1. Almost every chapter ended with a ridiculous cliffhanger line. I know that many suspense writers, such as Dan Brown do this. But in this book, it felt so redundant and cheesy. I actually wished I had a dramatic cliffhanger sounder to play after every chapter to add to the melodrama.2. These characters are SHALLOW. I know that they were introduced in an earlier book, but there is barely anything here to realte to the characters with. They were like cardboard cut outs walking around in this story.3. There are some serious plot lines that are either tied up hastily or just dropped all together. Like what happened to the \\"crews\\". Its summed up in one sentence. WHAT? And also, how were their deeds even relevant?Like I said, this book is not a master piece. It tried to be Dan Brown, but ends up being James Rollins. This is by no means a bad thing. I like Rollins. But just don't buy this book in the hopes of being enlightened."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"When I saw the name of this book and I read the plot, I will admit that I was intrigued! Then I got to reading the thing and I was saddened. And where did my sadness occur most? Toward the end of most chapters or plot sections where the author would give us a not-so-subtle hint of foreshadowing. For example, \\"A secret that would change her life-and the history of the world-forever,\\" \\"...unaware that he'd be murdered in less than an hour later,\\" \\"Just like he would later that night.\\" Now, sure, they look harmless here, but if chapter after chapter ends this way...it gets tired. Plus, the characters were not developed as well as they could be. Very shallow, but they had great promise. There was humor in places that shouldn't have had any, behavior that was unnecessary in the context, and obvious and over-the-top conversations.I'll try another of his books, like \\"Sword of God\\" in the hopes that it will show some improvement. As we know...as time goes by, authors can either improve their art, or have it completely fall apart."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"This one of my favorite books of Chris'.

Chris Kuneski's characters Payne and Jones have a well developed sense of humor which makes the story fun to read. The major flaw of SIGN OF THE CROSS is the characterization and dialogue. There are too many characters in this book, and Kuzneski keeps switching the perspective from character to character. As a result, no single character is fully fleshed out, and many characters comes across as little more than cardboard cutouts that rush from one action scene to another. Some of the supporting characters seem like cartoon characters kids would watch on TV. Also, much of the dialogue in this novel is rather stilted. Overall, I was impressed enough with the plot of this novel to recommend it. I think Kuzneski has exceptional plotting and research skills, but he needs to work more on his dialogue and characterization. If he does that, he could become the next Dan Brown or Steve Berry."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross","review":"Great book. Really enjoyable read.

The emotional ride you're taken through is heartwrenching. Ms. Baxter did her job well, as she always does. These two characters were very real and very hurt.Its hard to come by a novel where the hero and heroine are so intuned to one another and when you read their conflicts and joys you feel the emotions with them.I highly enjoyed this one because of that, although my rating would've been higher had the villain been scarier and more threatening.Husband and wife, divorced 11 years are thrown together once again when one finds herself caught in a blackmail murder plot and her ex-husband is the Texas Ranger on the case.Years after trying to forget one another after a very tumultuous marriage and a horrifc tragedy, Juliana Reed has finally gotten through the worst part and gotten her life back on track, but when her friend is murdered and she is somehow pulled into the strange and complex case via men with knives and some book they want, she is loathe t0 put her trust in the one man who destroyed her life so many years ago, her ex, Gates O'Brian.Gates is a Texas Ranger and a very good one at that. Although he hasn't yet gotten his life completely straightened out, he has made progress. What he doesn't need is his ex-wife coming into the picture again. His heart cant handle it. But he must do his job and learns this is more than a simple case of blackmail, there is a lot more under the surface and somehow Juliana is caught in the crossfire. People are willing to murder her to get this book, can he survive anther emotional ride with her? Can they forget the past and maybe start anew?Very good book, not to be missed.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Lone Star Heat","review":"Texas Ranger Gates O'Brien is investigating political corruption in the Lone Star state as his brother Rusk, an up and coming politician is running for governor. When one of Rusk's campaign workers appears on a local news show and drops dead, Gates is called in to investigate. Making matters difficult is that his ex-wife Juliana is the host of the show and she and the victim were close friends. Despite their tortured past (and the obvious love they still feel for each other), he reluctantly lets her in on his case. Further investigation elevates Marge's death to a murder and blackmail scheme which implicates his family and the death of their child which was the catalyst for the crumbling of their marriage.At times the story is very emotional and sentimental, and the premise is very interesting. Unfortunately, the story is marred by cheesy dialogue (a staple in Baxter's novels) and lack of a believable villain that it becomes just an average story. I really wanted to root for these characters, and toward the end, I just wanted it to end.Tracy Vest, September 2008"},{"Title":"Lone Star Heat","review":"Gates and Juliana are both dimwitted. The book lacked something. With sharper characters, this one could have been better."},{"Title":"My Life in Science: Sydney Brenner, A Life in Science (Lives in Science)","review":"The book was produced from the transcript of fifteen hour videotaped autobiography, as told to Lewis Wolpert. It has 191 pages of interviews and seven pages index. For some reason, the book format is bizarre. It's like a double-spaced manuscript with small fonts; very difficult to read. It doesn't have any figure or table or fun stuff. Just a text. Four pictures of him are included.This is a typical science-for-popular-audience type book. Lots of amusing anecdotes in addition to the basic science story. But this book will be a little too specific for general audience, and too ambiguous for professionals. As Brenner is already the most well-known molecular biologist, most facts are not so new to people who knows this field (mRNA, C. elegans story). It doesn't have much behind-the-scene information (like the Watson's DH) either. I wish he included his perspective on more recent topics such as RNAi, functional genomics and bioinformatics. And I was expecting a little more political aspect, as he is from South Africa, but this book is 100% about biology.I personally appreciate his criticism of Karl Popper's falsificationism, the importance of which I feel many British scientists overstate. Hume's \\"problem of induction\\" itself doesn't exist in the practical biology world from the beginning. I think there is no need to develop Popperian demarcation out of Logical positivism for this.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Great story that really draws you in.

While true to the character of most of the personalities from the DC Comics universe, it manages to be neither formulaic nor predictable. It's the sort of book that improves with re-reading, which is a rare pleasure in comics these days.WikiPedia has a pretty good entry if you're looking for a detailed synopsis (there are plenty of spoilers - be warned), but if the premise of the story interests you at all, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I have never been a big fan of Superman. The only arc I ever really cared for was his death. However, I have always loved Elseworld and after exhausting most all of the Batman elseworlds and other DCU titles that I could find the only thing left was this book.I loved this book. This wasn't the best elseworld title (I believe that honor belongs to Bloodstorm) but it was most definatly the best Superman title I have ever read. I loved how his American Democratic Boy Scout nature was replaced by Soviet Socialism Ideals. I also loved how he was trying to protect the whole world by taking it over. My favorite part of this Elseworld though is Batmans role. He is a freedom fighter that somehow reminds me of V for Vendetta.This Elseworld single handedly convinced me to give the main DCU Superman a second chance. I am still not a huge fan of the character but at least I'm willing to give ol'supes a chance now and then compaired to before where I would be rooting for him to be blown to shreds in every crossover."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I haven't read a comic in a long time. Can't remember the last time I actually did. I read some good stuff about this book and also like things that play around a little bit with mythology and ask a few \\"what if\\" questions. Millar has created a world where Superman is Russian and doesn't even use a secret identity. Lex Luthor is elevated to a status of a great American icon whose motivations might be bad, but do the ends justify the means?The book asks a lot of good moral questions and yet doesn't get preachy at all; it also remains immensly enjoyable.It's a good read. The illustrations are top notch. I'm extremely happy I picked it up and will be looking for other Mark Millar novels.It's a Superman story that's dying to be translated to the big screen, but likely will never happen. Pick it up and enjoy it for yourself."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Both one of the best concets DC has ever come up with for the Elseworlds concept of tales entirely removed from DCU continuity, and utterly flawless in its execution; an instant classic that's still going to be vital centuries from now.As the title implies, \\"Superman: Red Son\\" takes on the 'what if' notion of the Man Of Steel's lifepod having come down in the late 30s in the Soviet Union instead of the Kansas. Fitting in with the time frame, Superman and most of the other characters (with the notable exception of Batman, who more resembles his current self) in the saga are much more in keeping with their decades-ago incarnations than their current post-Crisis selves, with Superman light years more powerful than in current continuity (back to the days when he was practically omnipotent) and Lex Luthor seeming to be about ten times smarter than Einstein and Hawking combined. I don't think these characterizations/attributes could ever fly (no pun intended) on a long-term basis in the modern, highly-detailed and plausibilty-concerned universes, but it has proved to work spectacularly in a self-contained Elseworlds tale such as this.Random high points: there are so many open-to-interpretation/subtext points it would be impossible to mention them all here (besides it would give away pretty much the whole story) but it does provide invigorating fodder for conversation and wonder. There are a host of familiar DCU characters who turn up along the way, some in major roles and for others small cameos, and again it would be grossly unfair to give even a partial list of the surprise players here. And the art and the way it conveys what's going on inside the character's minds without a word in some panels - you'll see a prime example when you get to Pages 134-135 near the end of the book; if this was a movie the actors would deserve awards for conveying so much and with such force. And finally, only rarely does the tale go where one would expect it to; truly one of the more unpredictable epics out there.Possibly THE indispensable Elseworlds."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I am new to graphic novels so I don't have the history others do with superman comics, but I have read allot lately and I have to say this is one of my favorites.

I anticipated it to be good - but I never expected it to be this good. What it's strengths were breaking away from the molds in which the DC characters are made from and recasting them in different circumstances. The \\"humanness\\" of Superman comes through as well as his capacity to protect all mankind.I was pleasantly surprised to find myself rooting for Lex Luthor at the end. Throughout the book you get a keen sense of his intellect that rarely shines when he is bent on world domination.

If your a kid this will have enough action for you, but it may be a little graphic. If you are an adult you will totally enjoy the political aspects and historical figures represented in this book.The deluxe edition has a great cover and some extra art at the end and looks great in any bookcase."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"If you glance at my collection of graphic novels, you'll see a ridiculous abundance of Batman titles. 'Year One', 'The Dark Knight Returns', 'The Long Halloween', 'Dark Victory', 'The Killing Joke', 'Arkham Asylum', and on and on. Batman has been my favorite for years, which makes it a little strange to say that Mark Millar's 'Superman: Red Son' is my favorite graphic novel of all time.It's always tough to jump into a superhero's mythology so many decades after its beginning. In that respect, 'Red Son' is perfect for the Supes newcomer; it's a complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. No multiple backstories to read up on, no origin story to research.The premise is simple: instead of crash-landing in Smallville, Kal-El's spaceship ends up on a collective farm in the Soviet Union. We get to see what might've happened if Superman's origin story had gone this way.To be clear, this Elseworlds story isn't a butterfly effect-type tale. Millar doesn't simply change the location of Kal-El's crash and then write about how this change alone effects the Superman universe. Many DC characters pop up with altered roles and origins, including the Green Lantern, Batman, Wonder Woman, Lex Luthor, Bizarro and more.Therein lies my favorite part of 'Red Son'. These characters are not brought in just for recognition purposes; they all have a reason for being there, and all of these reasons are heavily influenced by Superman being a communist instead of an American. I read and re-read Batman's part all the time, not because it's Batman, but because it's a truly amazing scene.Props must be given to Millar for such tight and all-encompassing storytelling. He's written a tale that gives us a glimpse of what might happen if the most powerful American superhero of all time wasn't American at all. Even for fiction, it's a little frightening. And the ending is absolutely mind-blowing; you must read it to believe it.Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett's art is spot-on, and it's only helped by this definitive hardcover edition. The cover (as you can see above) is a beautiful piece of faux-propaganda, and it fits the tone of this graphic novel absolutely perfectly.If you're looking for a fascinating, high-quality story that doesn't require a great deal of past superhero knowledge or research to enjoy and understand, then 'Superman: Red Son' should be a no-brainer, and this new deluxe edition should only seal the deal."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"What if the Krypton starship landed in Soviet territory instead of the US heartland? Superman being brought up with Marxist/communist ideals? The world would certainly be a different place. For the better or the worse?Superman: Red Son attempts to answer these questions in such an adaptation. And a heck of an adaptation it is. Superman is still the virtuous Boy Scout he's always been, but this time he's on Stalin's side. But with such an upbringing, there are plenty of people trying to bring him down. The first people from his own country, then later his confrontation with the West, instigated by none other than Lex Luthor.This graphic nov was quite a treat to read, with grand morals to ponder as the plot thickened. The beginning of the story illustrated the constant power struggles between Party officials in the USSR that Superman eventually had to quell in the name of stability. The tale also encompasses aspects of the Cold War, but instead of a nuclear arms race, a superhero race erupts as Luthor develops an Americanized clone of Superman. Though he is American, the clone is also as moral as Superman and sacrifices himself when a nuclear warhead threatens innocent civilians.The story progresses with an array of familiar characters that live in an unfamiliar world. Lois Lane is married to Lex Luthor, despite brief tensions with Superman. Batman leads an anarchist's campaign against Superman, but fails to destroy the man of steel. Eventually Luthor and Brainiac join forces to shrink the Soviet capital, but actually minimize Stalingrad instead. Superman captures both Brainiac and Stalingrad, but is unable to restore the city to its former size. Thus it is kept in a glass jar until he can figure out a way to save the miniature city. This becomes Superman's greatest failure as a man who strives for perfection.Still, the world seems to fall under his command quite quickly. Instead of an American economic victory over the Soviet Union that led to communist collapse, it is the US that can no longer hold states in the Union. The world prospers under a communist rule that only Superman can lead properly. But Luthor, with his mass of capital and pure genius, takes over the US presidency and raises the American economy out of poverty. Eventually he provokes Superman into a third world war of which Superman is humbled by a few simple words, \\"Why don't you just put the whole WORLD in a BOTTLE, Superman?\\" This leads the Super Commissar to call off the invasion of the United States, which triggers a nuclear fail safe in Brainiac's ship. Superman sacrifices himself to destroy this ship and the world is left in the hands of Luthor. Eventually the entirety of mankind is transformed into beings just like Superman when the sun inflates red billions of years into the future. In fact, it turns out that Superman is the descendant of Lex Luthor. His family sends Superman not only through space but also through time to escape the dying world.Recapping on the story, it portrays a great deal of perfectionist attitudes that never live up to the standards, much instigated by communist nations. These strives for perfection on a national scale brought only oppression to the world. It shows that chaos is not something to be perfected. Greed and envy will always exist, and no Soviet deity could stop such things. If he wanted end suffering, Superman would need to imprison the entire world into a glass jar, like that of Stalingrad. And even though war and defeat have littered the comrade of steel, Superman is still a descent being, willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others. Sort of shows that no matter how wrong one may be there is always room for amending and healing a world gone mad. But oppression and violent persuasion is never the answer."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"How do you craft an original, startling take on an iconic character? Ask Mark Millar (Ultimates, Wanted) as he offers this Elseworlds tale starring not just Superman, but the whole DC universe. What if Kal-El's space ship had landed in communist, Stalin-led Russia instead of Smallville, Kansas? That's what happens in Red Son, as the Man of Steel is raised behind the Iron Curtain as Russia's greatest hero, symbol, weapon, and eventually, leader. Opposing Superman is the brilliant American Lex Luthor, who has disconnected himself from his wife Lois Lane in an effort to clone Superman, and outduel him. There's more, so much more, going on in Red Son that you'll be amazed how Millar weaves everything together so seamlessly. Other DC characters, including Wonder Woman, Brainiac, Bizarro, and Jimmy Olsen, are here as well, along with some very interesting takes on Batman and Green Lantern Hal Jordan. The finale of Red Son is the crowning moment however, as everything comes full circle like one couldn't imagine. The artwork from pencilers Dave Johnson and Killian Plunkett, and inkers Andrew Robinson and Walden Wong, is easy on the eyes as well, and is wonderfully detailed as well. All in all, Red Son is by far one of the best Superman stories to see the light of day in recent memory, and should be checked out regardless of whether or not you are a Superman fan/reader or not."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This self contained alternate history of Superman and the DC universe is exactly the sort of great storytelling that the graphic novel format was invented for. Not only is it entertaining in a spot-the-reference kind of way but it also manages to reinforce one of the more relevant historical lessons of our time: however well intentioned a dictator starts out, eventually power becomes its own end.What makes this graphic novel especially brilliant is that it delivers this lesson without changing the essential nature of the main characters. Superman lands on the steppes of Soviet Russia and is raised on a farm collective where he internalizes the dream of socialist utopia. The result is a man whose bearing and morality are identical to the American icon we know and love, but whose political philosophy is diametrically opposed. Lex Luthor, with no one to stop him, grows to unparalleled power in America which he duly abuses. He is the same megalomaniac we know and loathe, prone to casual murder, constant pontificating, and spousal abuse (of Lois Lane, no less!) And yet, as the story progresses it is clear that for all his faults Lex is only a would be petty tyrant, while Superman is a dictator in the terrifying mold of Stalin himself. There are even a few jokes about the two \\"men of steel\\" sprinkled into the early chapters.Unfortunately, Lex seems to have no better luck stopping Superman here than he does in the regular series, and soon America is the only country in the world not under Soviet control. I won't spoil the resolution here, but suffice it to say that it plays on Superman's essentially moral nature to very good effect. There's also a virtual post-script that introduces a twist to the whole story, but I found it a little weak, and I decided to ignore it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"To begin with I'm not the biggest superman fan. I believe he has a tendency to be written a little flat and not very dynamic personality wise. Which is ironic given his physical abilities. Which is one of the reasons this comic blew my mind and just when i thought i put all the pieces back in my skull it blew it again.Superman is given a whole new dimension (personality wise) here and his character is so rich and the artwork beautiful the pages might as well ooze beauty. The alternative histories for other major DC heroes, Green Lantern and Batman most notably, collide with Superman's and changed the way I viewed those characters could be written.My few complaints fall under an umbrella of \\"realism\\" that is embedded in the comic. In short no one can stand up to Superman effectively. Some of the DC's most prestigious members go up against this guy and fall drastically short. That is realistically what would happen if Superman would have to fight these in the conditions set by the comic. That is why the comic is so great even my complaint fits in with something good about this comic.If you like alternative histories. Or often think about what would happen if characters were put in different situations and how they would react in character and development read this comic like its the answer to all your problems. Even though its not. But it could be..."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"When DC Comics began their Elseworlds series in the late 80's,the stories ran the gamut from finding their iconic superheroes in specific periods of history,to reinterpretations of familiar storylines and continuity.Some of these truly stood out from all the rest,like this selection from writer Mark Millar,in which the previously All-American Man Of Steel is now a hero of the Soviet Union,coming to manhood at the very beginning of The Cold War,an event which has the U.S. Government turning to its top scientist Lex Luthor for aide.Despite what the previous sentence might suggest,this isn't an alternate reality where Superman is the villian and Luthor is the hero;Millar wisely avoids such an obvious plotline,giving us instead a Superman who wants to do the right thing by his adopted race,even with his strong belief in the Marxist Doctrine.Although destroying the Soviet Man Of Steel becomes an obsession for Lex Luthor,he carefully straddles the line between diligence and deviousness.Caught between these two men is Lois Lane,unsure of with whom her destiny lies.Other characters in the DC canon,such as Jimmy Olson,Batman and Brainiac round out the cast.The eye-catching artwork,provided by Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett,perfectly compliments Millar's provocative story,which concludes with a twist ending that is far too good to reveal here."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This is a very well told and subtle story. I believe this falls under the \\"Elseworlds\\" category of storytelling. In short, it's a tale of Superman if he had landed in the Soviet Union rather than middle America and grew to be the iron fist for the hammer and scythe. In it we see the ramifications of Superman as totalitarian enforcer for the iron curtain and how he interacts with Superman mainstays Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, the miniature city of Kandor and many more in this alternate reality. It's a fun, cerebral trip and should be added to any comic lovers collection."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Not a big Superman fan, but this is by far my favorite story about him. Not gonna get into specifics because they arent needed...."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"In every sense of the word, masterpiece describes this novel. A completely engrossing and exlporative way to engage with classic heroes and villains, Red Son is simply incredible. Buy it. Put it on a mantle. Tell your friends to do the same."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"There have already been very detailed reviews of this product and I fully support them. This is one great book and is great for a long time DC fan or anyone who has even heard of Superman before. It does not require the reader to have any further knowledge on the existing characters. Great art and wonderful story."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This volume has a great design, and the quality that its importance deserves.There is no a childish approach of Superman: he is not consequently bad but just the result of different circunstances. The story starts with a revelation to its fictional world so big that is a social explosion and ends with a revelation to ours, the readers, that is so big that also is an explosion.The drawing style is very well. It creates an atmosphere that seems reflects the feelings of the characters. The use of the color is very good. Point apart are the covers: beautiful exercises of design.Perfect Story. It was a pleasure read it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Truly a unique take on the Superman mythos. The ending is really where the story takes a twist."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"What a great Elseworlds tale. Superman is an American ideal but what if he crash landed in Russia in the late '30s? Well, read this and find out. This book is so well thought out and gorgeously drawn by both artists. I love all the easter eggs but they were needed for this to be unforgettable. I love how even though he was a communist he was still the hero we know. Fantastic work by Mark Millar!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"So much fun to imagine that its hard to believe someone didn't write this concept earlier. What is the baby boy of steel had landed somewhere other then America, in this case in Soviet Russia. Its great to see how different things could might have been. While Superman himself and his character are largely unchanged, the world around him and how he effects it is. A great take on a great possibility"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Loved this book from beginning to end. If you like Superman you must read this story!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Superman: Red Son by Mark Millar gives an intriguing pastiche of Millar's superhero concepts. This is a 5-star concept with perhaps 3-star execution. Had DC published this more along the lines of its Vertigo imprint, we would have really seen Millar shine. As it is, he seems to hold back a bit to make Red Son more palatable to a DC/Superman audience.The concept of the book is brilliant. What if baby Kal-El's rocket ship landed on a farm not in midwestern America but on a farm in Soviet Russia? However, a campy atmosphere holds it in check. The premise seems to deserve something a little... heavier. Then again, Supes has always been a campy character. Giving him the weight of something like 'Old Man Logan' or 'Watchmen' might not be in keeping with his history - or with the primary Superman audience.The artists also seem torn between paying tribute to the simpler days of Superman and something more edgy. Visually, the book seems caught in the middle, achieving neither that Curt Swan chipperness nor that Frank Miller (or even John Cassady) weight.Interestingly, many of the brilliant ideas in Red Son are a pastiche of other revisionist superhero stories and \\"superheroes in the real world\\" storylines.Millar borrows from Alan Moore's 'Miracleman.' The ultra-powerful human narrating his conversion of the world to a utopia from a future perspective is right out of Miracleman. Millar even gives a tip of his hat with a cameo of Dr. Sivana, the character from Captain \\"Shazam\\" Marvel who inspired a similar character in Miracleman.Millar borrows a little from Frank Miller's Dark Knight. Batman finds a weakness of Superman's and exploits it to physically kick Supes' butt. Also, Batman has a legion of followers (the Batmen) that remind one of Miller's S.O.B.'s (Sons of the Batman.)Published in 2004, this story also gives a nod to Millar's friend Warren Ellis and the Ellis/Cassady collaboration 'Planetary.' Lex Luthor's usurping the Green Lantern technology from a crashed alien ship echoes Ellis' 'Planetary' treatment of The Four's capturing the alien Green Lantern and using his technology to further their own evil plans. Ellis penned that story circa 2001.Bizarro's brief appearance culminating in his heroic self-destruction brings to mind John Byrne's similar treatment of Bizarro in his 'Man of Steel' revamp in the 1980's.Lex Luthor's creating supervillians is another variation on one of Millar's favorites: the idea of superheroes/villians as super-soldiers. (He takes it on in the 'Authority,' 'War Heroes,' and the 'Ultimates.')Mark Millar also tackled the \\"all powerful being attempts to create utopia\\" scenario in the 'Authority,' picking up where Warren Ellis left the series and taking it into the same moral shades of gray we see in 'Red Son.' Not everyone is happy having utopia forced on them!Finally, at the end, the time travel sequence is not entirely original. My favorite version of this convention is in John Byrne's 'Next Men,' where the villian Satanas travels back in time to begin the time line that created him in the first place - a closed historical loop.All of which only proves that Millar loves comic books as much as any of his readers, and he has his thumb on the pulse of relevant ideas. Maybe he felt no one had ever applied these concepts to the most powerful and iconic hero of our times, and this was his turn.We don't mean to knock the book. It was a solid read. If you really dug this book, track down some of these other titles mentioned in this review and give them a shot.Millar's doing away with Superman's need for a 'secret identity' is a great idea. We never understood why anyone as powerful as Superman would pretend to be some regular doorknob. Superman doesn't waste his time changing in phone booths - he is too busy changing the world. Red Son also avoids ridiculous love triangles with human beings. He's practically a god. We never could see Supes' frittering around in some teenage love triangle with Lois and Lana.All in all, great concepts, just not a Millar home-run like Ultimates, Ultimate X-Men, Old Man Logan, Civil War, and the Authority."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I thought that The Red Son would be this sort of cool elseworld take on Superman and I will get around to it when I feel like it. Then I read it and I wished I had picked it up sooner. It has taken a place on my self reserved for my favorites.I really liked the use of Batman, Green Lantern, Bizarro, and Brainiac in this story as well as the lack of kryptonite. I have always considered it pretty gay that some douche always is taking Superman out with a little green rock. Not here though. I liked how differently every enemy was formed and took on Superman. Batman was my favorite enemy of the state of all time and I think a story line like with Batman like this should be written.The ending for me is what really made this story stand alone. It was clever and something that made me shout, \\"AWESOME!!!\\" then my girlfriend elbowed me for waking her up. Just a well told story. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"The art is amazing, and the concepts are profound and moving. A must have!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"An excellent read for anyone, Superman fan or not. I fall into the latter catagory, not a big Superman fan, but this book was great fun to read. It rarely falls into cliche, the characters are adequately changed in demeamor and story, and the artwork is fantastic."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I am not a fan of superman. I think he is ridiculously overpowered and since his creation he gets a new ridiculous power every 3-5 years.BUT, I enjoyed this immensely. Some other reviewers have complained about various other characters being in different positions that they don't believe they would have occupied just because they didn't meet superman. I think most of it is plausable and when it isn't, it's more interesting to put known characters in a different situation than to just make up new ones to fill places in the plot. I don't see what others are complaining about."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This was an incredibly interesting take on the \\"what if?\\" of the Superman mythos. I was quite happy with the portrayal of Superman and everyone that he knew in this bizarre situation."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Much like Flashpoint, you want to know more about this alternate universe. You want to see more characters and explore the different attitudes and ideals our heroes have being giving a different upbringing. Great writing and great artwork, a must read for any superman/DC fan. And yes, the Dark Knight makes an apperance, among others."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"It's hard to write a good Superman, but this is the best of the best. It's one of my favorite comics of all time, and definitely my favorite take on Superman. I would heavily recommend this to anyone who likes graphic novels, even if they're not a Superman fan."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"&#8220;Superman: Red Son&#8221; re-imagines how Superman and the world would have changed if &#8220;Big Blue&#8221; had landed and been raised in the Soviet Union rather than Smallville, USA. While re-imagining and reinventing comic book heroes, both on the printed page and on the big screen, has been going on for some time (and indeed I believe this comic set was first published in 2003), very few of these efforts have stood out as being particularly worthwhile. I&#8217;m happy to say that &#8220;Superman: Red Son&#8221; is one of the rare exceptions. Much like &#8220;Batman: the Dark Knight Returns&#8221; and &#8220;The Watchmen&#8221;, this comic could also pass for literature, as it is deeply layered and entertaining even if you aren&#8217;t tremendously familiar with the characters.While being well drawn, cunningly plotted, and very literate, the book also brings other familiar characters from the DC Comic universe into the story, most of which are somewhat re-imagined as well in this brave new world. However, to a surprisingly large extent, the tale remains true to the official &#8220;canon&#8221;, and there are only a very few things that don&#8217;t ring true.In short, I found this comic to be fantastic and recommend it very highly. Five stars."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"You like superman? You like Russians? The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I've never really like Superman as a character. Superman never really had appeal to me. Mark Millar however wrote this interesting twist on Superman and his world. I loved it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I've always been a fan of the Elseworlds universe. It provides different possibilities which, while familiar, can also be self contained pieces all on their own without having to be bogged down with the idea that it may have repercussions in the continuity of the larger comic book universe. It doesn't always work, with either the art or the story a little off kilter, but when it does you know you have something special.\\"Red Son\\" is an example of when it does work.In the world of \\"Red Son\\" the Superman we know never crashed on the Kent farm and he never grew up to stand for truth, justice, and the American way. He crashed down in Soviet Russia, and became its greatest advocate, defender and premier. In this world, nothing is as it seems.Mark Millar does beautiful writing and the story is tightly woven, spanning decades from the moment where Superman becomes Stalin's right hand man, until his final Battle with Lex Luthor and the United States of America! The art is more than passable and melds well with the story, providing just enough action that you'll find yourself holding your breath as you turn the page.The point of this whole review is to point out that I haven't been this excited and amazed by an Elseworlds book since Kingdom Come and I think I've been waiting for this little gem to come along for a long time without even realizing it. You'd be a fool not to give this work a shufti. Buy it forthwith! The sooner you get it, the sooner you'll agree I was right."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"The premise of this story is that Superman lands in Russia during the height of the Cold War. Most writers would've gone for an easy \\"Superman as a bad guy\\" story. Instead, we get a mature and refreshing take on the Man of Steel that surprisingly changes very little about his personality.This is still the Superman we know, more or less. A good man with amazing powers trying to make the world a better place, struggling to make sense of his role in the larger scheme. It's very good. Very, very good.I do have one minor complaints though. It is very strongly bound to Superman continuity (even if an alternatre version) and a lot of non-fans might have trouble following the story because many characters basically have cameos. This is due to the fact that the story takes place over several decades, highlighting each era of the Cold War. While very well written, it can seem a little rushed. But I'd rather the story move quickly than drag itself down with endless exposition.Fun read. Intelligent read. Satisfying read. In other words, a very worthwhile take on the Superman character that might make you think, but, more importantly, will keep you entertained."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I am not a fan of \\"Elseworlds\\" books, they usually fall flat. This one however......is GREAT! \\"Superman: Red Son\\" is compelling from beginning to end. Mark Millar had a tall order with this, re-imagining the Man of Steel as the poster-boy for socialism. The story heads in directions that you wouldn't expect, Millar adds several great twists. Johnson and Plunkett's concise, beautiful artwork serves the story well. They cleverly depict several alternate versions of DC heroes and villians. There is a great \\"sketchbook\\" in the back of this trade paperback, showing the evolution of some of these characters.I couldn't disagree more with the \\"spotlight review\\" by Antonio Nunez. To discuss the plausability of any Superman book is ridiculous. His entire existence is implausible.Order this book, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"THis graphic novel took me completely by surprise in its presentation of how supe became a man who becomes all dictating to the realization of the monster he has become to humanity. Lex Luthor as the obsessed scientist who will do anything to stop had me gasping with surprise. And the twist ending will leave your jaw dropped."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Like Dark Knight Returns, this one will become a classic for comic geeks like myself.Rather than just reimagining Superman as a tool for the Soviet Empire, the writer subtlely compares the strengths and weaknesses of American capitalism and Soviet socialism, and while the book clearly leans toward an American system, the fact that the greatest Superman villain, Lex Luthor, remained a \\"American capitalist\\" in this Elseworld, makes you wonder.Red Son dares to be political in a child's popular medium and dares to challenge our view of not only the \\"Superman world\\" but also the political world in general. Rather than blandly stating America was better than the Soviet Union, the author suggests there were virtues and flaws in both \\"Empires.\\" A brilliant comic that could be discussed in an English or Political Science class and also absorbed and enjoyed by teenagers."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"If you're new to DC's Elseworlds line, I would recommend starting with the Alex Ross illustrated gem 'Kingdom Come'. Ironically without giving too much away, Kingdom Come is really more of an 'end' opposed to a beginning in the Elseworlds. If you are not already familiar with DC's Elseworlds, it is essentially an alternate future or timeline that is not canon to DC events. This makes for very exciting possibilities. In this novel we see what would have happen if the last ship from Krypton was sent just a few hours earlier landing the Man of Steel in the Ukraine country side instead of the Kansas country. You will likely not be disappointed in reading this novel if you are a fan of the DCU, all kinds of cool surprises are behind every page and if one thing will keep you interested it is that this novel has one of the greatest 'endings' that you might ever read."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Once upon a time there was an infant named Kal-El from the distant planet Krypton. When the planet's red sun was going out, Krypton was on the verge of destruction. In order to save one of their race, Kal-El's parents place him in a little spaceship and send the ship to Earth while everyone else dies with Krypton and it's sun. Kal-El would eventually become Superman, the Man of Steel. And where on Earth does his ship land, not on a small farm in Kansas, but in the heart of communist Russia!If you think that I'm making this up, I am not. In this parallel universe, Superman now fights for the soviets, the expansion of communism, and Joseph Stalin. Eventually after Stalin's death, Superman takes control of the Soviet Union and soon America is the only noncommunist country left on Earth.An entirely original Superman Storyline by Ultimates writer Mark Millar, filled with lots of action and meaningful moments! The best Superman storyline ever since The Death of Superman!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"What if Superman had landed in Soviet Russia instead of Smallville, Kansas? DC's \\"Elseworlds\\" series imagines an alternate take on the Superman story with \\"Comrade Superman\\" becoming ruler of Soviet Russia, slowly taking over the world while an independent America led by Lex Luthor fights against an increasingly unhinged and totalitarian-minded Man of Steel.Mark Millar has written no less than a masterpiece with \\"Superman: Red Son\\". We see the character of Superman evolve from an idealistic young man to new ruler to an increasingly isolated and intolerable megalomaniac who takes his god-like powers and status and tries to make the world into a utopia. Red Superman is at turns heroic and then more dark until he's a terrifying figure of absolute power taken to the limit.Lex is the real star of the book and Millar does a fine job of making him at turns arrogant and ruthless but also charming and funny and with his tireless and imaginative efforts at bringing down the Superman, nothing less than a superhero in his own right. I like when writers add nuance to Luthor's character instead of single-minded cartoonist villainy and Millar hits the right chord with his characterisation of Luthor here.There are great moments throughout the book that make it a non-stop thriller for any comics fan: the re-imaginings of Wonder Woman, Bizarro, and Green Lantern are excellent but the Russian Batman takes the cake for best alternate take on a legend. Red Batman is an urban terrorist living in the sewers, going to extremes to destroy the invincible Superman and in one momentous scene reminiscent of Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", he almost does it before doing something extreme even Miller's Batman didn't.\\"Red Son\\" is easily one of the best Superman books out there and might be the best thing Mark Millar's ever written. He's on top form throughout, his imagination fizzing off of the page from one breath-taking set-piece to the next, aided by amazing art from Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett throughout, crescendoing in a completely unpredictable and inspired conclusion. This is a must-read for all superhero fans but it's also an excellent piece of dystopian fiction for readers who don't normally read comics. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Many times I feel like a comic will be great the whole time, then they botch the ending for whatever reason, it was rushed, it didn't resolve, whatever. Red Son was wonderful the whole way through and absolutely stuck the ending! I will definitely read this one multiple times."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Mark Millar has taken the imagination on a different tour of duty this time, and come up with a winner again. Can this guy not create?Red Son and the concept behind it was radical in its thinking, and probably as unique a storyline I have read this year. All three collected works are published here in strong hardcover fashion adding to the unique industrial style of nostalgic Russian society in the 20th century.The artwork and style, of which I just touched upon, was refreshing, and unique. DC has hit upon a nerve, and found a good forumla for major blockbusters (those involving storyline, good artwork, and either Batman or Superman) and making them more about the dilemma, the situation, the world, and not about the character themselves. Side Stories like Azzarello's Joker was unique in its introspective view of the madman.Red Son will be re-read and re-read until something about it doesn't sit right, and is eventually tossed in the same pile along with the Killing Joke, and the Dark Knight. Basically I have read these, and will pick them up again and again and again..."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"i really liked this book, it's a great idea and was very well executed a must read for superman fans"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Like many other reviewers of this paperback collection, I have never been a big Superman fan (just too darn powerful).

A truly daring Superman deconstruction-- landing in the Ukraine instead of Smallville, raised in Stalinist Russia, etc.Alternative history at its best."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"When I first looked at this coy of Red Son I was afraid I stumbled upon a poor reversal of Superman's roles. But I thought Amazon reader's reviews couldn't have been so wrong. I started reading it and by the end I was glad I bought it. Great scenario and an interesting combination of smart villains and political satire. The graphics nicely enhance the scenario. It's a good looking comic with a nice story and a very nice ending in my opinion. If you're reading this review I recommend you get the deluxe edition. I bought the soft cover just before I saw there was a hardcover available. It would have added a nicer feeling to it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I picked this up for two reasons: One, I love Dave Johnson's covers for 100 Bullets and two, the premise seemed interesting.After reading Superman: Red Son, I realized two things: One, this book is a true classic and two, it has fascinating parallels to an Incredible Hulk story by Peter David, \\"Future Imperfect\\".In both stories, the main ominpotent/invulnerable characters of their resepctive universes (DC's Superman, Marvel's Hulk) are posed perhaps the most obivous yet complicated question by their writers: What is stopping these unstoppable but heroic beings from taking over Earth? And once the unstoppable but heroic beings do take over Earth, how do they choose to rule? The two stories have completely different answers to that question, but both are extremely well written and both also happen to look great, too.Now maybe this all old hat to many readers and I am (as usual) late to the party. Nonetheless, this was like finding a hidden treasure on the comic book store shelf. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"okay, dig it man.what if kal-el, the last son of Krypton, you know, Superman, landed in communist Russia instead of Kansas?an awesome graphic novel, that's what.that's basically all you need to know.well,that, and the fact that superman grows up embracing the hammer&sickle; instead of truth, justice, and the American way.Even if you're an amateur comic enthusiast, its just a great story.the only reason I give it 4 stars is because, without ruining the ending for who hasn't read it yet, let's just say a time paradox is involved.and if anything pisses me off more than jump puzzles, its a time paradox.But that's personal. besides that, awesome story.Go buy it right now!you can always return it if you don't like it.Trust me tho, you will."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Read it you won't be disappointed.

The story is beautifully crafted and the dialogue is superb. I love how it delves into the personality of the each character and the way they think.

On a personal note, it finally made me realize what the world might be like with an actual superhero. *puts away jetpack & batarangs* This book will make you think!I'm not much of a Superman fan but thankfully it dealt with other DC heroes (which is why I decide to buy). Highly recommended!! I would even recommend the absolute/hardcover version if it's ever released.A profound work of art."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"What this book teaches most of all is that things turned out for the best since he did actually land in America in the official story. Things start off great, but eventually all falls apart by the end. The end of the story also has a very interesting twist and new take on the origin of Superman. What is also interesting is that they didn't take the easy way out made the Soviet Union as pure evil bad guys, but in fact, kind of made the US look bad in some parts of the story. Overall, this is a must have if you are a fan of Superman. Nothing official, but still an interesting read. If you are a fan of Millar, then pick this up. It doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Alternate history for the Man of Steel and the rest of the DC universe.

After Stalin, SM is pretty much in charge of trying to bring order to the World as Luthor's decadent US and Brainac challenge him with alternate plans. Great ending, as you realize its irony. Experience the Superman myth in a different way."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Really, what a truly imaginative and interesting concept, the Last Son of Krypton falls not in middle American Kansas but rather in a Ukrainian farm collective circa 1930's. This setup gave the authors an great opportunity to examine the debate between nature and nurture, how different societies view justice and heroism, in addition to being a great artistic platform to survey and reinterpret the graphic designs of the USSR.Unfortunately, the story falls far short of its potential. It starts out with promise as Superman is touted by Stalin as an unstoppable Soviet weapon in the Cold War contrasted with Superman's reservations about becoming a political figure and symbol. However, it then slowly devolves into a Randian battle between Superman and Lex Luthor.In terms of the art, while there are some great pieces, especially the hammer and sickle Superman emblem, and some cool propaganda posters here and there overall the art misses the mark. The art team felt that simply using lots of red was sufficient to give the images a Soviet flair.Go elsewhere for revisionist superheros."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Not the best &quot;Elseworlds&quot; Superman title: I have two other 'Elseworlds' titles of Superman - the mediaeval 'Kal' &amp; 'Superman: The Dark Side' (raised by Darkseid) - and they're both FAR better than this one, even the fact that 'Kal' is MUCH shorter doesn't detract from its impact. 'The Dark Side' is definately the best story of the 3 ('Kal' doesn't have much time for a story to develop), but there's something else to it that I can't quite put my finger on.Don't get me wrong: it's a good story &amp; worth getting if you like Superman graphic novels, it just doesn't have the same kick as 'The Dark Side'. I think it might be that it's so focused on Superman vs Lex Luthor that the other super-heroes mentioned (Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern) get short shrift. There's also no clear 'bad guy' in it which made 'Kal' &amp; 'TDS' enjoyable: who do you get fired up AT if there's no clear bad guy?I gave it 3 stars because it's &quot;good, as you'd expect&quot; instead of &quot;Wow! that's awesome!&quot;"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"With twists worth of Rod Serling, this is a great sci-fi story that plays around with all the great Metropolis characters in an alternate reality... or is it ??????????"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I waited a long time for this book. I was thrilled to get it via Amazon. I was *very* disappointed by it, and for many reasons.The first reason is that the premise is too narrow for such a long story to hold one's interest. A great comic is read breathlessly, and only upon a second or third reading does one clearly identify the boring bits. Here they are evident from the beginning and only become more so upon re-reading. A long Elseworld book like \\"Golden Age\\" will warrant a fourth or fifth re-reading. Not the case with Red Son.The second reason is that it is inconsistent. Lex and Lois Luthor appear to be in their 20s in 1953 (the year of Stalin's death, at the beginning of the book). That would make them about 65 when Lex is elected President. At the time there is no indication that they have any children, and yet a complete lineage of Luthors is created in the final chapter, and a son is shown when there is no intimation that he should exist, or when he came to be. Also, there is no reason why Richard Nixon should have been elected in 1960, and murdered in 1963, or why John F. Kennedy would be elected President in 1968 and hang around for about 20 years. His marrying a fat, slutty Marilyn Monroe is fun but farcical. That is clearly a take on Nixon in \\"The Watchmen\\", where he is still President in 1985. There is no reason either why a pseudo-Batman should exist in the USSR, as the child of murdered dissidents, since Kal El's arrival in The Ukhraine in the 1930s should have no impact on NKVD activities prior to his adulthood.Finally, the book shows a profound ignorance about Communism. Stalin is presented as a fairly malevolent old goat, but showing Stalin's son as the head of KGB is ridiculous, given that Stalin never gave a hoot about his own children and actually drove one of them to suicide in a German KZ. And the drawings aren't so hot, except for the simulated \\"Socialist\\" posters. A sort of \\"Social Realism\\", a la \\"Batman Year 1\\" would probably have been more suitable. As it is, it looks cartoony in a cheap sort of way.One doesn't expect deep social criticism from a comic book (although they can provide it on occasion), but \\"Red Son\\", so long in the making, was subject to high expectations, which it hasn't discharged.All in all, an opportunity lost.
