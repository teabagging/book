I have finished the books and still can't take my mind off the story."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have read all of the Left Behind series and the Christ Clone Trilogy is far superior to the other series (I read reviews on the Trilogy and bought all 3 books based on what I was hearing from other readers). The Anti-Christ was very engaging up to the point of his resurrection and then becomes very insidious; because of this book 2 troubled me. The third volume was a wild thrill-a-minute ride and the last 2 chapters were perfect with a surprise ending. I would recommend the Trilogy to anyone who is interested in endtimes novels and a good read!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is masterful. Having just finished the Left Behind series, this is a nice change on the same topic. It's a wonderful end times novel, based (in the first two chapters) on acutal facts. Beauseigneur intrigues readers with his very apt combination of science and religion. Although it gets a little tedioius in the exact description of happenings at the United Nations, this book will carry you through and leave you hungry for the next. I can't wait to receive the second installment."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"How refreshing to read a volume that has the depth and insight to handle the subject of the Apocalyse with intelligence and style! Well-conceived and well-written, &quot;In His Image&quot; handles the prophecies regarding the End of Time with amazing detail and accuracy, yet with tremendous creativity. Author James Beauseigneur has done a marvelous job with this story. I read the first 2 volumes of the &quot;Christ Clone Trilogy&quot; in 3 days, and I now anxiously await the publication of the final volume. This series is worth your time!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Don't get me wrong, I thought the first book was well written and pretty interesting, but once I finished I was kind of sick. I thought the author was going in a very new age direction, totally opposed to a Christian message. I even put the series down and didn't read anymore because I thought the message was skewed. On a whim, I picked up the second book. Once it hit me what BeauSeigneur was doing, all I could think was &quot;Boy am I stupid&quot; and &quot;Brilliant!&quot;. From that point forward, I couldn't put the books down. They were absolutely fabulous. Well written, interesting and fast paced.If you are reading this as a Christian and you get frustrated with the first book....keep going. Trust me. You will not be disappointed. The same idea that trapped me also got my father in-law. Have fun."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was told before I bought the book that before I read it, I should make sure that I was grounded in my faith and what I believe because this book would make my head spin. So I bought it thinking that it would never measure up to the high expectations I set. There have been so many books written about the \\"End Times,\\" what would make this one different from the rest?Let me start by saying this book makes the Left Behind series look like 4th grade reading material.After the first few chapters I was completely engulfed. This book takes you on a roller coaster ride giving numerous plausible explanations to many questions that I have often pondered about the end times. I'm not saying it's gospel, but it certainly leaves you thinking, \\"Whoa, that could really happen.\\" I am certain you will find yourself sitting at work thinking about this book anticipating the next time you get a chance to read it. It is a Great book. I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is a very intelligently written novel. Mr. BeauSeigneur presents a very believable story that captures the present world political climate. His scenario of the strife in Israel with its Arab neighbors that escalates to terrorists destroying the Wailing Wall and then the Dome on the Rock took my breath away with how easy it would be for these events to lead to the rebuilding of the Temple. Descriptions of upcoming world events fortold in the book of Revelations are given a evening news feel rather than a sermon feel. People who aren't Christians in the book don't go around shouting that the end is near. Mr. BeauSignuer has done a great job of making holy scripture of the end of days into a picture not too removed from our own present world."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"James BeauSeigneur has done the most amazing thing in this remarkable series of books--he's written something that both believers and skeptics can rejoice about.If you're anything like me, you've looked at End Times books with more than a little bit of a jaundiced eye. Too often, everything is given away right at the start of the books. The rest becomes simply preaching to the choir.Not here. Finally, at last, we have a series of books that leaves the reader in doubt as to what is REALLY going on until the middle of the third book. The great thing about this approach is that it MOST CLOSELY ACCORDS WITH HOW END TIMES EVENTS WILL ACTUALLY UNFOLD. In other words, for believers and skeptics alike IT IS ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE END TIMES AS THEY READ THESE BOOKS.Think about it. If we were actually living in the End Times as the Bible describes them, WE WOULDN'T KNOW IT, WOULD WE. Nor would we know the either the identity of the Antichrist, nor how he would go about enacting his agenda. That's what sets these books apart. The author has written them in such a way that WE JUST DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE THINGS. It's as if we're living through the End Times as they are actually unfolding.That to me is a great accomplishment, and one that enables readers of whatever stripe--Christian, atheist, agnostic, skeptic--to have an authentic reading experience."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Fascinating concept,original. I think better written than the &quot;Left Behind&quot; Series, which I found tedious after the 2nd one. The Christ Clone books are totally believable. A great read."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The Christ Clone Trilogy is one of the greatest end of time fiction novels I have read. It is this kind of fiction that is appealing to &quot;picky&quot; readers as myself. This novel is very believable and has many unexpected twists. I just hope that this Trilogy gets made into a tv mini-series. The first volume gives you the setting of apocalyptic events to come. This book is practically impossible to put down. Once you get involved in the story, you can't have enough. I give it two huge thumbs up."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a lot. I think I read it cover to cover in two days because it was so hard to put down. I enjoyed his little twists and turns and the alternate view of how the End Times might come about. It wasn't predictable in the slightest, even though I know what's supposed to happen. He doesn't go for the obvious, and enjoys subtlety.I thought it was a little odd that he would cast actual people as the bad guys. Miller and Bailey are nearly the identical names of real people associated with the UN and Lucis Trust in New York, and they're both New Age and One World Gov't. folks, just like in the book. I'm surprised there hasn't been litigation on this subject.I'm looking forward to the revised and updated versions of Books Two and Three."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I received my copy on a Thursday, finished it before going to bed Saturday. The author's intent seems to be that of telling a good story which mixes contemporary politics &amp; science with dispensational premillenial eschatology, and he succeeds admirably. While not agreeing with Dispensationalism, I certainly appreciate the dramatic spin he puts on the Rapture and the Two Witnesses."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Engrossing! I couldn't put it down for 3 days staight. The research alone required to put together a book of such power is amazing. Those who question religion, and those who believe will both love this trilogy. Truely a series not to me missed."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed reading this trilogy. When I was done I wished there were another book. Mr. James BeauSeigneur makes the words come alive. I do like the left behind series but I think this series far surpassas it. I do wish he would write some more books like this. The thing is you just don't know till the end how it is going to turn out even though you know the good guys win he keeps you wondering who the bad guy is. Please Mr BeauSeigneur write some more good books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I've read a number of Christian related books &amp; seen a number of Christian related movies (including the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series) but this is far better than any of them. I'm surprised they haven't made it into a movie. The first book is mainly background information you'll need when you get into the second &amp; third books. The second &amp; third books are where the fun begins. The author sticks close to the bible. I had a hard time putting the books down &amp; wish there were 5 or 6 books to the series."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"An engrossing blend of politics, religion, New Age, end-of-the-world prophecy, and science, James BeauSeigneur's In His Image keeps readers turning pages. His masterful plotting weaves an international cast of characters through world-changing events (including the cloning of Jesus and two nuclear holocausts) that are made entirely believable because of BeauSeigneur's meticulous research and eyewitness-quality detail."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"There was a lot of hype, but the series didn't live up to it. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's all just so...typical. The books do some great debating about beliefs, presenting both sides of the argument, but in the end it's still the same message. If you're not a Christian, you're going to Hell. Looks like there's still no hope for unbelievers in the literary world. Sigh. Read Matthew Reilly books. They're cool. By the way, vampires are cool too. That is all."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"First off - I am a Christian and although I'm not a Bible \\"scholar\\" as such - I have studied the Bible and the end-times revelations in the Bible. I do realize this book is fiction - the author even writes a bit of a disclaimer at the beginning of the book. But presumably the book is based on the Bible's revelations of the end-times. However, I find some things disturbing as they DO NOT illustrate what the Bible actually says. As in the case of the dead bodies - where is it mentioned that the bodies of the \\"saints\\" are left behind? The book actually \\"glosses\\" over the \\"Diaster\\" - with NO mention of the fact that the dead people were all Christians and that there could possibly be a \\"Christian Theory\\" about what happened. What about all the friends and family members left? They HAD to think - at some point - about what they'd heard from their Christian family members and friends. I know that I have a Bible with those passages marked sitting out where someone can find it if the Lord comes for me in that manner. And the appearance of the apostle John - now where is that in the Bible? I know the author gave a scripture reference (subject to interpretation) - but in all my years - I'd NEVER heard that John never died. Again, there was NO \\"reason\\" given for why the \\"Diaster\\" happened - just a mention of a couple of theories. I can't imagine something of that magnitude happening without a \\"concrete\\" explanation - even if it was wrong. We have committees and investigative procedures for everything in this country - i.e. \\"weapons of mass distruction\\". So why would an event with such an enormous impact NOT be investigted throughly? In addition - except for a couple of instances involving Jewish characters, there is absolutely NO mention of a Bible found anywhere. I found all the pages written about the UN to be BORING - I actually skipped over much of that. What needed to be said in that regard could have been said without soooooooooooo much detail. Instead of all that nonsense - why didn't the author use his time to develope his characters? I'm not quite finished with this book (about 20 pages left) and will read the next in the triology only to find out what happens to Christopher - to see if the author \\"brings it together\\" (and I've already purchased the book - jury is out on whether I'll purchase the third). Most importantly I find that the author doesn't develop his characters - There isn't any connection with the \\"main\\" character Decker Hawthorne - his entire family dies and except for a few days of \\"mourning\\" his life goes on as usual - with the exception that Christopher appears at his doorstep! Decker does NOT investigate WHY his family died - and he's a REPORTER! That doesn't make sense to me - IF my entire family died along with millions of other people I'd turn over every rock to find out WHY! As to the character Christopher - he seems to be made of cardboard. I'm sure Jesus had a personality - unfortunately His \\"clone\\" doesn't! Talk about the lack of developing a character - why don't we really know what he's thinking - not just in his dreams - but what makes him \\"tick\\"? THAT's why I bought the book in the first place. In all honesty this book is NOT \\"...by far the most exciting, true-to-life portrayal of end times events...\\" as John Terry of PropheZine stated. It's really quite a disappointment. I didn't expect it to be \\"word for word\\" out of the Bible - but I did expect some character development. These people are as forgetable as last week's weather forecast. As I stated earlier I am a Christian and as such read this type of book with a different mind set than a lot of people - but even given that - the book still is a disappointment anyway you read it. In general its NOT a good book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have read The Christ Clone Trilogy three times and each time I have discovered greater and greater depth to the story and the characters. And each time I have found clues and bits of the puzzle that I missed on earlier readings. BeauSeigneur is an absolute master of the craft. I'll wait a few months, but I WILL read these books again!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"OK. I really enjoyed this book. Neat sci-fi idea: cloning Christ from an old relic. But the guy so-cloned doesn't have much of the personality of the original. He's just so...*young*. Maybe that'll develop over the course of the series. I also shuddered a bit when the guy remembers his previous life by saying, &quot;When I was Jesus...&quot; Feller, I know Jesus. Jesus was a friend o' mine. Feller, you ain't no Jesus!Anyway, carping aside, BeauSeigneur does a nice job of working in skullduggery at the UN, origin of human life on other planets, new spins on old Scriptures, and a subtly developing sense that large forces are at play and just beginning to make themselves known. True, there are some rather tedious scenes at the UN. But BeauS has enough trust in the that he doesn't beat us over the head with every potential tie-in with Revelation. Hmmm...the UN organizes itself into ten world-wide governing units? Where have I seen that? Could it be the ten kings written of in the Apocalypse?Now a question. How did France's &quot;Ambassador Moore&quot; from this book become &quot;Ambassador Faure&quot; in Book 2? The miracle of publishing?"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The entire CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY is very well written. I simply couldn't put them down. I suggest you read this series with a highlighter nearby so you can mark things and research them for yourself. This is made easier by BeauSeigneur's use of footnotes.The Christ Clone Trilogy will surprise you with nearly every page. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who wants to understand biblical prophecy and the book of Revelation. BUY THESE BOOKS, READ THEM, GIVE THEM TO YOUR PASTOR TO READ, AND BUY COPIES FOR YOUR FAMILY!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was skeptical when I started reading &quot;In His Image&quot;, since I was already being strung along with the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. In His Image grabbed my attention by the second chapter and I couldn't put the book down. The story was presented from a &quot;real world&quot; perspective with the characters unaware of the story that was unfolding. I can't wait until the I get the next two books so I can finish the story. Another intriguing point is that after the next two books, I know the story will end and I won't be waiting for the next installment, ala Left Behind."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The first two volumes are very good, the third crashes and burns...I've been reading Christian oriented fiction for years now and thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in the series.For the Christian who needs affirmation of their faith (I'm not one of them) perhaps the third volume \\"redeems\\" the first two, which propose an enjoyable \\"alternate\\" theory to existing religious dogma. However, for someone who was seeking an entertaining perspective on the \\"end of the world\\" the series took a notable turn for the worse The series is, pretty much, destroyed, with this third volume.The first two volumes build on a certain premise (no spoilers here) and we, the \\"suspending disbelief audience\\" are called on to go along with whatever the author is purporting to communicate, taking any pre-conceived ideas and putting them in a closet (Without suspending our disbelief and with a bit of knowledge regarding the scriptures, we are a frustrated audience screaming at the book \\"But what about this, and this, and this?!!\\") With this third volume, we are given the author's true motives and have that suspension broken into pieces.As readers, we are manipulated, and unfairly so. We are treated as unintelligent whelps at the whims of the author who feels justified by including a preface that excuses what he is writing and advises the reader to withhold judgment to the end of the series. Having done that, I am ashamed at the bold facedness of this manipulation. Shame on you, Mr. BeauSeigneur!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"It sure is a good thing I never actually bought this book - I borrowed it from the library after reading 5-star reviews on amazon. This is awful writing if I've ever seen it. The characters, as mentioned by scores of others, are one-dimensional - the author tells you what happens rather than bringing you into the situation and letting you see and feel for yourself. I am a fan of the Left Behind series, though I find the series to be quite long (it's not even finished yet!), at least you can connect with the characters and feel for them. The swearing also turned me off, it is unneccessary and does not belong in Christian fiction.Do not buy this book - if you really want to read it, see if you can borrow it, but DO NOT waste your money on poor writing, awful editing, and Christian fiction that is not even based on Sciptures. Read Left Behind if you want true-to-Scripture, edifying reading."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have read all of the Left Behind series, and was excited to pick up this novel, since the reviews were overwhelmingly positive about this trilogy. I am very disappointed that this book was very tedious to read. There were far too many pages discussing bureaucrats in the UN, and all of their parliamentary acts. The characters were cardbard shapes with no dept whatsoever. We met Decker in the first pages, and by page 413, we know nothing about him, more than he felt bad about losing his family, moved on quickly as a press secretary for a bureaucrat, and has maintained the job (seemingly mindlessly) for 25 years. He never asked once why his whole family died, and he lived. His wife mentioned half a sentence about being born again, but never finished the sentence. It obviously wasn't important enough to discuss later that day? Or for the next week, before the Rapture occurred?On that fact, why did NO ONE notice that the Rapture ocurred? You can't tell me that not a single non-believer knew of the Rapture. Every imaginable reason was discussed, except this one.Time flew in this book. It was the exact opposite as Left Behind, which dragged out a month into an entire $24 dollar novel. The characters all got old, but never got smarter, never asked questions, and walked through the novel like clones. Only Scott and Joel were dynamic, but unfortunately for Scott, he was such an unlikeable character, that it didn't really matter. And what of Tom? He was a developed character who completely disappeared half way through the book. I know it is a trilogy, but there is too much of a detachment of characters, that we know little or nothing of his existance the last 20 years (and he never called his friend Decker to tell him he was alive!).I am seriously debating on buying the second installment. In the Left Behind series, it took about 9 installments, before I felt dissatisfied. I wanted to throw this book aside at page 200, since it was nothing more than a who's who of the United Nations, an organization with no teeth or jurisdiction over anyone. Was he developing the UN to become Antichrist? The Left Behind Series did the exact same thing.I guess I'll check the local library so I can save the $15 on a new copy."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"If you loved Left Behind you will be bitterly dissapointed by this book.Author has gone through a lot of trouble to get the facts and work on theories but not gone through any trouble of developing characters and intertwining their life with the story.Story jumps through characters without allowing a reader to attach themselves and it is pretty dry and hard to swallow.My question for the Author is who did he write this book for, born again Christians will not enjoy it since we don;t see ourselves in it and unsaved won't get it since it will go right over their heads. Left Behind writers knew exactly who their target market was and they presented it in the right way.I loved the testimonies of salvation in Left Behind series (many of them) and there is maybe one of these in the whole of this series (in three books)I believe as a writer you have to pick a side you are on when you decide to write this kind of a book and stick with it, it amazes me how much trouble the author went through to sell the devil's story and how little time he spent on the Christians themselves, very sad if you ask me.Finally, if you want a good book and you are a born again Christian, don;t waste your time, you will be dissapointed.Mladen Alfeldi"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I thought this book was very unique, creative and different from what I have read before. I love the perspective that the author took. Definitely made me want to read the second book!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I have read this series of books at least three different times and am amazed by them each time. I have read the Left Behind series and enjoyed them very much but I cannot compare the two series because there is absolutely no comparison to be made. The \\"right now\\" feeling I get from the CCT is spine tingling and makes me question the world around me, wondering if I too could be so easily fooled. I sent these books to my father-in-law a few years back, who I would not call a practicing Christian, and he finished all three books in less than 2 weeks and was searching for more by this author right away. I would suggest this series to any and everyone because there is not a slam you in the face religious rant to them, just a GREAT story!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"My first time through the Christ Clone Trilogy left me shaken and brought me to my knees. I came face-to-face with my own arrogance in believing that as a Christian I could not be fooled by an anti-Christ. Page by page author BeauSeigneur skillfully weaves end-time Bible prophecy and history with present day technology, culture, and spirituality to create a scenario so clear that no matter what else you believe, you will know that this not only could happen, but that we are witnessing it happening now. I thank God that He led me to this riveting series, I reread it every few years, and I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I started reading the Left Behind series and was fully involved with the first six books and read them in about two weeks. Then I got to the 7th book the Indwelling and seemed like the whole series just fell apart. I tried to keep going but after book 10, I quit. The main reason? I read the Christ Clone Trilogy. It had to be one of the best reading experiences I ever had, I could not put the books down. It was a good blend of end times prophecy mixed with science to explain how events will happen. It was also a better read because it explained the final judgments from the sinner's view vs the believer's view like the Left Behind series. I highly recommend anyone to read this if they have any interest on the end times and presented in a way that \\"it could happen that way\\"."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This is certainly one of those books that leave you thinking: what if...?Not many books I have read had that effect on me, but this one grabbed my attention from the first page....I would absolutely recomend it to all those readers who are looking for a good plot, believable, and with an open mind."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Forget the other ten or more series book. These trilogy is the real deal. Superb story line, easy to read and understand. The mix of real facts and fiction are well done as well. I am curious to why these trilogy has not come to a theater near you..."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This first volume in The Christ Clone Trilogy starts off fast and quickly picks up pace. It's a great start for what promises to be a great series. I'm already halfway through the second installment and it's just as good as the first. I've personally tried to read the \\"Left Behind\\" series first but choked on the first book of that series, I'm amazed that that particular series is so popular because it's soooo bad! The authors of the \\"Left Behind\\" manage to make the end of the world a boring yawn-worthy tale. \\"In His Image\\" on the other hand is on the nose with plot, characters, and pace."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"For those who did not look favorably on this trilogy and gave up either just before or just after reading the second book... boy, you missed it! I understand the discomfort a Christian feels wading through Book 2... I felt some of the story bordered on blasphemy myself. I had to convince myself to buy Book 3. But I kept thinking, \\"The author had a disclaimer in the beginning asking readers to stick with it until the third book.\\" So I did... on faith. In Book 3 the story and characters come together so beautifully! Book 3 reveals all, and then you understand more about what is not said in the first two books (which serve basically to tell the reader about events rather than characters and to \\"deceive\\" the reader as the world will one day be deceived.) I don't want to reveal too much, but my overall impression (after reading this series at least three times) is that the message of the author is: this is one way it could happen, and I want you to see it from the eyes of a man who didn't have a clue... who lived in a world that didn't have a clue. I was impressed with the author's research, and I am grateful for what I learned from him. Dear Reader, just stick it out to about Page 100 of the third book, and I think you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I was very impressed by these three books. I am not religious and read these out of curiosity. I enjoyed them very much. I cared a lot about Decker and I found that his character was well developped.

Intriguing in the aspect of cloning. I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"My only disappointment with the Christ Clone Trilogy is that there's not a dozen of them. I want a sequel, a prequel, and if not that then at least more books by Beauseigneur."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Add me to the list of people who think the Christ Clone Trilogy is greatly superior to the Left Behind series. I still like Left Behind and I'll buy and read the rest of the series, whether there's 12 or 18 books because I'm interested in the characters, but for explaining prophecy, Revelation, the tribulation, and everything else about the end times and for telling a story that seems really real, the Christ Clone Trilogy does a better job, hands down!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This 'end of the world' books tend to cover so many characters and so many events that a reader can get lost. BeauSeigneur does a good job of always returning to his two main characters, Decker Hawthorne and Christopher Goodman. I like that he has researched and footnoted much of his information. When he gets to the speculation he has some interesting extensions of current and historical events which he can fit into a countdown to the end of days. I just wish there were more female characters -- hello, women are half the species folks!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"In His Image is the first book of a fantastic, horrifying, and powerfully moving trilogy. I was deeply touched by some of the character's insights on God and why we are here. I didn't want it to end.

Left Behind is nothing compared to Christ Clone Trilogy!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Superbly structured, marvelous manipulation of time constraints, artisitic delivery of each and every paragraph! I stand in complete awe, at the wonder of this series! It was great, I recommend it to ALL!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The author does a nice job of bringing ancient prophecy and modern technology together in an Apocaplyptic vision. The characters are full-blooded and integrate seamlessly into the plot. BeauSeigneur deserves praise for allowing his version of Revelation to unfold without having characters pop up at every turn to say, &quot;Hey, guys! Isn't this just like Chapter 3, verse 2? Why, this is the Apocalypse!&quot; Rather, the author keeps you wondering who the goods guys and bad guys are, and as with real people, most of these are a bit unsure over what's good and what's bad. For me, it's much easier to accept that ultimate evil will rise on human weaknesses rather than supernaturally assert itself with some in-your-face nastiness. My principal regret is that the author really doesn't credibly follow through on some developments. Millions die and the reaction is &quot;That was strange. We'll have to study this.&quot; Which is OK for a while, but the book never returns to give the resolution. So the reader is asked to accept as given a bit more than I was completely satisfied with. Overall, this omission did not override my enjoyment of this intriguing vision and I'll go on to the next in the trilogy. It just would have been nice perhaps to have made this a 'quadrilogy' and fill in some of the logical gaps along the way."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"\\"In his Image\\" is by far the most entertaining book I've ever read. James BeauSeigneur does a marvelous job of creating a story that both maintains suspense and fulfills end time phophecy in an amazingly plausible way. Current day philosophical opinions, scientific theories, religions and world views are used perfectly together to weave a story that keeps you turning the pages. I even found myself reading the Bible to guess where the story might go next. After I finished reading all the books in \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" I did my own research on some of the topics covered in the book and it's scary how some of the things the \\"bad guys\\" do/believe are based on actual people in positions of power. It's a highly entertaining book in the most chilling of ways."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"&quot;In His Image&quot; is a fanciful tale that relys on some commonly and some not so commonly held interpretations of end-time events as predicted in the Bible. It is cleverly woven and fast-paced (if you skip the boring parts) offering the reader a plateful of food for thought. The question of cloning the Messiah is indeed an interesting one but is there any scriptural evidence to support such a possibility? It will surprise many to learn that there is. Unhappily, Mr. Beauseigneur is ignorant of this evidence (and of the true source from which the clone will be created) and his lack of understanding of &quot;prophecies and times&quot; forces him to fabricate possibilities on the back of an incomplete skeleton of Bible verses. While &quot;The Christ Clone Trilogy&quot; is classified as a work of fiction Mr Beauseigneur was careful to footnote certain passages to add authenticity to his work of imagination. Having read only the first of the three volumes I defer to the author's request (directed to Christians - which I am not) to remember the words of Ecclesiastes 7:8; The end of a matter is better than its beginning."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had been reading the Left Behind Series and saw the Christ Clone Trilogy listed as books that others had bought. I read the reviews of the trilogy and thought I'd give it a shot. And I was very pleased with the results. The books are fantastic. As a Christian, I was almost ready to put the book down because I felt the direction he was going was anti-christian, but I stuck it out because I wanted to see where he would go. The author does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat and building a deceptive belief of what is good and what is evil. If you like the Left Behind Series, you'll like this trilogy much better. And if you didn't like the Left Behind Series, I think you will really enjoy this one. Excellent books!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"At the urging of an excellent author, I gave this book another try--I am so glad I did!! Bound and determined to make it all the way through this time, I found myself unable to put it down--read it in two days and am so thankful I have the next two waiting on my nightstand!!Mr. BeauSeigneur has written a smart, insightful, story of the endtimes that is perfect reading for this time in our nation's history!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Christ Clone is far and away the greatest treatment of end times prophecy I have ever read. It is much better than Left Behind! I am convinced that the events potrayed in the trilogy will be closely played out in the real world. This trilogy contains a very believable Anti-Christ figure. Christ Clone will make you think! These books were so good that they will canonized on my bookshelf for sure!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Voltaire said that if God didn't exist, it would be necessary for Man to invent Him.In \\"In His Image\\", Man does exactly that.James Beauseigneur may very well have put literary form to the old bumper sticker \\"Christ is Coming: Look Busy!\\", with \\"In His Image\\", the first little broadside in a wickedly absorbing trilogy that dares ask the question: \\"hey, izzat JESUS you got in this here petri dish, Doctor?\\"Bottom line: bewhiskered professor of Genetics Harry Goodman goes on a little combo Holy Land walkabout & research project to do a full genetic & biological scrape of the Shroud of Turin, supposedly the cerement of Jesus Christ, which bears the image of Christ left from the energy unleashed in His supposed Resurrection.The Shroud doesn't mind. The genetic Scrape & Peel, I mean. About the Resurrection, I have no idea.Anyway, let's just say while they're scraping the Shroud, a little something extra comes off. And let's just say that the Good Professor saves that little something extra, because in this life, if it's not about getting the Little Something Extra, it's about nothing at all.Faster than you can say \\"beam me up Scotty!\\" you've got a precocious kid running around, a smart little tyke with a keen interest in the UN and an astonishing ability to levitate and walk on water.I'm kidding about those last two things, but I couldn't help myself.Look: I think it's awesome that something called \\"Christ the Clone\\" exists. I *dig* the idea. And whereas the \\"Left Behind\\" series from LaHaye & Jenkins concerns itself with the tactical of the New Messiah and his foes, BeauSeigneur is focused more on the strategic: the book reads more like the highpoints of an Apocalyptic powerpoint presentation than the down & dirty everyday drama of a Left Behind.If that sounds bad---well, depends on what you're after. I found \\"In His Image\\" completely absorbing and compulsively readable: indeed, I polished it off in about three hours and I'm getting ready to dig into #2.But be warned: BeauSeigneur might as well be writing what amounts to a Pentagon briefing: his style is pulpy but bland, and the characterization---particularly, oddly, of the 'Christ' child---is brief and shallow. Actual physical descriptions, of locations, events, and characters, are either non-existent, or told secondhand---from a news report, for example, as happens when Moscow learns an entirely new meaning of \\"Scorched Earth\\". BeauSeigneur is a much better plotter than he is a writer.Those glaring weaknesses would normally doom a book for me, but \\"In His Image\\" is furiously engaging, bristingly with a lot of very juicy, intriguing ideas, ample Machiavellian gamesmanship at the UN, and an interesting subplot developing about the Messianic Jews.There's even a dastardly, scheming French villain; speaking of which, there's a moment where BeauSeigneur takes his characterization gloves off & bobs and weaves with the story---you'll know it when you read it. It's a wicked moment, but all too brief: here's hoping the author loosens up going forward.Whether you're pulpy tales of Apocalyptic doom (who isn't?), or always wondered what a test-tube Jesus would look like, \\"In His Image\\" is juicy stuff.JSG"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"A friend recommended The Christ Clone Trilogy to me as a recreational read, so I figured I'd start out at book 1... In His Image by James Beauseigneur. I'll give books 2 and 3 a try, but I'm hoping they are better than the first one.A newspaper reporter, Decker Hawthorne, figures out a way to get himself on a team that is investigating whether the Shroud of Turin is authentic. A few years after the team comes up with their conclusion (it's not), one of the scientists finds living DNA on the Shroud and is able to clone those cells into a living human, Christopher... essentially the clone of Christ if the shroud was real. Through a disaster causing worldwide deaths (supposed to be the Rapture), the United Nations takes on a much more important role in the world, and Decker ends up as the main staffer to the guy who becomes the Secretary General of the UN. Decker also ends up becoming the guardian of Christopher when his \\"parents\\" die off in the disaster. Christopher knows the story of his origin, and shows some remarkable powers. He's also seen by a group of \\"New Age\\" leaders as the person to lead the world to a new era of peace and prosperity. Add in Israeli/Arab conflicts, apocalyptic wars, and one world rule, and you sort of see where this is going. At the end of the book, Christopher takes off for a 40 day fast and comes back convinced of his mission and calling in the world, whatever that might be...While I want to like this book, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it (yet). There are a large number of plot holes where important events and facts (in my opinion) are just bypassed, and the story jumps forward a number of years or months. It also suffers a great deal when you draw the inevitable comparisons to the Left Behind series, even though this one came first. I understand that books two and three are supposed to be much better, so I'm clinging on to some level of hope that my time spent reading this will be rewarded. This is definitely not a book that stands on its own without the support of future books, so I'll reserve full judgement until then. But at this point in time, I'd have to rate this book average at best..."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I had orginally found out about this trilogy in the late 1990s when looking for information about the Left Behind series. About two years ago, I stumbled upon it again and decided to purchase Book 1, published sometime after 2001.I was surprised and somewhat disappointed to find that it had been revised to make it more current by including such things as 9/11 and George W. Bush as president. This made it hard for me to get into the book knowing that it had been originally published prior to these events. So I am going to look for a cheap used copy published prior to 2001 to see if I enjoy it better. But if one prefers an updated version, buy any that are printed after 2001"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I wrote this review hastily....and didn't really give the author the credit I was intending...so I have revised it....I normally avoid modern thriller fiction....especially modern 'you can read this during in-flight service from Boston to D.C.' - and for some reason I keep feeling the need to remind myself why by reading modern thriller fiction.....So here we go. Great Premise! That is what earned my three star rating of the book...just the premise. A journalist finds himself enlisted to a team of scientists who attempt to carbon-date the Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth said to be embossed with the image of Christ. One scientist removes dna samples (via fibers left on the shroud)and uses them to clone Christ....or so it would seem.Flash forward years later, where the hot premise is dropped like a hot potato...and the book becomes little more than the average, dime-a-dozen political/war books...and many do it more effectively. The author is to be commended for going back and revising the book since the original publication to include such incidents as September 11th, the War on Terror, and the slaying of journalist Daniel Pearl....but after finishing the book....it seems like his effort is wasted in trying to put a shiny coating on a permanently dulled floor.The characters are perhaps a bit more interesting than your usual Tom Clancy Rogues gallery, but are lost amidst the nuclear bombs, political maneuvering, and usurping of authority that comprise three quarters of this book.Dull, dull, dull...except for those rare moments when Christopher Goodman, the 'clone' of Christ, displays his 'powers'. Other than that....the story loses grip on what interested me in the first place. Knowing that it is book one of a trilogy (and now knowing from the author himself that it was originally one large text) and knowing that the author has revised the story since initial publication....perhaps those revisions could have included more evidence of Christopher's powers being put to test/use, and a little more focus on what I assume is intended to be the main focus of the story, a clone of Christ??Sorry to say, but (for me) this only served as a good reminder as to why I usually stick to the classics for a good story....with rare exception. The book is well written, I give it that....but I am a sucker for good in-depth characterization and this story just fails to deliver that for me. I have been encouraged to continue on in the trilogy, by the author, and perhaps some day I might. For anyone interested in a timely topic (cloning) and political/military/war intrigue, this will interest you."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Though I think the first one is not the best of the trilogy, this book is very good. I bought it just to have something different to read, but when I got it I couldn't stop reading it until I finished. I found that I had been reading the whole night. Be careful not to start reading in the office or in public places, you'll find yourself bound to your chair until you finish.After that I couldn't help it and bought the others.I would like to see this trilogy translated to spanish!!!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"As a biology major with a field in laboratory science, I was mesmerized by the accuracy and plausibility of this work. In fact I would classify it as a true work of art. As a believer in God and his trinity, I find myself wishing this book to be true. The plot is detailed, and the characters so personable that you find yourself involved. Mystery lovers as well as Judeo-Christanity scholars would applaude the involvement of so many of our truths, myths, and legends. The introduction of the destructive elements (or persons) were a true surprise. I cannot wait for the next installment, and although I bought the first book in paperback, I will not wait but will purchase the hardback as soon as I can for the second novel.

More have tried to do the same on the silver screen. For the first time an author has succeeded. The plot twists in this piece of apocalyptic fiction will keep you up late at night as you try to figure out where the next turn will take you and who you should cheer and who you should fear. Even when you think you have it figured out, you have the sense that nothing is as it appears."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This series was a phenomenal read. You have to read it for yourself. Judging from other customer reviews you'll either love it or hate it, but most like me seem to love it. The guy is a genius. The tale is intricately woven with many loose ends tied up at the last possible moment. The level of detail is astounding as I found myself learning stuff about astronomy, the New Age movement, politics, and history to name just a few levels on which these books excel. Best of all, it's realistic! It seems to have been written from a secular vantage point describing supernatural events as an unbelieving world might describe them. Whatever doctrinal objections you may have with the author, don't let that stop you from enjoying one of the best fictional series of all time."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The ideas, characterization, and overall writing is far better than in Kleier's Last Day, which I waded through a few months ago. In comparison, this novel has oringinality, wit, and style. It also makes you think instead of lecturing on how you should think. Enlightening, entertaining, and thoughtful, this is a gem of the genre."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I came here because fans of this series of books have apparently taken it upon themselves to recommend this book in addition to / instead of what must be hundreds of other books. In the case of books that are cliche, unoriginal and uninspiring, this is a good &quot;In addition to&quot; recommendation -- One might as well read two bad books as opposed to one. For books that the author attempts to tell an actual story with characters that aren't straight out of a cookie-cutter, even putting this book's name on the same page is a crime.What was especially amusing are the recommendations for this book itself. Apparently 17 of the buffoons from the total &quot;Buffoon Recommandation Patrol&quot; think I should buy &quot;In His Image (Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy)&quot; instead of &quot;In His Image (Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy)&quot; I could see one person making a mistake like that, but 17 people? Is there an epidemic of stupidity going around?Oh back to the book. It was predicatable. It was contrite. It was for boring in stretches of sometimes 52 pages.

Avoid, avoid, avoid!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Devoted Christians should definitely stay away not only from this book but also from this author... better he should spend the time trying to improve his writing skills and reading the Good Book (if there's no profanity in the Bible why should there be any in this series?).

Stay away if you value the Lord's Word as well as a sense of good writing."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I'm so disappointed! After all the glowing reviews, I expected something a lot more professional and sophisticated than this. The book reads like a senior high school science project, droning on and on about the most trivial and boring details, as if to say &quot;hey everybody, see how smart I am!&quot; when in fact, it just bogs the story down in minutiae and overkill. I'll not read the next two, and highly warn everyone else to avoid this drugery!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"What Mr. James BeauSeigneur needed desperately when he finished writing this book was an editor. It pains me to think that there are two more unedited installments out there just like this one. I am embarrassed for him.The subject matter, at first glance, is intriguing but the writing is so poor that I was unable to get passed page 185. Mr. BeauSeigneur committed an author's cardinal sin and that was that he bored his reader.I was incapable of connecting with any of the characters - or rather I was unable to find any characters at all. They were stick figures that stated emotions that Mr. BeauSeigneur never showed to the reader. I had a hard time caring about anyone much less his main pseudo person, Decker Hawthorne. I do not find it surprising that Mr. BeauSeigneur's credits include successfully writing technical manuals. There are no people in technical manuals.The author's lapses into the didactic, \\" . . . okay now I'm going to teach you some history,\\" was tiresome. A good editor would have cut the superfluous dead wood and recommended that he weave the tedious stuff into the plot.As for the use of boldface, he needs to consult a punctuation book to discover the use of Italics. The front pages of any good dictionary are very informative. The point is anything that takes the reader's mind out of the story is inappropriate and the boldface, besides being incorrect, was intrusive.My recommendation is, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I realize, given the tone of many reviews on this page, that this book is intended more for a Christian crowd. I was raised Christian, but I am of the agnostic bend of atheism; i.e., I believe that if there is a 'Greater Power', then no religion has managed to properly describe it.That being said, I approached this novel with an open mind, knowing real well that a book about the clone of Jesus Christ would have a, shall we say, specifically Christian worldview. This is my biggest advice to any non-Christian picking up this book: take it as a fantasy with its own, fundamentalist Christian internal logic. Don't expect revelations about other religions.Even with that in mind, some aspects of the book shocked me a little. For instance, there is quite a lot of wishful thinking on the part of the author when he describes a Rabbi converting to Jesus Christ from a passage in the Torah. It's also somewhat amusing to see how inoffensive USA is in the events that unfold, when compared to the omnious role the UN seems poised to undertake; it feels right out of a right-wing conspiracy theory. Finally, the distribution of people 'saved' by the Rapture (i.e., a lot of rural US, very few in Europe, a very low number in Israel) made me chuckle by how unabashedly it sticks to fundamentalist cliches. Oh, and did I mention that one of the 'bad guys' is French and most likely homosexual? (This was hinted at in a very subtle manner near the end of the book.)But past all this, I found a lot to enjoy in this book. For starters, it's very well-researched. The expedition to Turin at the beginning of the book was gripping because it stuck so close to real events, and kept me reading when the book became less plausible. There's a lot of footnotes in this book, meant to underline Bible passages in many parts, that I didn't care about; they seemed to get in the way of the story. And the author's insistence in footnotes about reminding us not to assume characters say the truth when they contradict a statement from the Bible took a lot away from the suspense by making me guess, halfway through, what is supposed to be a big shock in Book 2.All in all, In His Image was enjoyable for its strong premise and its deep research, but I needed to remind myself than the author and his target readership took things for granted than were a bit irritating to me. That's fine, I'm sure it's the same problem for Christians who read books more aligned with my worldview. I could have done with better writing all around, as BeauSeigneur tends to enumerate instead of describing, which made the whole book sound like a very amateur endeavor.If you're a firm believer in Christ and find nothing offensive in a fantasy where Jews convert massively to Jesus when they read the proper passage from the Torah, then pick this book, the story and tone will please you. If you're atheist, you might enjoy it as a Christian fantasy, like I have. If you're Jewish or Buddhist or into New Age, don't pick up this book unless you have a strong sense of humor."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This writer is good with politics and technology, and he reveals the choice we must all make: to either put our trust in God or ourselves. But that's not enough!He does not fathom what spiritual progress is. When one makes his choice, he is only beginning the spiritual journey -- he has not arrived. Also, his vision of heaven is much like that promised by the antichrist -- people are lords of the universe, still given to marriage and sex, and still having children even! Jesus offers you a personal resurrection and says He'll always be nearby, but then off you go to be a star-child -- having more children and only visiting heaven if you feel so inclined. After endless pages of politics and plagues this worldly and unbiblical next life cannot convince or satisfy a spiritual Christian!And this Bible lawyer knows he's contradicting the Bible with this worldly view of the next life and even tries unsuccessfully to squirm out of it in one of his footnotes. But what can you expect from someone who insists on a version of the rapture that contradicts even that single Bible quote that theoretically refers to the rapture?!?If you want to read a Christian novel that truly looks at the spiritual battle in a futuristic setting, check out Thy Kingdom Come by Vincent Malzahn."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Before reading this book, i was an atheist. Hardcore atheist. But then, I read the book due to a friend incessantly begging me to. I was totally blown away.

I am a big fan of the Left Behind series, having read all the books, seen the movie and studied Tim LeHaye's reference material. A warning to anyone who reads the Christ Clone books....do not expect any similarity to Left Behind, except in the extensive biblical research. There is so much more international politics and &quot;new age&quot; rhetoric. Sometimes the stories of the characters seemed to get lost and the profanity, although mild, was out of place. The story reads more like a mystery novel, which made it more interesting to me. Overall,it was a thought-provoking book, enough so that I will probably read the other two books in the series."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"You've found it! I highly recommend this well-researched, gripping, fast-paced and wonderfully written novel (the whole trilogy for that matter) If you were disappointed with the poor writing and dull dialogue of the Left Behind series (I drudged through the whole series out of obligation I think) this trilogy is a refreshing and worthwhile change. If you're a fan of Michael Crichton (especially his early stuff), you'll love The Christ Clone series. The plot line is fascinating and believable. BeauSeigneur does a great job of developing his characters and crafting a great read. Rest assured the plot is not &quot;in your face&quot; evangelism but presents the end times and the rise of Antichrist how it very well may happen. Can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I just finished Acts of God (Book 3) last night. The Christ Clone Trilogy was the best set of books I have ever read. The way the author weaved fiction, prophecy and science together into a coherent and compelling story was absolutely brilliant. When I was going through The Birth of An Age (Book 2) and Christopher was presenting his case, I was truly troubled. My wife asked why I was reading a book like this. Christopher's case was so compelling. But, I told her that during any trial, you have to hear both sides of the case and this was only the prosecution's. I stuck it out and I am glad I did. If you decide to pick up this series, read the author's warning at the beginning and commit to stick it out until the end of the third book.The books, while fictional, helped me with a lot of questions. Why does God allow this to continue? What is HaSatan's motivation for causing such misery? What will heaven be like? And on and on... I have been a Christian for 30 years and read tons of theology. These books helped me form a little better picture of what the world is really like and where we're all headed."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The story kicks off when journalist Decker Hawthorne, editor of a small newspaper in Knoxville, serendipitously replaces the assistant of his former professor on a scientific study of the Shroud of Turin. Despite remarkable test results, the Shroud is subsequently determined to not be authentic under the Carbon 14 testing. So, when Professor Goodman takes a closer look years later, how is he to explain the presence of live cells taken from the shroud?While Professor Goodman sets out to study the cells with hopes of developing major leaps in medicine and ultimately proving the source of the cells to be extraterristrail, Decker is sworn to secrecy in exchange for exclusives. When he learns that Goodman has cloned the cells, can he keep quiet about the true identity of Goodman's adopted son?This is all just the beginning of a fantastic plot that sees Decker and a comrade kidnapped by Islamic terrorists, subsequently rescued and then deeply embroiled in the activities in Israel and the life of Christopher, the result of the cloning process. This is a very well written book and the author does not take the plot for granted. It is at no point predictable but it is also at no point implausible. The world events - war between Russia and Israel, Pakistan and India, the restructuring of the UN after &quot;the Disaster&quot; decimates the population, and the power struggles - all make sense in the given time line and context. This is written as a novel and not a bible study. In fact, it is not until near the end of the book that any allusions to Revelations even come up. And then, it may not be the exact story that you expected. For example, what if Judas had actually been a patsy for the apostle John? After all, it was John who wrote the book of Revelations."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I highly recommend this book. I'm not a big fiction reader. Most of what I read is related to my work. So when my father told me I had to read In His Image I was reluctant even though the idea of cloning Jesus certainly grabbed my attention. Just to see what it was about I started reading on my break at work. I won't say I was hooked in those ten minutes but it did grab me enough to keep reading later. When I really got hooked was when the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem was destroyed by terrorists. From then on I was at BeauSeigneur's mercy. His telling of the story of Revelation made it very real. I'm looking forward to book 2, Birth of an Age."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I wish I could write great reviews because the Christ Clone Trilogy deserves far better than I'm capable of writing.

It's such a powerful book that I'll never be able to come close in words to describing its effect on me. But as G. K. Chesterton once said, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.&quot; So here goes.The first thing I noticed when I began to read it was that I was totally wrapped up in the story. In other words, I was able to suspend disbelief entirely without even realizing I'd done it! When that happens, I know I'm on to a great story.The second thing I noticed is that I had the hardest time figuring out what was going to happen. That may seem like a bad thing in a novel, but, frankly, I've read too many end times books that were almost totally predictable--not to mention any names. So it was refreshing for me to be all the time trying to figure where the story's going, only to be fooled at the last moment.But what really got me is just how hard-hitting and impactful this story is. You don't often get that with religious fiction. Too many times it's watered down. Not this book. It ran over me like a bullet train.So what's the wait? Read this book now.

This first volume of the CHRIST CLONE trilogy makes very exciting reading; you'll quickly finish this book, anticipating the next two volumes: BIRTH OF AN AGE and ACTS OF GOD. Unfortunately, these subsequent volumes lack the edge and intrigue of IN HIS IMAGE. They get bogged down in the minutiae of geopolitics, the UN and asteroids.

For those who see Revelation prophecy as the stuff of legend and fantasy, the trilogy is a page-turning, surprise-a-minute, what-if techno-thriller. Either way, these are great books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"If you pick up In His Image, dedicate yourself to reading the entire trilogy before passing any judgment regarding the content. Christian readers may become uncomfortable with the direction the plot takes, but all three books should be read with an open mind to obtain the big picture.In His Image starts out rather slowly, with vital exposition - but one doesn't know how vital it is until later, in some cases midway through the last book. The first 100 pages might be difficult to get through, but suddenly the book explodes with a single chapter and the reader can't put it down after that.Rarely does an author skillfully pull me along to accept a viewpoint that might not reflect my own inclination or beliefs, but BeauSeigneur not only does this, but then skillfully turns everything against his reader in a turnaround that will leave you reeling and amazed. While it may be possible to buy the first book to \\"see how it is\\" and then hop up and down until you can get your hands on the second, I'd recommend buying all three at the same time - or, at the very least, buy the last two at the same time, as book two is slim and so compelling you'll go crazy waiting to get your hands on the final volume if it's not at your fingertips.The writing is excellent; the plot masterful and the characters so well-crafted you'll form solid opinions and emotions about them as if you had met them. This trilogy also has something other works of fiction lack: scholarship. One can't write about the apocalyptic literature of religious tradition without thoroughly researching the original texts, and BeauSeigneur meticulously footnotes every reference for the reader. In no way could I find biblical scripture twisted to serve the plot of these books; instead, the plot is a very creative and plausible interpretation of the actual text of scripture. In the final analysis, the books are more creative intellectually than they are doctrinally bound; for what might be a more \\"mainstream\\" Christian account, read LaHaye's Left Behind series, which is also very compelling, but does not approach the subtlety of BeauSeigneur's shadowy portrait of the New Age.Whether the reader is Christian or not, the trilogy raises somber questions about the New Age in general and man's place in the universe. A thrilling ride no matter how or why you read it!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"It is hard to resist comparing this series with the Left Behind series, which I've also read. If you only have time to read one, read this one. Both are fictionalized accounts of the book of Revelation, but this is better done, nor does it drag out as long. In this one, Christopher Goodman is the anti-Christ, and I'd suspected so only because I'd read Revelation, but this portrayal of the anti-Christ is more convincing. You're supposed to be decieved into following him, right? Well, this guy seems so nice that I had to sneak a peek at this reviews for the other books in the series to be sure that he really does turn out to be the bad guy. Now I see how people could be deceived by the anti-Christ. In the Left Behind series, the authors so beat you over the head with how evil Carpathia is that you're left wondering why in the world others don't see through him. If nothing else, this alone makes this series better.It also has a different way of interpreting the rapture of Church. A word of caution - it is somewhat graphic. This disappearing act in the Left Behind series might be easier to stomach in that respect.So far I have not finished the entire series yet, but I've at least enjoyed the first book and its premise."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"After hearing about the plot of this book I eagerly anticipated it. Wow, the idea of cloning Christ from the Shroud of Turin, what possibilities for a story! Having read it I have to say it pretty much left me feeling lukewarm. The book is so-so on several levels. First, the author had a tremendous opportunity to take the shroud cloning to some exciting technological twists and scintillating religious arguments but he barely scratched the surface on both accounts, choosing to skim over these areas. A whole book in my opinion could've been written on the cloning of Christ. This aspect left me feeling unfulfilled as a reader as it did not live up to my expectations at all. Second, there is no real drama or suspense in the book and for the most part it was lifeless. The story even skims over the events and fallout of the \\"rapture\\", the biblical event where Christian believers are taken up into heaven. At no time does he ever use the word rapture. Rather this world changing event is called, rather obliquely I might add, 'The Disaster'. There are a few areas where it got a little exciting but as a whole the story was flat. Probably the most exciting part was at the very end when the power of Christian Goodman (the cloned \\"Christ\\") becomes revealed when he challenges the French Ambassador to the United Nations (UN). But it was too little too late. Also, there is no distinguishable prime antagonist in the story. So where is the tension? Where is the drama, the conflict? The author, with a background on political science, seems to go into great depth about the development of the UN and the establishment of the 10 UN regions (which refer biblically to the 10 kingdoms created during the Great Tribulation). Since the book is definitely going down that path where is the anti-Christ? Lastly, there is a chapter where the Ark of the Covenant is recovered and handed over to the Italian government in exchange for UN support. This whole scene was disappointing. The Ark would have to be the greatest archeological find of the age and yet the author once again skims over the details of how it is found and the significance of it. Instead, he seemed to plod along his political sidetrack of the UN and setting the trilogy up for what I can only hope for a much greater 2nd and 3rd book. The book does \\"read\\" well with good dialog and text and I found it interesting on a conceptual level of how the Great Tribulation might unfold but this is just not enough to carry the story. The book seemingly covers much of the same ground as the well known \`Left Behind' series so there is a bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu there. I however found the Left Behind series much better on nearly every level and would recommend that series over this trilogy (although you'd have to persist thru the marathon 12 books to get to the conclusion). Perhaps books 2 and 3 of this trilogy pick up and the story finishes strong but for now I can only give a lukewarm recommendation."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I read this trilogy about 10 years ago in paper back when I was a very young Christian and had many fond memories of it's gripping entertainment. The basic premise of the story which is centered around the concept of a pre-tribulation rapture is actually quite intriguing, and that is why it got a 3 star instead of 2. The writing is actually fairly amatuerish, kind of like watching a good movie with B acting going on. It's entertaining, but not necessarily one that you would read again.I got it because of my memories and also because it was on sale at the time. I would not recommend it for full price.Besides the just OK writing, one major point is that we have seen via 9-11 and other tragic events how the world's economy is linked to catastrophic events. This book doesn't even address such things. It's almost as if the people who are not directly impacted have had no strain put on their lives financially. No mention of the markets crashing, etc. which would likely happen in an event as epic as the rapture.Besides that, there is the extreme artisitic license that is used to try and link some of the events to biblical accounts. I looked at all of the notes for each of the notes listed and some of them are plausible, and others are just wishful thinking.In any case, I bought book two so that I can finish the trilogy as I want to satisfy my curiosity about my memories of the books. My recommendation for this - It's generally entertaining, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Not a bad book, but not good enough to convince me to purchase the subsequent books at the prices they are currently listed (roughly $10 for the second book). My main complaint with this book is how often the author skipped time. He would write a problem or major discovery into the plot and end the chapter. I would eagerly turn the page only to find &#34;eight years later&#34; as the first words of the next chapter. The author would then write about what had happened from the characters' memories. I find this extremely annoying and a cheap trick to get around the difficulty of resolving a conflict. If it happens once, I don't mind too much. However, it happened 4-5 times in the first book alone."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Not only was this very poorly written, the theology was very anti-Christian. God is presented as a selfish, arrogant deity, John the disciple as a traitor, and Judas Iscariot as the only true friend of Christ. Do not waste the time reading this!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"STarted off really interesting but soon got to much into politics and world order. I was looking for something that was more religous based and si fi. Not entertaining enough to keep my interest."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"BeauSeigneur's take on the Rapture, the Ezekiel 38-39 war, the Trumpet Judgments, and on soooo much else is not only the most original (while staying within the bounds of scripture), it's also the most believable depiction I've ever seen. The 6th Trumpet Judgment (in book 2) and the 5th Bowl Judgment (in book 3) will scare you like you've never been scared before!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Well, all I have to say is just that I won't just go for anything in search of entertainment. The Left Behind series was true to the scriptures. All this stuff about cloning Christ's tissues and stuff leave me with a bad taste in the mouth. It's not scriptural and I wonder what we are headed to...Let's not take creativity too far, please. Otherwise there's no difference between true christianity and the rest. That's no thanks for me.Of course, some may disagree. That's OK."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I am a large fan of fictional and tutorial works based on the book of Revelations, my favorite book in the Bible. As such, in regard to fictional works, I have read (books) and seen (movies)depicting many different authors' ideas concerning the end times. Some were very far fetched and did not follow the prophesy and there are a rare few that not only follow the prophesy, but are also very entertaining and hard to put down such as the Left Behind Series by LaHaye and Jenkins. The Christ Clone Series is one of these works also. It puts a different spin on the Rapture than I have seen, but it backs it up with scripture. Through out the book, there are footnotes refering to actual events and science reference. The author does an excellent job of intermingling scriptural prophesy, science, and history, referencing actual people and events, into one of the most believable works of fiction I have read. For those worried that this book may not be based on scripture, rest assurred. Not only does he do this, but he has created a very soul moving ending. This is one of my favorite works to date. It was so gripping I read all three books in 3 days."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"These books were awesome! So much better than the Left Behind books (which I've also read). The author is a Christian who is writing to bring in a more secular audience than say the LB books might. In the LB books, it's been said they are \\"preaching to the choir\\". In this selection, there is more guessing in who the bad guy is and what is going to happen (if you haven't read or heard about the Revelation prophecies that is). In this aspect, the author did a great job! Also, I believe Christopher (who seems like a nice guy and swayed people to his side) was more believable as the anti-Christ than Carpathia who is oozing evil the entire time. Well, that is my opinion anyway. Yes, he was VERY detailed, more than some people wanted I'm sure but he's so good at telling the little things! Also, yes he had you going one way with your thinking and then turns it around in the end (which we already knew if you believe what is supposed to happen in the end times) but for a non-believer, this might put them on the edge of their seat. wondering how it will end, etc... Anyway, when I read a review this wasn't exactly \\"like the end times\\" well I think he follows the steps in Rev. like other authors have done. This one just did a better job of making it more real for us. or to myself and those that I've discussed these books with. great books, I read them all in a week, they will get detailed in places but give them a try!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This story was, quite simply, based on nothing. The Turin Shroud has been proven to be a fake - not just by Carbon-14 dating but also by thermoluminesnce and electron spin resonance tests as well as by historical criticism of extant records. Yet this whole book is based on it being &quot;the real thing.&quot; There are enough flaws in Christianity as a religion without bringing in patently false history. This is not to bash Christians - it is simply a fact in the research that I have done.The somewhat &quot;other-wordly&quot; nature of Jesus posited in the book was an interesting twist but not enough to carry the day for me. This book tries to walk that secular/religious line and, I guess for the most part it does okay on that, but the whole basis of the plot is ruined right from the start with the Shroud material.True believers in Christianity will probably not like where the book goes. Secular readers will not be gulliable enough (in the religious sense) to buy into the premise."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This series appeals as another of the \\"end times\\" novels and is a good story, as it goes. The reason for only 1 star is that the author, in pursuing \\"realism,\\" has his characters use profanity throughout the book. As Christians we are to keep our language pure, and even if only the non-Christians use profanity, the reader must still experience it. With violence, the author would be telling us ABOUT something evil, but with profanity, he is committing it against us. Too bad--I was hoping for something appropriate for Christians."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"I ordered this book after finishing the last Left Behind book. Despite the strange bi-polar reviews, I still gave it a shot, because of the idea. Unfortunately, an idea is not enough. The writing is strictly third rate. I give it two stars for the idea...."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"When my grandmother first introduced me to the left behind series, I was ecstatic. However that series is constantly declining in quality. When I decided to give this series a chance I didn't know what to expect.

By the books! Forget left behind, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The first I heard of this book it had been described as \\"if Tom Clancy had written Left Behind\\". I liked the story but it never grabbed me like the \\"Left Behind\\" series of books did. This book started slowly introducing cahracters and setting a real scientific backgroud for the premise of the story.

It was a huge disappointment to me because, as a Christian, I found this near blasphemy. I was uncomfortable reading the book with such distortions of Biblical doctrine. Though I realized this book was not a historical account, I wasn't prepared for the twists and turns, which were written convincingly well, thinking all the time about those who read this but aren't well read in the Scriptures. The danger ever present in my mind was the harm that could be done to a person seeking spiritual significance when they are not founded in sound doctrine. What would such notions do to earnest seekers?I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is totally wack. The research was impressive, but that's about it. The only reason I even finished was because I bought the book and felt obligated to finish it- I'm not even interested in finishing the trilogy. Decades are skipped and connection to the characters is non-existant. On the back of the book one reviewer wrote, \\"C.S. Lewis couldn't have done it better.\\" C.S. Lewis wouldn't do it in the first place."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"This book is an interesting start of a three book set.

Over the years I've read and reread the biblical books of Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, etc., but I always came away just scratching my head. I've read numerous fiction and non-fiction interpretations of the end times but it's been pretty obvious in most of those books that the authors were as confused as I was.What BeauSeigneur has done with the Christ Clone Trilogy is nothing short of remarkable. It is so well written, so well developed, and so well researched that there is hardly any need to suspend disbelief. I couldn't help but feel that I was actually there, experiencing each of the prophetic events and circumstances. I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"One of the best series ever read. I don't read that much, but I read all 3 books in less then 12 days.

So looking for something else to fill the gap, I found out about In His Image (Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy) After reading the reviews, I ordered the books, only to find I had to finish all of them. This edge of your seat, thrill ride, has you thinking, feeling and wondering. All of it very logical and very entertaining. If you are looking for a great read, then this book and the other two in the series are it. At this point I find my self looking for more information, and books on this topic to read.

Anyway, I've been seing all the recommendations for In His Image by James BeauSeigneur and then I saw him on the Harvest Show on TV. Just to check it out, I bought the book and it really is a GREAT book. It's not at all like Left Behind even though it's about the end times. Instead you see things more from the perspective of non Christians who don't know what's hapening because things aren't as obvious as they are in Left Behind.

It's hard to believe this is his maiden voyage beyond writing technical manuals and speeches. This book has it all. Suspense, graphic imagery, complex and interesting characters, twists and turns in the plot, political rivalries, and warring religious factions; all easily read and a scholarly approach to boot. His impressive research and exhaustive study on a wide variety of topics illustrates his extraordinary grasp on complex subjects, from astrophysics to the Bible.Although I am not a Christian, and certainly no Biblicist, I am familiar with the premise of the Book of Revelation and with \\"end times\\" stories.

I enjoyed it so much that I actually emailed the author, via the publishers, to find out if he had written any other fiction books!!! That's a first for me!I read quite a few of the reviews tying to decide if I should purchase the books. I must admit after reading the reviews I was put off from buying the series thinking that maybe I was wasting my money - BUT - I'm sooooooooo glad that I changed my mind and went for it!What an amazing, gob smacking read they have been. I could not put down the first book in the series. There is just no way to know what was going to happen next - this trilogy is not a predictable read.Other reviewers have written about the the main storylines so I would just like to say that this trilogy is much better than the last 10 books of the Left Behind series rolled together.Don't be put off by the other not so positive reviews - go read it for yourself."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"Wow! I find myself amazed at this! I read the first 3 Left Behind books, and while I enjoyed them, I can wait for the rest of the series. Not so with this! I borrowed this book, so until I get book #2, the wait will be most anxious!BeauSeigneur tells you in the beginning to never assume that the characters speak for him. But this is based on scripture, and it is very clever, as well as very in depth as well as accurate! But it does keep one guessing.A few of the characters are as follows. Decker Hawthorne, he has lost everything, his family, and he works as a reporter. There is Christopher Goodman, who lives with Decker after the Disaster, and happens to be a clone. There is a man named Milner, who knows all about Christopher. Then there is the very mysterious Tibetan, Master Djwlij Kajm. Who are these people?You may be asking questions such as myself. Questions like, \\"What kind of title is that for a trilogy?\\" Hey, it is thrilling, exciting, and sometimes even a little chilling.LaHaye and Jenkins are good. BeauSeigneur is by far better. He has praise by authors such as Ted Dekker and W.G. Griffiths. Now he has my praise! Don't pay any attention to the knuckle-headed reviews that are negative. They don't know what they're talking about. James BeauSeigneur does. Don't believe this? Read the scriptures!Mind boggling, and deserves great applause!"},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"\\"In His Image,\\" the first book of \\"The Christ Clone\\" trilogy, author James BeauSeigneur captures your imagination and draws you completely into the world that exists between it's covers. It is an exhilarating experience. A highly imaginative and extremely well written novel of epic proportions, it covers a span of over forty years, during which time the reader is transported from the world as we know it today, to the very dawning of the \\"New Age.\\" The story unfolds with a ring of authenticity that makes it a compelling read, with a scope reminiscent of Asimov's classic, \\"Foundation.\\"The story begins \\"two decades ago,\\" as journalist Decker Hawthorne attaches himself to a large contingent of American scientists who are off to Italy to conduct tests on the Shroud of Turin, long believed to be the burial cloth of Christ, in an effort to determine it's authenticity. The first two chapters are a dramatization of an actual expedition in 1978, and BeauSeigneur draws upon the published reports of the actual scientists involved, seamlessly weaving fact and fiction together to create a riveting narrative, much as Michael Crichton did with \\"Eaters of the Dead.\\" He uses footnotes to reference factual information, which gives the reader the best of both worlds-- documentation of an important historical event, but delivered within the context, and with the flow, of a well written novel-- rather than in the dry, academic tone of a text book.The third chapter jumps ahead ten years-- the first of many transitions that encompass months or years, a technique effectively employed throughout the book by BeauSeigneur-- and here the story begins in earnest. During the expedition to Turin, due to time constraints the scientists were limited as to the number and types of tests they were able to conduct; now, Harry Goodman, a member of the Turin team, has reexamined some of the samples taken from the shroud and has uncovered what he believes is the most important discovery since Columbus discovered the New World. A phone call later, Decker Hawthorne is with his old colleague Goodman, who promises Decker exclusive rights to what will be an evolving story, if he will agree to provide Goodman with confidentiality, and publish his report only when-- according to Goodman-- the time is right. And it's only the beginning of an extraordinary story that will sweep you along without pause to the very end.BeauSeigneur brings his characters vividly to life, and with a depth that along the way offers some real insight into human nature. Those who populate his world are very real, and there are those with whom you will readily identify, for he presents a far-ranging and diverse cross section of humanity that reflects a number of attitudes and perspectives. There are, indeed, heroes and villains, but BeauSeigneur makes them believable and avoids any cliches or stereotypes, which gives them the necessary credibility. You'll recognize some of these people; they're friends and co-workers, neighbors and acquaintances, and some of celebrity. All of those who make up the very real world in which we live.BeauSeigneur facilitates entry into this world and makes suspension of disbelief easy, by grounding even the most extreme episodes in reality. He does this through the occasional use of footnotes, which elucidate facts, or supply the reader with context through specific passages from the Bible. His most effective means, however, is by establishing a frame of reference for the reader, in which actual places and events become an integral part of the story. The U.N., for example, is central to the story, as is the Wailing Wall in Israel. The conflicts and cataclysms that ensue, as well as the politics and parties involved, are all realistically rendered, and BeauSeigneur keeps it all flowing steadily forward with a brisk pace and impeccable transitions, through which suspense builds so rapidly that at times you will not be able to turn the pages quickly enough. There is one section involving strategic issues that gets a bit technical, a la Tom Clancy, but it affords the reader a basis of understanding that later becomes invaluable in appreciating the full impact of certain incidents that come to pass, and BeauSeigneur's approach is similar to what Melville did with \\"Moby Dick.\\" By the time the whale breaches, you know the importance of the harpooner, as well as that of the rest of the sailors in the longboat.In the final analysis, \\"In His Image\\" is a stirring, thought-provoking novel that will no doubt induce you to take pause and reflect upon the state of the world around you. Thoroughly entertaining and at times profound, it will literally take you to another place and another time."},{"Title":"In His Image: Book One of The Christ Clone Trilogy","review":"The previous reviewer (a reader from Pennsauken, NY) quotes a line from IN HIS IMAGE. He even does it correctly. But he fails to notice that the book states that the narrative starts &quot;20 years ago.&quot; Thus the &quot;then-current method(s)&quot; refers to dating methods available in 1983 not what was done in 1988. The reviewer also fails to notice that on the page BEFORE the quoted line, BeauSeigneur himself refers to the 1988 C-14 tests, both in the narrative AND in a footnote.The Christ Clone Trilogy is fiction, but it is among the best researched an presented fiction written in any genre.

The army wanted a super-bomber in peacetime, and the company designed it as a private venture. Not until 1940 was there an actual contract--for two planes, out of a fleet that would number 3,895. They cost $3 billion, making the B-29 the most expensive weapon of World War II, not excluding the atomic bomb.Vander Meulen is less interested in the weapon than in the industrial phenomenon--the B-29 as product of a U.S. emerging from depression and despair to find itself the most powerful country in the world.Of four factories that built it, the most successful was in Wichita. Kansas offered good weather, level ground, security from foreign raiders, and thousands of patriotic, hard-working people with few job opportunities. The magnitude of a $3 billion program in those days can be gauged by the cost of a meal at Boeing-Wichita (28 cents including soup, coffee, and pie) and by the hourly wage (75 cents).You worked 10 hours a day for 12 days, then got two days off. You earned $52.50 a week on the average, allowing for overtime but not for payroll deductions. Like the Pentagon, Musak, the preeminence of Boeing as an airframe builder--even many of our airports and factories--the withholding tax was a product of the war machine that the U.S. became in World War II.As an economist, Vander Meulen brings a refreshing perspective to these developments. He concludes with this arithmetic: for every ton of explosives dropped by a B-29 on Japan, an American worked 3.4 years to get it there, and a Japanese worked 50 years to repair the damage."},{"Title":"Building the B-29 (Smithsonian History of Aviation and Spaceflight)","review":"In &quot;Inferno&quot;, published 2000, it is projected that B-29 firebombings killed more than both atomic raids,yet the public is not aware.

Whether you're dealing with Linux, Unix, or BeOS, it's the principles that matter, not the implementation.The second was that cfEngine, a systems configuration engine, was used to demonstrate the principles. This works on Unix - and again, detracted from the overall presentation of the \\"Principles\\" in the title I bought it for.So, bottom line, the book is worth a read. Spend some time working to understand and apply the principles in your environment. If you can implement some of the specifics of the author's techniques, that's all the better.11/10/02 update: \\"The Practice of System and Network Administration\\" is in.

For those of us who are aspiring writers or simply lovers of literature, this book offers wonderfully fun, odd and always interesting insights into the minds of such fine writers as Sherman Alexie, Brenda Hillman, David Rains Wallace and Ethan Canin, to name a few of the sixteen authors presented here. These glimpses into the writers' notebooks show how personal and idiosyncratic the creative process is: we see sketches, first drafts, outlines, newspaper clippings, interlineated text, etc. Mr. Junker, in his introduction, observes that the &quot;notebooks are notoriously raw, uncooked sometimes to the point of illegibility&quot; requiring footnote translations &quot;for the most egregious practitioners of bad penmanship [such as] Gerald Vizenor and Charles Johnson.&quot; Well, that's the charm of this joyous collection.

This edition is 431 pages, not 290. I would consider selling it.It describes the game 500 up, which no living player recognizes as far as I can determine. It appears to be similar to modern billiards, but played on a 6 pocket table. Nevertheless, the many illustrations are interesting and instructive.The text mostly concerns noblemen learning the finer techniques, and there is interesting emphasis on the individuals who must have been very important in social circles of the time. None are familiar to me. The language of course is quite formal by modern standards. I have treasured my copy for 40 years and love the mystique of the game as it was seen in those days.The technology of the time is discussed including various materials used for the balls and rubber cushions.

This should provide adequate warning as to the validity of this criticism of Machen. As well, merely because today's colleges and seminaries teach in a certain way is no indication of its superiority over Machen's, especially since today's education in general is also most demonstrably moving progressively more rapidly into a dark ages eclipse of illiteracy, though how thankful I am for the shining exceptions. Only a very few decades ago no one would have dreamed of considering one educated even to the bachelor's level without a proficiency in Latin and Greek and a foreign language or two, whereas today even Ph. D. professors can't communicate in, much less master English! How ironic that so many of them then turn 'round and criticize &quot;religion&quot; as a bastion for the ignorant! John Paul II's mastery of at least a dozen tongues rather, is typical of a true approach of wisdom in this arena. Inability to think in more than one language (or even in one language!) is really an inability to think at all about anything, at least not credibly, since ordinary children, even when little, are readily multilingual, mostly because of their blessed lack of adult pride and vanity so inhibiting to linguistic progress.Machen supposedly being a hero to Evangelicals (whatever that is and whoever they are!) is scarcely relevant for those of us rather more interested in stemming the manifest woeful ignorance in Christ's Church, and then reaching out to minister in wisdom, understanding and love to those around us as was the case for the Church in the previous dark ages.Of course such ignorance is as well related to the folly of the various styles of the antiscientific religion of Darwinism, so fantastically based on proven lack of evidence but as profoundly corrupting the thought processes throughout a culture so intimidated as to generally fail to challenge the ignorant and bigoted hegemony so entrenched in the halls of &quot;education&quot; and government. For multitudes of examples see works by Phillip E. Johnson &amp; Michael J. Behe.These comments in favor of Machen of course can in no way denigrate Mounce's manifestly invaluable scholarly work, however popularity is no valid measuring stick of a certain pedagogy's validity. Many tout the supposed superiority of the inductive approach to language (touted by most language tools today) versus the supposed exclusively deductive approach used by most language tools of yesteryear, including those of Machen and the great A. T. Robertson, but such thinking strangely fails to recognize the manifest inclusion of inductive method subsumed in the data under consideration by the deductive process. To turn the argument 'round, a form of the inductive method is as well popular in the notorious &quot;whole language&quot; absurdity in the &quot;teaching&quot; in today's government schools showing some of the limits of its usefulness. Indeed the incompetence resulting is well illustrated by the icons of illiteracy (pun intended) ubiquitously present on Windows and Macintosh computers!The important matter at hand for a true teacher is not to bow to the idol of making things easier for students, but rather greatly to encourage these greatly beloved children of God that they nobly and heroically may rise to the challenge of great strides of learning of which they are no doubt eminently capable, and for whom Machen can certainly provide more than adequate equipping."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I just received this book from the United Kingdom.

However, I also firmly believe that anyone who studies Machen in addition to Mounce, say, after completing Mounce, will greatly profit by it. ~ I have!I also believe that if someone is inclined to learn Greek solely by the traditional method, they would probably do best if they went with Machen.The exercises in the book are a real help, especially the English to Greek, which tends to force the student to think in Greek in a way the Mounce system does not.I don't think that I, nor anyone else, can find anything bad to say about the Machen grammar. It's the old school method, but as learner-friendly as the old school method can get, and as I mentioned, a great \\"second opinion\\" to one's studies in Mounce's introductory grammar.I myself purchased a used, out of print edition (really cheap!), on ebay, but other used outlets or private sellers are circulating them as well(Amazon Marketplace, for instance).

Gresham Machen's introduction to NT Greek is still used in Seminaries today. Here is his own comments about this book:&quot;My schedule as a teacher at Princeton was rather a heavy one, and I do not regret the fact. There were some advanced courses to keep me alive, and I also had the job of teaching elementary Greek. This latter was never mere drudgery to me, as it is to some men. I have notions about it different from those that often prevail, and after fifteen years' experience I embodied them in my little textbook, New Testament Greek for Beginners. A teacher of language, it seems to me, or the writer of an elementary textbook, should never yield to the temptation of displaying his philological learning--I myself was greatly helped in my resistance to this temptation by having so little philological learning to display--but should ruthlessly sacrifice everything else to the impartation of a reading knowledge of the language. Philological discussion is very interesting and very important, but it should come later. It is not learning, but often mere pedantry, to discuss the detailed history of a language that one cannot read. The more general observance of that principle might have delayed, even if it could not have prevented, the sad disfavor into which the classics have fallen in our day.&quot;"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I studied Greek for over five years, but when I think Greek, the image of Machen's little blue book always comes to mind.

The text is old-school, but thorough. If you can handle having paradigms tossed at you in an entirely businesslike manner, and you can get someone to explain the subtleties of participles, then this is text can be a fast introduction.A word of warning: Machen follows the classical tradition of teaching grammar by aphorism in the exercises at the end of each chapter. The exercises tend to reflect Machen's worldview: that of an embattled evangelical feeling marginalized in an increasingly modernistic denomination. Example: &quot;If you do not receive our testimony, you will not be saved.&quot;"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I have to voice agreement with those who praise this as the best introduction but I wonder how much of our love for the book is because it has sat on our desks for so many years and along with our Liddell and Scott is the first place we go to check something!"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"Today times are changing, and because of this I can only say that so is the way koina Greek is taught in seminaries and bible colleges. Machen represents a hero to evangelicalism of the past. However, I truly believe that his grammer is out of date. I think that the leading tool for teaching NT Greek is William Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. There are probably less than 10% of colleges and seminaries that even still use Machen.

Machen is a no-nonsense, no frills, dead serious introductory text, but a student who has completed it will be able to read NT Greek. Each of the 33 lessons concludes with 20 Greek to English sentences and 16 English to Greek sentences to be translated. At the end of the first year of Machen, I discovered that Zodhiates (AMG Publishers, Chattanooga, TN) has published keys to these exercises, together with cassettes covering all 33 lessons, and a workbook with its own key booklet for each lesson. Gresham taught NT Greek at Princeton Theological Seminary in the early 20's and was a fundamentalist preacher there of considerable renown. I recommend Machen's text without reservation for serious students of NT Greek."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I am a Lutheran pastor. Forty years ago I used Machen as the first year text by which I learned New Testament Greek. Over the years, I have used this text to teach a few interested persons New Testament Greek one-on-one. I tried another text once, but its arrangement of subjects seemed out of place. For me, the great feature of Machen is the numerous exercise sentences at the end of each chapter. Too many first year texts provide the students with too few exercise sentences by which they can practice what they have learned.It is not really a book for self-study. But, with the help of a teacher who has studied New Testament Greek, it is simply the best book available after its nearly 80 years in print. That alone speaks much in its behalf."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"The long ago departed J. Gresham Machen provided the academic world with the standard text for teaching Koine (common) Greek, often called New Testament Greek. This book is extremely well done, and after viewing two three separate Greek texts, this is the most detailed. He covers all the rules in Greek such as declensions, Present Actives, Participles, aorists, imperfects, Perfect tenses, subjunctives, etc. His vocabulary section in the back is great for the student as a quick reference or study tool for memorization. Further, as another reviewer noted, one can practice what they have learned in each chapter with Greek to English and English to Greek exercises. This is more difficult book than Mounce's text if one was trying to learn Greek alone. With a minor in Greek, I suggests one seek a teacher or someone with at least two years of Greek if using a book to learn Greek anyway."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"Machen's New Testament Greek for Beginners is concise and clear in what it teaches. It is no-nonsense and gets right to the point of each individual lesson. The chapters are fed to the student in small &quot;bite-size&quot; portions that are easily digested - not too much info in one sitting. The real benefit of this grammar, however, is in the exercises at the end of each chapter. The student is taught one or two new grammatical concepts per chapter, and then is asked to apply those concepts through numerous translations - first from Greek to English and then from English to Greek. It is the second set of exercises (English to Greek) that really cements the points of the lesson in one's mind - for one could scramble through translating from the Greek if they had to, but taking the English and writing the equivalent in Greek takes a clearer understanding of the concepts.Another benefit of the excercises in Machen is the fact that the sentences to be translated are not directly from the Bible. I started out my trek through Koine Greek with Mounce's grammar. He does not have the student translate from English to Greek because he states (and I'm paraphrasing) that &quot;we're not learning to write, we're learning to read&quot;. In addition, all of the exercises were passages from the Bible. If, as in my case, you have studied the Bible before moving on to Greek, many of the exercises to be translated will be familiar to you. It seemed that I could make it through the translation after the first few words because I had heard the English many times. This did not help because I was not forced to work through each word or phrase individually (because I knew what it said before I got to that point). Machen makes up his own sentences, having to do with the vocabulary words learned up to that point. There is no such thing as translating, &quot;For God so loved the world...&quot; and then not having to complete the exercise because you happen to know the rest of the verse. While Mounce provides much more explanation in his chapters, you can't beat Machen for practical exercises.It should be noted that the style of Machen is more &quot;academic&quot;, while Mounce is more &quot;contemporary&quot;."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I spent two semesters in college going through this book in a Classroom setting and found this work entirely helpful for the understanding of New Testament Greek. The method by which Machen divided up his Chapters allows the student to begin understanding (and writing) Greek sentences after only a few lessons whereas some grammars will go over every single Noun Ending and Rule before moving on to the Verbs and it could be fifteen lessons before the Student is able to understand even a basic sentence.There are a few problems with the text and those are mainly involving the way in which he describes some of the more difficult concepts. Without a knowledgeable person explaining Participles to the student, the novice would be hard-pressed to understand the complexity of the Participle in Greek and would flounder through Machen's descriptions of them. If the solitary student is trying to brush up on his Greek or has already learned one or more languages then he or she will have a much easier time grasping the more difficult concepts because they would be used to going through a grammar and learning ideas about a foreign language.The Lexicon in the Back (with the principle parts) is also a very helpful tool for the beginning student so the student does not have to flip through every single lesson trying to find the definition of a word given previously while working on a later lesson.Once the student has completely finished using Machen's book he or she will be able to, armed with only this grammar and a Lexicon, tackle a significant majority of the passages in the New Testament. While there are obviously some more difficult passages in the New Testament (Hebrews, etc) that will be a struggle for the beginning student this work will provide him or her with a very solid foundation to work from and will be an invaluable tool for the rest of the student's time spent in Greek."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I took four years of high school Greek and we used this book all the way through. I am now taking Greek in College and we are using Croy's book: A Primer of Biblical Greek. After using Croy's book for two semester's, I can say that I prefer Machen. He is very thorough and yet very clear in his presentation of beginning concepts. Machen's dictionary in the back is also invaluable for the beginning student. It is truly a great work."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I have used this book as a classbook, to teach Greek, since the late 1980's. Just as important, it has been a concise, reliable, and lucid reference, far exceeding any other grammatical reference books in my entire library. I continue to add new Greek references and study books, but this is the one I keep coming back to."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I am partial to Machen because I first learned Greek with his book, but the more I use this text to teach Greek to others, the more impressed I become. The genius is the organization and the exercises. No grammar does a better job of systematically leading one through Greek and the exercises are wonderful at reenforcing the vocabulary and paradigms. This book is great for reviewing or refreshing Greek and is perfect for teaching children, again because of the exercises.Machen's writing style is succinct if not eliptical, and this is the polar opposite to Mounce's user-friendly, wordy text, but its nice that it is small and you don't need a separate workbook. I would recommend that you buy both Machen and Mounce. The only reason I give it four stars is that no grammar is perfect and you really need to work through several. Machen is also to be honored for defending the faith against liberalism and he belongs in every Greco-phile's library."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"I have to say I found this more challenging than the text we used in my seminary classes (Hewett), but it is worth it if you have the motivation. Work through the whole grammar and you can sight-read koine Greek. Its tough and its grammar, but you can see hints of why Machen's Greek courses at Princeton in the 20s were so popular with the students. He is passionate about the language, its importance and its beauty."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners","review":"There are some modest problems with Machen's grammar, but age is not one of them. I learned with this grammar and I still use it to teach introductory Koine. It is not an accident that so many Greek teachers learned with this grammar -- it covers all the material needed to read the NT competently. I personally would like to see MI verbs covered earlier in the lessons but this is a small matter that can be corrected by the instructor if they are so inclined. The grammar is well thought out as well. Lessons that are heavy and require a lot of work are followed by lighter lessons so the student is not overwhelmed. The exercises, though not directly from the NT, cover the grammatical points of the lesson and help the student understand the rules of grammar.My greatest trouble with Machen's grammar is that it assumes the student is well versed in English grammar. Sadly, most university students do not know what a subjunctive mood is or a superlative adjective etc. I am constantly needing to explain Machen's definitions to my students because they do not have the basic instruction in English to comprehend the Greek. This is not so much a fault of Machen's grammar as a telltale sign that classical learning is not valued in public education. My second problem is his constant use of archaic pronouns. Again, this is not so much about Machen being an 'archaic' book but that when the grammar was written, the KJV was pretty much the only version used in the churches. Ye, thee, thou, etc. would have seemed a very reasonable and dignified way of translating pronouns. Now it just sounds silly (for most of us anyway). Again, this can be corrected by the instructor.All round, Machen is a good grammar that covers the material. It does not offer a magic pill solution to learning a foreign language. If you use Machen you will need to work; however, the pay off is knowing Greek well."},{"Title":"Do Men Mother?: Fathering, Care, and Domestic Responsibility","review":"I read this book as part of an academic project, but I enjoyed it on a personal level.

Written in 1955, this Pulitzer Prize winning work traces the development of Populism and the beginnings of Progressivism from the 1890's to the rise of WWI. However, this book is in my opinion \\"primarily a study of political thinking and of political moods\\" and, therefore, suffers from a major weaknesses. Put simply Hofstadter's book is largely devoid of primary regional sources, and his work pays lip service to the crucial values and strategies of key Populist leaders. I recommend Lawrence Goodwyn's account over Hofstadter for this reason...otherwise, a well written and intellectual achievement...worth a look."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"This is a really seminal work. Hofstadter's writing is the first thing that struck me. It is fluid, crisp, and devoid of the florid verbosity that so often fills scholarly treatments (let's face it, good historians are rarely good writers).The parallels between the bust-and-boom of Western commercial real estate in 1880s and the modern economic crisis are eerily similar. In addition, a lot of the rhetoric that emerged from the Progressive movement (railing against the securitization of finance, corporate greed, etc.) is resurfacing now, over 100 years later.It's really an essential work for anyone interested in the Populist and Progressive movements. I look forward to reading more Hofstadter."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"This is an old book, out of print, and not in my local library. I received it quickly and it was in the condition advertised. Thanks."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"It's not every book that can change one's thinking about a political movement and a period in history, but Hofstadter's book did just that for me when I first read it many years ago. It's an incisive critique of the populist and progressive movements that sprang up in the last quarter of the 19th century and exerted strong influence on American politics until the onset of World War I. But Hofstadter's great achievement is that he sets both these movements in historical perspective, showing us that no movement flowers without roots.Hofstadter is at his best in revealing that the populist movement played -- and preyed -- on the longing of Americans for a pastoral, agrarian past that was ironically little more than myth by the end of Reconstruction. In an increasingly industrial, urban America, the populists were able to set themselves up as downtrodden victims of various villians, chief among them the railroads and the banks.Yet Hofstadter convincingly argues that the farmers of the West were eager to become businessmen in the boom years following the Civil War, when land and capital were cheap. It was not until they were battered by the economic slumps that are an inevitable part of a market economy that the agrarian movement began demanding government intervention to reign in capital and portraying agriculture as especially worthy of special attention.The populist's appeal to the little man, dwarfed by powers beyond his control, played well in some segments of the U.S., but Hofstadter portrays a darker side of populism, exposing its anti-foreign and anti-Semitic leanings. Reading about the populist's railings against foreigners and their dark hints of conspiracy by vast economic and political powers, I heard echoes of the speeches of Pat Buchanan.As for the progressives, the urban reformers who overlapped to some extent with the populists, Hofstadter cogently points out that this middle class movement was in large part a reaction to the growing influence of immigrants in large American cities. The middle class, he argues, was feeling squeezed between the waves of immigrants, who were increasingly catered to by machine politicians, and the new and enormously rich industrial class. The progressive movement was an attempt to wrest back some measure of political strength by undercutting the power of the bosses with &quot;good government&quot; and to reign in the economic clout of the industrialists through reform.This is required reading for the student of American history. We have produced few historians who match the stature and achievement of Hofstadter, and this book is one of his best."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Hofstadter ranks with Bancroft, Beard, and Tuckman as one of the great scholars of American history. AGE OF REFORM definitely shows why; his scholarly, permeating style impresses his words into your mind, changing both your scope and sense of American history. In this book, he tracks various reformist groups that shaped America, starting with the Populists of the late 19th century and ending with the New Deal reforms of FDR.Hofstadter's thoughts on the early 20th century Progressives and New Dealers conform with the writings of most other historians. It is Hofstadter's section on the Populists that has always generated the most controversy, both in the past and still today. In the first third of the book, Hofstadter writes of the American \\"agrarian myth\\" and how the Populist farmers sought the \\"lost agrarian ideals\\" of Jefferson and Jackson. He emphasizes how the Populists were basically reactionary whiners who impetuously thought themselves deserving of some special privelage, simply because they were farmers, the supposed \\"All-American\\" profession. Hofstadter goes further by describing the Populists as jingoistic proto-facists. By use of effective documentation, he shows this \\"dark side\\" of Populism, with its demagogic rants against politicians, urbanites, Britons, Jews, and immigrants.Although Hofstadter indeed is very effective in his writing and documentation, he fails in the aspect of fair historical analysis. When one reads AGE OF REFORM, one should always remember the Populists from a broader perspective than Hofstadter's biased urban views. In truth, the Populists are one of American history's unfortunate losers; like the Loyalists and Native Americans, the Populists failed in almost all their immediate objectives; their leaders, like William Jennings Bryan and Tom Watson, are best remembered as lost crusaders. They lost because they were simply ahead of their time; they were New Dealers in a time when the New Deal was ignored and not accepted. The Populists lost in their present because their reforms were meant for the future; thus, at least the future should appreciate and judge the past correctly. Although Hofstadter writes an enthralling historical work, his unjust view of the Populists should not be taken by modern readers as absolute truth."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Richard Hosstadter was one of our most profound social commentators and it will be a long while before his equal comes along. In this book he highlights the rather surprising fact that Conservatives were the first to back the Progressive idea that replaced Populism. The Progressive mentality, with roots in the Protestant ethic felt the individual was responsible for improvement of &quot;everything.&quot; It was an idea congenial to Teddy Roosevelt, who took it and ran with it, and it reached its culmination in Woodrow Wilson. As Hofstadter shows, Wilson led us into WWI with the idea that it was our responsibility to save civilization, rather than our self interested need to survive intact ourselves in a congenial economic milieu which would not have been likely if the Central Powers had won the war. The devastation and human wreckage wrought by the war brought home to Americans what they mistakenly considered the price of idealism (rather than the price of survival) and turned them toward a reaction that killed Progressivism. One result was the Flapper Era, reaction characteristic of general Eurphoria, undoubtedly sustained by prosperity. Hofstadter makes a remarkable case that explains how we got Prohibition and that, remarkably, it was tolerated by that era, He traces its development to a strange conjunction between a Progressive holdover, reaction against city loose morals and nativism. (Perhaps true, at least he makes a good case for the develpment of what is otherwise an inexplicable contradiction.) When the bubble busted in 1929 with the market crash followed by world depression, the stage had been set for acceptance of state reponsibility for human welfare, with roots going back rather surprisingly to Conservatives who first made a congenial environment for Progressive ideas on the notion that they were preserving individualism. This, of course, is ironic, since it was the Conservatives who had a hissie over the New Deal and FDR. Hofstadter also points out that major swings of national policy depend upon moods of the people at the time. Cycles exist. Unfortunately, he doesn't provide a formula for creating, sustaining of killing moods, probably because no one can. In any case he gives us hope that the mood we hate will pass away; for example PC which currently seems to threaten our basic notion of freedom will fly out the window someday, perhaps having served a good purpose for all of its arrogant intolerance of free discussion and conduct, especially in our colleges and universities. A derned good book to read in installments as I do, in a hot tub in the morning while I try to get my weary bones articulating. To balance Hofstadter try Albro Martin to whom Hofstadter's idea of acceptance of such things as government regulation of railroads (starting with the Hepburn Act) was anathema and actually came close to destroying them. They agree that TR's trustbusting was cosmetic, with Hofstadter seeing some good in it (the Northern Securites Case being the classic example to show that government was at least watching) and Martin pointing out that the severance of the Burlington, Northern Pacific and Great Northern from a trust status was replaced by what amounted to the same thing. It was so secretly done that even the employees of the combination didn't recognize the interlocking board control until 1972. As we know it is now fully accepted as the Bulington Northern Santa Fe. And what has this to do with The Age of Reform? Read the book and draw your own conclusions. Hofstadter admits that in the final analysis the Big Men that reform reacted against were running the show behind the scenes most of the time anyhow when the chips were down. Of course this is not a book for those who are into Harlequin Romances or even baseball unless you're George Will. Glenn G. Boyer"},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Historians still consider the late Richard Hofstadter one of the great American historians of the 20th century. His voluminous output when he worked as a professor at Columbia continues to draw readers and researchers both inside and outside of academia. \\"The Age of Reform\\" is Hofstadter's analysis of Populism and Progressivism in American history, which the author defines as a period running roughly from 1890 to 1940. This historical treatment won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1956, although it is difficult at times to see why. If we accept the idea that historians should always strive to lift themselves above their own biases and personal backgrounds, we must conclude that Richard Hofstadter was little more than a prejudiced city dweller who sought to tar American rural movements with an overarching label of anti-Semitism. Fortunately, new work concerning the Populists is available, work that patently refutes many of this author's scurrilous claims.The author claims that Populism sought to reaffirm the American agrarian lifestyle in an age of increasing industrialization and urbanization. He attacks what he refers to as the \\"agrarian myth,\\" or the idea that the backbone of American society was the benevolent, hard working farmer; an idea once advocated by none other than Thomas Jefferson. Hofstadter scoffs at the Jeffersonian idea of democratic virtues imbued by working with the soil, going so far as to conclude that Populism, which was a political movement by farmers and their associates to challenge what they saw as hegemonic behavior directed against rural areas by the cities and governmental organs, was deeply and irrevocably devoted to anti-Semitism in its most virulent strains. \\"The Age of Reform\\" cites Populist leaders Mary Lease and Ignatius Donnelly as two of the more strident proponents of rural anti-Jewish discontent.While it is obvious that there was an element of anti-Semitism swirling through parts of the Populist movement, this animosity in no way formed the foundation of rural discontent. Farmers' concerns encompassed a host of disturbing issues, including railroads, the banking industry, corruption in politics, and moral values. Hofstadter commits a grave error in claiming that racial motives constituted the sublime principle for the millions of farmers who harbored a beef with the political system. Author Peter Novick, in his superb treatment of American historians, unearthed a letter proving that Hofstadter admitted to greatly exaggerating his claims about anti-Semitism among America's rural population. If one takes this claim to its logical, and disturbing, conclusion, the author of \\"The Age of Reform\\" essentially misrepresented his evidence in order to support a theory. That this is an egregious crime worthy of professional exile has had little effect on the endless accolades accorded Richard Hofstadter over the years. If lesser mortals were to commit such an indiscretion, they would find themselves drummed out of the discipline with great haste.The second part of this book concerns Progressivism. According to Hofstadter, the concern of the progressives didn't involve a disbelief in the system of American society and government, but rather their position in a world increasingly fraught with the tectonic changes of industrialism. Specifically, Progressive initiatives involved status, as diverse sections of the populace attempted to find a new role in a changing country. As an example, the author refers to the clergy as one of these classes threatened with change. In an increasingly secularized culture, and one in which social scientists and the industrialists rose to undreamt of heights in social influence, those who worked for the churches lost considerable clout. Those men of the cloth wise to the changes in America embraced the reform minded social gospel in order to regain influence over the masses. In short, the changes in American society during the turn of the century led to a restructuring among all classes, not merely the working class or farmers. When a response to industrialism became necessary, everybody responded to it in some manner in an attempt to preserve their social station.In a way, I understand Hofstadter's concern about the dangers of mass political movements. Look at the author's ethnic background; he was a Jewish-American who worked closely with other Jewish-American scholars in post-WWII America. What Jew wouldn't look for the seeds of an anti-Semitic basis in any political movements with Hitler's final solution still looming large in the popular mind? Populism in its expressions never resembled the scenes in \\"Triumph of the Will,\\" but even a slender reed of anti-Jewish thought amongst the few was enough to set off alarm bells in the minds of Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, and others. \\"The Age of Reform\\" contributes an explanation of one facet of American Populism, but fails to convince me that anti-Jewish sentiment was the driving force of the movement. Hofstadter and company saw brown shirts instead of bib overalls, Nordic warriors instead of the Joads.All is not lost with Richard Hofstadter, as there is plenty here and in his other works that sparkle with his easy prose style and all-encompassing eye for detail. One of the things I love about this author is how he discusses these obscure writings from various historical figures. In \\"The Age of Reform,\\" Hofstadter discusses in some depth Ignatius Donnelly's apocalyptic novel \\"Caesar's Column,\\" a discussion that made me instantly want to procure a copy. His observations on such literary obscurities are always a lot of fun, inspiring the reader to investigate these topics further. In short, when one reads Hofstadter, don't always take his word as gospel just because historians continue to adore him. \\"The Age of Reform\\" is an important work on Populism and Progressivism, but it certainly isn't the final analysis on these fascinating subjects."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Richard Hostadter is a wonderful historian who paints with broad yet nimble strokes. He knows the details but does not suffocate the reader with them. His forte is grasping the fundamental beliefs and conditions that guide American political and social movements. Here he shows how &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; impulses interwined in the reform movements of the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries. I was especially intrigued with his argument about the myth of the idealized past, and how that myth becomes increasingly stronger even as it moves further away from the reality (take, for example, the image of 1950s small-town America in today's culture). If you believe, as I do, that the era in which we live has strong similarities to the American situation at the last turn of the century, then you will no doubt find this book valuable."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"At one time I used to believe that the Progressive Era in America, roughly from 1900- 1920, was the real source of post World War II ideas of social progress such as Truman's Fair Deal, Kennedy's New Frontier and Johnson's Great Society. Previously I had placed those ideas on the doorstep of Franklin Roosevelt. Ah, but those were the silly days of my youth when I believed that the Democratic Party could be pushed to the left and made the equivalent of a European social-democratic organization responsible to its working class base. I now believe that the progressive period is decisive but for a different reason, that is, its role in sucking up the leftist political landscape and preventing a hard core working class-centered socialist party from crystallizing in this country.For those, like myself, who look hard for antecedents, this is important to an understanding of why today, in face of incredible provocations by the two major political parties we have no independent class party of the working people. Thus, a look at the period becomes essential for understanding the malaise that we find ourselves today. A good place to start, and I would emphasize the word start since the book originally took form in the 1950's, is Professor Hofstadter's book on the period. While one does not have to be sympathetic to his generally pro-Progressive tilt this little book, complete with important footnoted source references, gives a very good outline of the personalities, issues and sociological trends that broke the back of fight for an independent mass socialist party in the period.Ironically in Europe, in the period under discussion, large, well-organized class-conscious labor parties some of them, like the Bolsheviks in Russia even revolutionary were rearing there heads. Although a relatively small, loosely organized, and programmatically amorphous Socialist Party did emerge in the United States at this time it was definitely (and occasionally, by choice) subordinated to the Progressive movement. Unless one is eternally committed to the political strategy of the \`popular front', that is multi-class organizations based on the lowest common denominator policies in order to achieve social change this was a very badly missed opportunity by socialists.Hofstadter makes the interesting, and basically true, point that the whirlwind Populist movement that sprang out of the farms of the American prairie in the early 1890's and embraced Free Silver and Bryan in 1896 was fundamentally hostile to the urban classes and particularly to the working class. I have argued elsewhere that the working class had no interest in the inflationary silver coinage issue. Moreover the populist movement, except in the South where it had the potential of driving a wedge into the race question, was the last gasp effort of the small capitalist family farmer in the face of the victory of mass industrialization and the rise of finance capital. I would however, argue that as late as 1896 it was still possible that the bedeviled populist movement could have been an auxiliary to an urban-based workers party. With the rise of the middle class Progressive movement such a possibility was derailed.The rise of the Progressive movement is the strongest part of this book. Hofstadter having staked out his own personal political philosophy under the aegis of that movement has many interesting things to say about it. The fundamental driving force behind this movement was the fact of ruthless industrialization and the reaction to it by those who either had previously benefited from society, the classic \\"Mugwumps\\", or were being driven under by \` the captains of industry'. Particularly well done are the analysis of the rise of the professoriat, the increase in the number of cities and their size and with it the creation of new political organizations, the change in the status of the clergy and the free professions, immigration (that round of it any way) and the changing mores which broke down the prevailing ideology.While one may, as the writer does, disagree with the depth of the positive effects that the various pieces of legislation that the Progressives were able to get passed one can nevertheless see that a different class axis would have been necessaryin order to make fundamental changes. Thus, although Hofstatder will not be you last place to look in understanding the evolution, such as it is, of American society for this crucial period in working class history it certainly should be your first."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Richard Hofstadter (1916-1970) was a prolific writer and commentator on the Gilded Age and Progressive Eras, a founding member of the \\"Consensus School\\" of American history, and a scathing critic of the conservatism of his day. Often portrayed, in his day and since, as the \\"finest and also most humane historical intelligence of our generation\\", Hofstadter was one of the most distinguished historians of the twentieth century . Over the course of his too brief life, Hofstadter the DeWitt Clinton Professor of American History at Columbia University, was the author of several groundbreaking books including, \`The Age of Reform (1955) and Anti-intellectualism in American Life (1963), both of which won the Pulitzer Prize in non-fiction . A vigorous champion of the liberal politics that emerged from the New Deal, Hofstadter fought public campaigns against liberalism's most dynamic opponents from McCarthy in the 1950s to Barry Goldwater and the Sun Belt Conservatives in the 1960s. His distaste of the extreme politics of post war America, expressed in his books, essays and public lectures, marked him as one of the nation's most important and prolific public intellectuals. The range of his interests was unusual, extending from the earliest phases of the American Experience through to the concerns of his day. A \`specialist' he was not, a master of the subjects he covered he was; which was widely acknowledged and respected. Hofstadter's principle theme of the importance of ideas in history, more precisely the relation between the way people behaved, in politics and other realms of effort, and the use they made of their mind, along with the idea that history is akin to literature, had an immense impact on his students, colleagues and the entire academic world. Extremely active, Hofstadter was continuously embarking on new thought provoking work right up to his death, caused by leukaemia on October 24, 1970, which caught him, as he himself had written of one of his favourite politicians many years before very much \\"in the midst of things\\" .Hofstadter's \\"The Age of Reform: From Bryan to FDR\\" played a significant role in establishing his influence and reputation. The book received critical acclaim when published in 1955 and won the Pulitzer Prize the following year. \\"The Age of Reform\\" many are inclined to agree, even its detractors of which are many \\"is the most influential book ever published on the history of twentieth century America\\" . This landmark book in American political thought is a study of American political culture from the Populist Movement of the 1890s through the Progressive Era ending with the New Deal of the 1930s. \\"The Age of Reform\\" is an evaluation of the reform associations from Bryan to F.D.R., and analyses the ideas of each participant, rather than the legislative or political philosophies, and does not regurgitate the number of details of each reform movement. Hofstadter's analysis of the reformations in a modern perspective and the definitions between each of them, created a unique and vastly influential contribution, which has been seen as not only his most original and influential book but one that solidified Hofstadter as one of the great historians of his time .[Part of the above review is taken from; \\"An Enduring Influence: Richard Hofstadter and The Age of Reform\\" by Alexander Rayden.2005 Alexander Rayden, All Rights Reserved]"},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"Hofstadter was the pre-eminent historian of the middle of hte century and this is his most enduring and still widely read book. It discusses the ideological strands and impulses that went into the Populist Progressive and later new deal movements. This is the history of ideas not events. Although his view of the progressive era has held up well, demeans the POpulsits as backwards utopians who dreamed for a Jeffersonian existence that never really was and was certainly unrealistic by the 1890s. He also sees them as xenophobic and anti-semetic. Much new historical work on the Populsits has been done since the 1950's which paints them in a better light. Most noteably Lawrence Goodwyn's &quot;The Populist Moment&quot; sees the movement as a kind of conciousness raising exercise whic empowered its members.The book is quite relevant today because many pundits compare the politics and idelolgy of today led by left of center technocrats (Bill Clinton) who wish to control big business to a similar impulse of the turn of the century by Progressives. (teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson).A good companion to this Book is Eric Foner's &quot;The Story of American Freedom&quot; which also traces the history of American ideologcal changes over the years. Foner also studied under Hofstdter at Columbia."},{"Title":"The age of reform from Bryan to F.D.R","review":"This book deserves its status as a classic: written more than 55 years ago, it remains highly relevant to today, not just in his critique of the left-leaning from 1890s to the end of the New Deal, but in his analysis of the dynamics of popular movements regardless of their beliefs. Though the book is written is a somewhat staid academic style, the content is utterly fascinating, original, and hard-edged. It is a dazzling synthesis that examines the vanishing yeoman farmer, womens' rights, industrialization and urbanization, and the adaptation of the political parties to the volcanic upheavals that these forces unleashed.Hofstadter begins with a definition of populism: it originated with a romanticised notion of the independent semi-autarkic farm, which was disappearing as businessmen in the distant growing cities commoditized their produce, pushing wages down to the point that they could barely make a living. The farmers were isolated, bound to small communities, and almost all protestant fundamentalists living by unforgiving moral codes. As Hofstadter demonstrates, their ideas were unrealistic, even utopian, to the point that the scorn of city dwellers doomed their movement to the sidelines. He also points out the contradictions between their beliefs and actions: not only were most farmers becoming businessmen themselves, but their christianity reinforced (rather than mitigated) their racism, xenophobia, and narrowness of mind. It is a devastating critique, in particular because they later became the seedbed of the Ku Klux Klan (which Hofstadter examines at length). With a large part of their purpose seeking to hold back modernism, these men were a far cry from the spontaneous democratic uprising that some liberals like to portray in popular books. Hofstadter argues that Bryant embodies many of these aspects - the good and the bad.Nonetheless, many of the populist ideals were adopted by the progressives, who were essentially urban-based, better educated, and operated in a booming economy. The business men farmers began to make a very good living as the economy - to feed the massive cities that were welcoming impoverished, though ambitious foreigners - and they made common cause with the muckrakers and others. Though the two parties resisted them - big business of the GOP, the old-elitist \\"mugwumps\\" of the dems - the movement became so strong that both adopted many of their positions into their platforms. The nouveau riche (with smaller businesses) also allied themselves with the progressives, fighting entrenched interests of landowners and financial fat cats. The exemplars of this period are Teddy Rooseveldt and Woodrow Wilson, who in fact enacted very little beyond legislative gestures that were unenforceable, if rhetorically flamboyant. Underneath the rhetoric, urban political machines flourished, big business was allowed to brutally \\"discipline\\" industrial laborers in accordance with the efficiency mantras of taylorism, and the opening of the electoral process to popular-vote primaries strengthened existing elites rather than forced them out.In a wonderful analysis of the birth of the Jazz Age conservatism, Hofstadter argues that the tieing of progressive rhetoric to WWI by Wilson led to the undoing of the progressive movement: once the public mood turned against the war, voters associated it with the progressive rhetoric. At that point, the rural population won disproportionate political power (largely through the election of 2 senators per state regardless of population size) and split from the urban progressives. This is the root and institutionalization, he asserts, of the stalled political process of our legislature.It was only with the Great Depression that a new progressive coalition was formed under FDR. Though this chapter is too short, Hofstadter proved, at least to me, that the New Deal was the culmination of many of the original progressive ideals, enacting more effective legislation that regulated business, introduced a far stronger role for government in both economy and society, and led a war effort that became a patriotic success, opening the way to the development of modern liberalism. Of course, conservatives see this (or Wilson) as the beginning of the end of \\"freedom\\" in the US.In spite of the density of ideas in the book, it is a tough read. The book assumes a high level of knowledge, about at the graduate level, and does little to enlighten the reader about the substance of some pretty obscure controversies. For example, there is a long section on the \\"silver question\\" - I had absolutely no idea what this meant and that occurred repeatedly on a variety of topics and minor movements. His writing style can also be a bit pedantic, with all sorts of hemming and hawing that should have been edited out.But it astonished me how relevant to today these ideas were, in particular on the behavior of politicians, who de-fanged popular movements by adapting their ideas to the way they preferred to wield power - and they stayed in power for the most part.

The discussions of fundamental and technical analysis are so superficial as to be practically worthless. The author's assertion that it's easy to tell when a stock has bottomed or topped is ludicrous--if it were that easy I'd be on my yacht right now instead of writing this.

But in the final chapter, he admits a case where one investor should be buying and another, with a different style, should be selling the same stock at the same price at the same time. They can trade with each other and both be winners. Once again the real world refuses to be reduced to a simple &quot;explanation&quot;.There is good information here on the data-gathering capabilities of the Internet, and good advice on specifics. For this it's worth the money. But use his evaluation techniques as a starting point; don't adopt them blindly. And for philosophy, read something else."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Investing: Winning Strategies for Beating the Wall Street Professionals","review":"This is a great book for individuals who think they are ready to break away from reliance on the big brokerage houses.

I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to my friends."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Investing: Winning Strategies for Beating the Wall Street Professionals","review":"Siris does not tell us a lot of new things. But he actually opens your eyes to every-day-life truths that you normally do not think about too often. You seem to know all the tricks and transactions he writes about, but he makes you think about all of them more consciously or prevent you from forgetting some of the basics altogether when trading. As a European reader I can say that not everything in this book is really useful to me - as conditions in my part of the world are somewhat different. But as I intend to do some trading in the US very soon I must say this book was very helpful. In addition to all the useful things I read about I enjoyed the &quot;human&quot; tone of Siris' writing, which brings a lot of color into a usually very &quot;dry&quot; subject."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Investing: Winning Strategies for Beating the Wall Street Professionals","review":"If I came tonight to amazon, it was to look for more books from P.

There is so much information regarding whats in the food we are eating that is harming our bodies, it could be overwhelming to some. I took it a bit at a time, and using common sense, began changing my eating habits from this book, it is the first of three books I have read by Dr. Colbert, that others are Toxic Killer, and Living in Divine Health. All three books must be read. Easy to understand, especially since a Dr. wrote them. He have changed my life, my husbands, childrens, mom and others that I get to share with. Instead of letting food control me, I am in control of what I eat. Because after reading these books, you will feel differently about those fries and anything with bad fat in it, plus a whole lot more information."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"I read this book a few years ago, but thought I'd compose a review now. At first glance, I thought this was just another \\"natural remedies\\" book, like so many, but this is a real doctor, who actually prefers alternative AND conventional medicine. This book has taught me alot, and because of the advice Don Colbert gives, I removed my amalgam fillings and have never looked back! A few decades ago alternative medicine was a taboo, now its commonplace. Even though there's numerous biblical messages contained inside, the crux of this book is you have to take care of your body yourself, and not to depend on an invisible being to do it for you. (I know that wasn't the author's intent, but that's what I got out of it.)"},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"I believe Dr. Don Colbert is THE BEST doctor ever!

I would like a refund!"},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"Dr. Colbert, the author of &quot;What You Don't Know May Be Killing You&quot;, has a heart for people to get in control of their health. This book is written from a Biblical point of view combined with evidence from medical research. This book covers a multitude of topics including but not limited to the importance of drinking water and exercising; high levels of metals such as mercury in our systems; detoxification; the effects of emotions such as anger, pride, and anxiety on our body; the importance of consuming living foods and foods that need to be eliminated from our diets; the diet deception; toxins in our homes; and so much more. This book can be a guide to living a healthy lifestyle. It is easy to read and understand. Every person who reads this book will find atleast one way to have a healthier lifestyle. Self-discipline is very important in applying the personal health choices encouraged by the author. However, to do everything that Dr. Colbert suggests will be difficult for the average person."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"The first chapter \\"The Menace of Mercury\\" really grabbed my attention because Dr. Colbert was mercury poisoned from leaking mercury dental fillings. He tells about developing chronic fatigue and becoming jaundiced from the poisoning. He tells how to detox with natural supplements, and how to find a safe biological dentist to safely remove the filling. (But his telephone number for a dentist referral didn't work. Call 1-800-311-6265 for a number that will refer you to a dentist.) He gave a number for finding a MD who knows how to treat mercury toxicity (1-800-LEADOUT). He also told the symptoms of mercury poisoning and how mercury would mess up different systems in your body because \\"mercury is more toxic than lead, cadium and arsenic!\\" He said that it messes up the digestive bacteria in the gut, can contribute to antibiotic resistance, and interfere with nerve impulses in the body leading to neurological diseases. He connects mercury to infertility, birth defects, miscarriages, loss of concentration and memory. He gives many more effects and symptoms, but you will have to buy the book. It is worth buying so you can pass it on to someone else and help them.Dr. Colbert said that mercury can cause autoimmune diseases in the body such a \\"rhematoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroditis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other autoimmune diseases.\\" Since Dr. Colbert is a holistic physician he understands the dangers of toxicity whereas traditional physicians don't even recognize the symptoms. His advice along with other authors like Dr. Hal Huggins has helped me through my time of chelating (ridding) my body of mercury.He told how the American Dental Association refuses to admit that mercury in the teeth hurts people because they are afraid of lawsuits. The ADA says that mercury in amalgam is tightly bound in the filling, but if that is true, how did a medical doctor like Dr. Colbert become mercury poisoned? Dr. Colbert says mercury isn't bound, because he was poisoned when mercury leaked from his teeth.Dr. Colbert is an example of just one way mercury from teeth can poison you. Only one chapter pertained to mercury poisoning. He also told other ways we are damaging our health in other chapters. If persons would take his advice on getting the mercury safely out of their teeth, detoxifying their bodies and using non toxic cleaning supplies they could be on the road to recovery from diseases like chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia.I applaude Dr. Colbert for speaking out on this mercury issue because I was mercury poisoned myself from breathing mercury vapor while a dentist drilled into a \\"silver\\" filling. (Go to www.mercurypoisoned.com for my story.) Dr. Colbert will help wake up the Christian community to the fact that \\"silver\\" fillings are very dangerous because they are actually 50% mercury. Christians, are you paying attention??? God sent this man to warn you. Are you listening or yawning and saying, \\"Oh, it won't happen to me.\\" It happened to Dr. Colbert and it happened to me, and it can happen to you. It is very true that WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW MAY BE KILLING YOU."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"I've seen Dr. Colbert speak on &quot;This Is Your Day&quot; with Benny Hinn. His book is just as great as his talks. He is a medical doctor who uses a holistic approach to health mainly in a proactive and preventitive way. This book is easy and fast reading. It is jam packed with useful information on what everyday things we can avoid for better health. It includes information on detoxifying the body and gives people a &quot;heads up&quot; on harmful things that we come into contact with everyday that we don't think even twice about. It is a great book and I highly recommend it for people to see what things they are really exposing themselves to every day and what you can do live a healthier life."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"This book is an eye opener. I can't believe how lethal the Amercian diet has become--we are overfeed and undernourished-and how uneducated people are about nutrition. I recommend that everyone pick up a copy of this book and follow Dr. Colbert's suggestions. Eating healthy is easier than most people think.I especially enjoyed the sections on mercury poisoning and the Atkins diet.I easily give this book 5 stars!"},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"\\"What You Don't Know,\\" is a great book that gives well researched information of the various things that a person needs to do to improve their health. It is generally easy to read without all the medical babble and scientific terms that can all to often make health books seem like a text book.After reading the book you will most certainly be reconsidering the foods, vitamins, etc. you are consuming (or not consuming but should be). My only comment here is that in many ways one is forced to say, \\"What Dr. Don Colbert says makes sense and the research seems to back it, but how in the world do I really do all this?\\"In the back of the book, the author does offer the ability to buy, from him, the proper supplements one needs to maintain good health (for about $80 a month as I recall). Perhaps, the book was written to sell Dr. Don's vitamins? Could one go to all this trouble just to sell vitamins? Hmm, one is forced to wonder.Overall, vitamins or no vitamins, the book is a worthy read. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"This fantastic book--no cliche--changed my life, especially the way I eat and how I see food, among other things.Also I stopped using antipersperants like Sure which I had previously used for many years and later had my underarm itching (a WARNING signal).

I really enjoyed it, it gave so much powerful information. I have changed the way I eat and the things I put into my house. I have learned to make household cleaners naturally homemade.

Thanks DR.!!!"},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"I was excited to read this book and find out there are answers that don't involve medications. He actually gives you the answers in the book. The explainations for our poor health is so true. He also supplies us with ways to correct the symptons and totally heal the problems. This book was a definite eye opener for me and I recommend this book to everyone. Even if you don't have problems this book is good because it shows you how to prevent them in the first place."},{"Title":"What You Don't Know May Be Killing You!","review":"Colbert presents a good deal of useful information in one book. Some of his warnings are controversial. He believes that Alzheimer's disease is linked to aluminum in our diets. This is possible, but has never been proved. He discusses mercury in the amalgam of tooth fillings, and contends that pork is very high in toxins. He says that shellfish should be avoided because they are high in cadmium. Is this always true or only sometimes true?Colbert discusses the importance of sufficient water consumption, and then extols the value of anti-oxidants, \\"live\\" vegetables (or, failing that, enzyme supplements), and fiber in the diet, etc. He warns of the dangers of excessive sugar, trans-fats, aspartame, and of many common household products. He believes that excessive body odor is related to toxins accumulating in the body as a result of infrequent bowel movements.His advice is not limited to diet and the immediate environment. He points out the unhealthful consequences of anger and bitterness, along with the opposite effects of mirth. He relates health issues to Bible teachings."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Just when you think that you have read it all with the character of Becky Bloomwood Branden she surprizes you again.In this fifth installment of the Shopaholic Series main charactor Becky Bloomwood Brandon finds herself pregnant.

I love the author, the series, Becky and her crazy stories. Super funny and entertaining. These books have been an amazing party of my life since the first time I read them."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I readConfessions of a Shopaholic(the first in the series) in January ago based upon the strong recommendation of a friend. She tends to like very dark subjects in her reading material so when she said this series was hilarious and I HAD to read it, I decided it must be good. She was absolutely right. I have now read the first five (out of six) books in this series within the span of a few weeks. Typically, I am not one to go through a series very quickly since I rotate genres and will often go three or four months before going to the next installment in a series. That hasn't happened here at all --- I just finished this fifth installment and have already downloaded the last one to my Kindle. There is just something about this series that tickles me and draws me in.Shopaholic & Babyrevolves around Becky Bloomwood Brandon's pregnancy. Just as she feels a need to be the height of fashion, so must Baby Brandon which means lots of shopping for the latest clothes, nursery accoutrements, and even name. In her quest to be at the forefront of everything fashionable, Becky decides that the family ob/gyn really is quite unexciting and she must get into the most talked-about doctor who caters to stars and celebrities. Only later does Becky find out that her new ob is an old college flame of Luke's and may not be totally over him yet.These books fall into the category of funny, entertaining, fluffy reads that have me chuckling with disbelief. As narcissistic as the main character is, I think I would find her irritating but don't. She is funny and crazy and I love seeing how she gets herself into and out of all these ridiculous situations and you know that by the end of the book, she will have turned her situation around and will come out smelling like a rose.Good, lighthearted read. One more to go in the series and I will hate to see it end."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Keeps the story line of the series going. An easy and entertaining read.

It was great! I was laughing out loud over and over and tried to share the humor with my husband (who didn't get it!). Of course, Becky goes crazy with her shopping and buys way more than a baby could ever use, but the storyline with Luke's old girlfriend was great, and I love the other characters from past books like Jess and Suze, and Becky's mom and Janice are always a hoot! I just hope she doesn't stop here with the series. No, it isn't deep, insightful reading, but for a fun time, you can't beat Becky Bloomwood and her Visa card!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I'm getting a bit tired of the Chick Lit category for some books because this book deserves to stand out and be accessable to MORE readers, ones who don't consider themselves \\"typical\\" Chick Lit readers. I confess that I'm one of those and because of that, I nearly missed reading this delightful book. It isn't deep literature but it is a pleasure to read, even if you're long past the days of parenthood (my kids are nearly grown).Quite simply, it is funny, believable and has a mother who readers should be able to relate to - or actually a mother-to-be. From the first days of pregnancy to other decisions, large and small, she is eccentric and lovable, in her own quirky way, fuming at her husband as he juggles business and HER needs, getting in debates with him about whether to learn the gender of the baby during an ultrasound, etc..I laughed out loud at some parts.Take a chance on this one. I wish I could include excerpts from every section of the book but you deserve to discover her style without having the surprise spoiled."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"If you're a fan of the Shopaholic series, this one will definitely be a favorite. Sophie Kinsella has not lost her magic touch of making Becky the charmingly air-headed shopping maniac we have come to love. I found myself laughing out loud throughout Becky's adventures in pregnancy. From her obsession with shopping in all the chic baby boutiques, to ordering online and from the glossy upscale catalogues, to investing in \\"antiques of the future\\" for her baby's portfolio, Becky was in fine form. Now working (more or less) as a personal shopper at a laughingstock of a store, Becky finds ways to make it soar while enlisting the help of an old friend. Familiar characters like Suz, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood, Janice, Tom, Jess, and of course Luke, are all featured prominently as Becky goes in search of the A-list obstetrician, the choice of all the glam people, only to discover she is Luke's ex-girlfriend and still carries a torch for him. Will Becky trust Luke when he is seen out and about with the doctor? Will she be able to find the right pram for her baby? Will she be the toast of the town when Vogue magazine features her as one of London's \\"yummiest Mummies-to-be\\"? From her first sonogram to the most hysterical delivery ever, everything's coming up pink and blue for our favorite shopper. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I read all 4 of the Shopaholic books and they seem to just be very repetitive. You can basically predict after the first book what the main character will do. But I still got through them all and though they were cute."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"SHOPAHOLIC & BABY by Sophie KinsellaDecember 2, 2007Rating: 4/5 StarsI've loved all the SHOPAHOLIC books by Sophie Kinsella, and this was no exception. In SHOPAHOLIC & BABY, Becky Brandon (Nee Bloomwood) is now pregnant, and as all fans will suspect, she's shopping like a madwoman for baby items. But not just any old baby items. She has to have the best of all designer products, such as fancy prams (no, she can't just have one!). Forget the breast pumps, the diapers, and all the stuff that is essential. Becky is only interested in one thing, and that is to have anything that looks great, has a designer label on it, and all the celebrities have as well.When Becky learns about the gynecologist to the stars, she HAS to switch doctors and finds a way to get on the waiting list for this very exclusive doctor. When she throws her name around (being married to the very famous Luke Brandon), she gets in immediately. Unfortunately, she finds out too late that Luke actually knows her new gynecologist. In fact, Luke and Venetia used to date in college, and from Becky's viewpoint, it looks like the two of them may have some unfinished business.SHOPAHOLIC & BABY is one misunderstanding after another, although it begins to look like maybe Becky isn't really misunderstanding anything at all. Is Luke really having an affair With Venetia? Will Becky allow this woman to deliver her baby? And what about all those baby strollers she bought? Will she be able to keep them all?In the mean time, Luke's business is heading for some rough times, and Becky is still spending money like it grows on trees. Becky's best friend is having a crisis of her own, and Becky's newly found sister (from the previous book) thinks that Becky has seen the light and is no longer the big consumer she used to be. Ha! I have a feeling this may be the last book in the series, although there is always a way to add yet another novel. I have enjoyed all the SHOPAHOLIC books, and I somehow relate to Becky (scary, I know) and am glad that there is someone out there, albeit fictional, that spends more money frivolously than I do."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"You'd think this stuff would wear thin. Becky really is, as one of the characters in the book accuses her of being, a frivolous, silly airhead. And a compulsive liar to boot. And she never seems to learn a thing -- here it is, the fifth Shopaholic book, and she's still getting into the same foolish fixes as she got into in the first one. Yet, somehow she remains tremendously likeable.High points: The bit with Becky's mum and Janice at the childbirth class is an absolute hoot. I also particularly enjoyed Becky's confrontations with Luke's horrible mother, and with the potential homewrecker... And the scene right after the baby was born was very tender and very, very true. That moment right after your child is born when you look it it and think, \\"It's you.\\" Kinsella put her finger right on it.A charming book all in all. I'm already looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have loved all the Shopaholic books to date. When you love each book, it is a little nerve wracking to see if the author can keep the series going. Kinsella does a great job of staying true to Becky's character and continuing to wind the additional characters in the book--even bringing back some old favorites. I get so sad when I am nearing the end as I want the stories to go on!Another poster was talking about the shallowness of the book. In my opinion, I look to Kinsella's books as entertainment. Each one, including \\"can you keep a secret\\" and \\"Undomesticated Goddess\\" were great entertaining reads. In fact, they were laugh out loud reads!If you loved Becky in her other escapades, you are sure to love this book. It really does not disappoint. I look forward to more of Kinsella's books, hopefully she can create another Shopaholic installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have been impatiently waiting for this book to finally come out ever since buying the previous book in the series the same day it was released, which I had been waiting for since getting the previous book in the series the same day it was released (or was that the new series she started) either way, Sophie Kinsella is such a talented, wonderful writer, she is truly the one and only author to which I compare everyone else to. I am pleased to say that this most recent release certainly did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love the Shopaholic series. However, the story lines seem to all be the same - Becky shops - a lot, Luke has issues at work that he does not share with her, she thinks he is cheating, Becky does something stupid and manages to turn it into something positive, etc.The book is funny and good for a quick read during spring break. I just wish we could see Becky get a real life and do something besides shop. Seriously, what person needs 5 prams?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon is have baby! Time to go shopping for everything that a baby is going to need. Prams, cribs and everythin else a baby needs.

But it turns out that the famous Dr. Carter has some history with her husband Luke. Now Becky is trying to save her job, her marriage, while trying to get ready for the next generation of shoppers.\\"Shopaholic and Baby\\" is the fifth book in this series by Sophie Kinsella and while the beginning of the series was pretty good, I have admitt that I am getting a bit tired of it. Becky seem to be a character that just can't learn. Becky's attitude was fun in the beginning but its getting old."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I started reading chick-lits when my roommate told me to de-stress myself. She said I should start with the Shopaholic series, and I may get addicted. So I went to the library and borrowed the first 4 books of the Shopaholic series. I CAN'T STOP! I read it before bed, during mealtimes, on the subway! I bought Can You Keep a Secret and The Undomestic Goddess, found them as nicely written as the Shopaholic series (though Shopaholic is still my favorite...), and I even looked for her books written under Madeline Wickham. But I guess they only published those in Britain. I was one of the first on the line to buy this new Shopaholic & Baby and can't stop reading it!!! Sophie Kinsella's amazing! Love Becky!!! Her lame excuses to shop -- irritating but lovable. Can't wait for her next book to come! I know they said this is the last installment of Shopaholic, but I hope Kinsella will publish another one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon takes shopping to a whole new level in this book in which she shops for her unborn child. Her philosophy is that on one can ever have too many prams or too much baby equipment when preparing for the blessed event. Becky's husband Luke is excited about the baby too, but he is also very distracted with his business affairs. And speaking of affairs, Becky is quite convinced that Luke is having an affair with her obstetrician who just happens to be an old girlfriend of his. As usual, Becky's friends are very supportive of her, and her mother-in-law is insufferable. This book is light reading and has lots of laughs but it does show that despite her self-centeredness, Becky does have a maternal side."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This was my favorite of the Shopoholic books; it was a good combination of emotion (which was slightly lacking in the \\"Sister\\" book) and humor. Similar plot to \\"Debutant Divorcee's\\" by Plum Sykes, yet with Kinsella's endearing characters."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The formula for these books is always the same. Becky gets in trouble due to her shopping addiction, unwittingly helps someone, and at the end saves the day. At first I thought her story and character was funny and cute, now she's just too darn annoying. I find that I'm disgusted through the majority of the book and it's very difficult to stay interested in a character that is just so unlovable. I think this will be the last Shopaholic book I read unless the author shakes it up a bit and strays from her normal formula."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I didn't like this book very much. It seemed to be the same as the other books and, in my opinion, very predictable. Becky is always getting herself into ridiculous situations and misunderstandings that nobody would ever get themselves into in real life. I suppose that's part of the charm to some people, but I found it very annoying this time."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Omy Gosh when I read she was Prego. Was so happy for her and luke. And Again Had me in so much Tears and Laughing but I think More tears. Because of that evil Slut Venetia, ugh well at first I was truly begging to think Like Becky that Luke was cheating on her. OMG and then when Venetia the cow convinced luke in going to the renunion and OMG just left Becky there. Oh well this was once again an amazing book and cant wait to reread it again, when im done rereading againt the tie the knot one!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"if u like to shop, this book is for u ...if u don\`t ,don\`t bye it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I haven't started this book yet, but I've loved all the other books in this series. Becky's adventures are hilarious. I can't wait to start it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book has to be the best out of her series, its witty and fun. It is a great summer read if your looking for something light and funny. The entire series was great and i'm really hoping that she doesn't stop at this one i would definetely read more of Becky's adventures. I admit i've been where she has and overindulged and looked at my Visa bill and nearly passed out the first time. I can competely relate to all her adventures especailly this one i was actually 3 months pregnant when i started reading this i admit it was kinda redundant in some parts but it was funny anyways. The villian Venetia Carter was just Hillarious!!! I think that this was the greatest thing about this book was it actually had a \\"villian\\". It was amazing and please please Sophie Kinsella WRITE MORE ABOUT Becky Bloomwood (Brandon)!! I will be sure to purchase and read it if you do."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"That's what append to me averytime a read something about Becky. I love the Shopaholic series but I really can not understand how can a man put up with her. :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Kinsella's latest installment in the Shopaholic series is a gem. Sometimes sequels fail to live up to earlier editions, but this is actually my favorite in the series. Our heroine, Becky, brings old \\"I Love Lucy\\" scenes to mind, as she gets herself into crazy situations, as she prepares for motherhood,while the longsuffering hubby stands by. Her Mom and friends are colorful characters you really care about. I was in the bookstore on Tuesday when the book came out, and read it straight through. You won't be disappointed, if you like to laugh and read about a true shopaholic...you'll won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I must admit that even though Becky was really starting to annoy me as each book kept coming, I felt that I should continue the series. Well, I read Shopaholic & Sister and Shopahlic & Baby back to back. Although Becky still annoyed me (Don't we all wish we had people to save us from all our mess-ups!?) I thought she ws much more enjoyable as a soon-to-be mom. Plus, the shopping is for a baby and not her constantly! I do hope this is the final book of the series because it definitely summed up all the books and made me enjoy the character again! This is a fun and quick read!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I enjoyed the first few Shopaholic books. But this one I started to get a little annoyed with the main character. Hasn't she learned her lesson YET? How can anyone be that much of an idiot with money? Well, maybe there are people out there like that, sadly. Anyway, the book was entertaining at times. I am probably just tired of the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I thought that this book, Shopoholic and Baby was a wonderful and extremely funny book. To read this book you probably should like romance novels. If you do not like teenage girl books you will most likely not enjoy this funny but romantic book. For me, this book had a great sense of humor. The story of this book is set in England. Instead of strollers the people from Britain call them prams. I thought that was unique since it is so different from the word \\"stroller\\". Over all (on a 1 to 10 scale) I'd give this book a 9.5. I loved it! Maddie"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"A woman who shops compulsively, is in denial about it and lies to her husband about her addiction hardly makes for a sympathetic protagonist. Furthermore one would think that the theme \\"a woman shops ... and shops ... and shops some more\\" would soon wear off, not continue on to the fifth in a series of bestsellers. However, Sophie Kinsella's witty prose and nimble imagination have managed to keep our attention in the continuation of the Shopaholic saga.Becky Brandon nee Bloomwood is now married to Luke, the love of her life. She has made uncertain peace with her newly discovered half sister Jess and reclaimed her (temporarily frayed) friendship with Suze. The big news in Becky's life, of course, is that she is pregnant!! Along with the usual excitement that comes with it is the thrill of shopping for the soon-to-be born baby. The baby needs clothes, the baby needs gear and of course the baby inside needs a lot of medical monitoring. That is when Dr.Venetia Carter comes in. She of the movie star good looks, she of the swishy red hair, she with the extensive knowledge of Latin, she of the romantic past with Luke. Does her unexpected appearance in the Brandons' life cause a rift?I gave the book four stars as the relationship between Luke and Becky is alluded to very superficially. Moreover, Luke's character is not fleshed out - his presence is shadowy and insubstantive. In fact I see this as the primary drawback in all the Shopaholic books. Becky's relationships with Jess and Suze, as well as the Bloomwood family, Elinor and Suze's parents, albeit wittily portrayed, draw on real concerns. I find Luke's uninvolved attitude (even his serious lack of concern about possibly being driven to bankruptcy by Becky's spending) too unrealistic even for a \\"fluffy\\" read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Just like all the rest of her work, this one had me reading the entire book in one night. I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have directed my dear sister to never, ever use me again as guinea pig should she want a \\"guy's reaction\\" to a book. I can only hope that this expression of so-called chick-lit is not the standard by which most women are entertained. Ms. Kinsella has, as we say in pre-school sandlots, a bit of a potty-mouth, and has transformed this into a genre that I title as \\"Wants to be cute so she swears.\\" OK, we get that you know all the FCC-forbidden words. We get that your characters think endlessly about consummation of, well, just about any enounter they encounter. My recommendation for Ms. Kinsella's penalty is that she must stay on a desert island for one full month (one of the longer months, like March), and then read and read Bronte and Austen (not re-read, as I am sure that writers like Ms. Kinsella have never read Bronte or Austen), and learn from them how to use prose to transform the reader. I even have a new crime of which I now accuse Ms. Kinsella: Prose Abuse."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Good book if you have read the other Shopaholic books. It lived up to my expections."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Fabulous. Great books. Very funny. Didn't think Shopaholic and Sister was as good as the previous books. This get Sophie back on track. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I happen to be at the library and i came across this book and a few other's in this series. So I thought I would give it a try. And i'm glad i did. So i have to say,This book and all the other's in the series is worth reading. I started the book right after i got home and when i looked again at the clock and the book i couldn't believe how the time flew by and how far i was in the book. These are a lite fun read to pass the time away. I would recomend it to family,friends, and anyone else you know. I did and they just love it also.I just love the way she talks about the baby and how she spends like it is no tomorrow. I feal sorry for the way she gets herself in debt and has a hard time getting out.but i can't stop reading it. i want to know more and more. So if you can go get this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I loved all of the Shopaholic novels, but this has been my favorite. I found the new villain, Venetia Carter, of the book to be well-rounded and a good addition. But most of all, and for the first time ever, I actually felt Becky's pain when she discovered, or falsely discovered, that her husband was cheating on her and was as pissed off as her when Venetia did other things (eg.: made her wear weird \\"baby-supporting\\" clothes). I'd love to see another Shopaholic book, but, if not, this was a great final installment. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I could not put the book down! I stayed up until 1:00 am to finish it. I absolutely loved it. I found myself hysterically laughing at so many parts in the book (Becky's mum and Janice talking about what labor was really like & the names Becky told Elinor they were considering.... so funny!). The story brought so many memories back of my own first pregnancy and the fears I felt about labor and being someone's mother. Also, that first time you see that little baby and the feeling that comes over you - Sophie Kinsella hit it on the head! Then there was the serious parts too when Becky thought she had lost Luke (and I don't blame her for feeling that way either). All around, it was just a FABULOUS book! I know Sophie Kinsella has said she will bring Becky & Luke back, I really hope this is true (she just HAS to - too much is left unfinished)and that she does it sooner rather than later (that's for my own selfish reasons - LOL). In fact, I hope she brings them back in several more books (for those who think the story is over, you don't have to buy them - there are plenty of us who will GLADLY keep on reading them)."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"\\"Amazing\\", is one word to sum up the book Shopaholic and Baby. The book is about a wealthy family of two, living in the busy city of London. They are about to have their dreams come true when Becky, the wife, finds out she is pregnant. Shopping is one of Becky's ways to get away from it all and to look for prams, clothes, bags, or anything else for the baby. Becky wants everything to be perfect for the baby, but the perfection turns out to be not so perfect.I really enjoyed this realistic fiction book. All of the wacky things Becky does makes this book worthwhile to read. Sophie Kinsella really puts you in the story by having side notes in addition to the book. This novel is geared to young adults, more than adults. If you enjoy shopping, conflict, or babies, you will definitely love Shopaholic and Baby.*-Morgan-*"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Latest installment in the wildly successful Shopaholic series, I was excited to read this book. While I thoroughly enjoyed the other books in the series and have read them multiple times, I can say that this one fell a bit short of the bar that Kinsella herself has set. Slow to start, I had trouble really connecting with Becky and her latest set of problems. Still as funny as the others, it just wasn't laugh out loud funny. I'm hoping for better things from the next book. Sorry Sophie, but it wasn't a home run."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Just finished reading Kinsella's latest enstallment for Becky Brandon (nee: Bloomwood). Was as funny and entertaining as all of the other books in the series. If you're a fan of Becky Brandon, I'd suggest reading this latest additon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love the Shopaholic series, I like Becky. I like how she is obssed with shopping, celebrity OBGYN and La Mer products.This book is no different than the former ones, very fun to read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"love the shopaholic series!!!! have to say the first 2 are still my favorite and definitely did not like the sister one.. but sophie kinsella brings the magic back with this one... i absolutely love the letters that becky sends to her financial investment guy... hilarious and sensitive at the same time! :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all the books in the \\"Shopaholic\\" series and was not disappointed with this newest installment. Once again Becky only wants the best and will spend whatever she has to, to get what she wants. Even if it almost causes doubt in her marriage. I hope there will be another book in the series just so we can see if the newest member of the family will be as \\"spoiled\\" as mom =)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have to give Sophie Kinsella due respect - after her last Shopaholic book, which was by far the worst in the series (and in my mind, a placefiller to extend the series likely devised by her publisher), she really managed to step it up for this latest installment.Becky Bloomwood is back, happily married, working on investments, a personal shopper at a hot new boutique, and excitedly expecting a baby. Or is she? As usual, Becky is a tad insatiable resulting in the quest for a new home, ridiculous investments, the perfect baby gear, and more notably, the perfect baby doctor - and did I mention her super fab job isn't so fab after all? Along the way, her new baby doctor reveals herself to be Luke's ex from college, and suddenly Becky is seeing a new side of Luke she isn't so sure she likes. Will all of the threads wrap up in time to make this a happy ending? Maybe, maybe not, but I will say Becky and co. are served with a healthy dose of reality in this edition of the Shoapholic world.The strengths of this book lay in the humour, the questions, and the turmoil wreaked in every segment of Becky's life. The weaknesses fell in the hands of certain unnecessary storylines (that pesky half-sister Jess from the last book is still a waste of page space imo), and the lack of shopping. The thing that could be said about the latter however, is that Kinsella (wisely) recognized that her readers had seen shopaholic Becky go on one too many splurges and recovered, and seeing it in this book would be overkill...she's supposed to progress remember? And progress she does, in a way that seems natural rather than contrived, and still highlights some priceless Shopaholic moments throughout.Personally, I'm still quoting \\"Shes a red-headed b**** and I hate her\\" to my friends in regards to a particularly funny part of the book - and you'll likely have fun doing the same with other jokes. Overall this is a good book, and a great improvement on the way the series was spinning previously, and truly a must-read for Shopaholic fans as it does not disappoint. Predictions for the next book? Shopaholic & House...or maybe even...Shopaholic & Budget? Gasp. Only time will tell!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This Shopaholic book is cute, as all the books have been. I was glad to see that there was more moving the plot line than just the same shopping fiascos. There are a few, but they are mostly just fun sidenotes. The book is just the right fit for the characters' growth."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have recently gotten into Audiobooks and wanted to listen to the full Shopaholic series in preparation for the Mini-Shopaholic book. The story is great...the Shopaholic Rhythm works. My only issue is the fact that the reader of this book pronounced the name of Becky's best friend (Suze) differetly than all of the other readers (she said Suzie while in the previous books she was called Sooz). As someone who loves these characters, it was disheartening to hear this, almost like the person reading didn't know the characters....Other than that, it was enjoyable and I am excited for Mini-Shopaholic."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This is probably my favorite of the shopaholic novels! I loved every minue of it! So much so that when my android that I was reading the book on crashed I ran to the store at 10:30 to buy it so I could finish it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I read all these Shopaholic books, one right after the other. I am almost finished with this last one. Don't get me wrong, I love Sophie Kinsella but these Shopaholic books almost drove me crazy. I read Kinsella's later books prior to the Shopaholic books. I must say she has come a long way. \\"Can you keep a Secret\\" is my favorite.Becky remaines crazy throughout all these Shopaholic books. Her fantasy world simply unnerves me. I wanted so bably for Becky to mature just a little bit. I realize her mother is why she is so goofy but most kids try a little harder than their parents. Becky just kept getting worse and worse after all that she had gone through. She is a very sweet girl and girl is the operative word, but she is so hung up on being the best dressed and hobnobbing with celebrities until it almost gets sickening at some point.On the other hand, I think Kinsella is depicting what an \\"aholic\\" really is even if it happens to be shopping. The feeling Becky gets when she needs a pick up just by going into a store is so typical of any addict. I just wish she had grown out of her addictive personality in at least the last book.Overall the book is good but not as good as Kinsella's latest works. She is quite the comedic writer."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This was a good book, and fun. It also had me not liking some of the choices of the main character...and had me hating her *new gynecologist*. It was very well written and no matter what it had me feeling, I was compelled to read it to the end. I'm glad I did!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Bloomwood Brandon never fails to make me laugh. This time, in her continual quest to \\"keep up with the Joneses,\\" Becky finds herself in a tangled web containing herself, her patient husband Luke, and her obstetrician...who also happens to be Luke's college ex-girlfriend. And while Becky is busy buying new prams right and left, searching for the perfect outfit for her new baby, and turning her new job into a raging success, Luke is busy at work attempting to support Becky's outrageous shopping habits.I love how Becky tries to justify each and every purchase. She just knows they're going to need this item or that item--for the baby, of course. Her friend Suze and her sister Jess are there to bail her out every time.While this one wasn't as fast-paced as some of the other Shopaholic books, it was back on par with Ms. Kinsella's first couple of them. I came away with a smile."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon, loveable shopaholic, is back for her biggest adventure yet- motherhood! Readers may be wondering if being pregnant calms her urges for all things fashion, but of course it doesn't! Becky quickly goes overboard with her purchases, buying all the things a new baby doesn't need- fashionable cribs, non-practicable prams, a closetful of designer clothes, and too much more. And what would a pregnancy be without the most sought after obstetrician that all the celebrities go to- Becky wisely name drops her own husbands PR firm to get a slot with the stunning Venetia Carter.Becky's pregnancy gets complicated when she figures out Venetia is actually Luke's ex-girlfriend from college, and starts to suspect an affair brewing between her OB and husband. (The late night dinners and text messages in Latin really makes wonder.)She hires an off-key private detective to snoop around, and the results are not what Becky was hoping to hear. Meanwhile, she is trying to snag the perfect house for her growing family, trading the owner a pair of the \\"most coveted\\" boots for the keys and the lease.Shopaholic and Baby, the fifth installment from Sophie Kinsella's popular series brings the usual laughs and wild antics from the heroine, but I felt this one gave even more. With the pregnancy and the possible affair, I felt that I couldn't put the book down. I had to keep reading to find out the sex of the baby, if Luke truly was unfaithful, and where the Brandon's would eventually settle down after losing their perfect house. The ending may come as a surprise to some, but I think it is perfect to pick up for a sixth novel- which Kinsella has recently announced she is working on. All chick lit lovers will love this novel and leave you asking for more."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I've finished the entire series and do think Sophie Kinsella did an overall good job. The books are fun to read. As I went through the series I got more and more annoyed with Becky. Her habit of telling lies to her husband (Brandon) was hard to read through at times & even the lie about going in labor. You'd think by the end of the series Becky would have learned something, but she doesn't. She's still the same Becky Bloomwood readers were introduced to in the 1st book (Confessions of a Shopaholic). The side stories (Suze,Jess, Janice, Tom, Mum & Dad) are what makes this book cute and fun to read. Good book but don't expect anything new from Becky."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"It's okay.Yes, there is a sense of hesitation. After reading all of the Shopaholic books, this latest installment of the series is definitely the most \`dramatic'. I even wonder if Ms. Kinsella wrote this when she was with child because the book is oozing with hormones, so to speak. Therefore, I cannot fully commit to saying that I like it because the book failed to bring me the same old Becky Bloomwood-Brandon antics and humor. For example, I could not find a single witty Shopaholic statement that I would normally find in Kinsella's novels. Becky's shopping \`mis'adventures have lessened and her enthusiasm for shopping for baby stuff seems pretty \`normal' for a pregnant person, whereas I was looking for something over the top! Granted there was a whole chapter on Prams' shopping (or strollers as we call them here in the U.S.), and Becky ends up buying three, but the chapter, although it was a manifestation that Becky hasn't lost her Shopaholic touch, was really not that interesting.However, even though the book lacked the same dose of Becky Bloomwood funny and witty mishaps, the difference in the flavor compared to the the other Shopaholic novels isn't all that bad. There were a dramatic plots, LOTS of it in fact....such as \`Is Luke and Venetia having an affair?', \`What is the secret that is going on in Brandon Communications?', \`Will they lose the house?', \`Is Jess going to Peru, if she does, what happens to Tom?'. The page-turner is definitely the supposed \`affair' of Venetia and Luke, and I must confess that during this portion of the book I was actually quite moved just imagining how painful it must be to be in such a delicate state and finding out your husband is committing adultery. I am sure every reader is at the edge of their seats too wondering if tragedy is how Ms. Shopaholic's story is going to end. The culmination is pretty good. Ms. Kinsella proves once again that Becky and Luke's love is stronger than ever. However it is not a perfect ending. As Ms. Kinsella resolves each one conflict, the ending result is somewhat turning out to be like a Rocky Balboa movie. Brandon Communications is severly hemorrhaging money and thus the Brandons lose the opportunity to buy their dream home and end up living momentarily with Becky's parents by the time the baby was born.If Kinsella decided to end the Shopaholic series with this book then that would be fine. There really isn't much more to develop in Becky's story. Ms. Kinsella has reinforced her 'shopaholic' nature time and again with every place she has visited or every new experience she encounters. Her romance with Luke has been tested and it was proven to be quite solid. And all the other characters in the story, like Becky's parents, Suze, Jess (who is moving for a short time to Chile with Tom), and even Danny (who I still do not like and can never comprehend how he became a famous and most sought after fashion designer when he specializes in \`t-shirts'!) have all been fairly developed. The series should end with this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I just love Becky Bloomwood, and I don't think I can give an unbiased review. I have loved all the Shopaholic books! Honestly, I just love the character of Becky Bloomwood so much that I don't really care what the plot is as long as I get to have Becky in my head for a few days! I know that sounds terrible, but it's true. If you have read all the other Shopaholic books and loved them, then you will love this one as well. However, if you have never read any of the Shopaholic books, I strongly recommend them! Start with Confessions of a Shopaholic. The movie is no substitute!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book was the most emotional book out of all of them I think. It may have been because Becky was pregnant so her emotions spread to me, or because her marriage was being threatened, but it did make me cry. I usually don't cry over books, but for a couple seconds I truly believed that Luke was cheating on her, but I quickly snapped out of that. It was kind of hard to imagine Becky pregnant the whole book, but she reminds you constantly of her big belly and swollen feet. This book might have had some of the funniest parts too Kinsella has written. I would frequently laugh out loud while reading it and run to the nearest person and tell them all about what Becky was up to now. She has matured a little since the first book, for she is a mother now, but her childlike ways always come back at the worst times, making for a hilarious novel that will grip your emotions to the fullest."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"While I want to scream sometimes at the tension that Kinsella creates in the last several novels between Becky and her man, I understand the theory behind creative writing enough to understand that Kinsella has to give us some tension beyond Becky's shopping habits and upcoming baby. Let's just say though that at the end of the novel, I kept hoping for a more monumental showdown between the infuriating OB/GYN doctor and Luke. :) Becky seems so weak sometimes as a person, and yet I can't help recognizing those qualities that make her both seem weak and vulnerable within myself at times too. Overall, a great read!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"If you have enjoyed the Shopaholic series in the past then you will enjoy this too. I found this particular adventure of Becky's even more fanciful than they others.In this book,as the title probably gives away, Becky is pregnant with her first baby. She has her same wacky adventures mostly related to Pram shopping but she is dealing with a potentially cheating husband.The caricature of her conniving OB and her husband are kind of over the top and Kinsella works so hard to sell the cheating senario that as she wraps up the book a lot of the pieces don't fit together.I also wasn't totally on board with Becky's pregnancy experience, having had two kids myself it didn't feel very realistic to me.Having said that, I gave the book 4 stars because it is just plain fun to read. So bottom line, if you are a shopaholic fan, you will enjoy this too, just don't wait for it to get the pulitzer."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"If you like the Shopaholic series you will luv this book. Becky Bradon is a great character who has not changed since becoming pregnant. Her justifications for shopping for the baby will make you laugh and smile. I could not put the book down and now all my friends are reading Sophie Kinsella's latest Shopaholic book. I hope there is a new one in the works. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of the other books in the Shopaholic series. While I am the first to admit that there is not a lot of concentration needed to read these books, this one seemed even more predictable than the others. If you need a book that you can pick up and put down while on a plane or by the pool, this one will do."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Poor Becky Bloomwood. Always getting herself into a bind, and miraculously finding her way out of it again like only a character of her hutzpah can. Her entire Shopaholic series is wonderful. BUY it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all in this series and I loved this book the most. While I did not LOVE & sister, Becky is back and fab!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This is a very well written addition to the Shopaholic Series. Just like the other ones this book makes me laugh and laugh and laugh till I have to put down the book. The way Sophie Kinsella writes about Becky's life, now expecting, is just so charming and amusing that I can't wait to have a baby just so I can go shopping as well :-)There is a huge downfall in the book involving her husband Luke that I think could have been kept a littler shorter...but in the end all will be well!Can't wait for the next book in this series...wonder what it will be... Shopaholic & Pregnant again cause shopping was so much fun the first time around..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"It's nice to know that Becky can always turn even the most uneventful pregnancy into a hilarious adventure!From speaking to her bladder during an improvised ultrasound session to finding out that babies have their own ideas of what the perfect pram is - Becky is not only as funny as ever, but can now shop faster than ever, especially since discovering it helps cure her of morning sickness!As always, Becky manages to get into unintentional misadventure, whether it is to make up a story about a made up child or being forced to wear support hose with shoes without high heels!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The book (hardcover) arrived in perfect condition, was much cheaper than at any B&M; bookstore, and was, as expected, just as funny (if not funnier) than its predecessors. Having just given birth to a child myself less than a year ago, it was even more icing on the cake. Definitely recommend this book.NOTE - No offense meant to anyone, but I typically don't read what I consider to be \\"foofoo\\" fiction novels (i.e., a quick and mindless read)... I'm more of a classical lit person myself; however, I made an exception for this after hearing coworkers rave about the series, and found myself pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I was so excited when this book came out because I love the Shopaholic! I was a little disapointed because it was so predictable. I feel like the author wrote it to make the readers happy not because she still loved her character. By the way Luke Brandon is really a jerk not the loving husband Becky thinks that he is."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I almost bought this book but at the last minute I checked it out at the library. I'm so glad I did.Since everyone else has recapped the book in their reviews I'll just state my opinion. It isn't a terrible book but it's not a great one either. I've read all the Sophie Kinsella books except for the latest release, \\"Mini Shopoholic\\". My favorite is \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" which isn't part of this series. My next favorite is \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\". I noticed in \\"Shopaholic Ties The Knot\\" that the characters were beginning to feel a little flat and I started disliking Luke more and more. I think the problem with this book is that all of the characters are too over the top. Becky with her shopping, Luke with his work, her mom and dad with their new zen attitudes, Janice and her obsession with her son, Danny with his ego, and on and on... There is no stable, normal acting character that balances out the over the top behavior and after a while you just get to the point where you don't care. I still like Becky but I've grown tired of the receptiveness of the story line and the relationship between her and the Luke character. I think these books would be much better if there was a stable, normal person that these characters could bounce off. Someone that represents the readers.If you get this book try checking it out at the library or buy a used copy on Amazon. In my opinion this is the weakest book of the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Having just read \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" before this and \\"Mini shopaholic\\" after, this book was probably my least favorite of the three. First off, I felt like Luke Brandon was not acting the way I had imagined him to be from reading the earlier books.In this book he seemed a weaker version of himself. But, I see how Kinsella has developed him from the earlier books--just not the way I imagined. I was disappointed in that I thought Kinsella could have done more with the idea that Becky was having a baby and been more creative with it...but I still enjoyed the book! The character of Vienna was described wonderfully! But, I was disappointed in the ending of what happens to her character. See what you all think and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read the entire series of Shopaholic books and this one does not dissappoint. However... with each one, the language gets worse and worse. That might not bother most people, but it bothers me. The stories are so cute, and the characters are so loveable - the language is just completely unnecessary and I think it takes away from the books. Still, these are fun, light reads and you can't help but love Becky Bloomwood!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella. All of her books are laugh out loud hilarious. This was no exception!!!! Great read. Very entertaining."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This Shopaholic series is the best I have ever read. I loved them so much that I have read them 2-3 times. I recommend any of Sophie Kinsella's books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I've been a huge fan of the series since my first laugh out loud reading \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\". Each subsequent edition has been slightly more watered-down and ludicrous, but Shopaholic & Baby conjures up eye rolls and groans rather than giggles and guffaws. I think it's time for Becky to hang it up."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Synopsis: Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is back in the fifth installment on Kinsella's Shopaholic series. Becky has had some crazy adventures. From being so far in debt she couldn't see straight, to meeting the man of her dreams and getting married, to discovering a long lost sister, Becky has done it all, and now, she's having a baby.Becky and her husband Luke have sold their swanky London flat and found their dream home, one that includes a shoe room for Becky. In true Shopaholic fashion, Becky is buying every designer baby item she can get her hands on. She even manages to land an appointment with an OB/GYN to the stars that has just moved to London. Everything is going swimmingly for the Brandons.Just when it seemed that the baby would complete Becky's perfect world, it begins to fall apart. An old girlfriend of Luke's resurfaces and Luke begins to spend quite a lot of time with her. Becky brushes it off at first, but she soon discovers that Luke is lying to her about his whereabouts and is receiving text messages written in Latin. Add into the mix Luke's snooty mother, a job in a store that is the laughingstock of London, and the inability to find the perfect pram, and Becky is at wits end. Can the ever bubbly Becky Bloomwood Brandon turn it all around in time for the birth of her baby?Review: I really liked this book. It had been a very long time since I read a shopaholic book, and I was glad to once again bask in the glow of all things Becky Bloomwood. Kinsella's books aren't the most intellectually challenging books. But you know what? They don't have to be. What her books are are a good time. The characters are endearing. There is no one like Becky Bloomwood and now matter how hair-brained her schemes may be, you can't help but love her.I recommend this entire series. If you've never met Becky Bloomwood, go introduce yourself!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The series is so fun and Becky is one of the funniest characters! If you liked any of the other books in the Shopaholic series you will love this one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"For some reason, I couldn't get into this book like I had with the previous 4 in the series. Once I finally did, I devoured the rest of it. This one is probably the most \\"dramatic\\" of the series, but still light and fun. Becky learns important lessons with each book, yet she's always the same old Becky - and that's why we love her. Now that I'm back on the Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) wagon, I can't wait to read Mini Shopaholic!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"this is a good book if you want to be entertained amd laugh. I have read all the books in the series and it drives me crazy that luke and becky are not homest with each other. i do recommend this series and will read more if they come out."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Babies are in right now so this is a perfect addition to the series! I read it when I was pregnant with my first baby and totally feel her! Great read even if you don't have a kid!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Easily my favorite of the shopaholic series & 3rd fav Sophia Kinsella novel (1st is Can you keep a secret, 2nd The Undomestic Goddess). Kinsella has a way of writing that keeps you glued, and laughing out loud!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Even if you don't like shopping, this book is to die for. I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books. I just laugh so hard at Becky. She tries so hard to stop shopping. Then she has a baby. It is so funny. You need to read the part about her wedding too. There is British humor too."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love anything buy Sophie Kinsella. Becky, the main character is hilarious. I recommend you read her other books since they all are more or less realted to each other, almost like sequels. This book is laugh out loud funny. The characters are crazy and do the dumbest things that you can't help but laugh!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This just might be my favorite Shopaholic book yet! Becky is up to all her usual antics but her views on pregnancy are hysterical. I was laughing out loud!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"My first Shopaholic was \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\". From that moment I became addicted to Sophie Kinsella. I have read every book on the series, plus the hilarious \\"Can you Keep a Secret?\\" and \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\", which I think it is her best book so far.I was a bit unsure when I began reading \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" Jess was too difficult to like, but I loved it at the end. I laughed so hard during the whole trip to Cumbria! But with Shopaholic and Baby... well, it just wasn't as funny. Becky sounded stupid at moments. And she was not, she may be an irresponsible, self centered day dreamer but she was not stupid! Looking for home options in the Caribbean was just a bit too unbelievable. That couldn't be Becky! Becky would be looking for houses she couldn't afford, not for houses that far away!Anyways, I enjoyed the lecture. It wasn't super, but it was ok. I hated Venetia so much and it was nice to see Jess and Suze again, the whole gang. I wished Sophie had taken a bit longer in writing it and reviewing it.I will definitely buy her next book, though. I can't wait to get my hands on it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"For those who like Sophie Kinsella's books, this one was amazing. Becky is up to her usual craziness and I found myself laughing out loud as I read the book. A very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This latest installment in the Shopaholic series was not my favorites, but certainly a good read. As someone with a young toddler, whose memories of pregnancy are pretty fresh in my mind, parts of this book took me back to what it was like to be expecting. For instance, while we aren't lucky enough to have the largest baby store on the planet, I felt overwhelmed right alongside Becky and Luke trying to pick out items from nearly a gazillion choices. There were just too many possibilities!The part with Venetia Carter trying to steal look away, was just a tad bit unbelievable, I mean really, this women had to be the ultimate jerk to say such horrible things to Becky as she went into labor, and to confront Becky and lie to her about Luke leaving her. What physician in their right mind would do such a thing...although perhaps she wasn't...or maybe the pregnancy hormones were in overdrive...I didn't laugh as much through this book, as I had with earlier installments, but it was still a very good read and hopefully there will be a \\"Shopaholic and Toddler\\" soon!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The latest in the Shopaholic series is hilarious and heartwarming and just a load of fun to read. I couldn't put it down. I have become a Sophie Kinsella adict, and I am happy to be one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of Kinsella's books up to this new one, Shopaholic & Baby, I haven't quite finished yet, but her books are amazing and fun to read!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This wasn't very good. I struggled to finish it. Becky proves in this book that she just isn't mature enough to be a mother. The name she gave her baby girl is beyond dreadful! This unbelievably cold, red haired witch is trying to steal her husband off her,worse of all the red haired witch is her obyn doctor. Becky really thinks Luke is leaving her and it really messes with her head.The other books in the series are spot on. Also ,I liked that they brought Jess,her level headed sister back as a character and gave her a love interest.It was nice to see Danny her friend from New York pop in and out of this book, but other than that this book was pretty lame."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I was intrigued by the story line and the characters from the 1st pages all the way through to the last. I hated to put the book down. I particularly like Sophie Kinsella's book because they are easy to read, keep you in an upbeat positive mood and just pure entertainment from beginning to end. Pass this one along to all of your friends, they will thank you. and then go get more of Sophie Kinsella's books, they are all fun to read, feel good books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Good audiobook, love the accent. Becky didn't do as much shopping as she usually does, but she definitely got herself in the some tight situations. Can't wait for next one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love the fiction of it all. I love how I was finishing the sentence before reading it because I was THINKING the exact same things...especially during the Venetia Carter moments. The strech marks comment was total \\"kick to the face\\" worthy. Smug cow. Anyway, Becky prevails!!! Which makes this book worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book follows suit in the Shopaholic series. It is funny and poor Becky still gets herself into sticky situations. Anyone who is a shopaholic or who has had a baby can totally relate to this book. Can't help loving Becky, Suze, Jess, Luke and all the family. I feel like I know them personally. Amazon sold the book at about ten dollars cheaper than everyone else. I don't know if that is because I pre-bought it before it was out or if Amazon just sells them cheaper, but I was very happy. A hardback new edition book for under 15 dollars was barely paperback price, and free shipping since I bought three books which totaled over 25 dollars. Love that Amazon. Barbara"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"British writer Sophie Kinsella won a host of fans on both sides of the big pond with her rib tickling Shopaholic series. My first introduction to Sophie was with The Undomestic Goddess, which was a good fun read. Then, I began tracking the Shopaholic series. It is escapism, but what girl doesn't like to fantasize about having days upon days simply to shop? It's been a good two years since the last in this series but well worth the wait.As many know, Becky Brandon (whom we first met as Becky Bloomwood) is a cute, gutsy, totally likable protagonist. She gets into scrapes but usually comes out on top, and she finally met and wed the great love of her life, Luke. Now, in the most natural of all courses of events Becky and Luke are expecting. The attendant discomforts of pregnancy which afflict most of us don't seem to daunt Becky - who else would find that shopping cures morning sickness?And shop she does as everything has to be the perfect ultimate for their firstborn. The finest pram, nursery done by a topnotch designer, priceless togs for the young \`un, and the most sought after obstetrician to care for Becky. She doesn't give a thought to deserting her friendly family doctor once she learns that Venetia Carter is the ob of choice for all celebs.However, she begins to give her decision more than a few thoughts once she finds that Venetia is tall, slim, gorgeous, and Luke's former girlfriend. Aaargh! Venetia knew Luke long before Becky met him, plus she's tres intellectual - even speaks Latin. What's a mother to be to do?Listen to this A-one reading by actress Katherine Kellgren who has a winning young voice with just the hint of a British accent. She has also narrated Shopaholic & Sister, and The Undomestic Goddess. Always highly pleasurable listening!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The heroine of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series is back and better than ever in the fifth installment, Shopaholic and Baby. In the newest book, Becky Bloomwood is pregnant and determined to have the most glamorous pregnancy possible. Her husband Luke's PR business is thriving and well thanks to the acqusition of the Arcodas Group, and he and Becky have sold their Maida Vale mansion and are planning on finding a new home to begin their family. The main conflict in the book comes when Becky decides she has to have the new IT-girl obstetrician to the stars, Venetia Carter. When she discovers that Venetia is one of Luke's ex-girlfriends and eventually begins to suspect that Venetia wants Luke back, Becky has to find a way to keep her man by her side while navigating the trials and tribulations of her pregnancy, her shopping addiction, and her search for the perfect home.Shopaholic and Baby has all of the outrageously fun and entertaining moments that we've come to expect from our favorite heroine including Becky's inability to choose a pram (she'll just have to buy five since they can't choose), her competition with Luke to see who can invest the baby's trust fund more successfully (Luke chooses stocks and bonds, Becky goes with \\"Antiques of the Future\\" (eg, Miu Miu barettes, designer scarves), and their search for the perfect home (which MUST have a Shoe Room). The conflict between Becky and Venetia is vintage Shopaholic with Becky pulling out all the stops to keep her man by her side. Shopaholic and Baby is a must-read for fans of the series, but Sophie Kinsella also does a pretty good job of summarizing the story so that new readers can jump right in. Either way, Shopaholic and Baby is sure to be one of the great beach reads this spring."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella has managed to once again make me laugh my \\"knickers\\" off with the latest installment of the Shopaholic series!The loveable and incredibly uproarious Becky Brandon (n&eacute;e Bloomwood) is back... and this time, she's pregnant! Knowing Becky and her frivolous shopping ways, you would think that the prospect of motherhood would cool off her fashion addiction - WRONG! She now uses her pregnancy as an excuse to invade every baby boutique ('Bambino's') and catalogue ('Funky Baba') within her reach - especially since she discovers that shopping cures morning sickness. Who knew?All of that aside, the real fun begins when Bex realizes that throughout her pregnancy, she absolutely must be taken care of by the one and only Venetia Carter - OBGYN to the stars. But troubled waters start to run deep when our favorite shopaholic starts to doubt her decision to switch over to the renowned doctor. She finds out that Venetia happens to be the ex-college girlfriend of her husband Luke. When she starts witnessing how close the pair have become since reuniting, she starts to obsess over their too close for comfort \\"friendship\\" and believes that they are involved in a secretive zealous love affair. Is it female intuition or just her raging hormones that have her thinking she is losing her husband?Bubbling and brightly hilarious, SHOPAHOLIC AND BABY will have fans yearning for more of Bex and her congenial antics. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"True to form, Sophie Kinsella follows up her hilarious books with another great one. I only wish my life were as funny as Becky's!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I bought this the day it was released in London and read it in only a few days! it is so funny and typical Becky humor. I love these books I just wish Sophie Kinsella could write a bit faster so we get them more often!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Another great chic lit book by Kinsella. It was very funny and I couldn't put it down. Becky was the same as she'd always been funny and heartwarming.I perfer Kinsella's non-shopoholic books (The Undomestic Goddess is my favorite)to these but they're all fantastic."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Shopaholic (Becky) is now pregnant, nothing has change really, she is still overindulging and on this last book, she seems more stupid than ever!! dont get me wrong, i love the shopaholic series, but how much more can she buy?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Yet another great story of Becky Bloomwood. These books are like revisiting old friends, you just jump right in. This time Becky is about to have a baby and it's quite a ride. Not only does Becky have fun buying baby clothes and equipment, but she gets herself all upset over her obstetrician's relationship with her husband, Luke. It turns out Becky's new celebrity doctor is an old girlfriend of Luke's from college and they seem to pick up right where they left off to Becky. It's another one of Becky's wild rides and it's so fun and relaxing to get into."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon is pregnant! She's dying to know the sex of the baby...but Luke wants a surprise. This doesn't stop her from shopping and getting her into embarrassing scrapes as she visits the local stores.The crux of the plot is Venetia Carter. Venetia is the kind of character you love to hate: a scheming, conniving, good-looking ob-gyn who can't wait to get her claws into Luke. Worse...they dated each other at Cambridge. Originally, Becky wanted to see Venetia because she's the \\"must-have\\" obstetrician among the celebrity set; but Venetia's history with Luke puts a crimp in her plans.The intrigue between Venetia and Luke provides suspense, but there is plenty of entertainment from secondary characters: eccentric Tom, who is now living in his parents' backyard after a failed romance; Becky's down-to-earth, ecologically-minded half-sister, who wants to make diapers out of old rags; and Lulu, the irritatingly perfect mother who turns out to have a secret.The great plot and fun characters kept me turning pages till I finished reading this in record time. I couldn't recommend it more! I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky is back in the fifth, and in my opinion best to date, installment of the ever endearing Shopaholic series. When we last left Becky two years ago in 'SHOPAHOLIC AND SISTER' she had just realized that she and husband Luke were expecting. Now in 'SHOPAHOLIC AND BABY' Becky is a few months along and determined to have the most fashionable pregnancy ever! Starting with aquiring a spot with OBGYN to the stars Venitia Carter. However, her dreams of lunching with such celebs as Kate Moss and the latest Bond girl are quickly diluted when Becky finds out that Venitia is Luke's ex-girlfriend. Becky is less than thrilled as Luke and Venitia begin to rekindle thier friendship, however, with troubles at work, a house hunt gone very awry, problem's at Lukes company and raging hormones to boot, she is having a hard time keeping things in perspective.In the usual hillarious Becky Bloomwood style, Becky finds herself in one compromising postition after another all of which are sure to make the reader laugh until they cry! If you are a fan of this series this book is a MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have waited so long to come out and it was everything I wanted it to be and more!! I love the shopaholic series. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I really hope this is not the end of Becky! I am keeping my fingers crossed for more....maybe Shopaholic and Toddler :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Even after the awful Shopaholic and Sister, I still looked very forward to this book's release and even pre-ordered it on Amazon. Even so, I didn't really expect to enjoy it. All of Sophie Kinsella's offerings post-Shopaholic Ties the Knot have been, to me, disappointing and nowhere near as enjoyable as the first three books of the Shopaholic series.However, while I was reading this book, I was about halfway through before I realized (with surprise) that I was actually enjoying it! Kinsella brings back the Becky we all know and love so much, a Becky that seemed to have been lost in Shopaholic and Sister, which was marred by bad storylines and predictable outcomes. Becky is back to true form with her uncontrollable spending and her knack for getting into weird situations, but instead of seeming overplayed it was actually an enjoyable escape.My only qualms with the book are Luke, who seems to be more invested in his business than his family and is a much different character than the Luke Brandon we were introduced to in the first novel; and the ending of the book. If this is indeed the last book in the Shopaholic series, I am sad to see it end in such an unsatisfying way. Also, despite the title, the pregnancy and the baby seemed to have taken a backseat in this book. Becky attends only one birthing class, visits the doctor about three times total, and spends the rest of the time using the baby as a reason to shop some more.Otherwise, this book is all in all a fast and fun read for anyone who has enjoyed Becky's misadventures in the past."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Shopaholic and baby is classic Becky Brandon(nee Bloomwood), it's a laugh a minute with Becky and her cast of characters. If you haven't read any of Shophie Kinsella's books remedy that soon. Her series of Shopaholic books will keep a stitch in your side and keep you smiling."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books, especially her Shopaholic series.I wasn't the least bit disappointed in this new addition and I cannot wait for another book to be released! I'd alos love to see another series started. That would be fab ;)!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky has taught us the joys (and sorrows) of shopping and in this new installment, she shows that having a baby is a great excuse to shop. And shop she does- a lot!Shopaholic and Baby was a pleasant surprise after reading the mediocre Shopaholic and Sister. I had a hard time not reading it all the way through; I literally had to make myself stop reading it- otherwise it would be \\"just one more chapter, just one more..\\" all night long. It was addicting. You just want to keep reading. I'd recommend having a big chunk of free time to devote to this one- to save yourself the \\"agony\\" of waiting or just put it in another room (out of reach) so you can go to sleep...Becky Brandon is silly, fun, and down-to-earth-real and relatable. I was so excited with her as she shopped and shopped for her new little bundle. I felt her pain and emotional turmoil when she found out Venetia and Luke used to be an item. I had such a vivid picture of Cruella de Venetia, as Becky later appropriately dubs her, with her red hair- that I could imagine the horns peeking through... lol. Her struggles that follow are hilarious, her silly antics as she sneaks around trying to find the truth. The \\"baby fair\\" with Suze and \\"Tallulah-Phoebe\\" is hilarious.The ending is sweet and satisfying- leaves you wanting more and waiting for even more fun and adventures with the new Brandon family. Overall, an enjoyable, sweet, fun, quick read. Definitely one for the keeper shelf!I only hesitate to give it five stars because of the completely unnecessary profanity (at least five f-words)."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"In typical Becky fashion, she chooses to go for the snotty OB GYN. That's fairly realistic, given her persona, and I know plenty of people do go this route.But when the OB GYN turns out to be your husband's gorgeous ex? Really? At that point, you cut bait.I don't know if Kinsella has ever had a baby, but surely she's been an adult female long enough to know that going to a doctor you don't trust and letting them poke you in parts to which you generally restrict who gets access is really unbelievable."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella takes a bit of a different turn in this installment of \\"shopaholic\\" tales. There is still the obsessive consumerism facet of Becky's life, but this time what she \\"must have\\" is the OB to the celebrity crowd no matter what she must do. The tale takes the fun twists and turns that Kinsella creates in the life of Becky the shopaholic queen but then there is a new development. The OB to the celebrities that Becky finally acquires turns out to be an ex-girlfriend of Becky's husband. The question becomes, does the \\"ex\\" in ex-girlfriend really apply or is Becky on the verge of losing the one thing in her life that is truly beyond price, her husband!!! This story takes on a bit more serious issues than the previous books and it gives the book a strength that makes it stand bit apart from the rest.The \\"Shopaholic\\" series is entertaining and shines the light on consumerism in a humorous and yet still serious manner. Sophie Kinsella's books are beyond the \\"chick-lit\\" category, they are more than just entertaining!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sopholoic and Baby starts out with Becky discovering she is pregnant with her and Luke's first child. However, one of Luke's former girlfriends is the premier obstrecian in London right now (of course) and Becky wants her baby to be delivered by her. Soon Becky starts to believe that Luke and his former girlfriend are having an affair and that he no longer loves her.Of course the same things that have happened in the previous four novels occurs here. Becky and Luke have huge misunderstandings, Becky spends too much money on baby things, Becky is being self-absored. The book had the worst ending ever with Luke somehow losing his company and Becky having made millions of dollars through some hare brained scheme.I struggled to finish this novel and ended up donating it to my local library."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"In this latest installment of Sophie Kinsella's \\"Shopaholic\\" series, Becky Brandon was pregnant with her first child with Luke Brandon, and she now worked for \\"The Look\\" an unpopular clothing store in London. As in her previous series, Becky became obsessed with shopping and this time she concentrated on buying items for her baby - prams, clothes, toys, and etc. Becky also started seeing Venetia Carter, a Hollywood A-list gynecologist who was known for her holistic approach to giving birth and who apparently gave out goodie bags to her clients. Unfortunately, Venetia also happened to be Luke's ex-girlfriend back when they were studying at Cambridge. Becky began to feel insecure as she felt that Venetia was out to get her husband. As usual, Becky relied on her best friend Suze for moral support.I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and have been waiting for the next installment of her \\"Shopaholic\\" series. As the previous book \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" was a letdown, this was an improvement for me and it was quite fun to read. The characters were fun to read, the writing was clear and the plot was interesting and engaging. The only drawback for me is that I wish the author would make Becky seem more intelligent. In this book, there were letters written from Becky's financial specialist to her and there were references that Becky made in terms of investment which made her sound rather unintelligent. For instance, Becky had apparently told the guy that she wanted to make investment in the coffee business (or something of that sort) to get free coffee. Or that Becky wanted to start an online bank. Let's not forget that Becky used to be a financial journalist and even though she did not make sound judgements in terms of money managemet, she was still rather smart. As the book progressed, the letters became more ridiculous. In any case, this was still a great read for me and having follow Becky's development from the very first book, I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I had been waiting for the next Shopaholic book for ages and when the day finally came for it to be released, I rushed out to buy it and read it in a day.Overall, the book was another winner from Sophie Kinsella. I have been hooked on Becky Bloomwood's antics since the beginning and I'm still hooked. There was some great moments in the novel that I got a little giggle from. Although I loved it, the situation with the second OB that Becky got was a bit predictable and something that Sophie Kinsella has done with Becky before. But apart from that, the book was quite enjoyable and I always love reading what shopping trouble Becky gets into. The best part by far was the ending when Becky had the baby. I won't say what gender the child is and what happens but I think it's the sweetest part of the whole Shopaholic series.I really did not want the book to end-it was that good to me. I kind of got the feeling that this book could be the end to the Shopaholic series-at least for awhile. But Sophie Kinsella is such a great writer that I can't wait to read whatever she comes up with next."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"As with all of the other Shopaholic books and the book written by this same author under the name Madeline Wickham, this was very true to the series. The same character, same old friends, and another new adventure for Becky Bloomwood/Brandon. I read this in a matter of hours after picking it up last night. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love love love love love Becky Bloomwood Brandon. She is funny, stylish, whimsical, outrageous, caring, outgoing, and so many other things all in one little person. I have loved every single Shopaholic book, except this one. It was a decent book, but by comparison, I thought it was a little dull and flat. I also felt like Becky looked very foolish for the majority of the book and that Luke almost belittled her. I know they are supposed to be flawed characters, but it felt like a departure from who they had been in the previous books.

I loved the first book, Confessions of a Shopaholic and immediately jumped into Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, which is still my favorite of the series. It's filled with humorous situations, however it takes a real look on the consequences of impulsive shopping. I read books 3 and 4, but when Shopaholic & Baby was released, I started it and then put it down.Fast forward to 2009. It's two years later and I've finally picked this up again to read. I decided to listen to the audio book and the narrator, Rosalyn Landor, did a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life. Becky and her husband, Luke, are expecting their first child. Always wanting to have the latest \\"in\\" thing, Becky convinces Luke they must have Dr. Venetia Carter as their OB-GYN as she is also the physician to the celebrities. During their initial visit, Becky learns that Dr. Carter and Luke are former school mates and previously dated! Becky is stunned by the news and gradually begins to feel insecure about herself and her marriage.True to the series, Ms. Kinsella fills the pages with humor as we read about the predicaments Becky finds herself in. Having doubts about her marriage, Becky hires a private detective, only what he discovers is not what she asked for. Becky learns that things are not always what they seem.So is it a girl or boy? I guess you'll have to read Shopaholic & Baby to find out!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"brilliant, just brilliant, i laughed all the way through. Becky gets funnier every book, she is written so well, she is a real person, i feel if i met her i would want Becky to be my best friend. The way her mind wanders to the most crazy conclusions about Luke and his college sweetheart, and her logic for buying things she will never need or use never gets old, and i sometimes read about a situation and say 'i would probably do the same thing.' From beginning to end just a laugh out riot, my favorite part is when she walks into the doctors appointment wearing heals and the jewelry and the big bag, something i would do, and then get yelled at by the doctor for it. The ending was very sweet, and as usual an extremely unexpected one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"By the way, this is really \\"Shopaholic and Fetus\\" as it is mainly about Becky's prenatal state, as she visits a celebrity OB-GYN who turns out to be her husband's college girlfriend. Venetia is a doctor who dresses fabulously. Becky is working for a failing department store. Luke might be having an affair with Venetia while Becky is big and pregnant. WHO is the better woman for Luke to pick????And there is the annoying part -- who should Luke scorn in favor of whom (I always root for the wife, by the way.) But here it is supposed to be about who has what and do men like that? and it is just depressing. Plus Becky and her friends are really babyish about how they deal with it (maybe that's where the title comes from.) They even design a T-shirt putting Venetia down. It's high school for thirty-somethings!Jess, Becky's long-lost half-sister, has a subplot in this book. She is vastly different from Becky as well but they have a nice and decent relationship. She rocks and I hope the next book features a bit more of her."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I am not the type of person to not finish a book, but I couldn't force myself to read all of this. I have read the other books in this series. I liked the first one. It was kind of original and somewhat relatable. But now, the main character, Becky Bloomwood, is just annoying and irresponsible. The foreign bank accounts, credit cards, etc. are just ridiculous. Her husband has become a joke. What man, of any means, would put up with this amount of lying and trickery. I realize that there are people out there who have shopping disorders such as this, but it's an addiction. I think that the next book should be Shopaholic and Therapist."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I guess everyone found this book funny except me. Just as in the previous 2 in the series, I wanted to punch Becky for being such a stupid, selfish cow rather than cheer for her. I bought the book b/c of the good reviews here. I have read the original Shopaholic at least 5 times and adored it for its humor and page turning laughs. 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan' continued the storyline nicely...but the laughs end when it's the same recycled plot and the protagonist never--ever--grows up. It's not \\"cute\\" that a woman in her *late 20's* (does anyone else realize this?) still giggles, LIES, and shops her way out of everyday situations. Where I used to love Becky, I now loathe her. Between the last 2 books I wonder why Luke would stay married to such a braindead bimbo. Yes, these books are an escape from reality, but there's also something called an insult to a reader's intelligence, and this series has definitely crossed that line."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Although she is witty and sometimes funny, I found it hard to care about what happened to Becky Bloomwood. Her irresponsibility really bothered me and Luke didn't seem like that much of a catch. I like happy ending stories but was still disappointed in the overall story in the end. I most likely will not read any more of the series. The only thing I found amusing were her analogies of shopping/fashion to everything else in life."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I've been a big Kinsella fan ever since I read her Undomestic Goddess book, followed by the Shopaholic series (yes, I read every single one of them!) I HAD looked forward to this one...and what a disappointment it was! Kinsella had a lot of material to work with...there's dearth of material to write about having a baby! But instead, Kinsella made Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) so STUPID! This is the first Kinsella book I bought that I cannot finish. This book was absolutely AWFUL! (Did anyone read her draft before publishing it?) I may never read any of Kinsella's books again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"In my opinion, this is not the best Kinsella's work, even though it has enough funny moments to keep you entertained. And it's not even because Becky didn't \\"grow up\\", as some other reviewers suggested. In the real life, women understand what had happened to them only after the baby is born, and so many of us just love to be not practical when it comes down to \\"baby stuff\\". So, I wasn't bothered by the fact that Becky continues to behave as if she is still 14 years old (that's certainly part of the charm, and one of the reasons for me to read these series).It's simply that in \\"Shopaholic & baby\\" the humor of most situations wears down, the plot follows the main line of the previous books, with the variation of Luke's ex-girlfriend coming to the scene... and some of these \\"funny\\" situations actually made me cringe because of their absurdity.In addition, I began to be annoyed by the fact that Luke is so absolutely perfect and understanding. Sophie Kinsella attempted to make him less perfect with all this \\"affair\\" story, but somehow it did not work for me - any normal guy that I know would immediately see the difference between friendship and flirt... and probably be more than a little upset about his wife's 16 offshore overdrafts!I was able to re-read the first books in the series, when I needed to relax and rewind, but not this one. I suggest borrowing the book from the library and waiting for the next installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"After the boring \\"Sister\\" chapter of this series, I was hoping that Becky would get back to shopping like the maniac we all know and love! Alas, it was not meant to be. Instead she focuses too much attention on the \\"other\\" woman in this story and it fizzles out. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I came away feeling very disappointed."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"By now, Becky is well known to anyone who has read the series. This book isn't any different than the others--but it's a great, easy weekend read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Newlywed Rebecca Brandon is four months pregnant and on top of the world. She and her husband Luke have made it through their troubles and now they're going to be parents. Becky is buying up all of London, getting fun baby things and not bothering with the mundane. Her obstetrician is the same doctor who delivered Luke, until one day she hears about must-have celebrity doctor Venetia Carter, who has paparazzi outside her office waiting for models and movie stars to appear. It seems like a wonderful dream come true when Becky gets an appointment with Dr. Carter, except the \\"red, swishy-haired\\" doctor is Luke's ex-girlfriend from college. Becky is assured nothing is going on, but why is Luke suddenly acting so secretive and strange, and why does the lovely Dr. Carter seem so evil and manipulative?Instead of dealing with the situation head-on, Becky employs a whole bunch of underhanded methods that come close to backfiring but, of course, everything comes up roses. Though I felt the occasional twinge of impatience with Becky for her slanted priorities, when push comes to shove, Becky shows she really does have a heart of gold under her out-of-control consumerism.Along for the ride is the familiar supporting cast: Luke, hero extraordinaire, who has a shadow of tarnish on his armor this time, but shows his true colors in a way that made me laugh out loud; Suze, the perfect best friend who's filthy rich yet raises her three children herself and cooks for her family, all while managing to be there for her best friend; Becky's unflappable parents who are always there in a pinch; and Becky's frugal sister Jess, who's passionate about saving the planet, yet somehow shares a bond with her seemingly shallow sister. A host of other small characters colorfully fills out the story that unfolds while Becky's life seems to unravel while her due date approaches.Though Becky's priorities often seem pretty shallow for a woman approaching motherhood, and though I didn't agree with her willingness to forgive Luke so easily, in the end, everyone behaved in a way befitting the characters we've come to know and love, and I laughed out loud a lot. Once again, Sophie Kinsella has delivered a delightful Shopaholic book, and I hope she'll do it again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I could have done without the explanations of things that had happened in previous books. All that rehashing was like speed bumps and I don't think that it was necessary. When writing a series the author should either assume that the reader has read the previous books or hope that they'll be curious enough to want to go back and read them.It does loyal readers of the series a disservice to subject them to those kinds of interruptions."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I believe this to be Sophie Kinsella's best book yet! I laughed outloud and I couldnt put the book down (and when I did I was thinking about it!) It was so heartwarming and I just absolutly love the character Becky. Im not sure if there are more \\"Becky adventures\\" to come but I hope so, if not...what a wonderful, wonderful ending."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The fifth installment (and hopefully not the last) in the Shopaholic series follows Becky Bloomwood Brandon during her pregnancy. She decides she needs to have \\"the\\" celebrity obstetrician see her, Venetia Carter--who just so happens to be Luke's ex girlfriend from college. And it becomes very clear early on that predatory Venetia is after Becky's husband, Luke.Becky is at her wittiest in this novel. Though her shopping sprees aren't as manic as they have been in the past, they're definitely funny when they do happen. And the story about running into Venetia Carter is well-drawn. If I'd been in Becky's place, I would have raked my fingernails across Venetia Carter's face for saying some of the things she said and doing some of the things she did! At the end of the day, it's all about friends and family, of which Becky has in abundance. A very funny, highly recommended novel."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic Books and this one by far is the best! Shopaholic, Becky Brandon, is at her shopping sprees again, only this time she's not shopping for herself. Becky is pregnant and puts her mind off morning sickness by shopping; thinks the baby needs five prams, and wants extremely special treatment for when she goes into labor. With all the new products to buy for the upcoming baby, such as prams, clothes, cribs, and bedding (etc.), Becky is overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions. She also needs to find just the right Dr to deliver her baby. On top of this she needs to find a new house because they sold there old one. The store she works at (The Look) is doing horrible in business. She even needs to find out if her husband is really having an affair with their Dr., even though he claims he's not. To put the icing on the cake, she's pregnant! With all this on her mind Becky gets very stressed and even finds it hard to shop. This is hard to believe being that she LOVES to shop, but even through all this she still manages to go out of control once again with her baby shopping. Becky thinks that her new bundle of joy needs almost everything that money can buy. I really enjoyed this book because I liked what Becky went through and how she dealt with her problems. Becky's sense of humor made this book really entertaining and was one of the reasons why I couldn't put this book down! I definitely recommend this book, and if you haven't read the other Shopaholic books, then you should because those are must-reads too!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon leads a full life of chaos and love. She is house hunting with her husband, Luke and is trying to help a new store, The Look get off the ground, all in the space of a few months before her baby is born. Her life is chaos, they are about to be homeless just before her baby is born if she does not find a new house. The store is a bust; she is looking for just the right marketing scheme to throw it into success. Add into all of that her pregnancy and you have one overworked, stressed out woman.While planning for her new arrival she goes overboard in the buying department finding it hard to choose just the right \\"things\\" for her new bundle of joy. Her life of stress makes it hard to shop, yet she keeps finding new things she just has to have, from the buggy to the ob/gyn, she wants the best for her child.SHOPAHOLIC & BABY is the newest edition to Sophie Kinsella's Bestselling series. The books is part of a series, yet can be read as a stand alone novel, while not the first SHOPAHOLIC book this reviewer read, she has not read them in order.This reviewer heard lots of great things about this series, with a few negative thrown in, and cannot disagree with any of them! Becky Brandon is an eccentric character filled with humor and love. She left this reader laughing out loud, shaking her head, and sighing all in the space of a few hundred pages. The downside to this novel is the lack of true emotion. This reader related to the stress and emotional chaos in the character's lives, yet couldn't seem find the deep down drama that should have been felt.This is not to say this reviewer would not highly recommend this novel to readers of Chick Lit and humor, it is light hearted and easily devoured. I would read another from this series, and will be looking for the next novel to be released. Sophie Kinsella is a talented author who has managed to create a cast of characters that continue to grow and change, leaving readers light hearted and laughing each time.Review Courtesy of LoveRomancesandmore :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic Books and this one by far is the best!

Fast, easy, and enjoyable read. Once again Becky Bloomwood finds herself in a dilema...are you surprised? Probably one of the best dressed babies and mom's to be...only this time there are some interesting twists and tests of relationships and perhaps some re-thinking on material things on Becky's part.

She shouldn't be treated this way and she shouldn't be second guessing herself. Hopefully this will be the last of these books.

However, it is still a quick, easy, and mindless read that was worthwhile for me. I love the quirky language and style of Sophie Kinsella's writing. She of course stuck to that type of writing, but I think the plot is not nearly as developed as the prior books in the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Since I am pregnant and I have to take a lot of bed rest, I was hoping to read something fun. I forgot to read any of the reviews before I bought Shopaholic and Baby.I like shopping and playfulness but I also like adults communicating as grown-ups with their partners. I like to read about honest relationships and I guess, the \\"games people play\\" bore me.The main character, Becky was super selfish and immature. And everyone else played along with her shallowness. It made her adventures sad, not fun nor funny.I would not recommend this for readers, who would like a bit of cheering up."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love all the shopaholic books and this one didn't dissapoint.

Becky Bloomwood Brandon is one of the most delightful airheads in the bookstore. I've read some (but not all) of the other books in the Shopaholic series and enjoyed them. This is the first one I've listened to on audiobook and I enjoyed it almost as much as reading. Becky is still laugh out loud funny.Admittedly, Becky's laxity with the truth and her idiotic scrapes with stupidity have gotten a little tiresome. But the snappy dialog and completely fun situations are worth the bother.I won't spoil the ending but it was totally satisfying.Definitely not great literature but for fun fiction it's a winner!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This was a great book to the series. I enjoy the shenanigans that Becky gets herself into. It wasn't the best of books but it was a fun read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Like all of her books, I loved this one as well. It was very entertaining and can't wait to read Mini Shopaholic."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This was very cute - a nice finish to this fun series. It wasn't my favorite of the five, but it wasn't the worst either - strangely, I think it is the first one that I liked the least.

I will keep an eye out to see if Kinsella continues this charming series any further!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love the Shopaholic books, but everyone I have read so far I get very annoyed with Becky and her crazy ways. But not this time, not with this book. I could not put it down! Becky is becoming such a great character I just loved this book and just hope that there are more Shopaholics to come. This book throws a lot of curve balls but it is a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book was easy to read, funny and just very cute. I definitely recommend this book/series to the ladies who want a good laugh and to forget about everything else. Enjoy! I know I sure did. I loved the whole series of books and definitely think the books are much better than the movie. I was so addicted especially towards the end of the book... that's all I will say to not ruin the book for anyone."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I bought \\"Confessions of A Shopaholic\\" years ago - it was absolutely hilarious! I've turned so many friends and family on to that book. Most recently, my mother. She has read Confessions..., ...Takes Manhattan, ...& Sister, and now she's working on Shopaholic & Baby. She began reading the books in February 2009, and she's nearly through the entire series! She absolutely loves it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I could really relate to so many parts of this story. It's SO believable. When the techician leaves the room after saying Becky is not allowed to know the sex of the baby. Becky grabs the ultrasound prob and is madly moving it around on top of her stomach to find out the sex and the technician walks back in. I laughed and laughed. She is eccentric and lovable. Her poor husband has to juggle heavy business problems at his work and HER needs at home with the pregnancy.Becky is the charmingly air-headed shopping fanatic. From her obsession with shopping in all the chic baby boutiques, to ordering online and from the glossy upper market cataloguesWhen Becky learns about the gynecologist to the stars, she HAS to switch doctors and finds a way to get on the waiting list for this very exclusive doctor. Unfortunately, she finds out too late that Luke her husband actually knows her new gynecologist. In fact, Luke and Venetia used to date in college and she seems to still carry a torch for him. Will Becky trust Luke when he is seen out with the doctor over lunch?Becky tries to be calm and not suspect anything but her mind goes crazy and its war, he is HER husband.From her first ultrasound to the most hysterical delivery ever. Don't miss this one! So funny!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This CD is fun to listen to in the car. I love all the Shopaholic books, CDs, you name it. In this CD, our heroine Becky has a new baby and a new job as a personal shopper at a new department store. Unfortunately, the store is failing--but Becky manages to turn it around. Becky is losing the battle of her shopping addiction. She uses her new baby as an excuse to buy the craziest, most impractical baby clothes and products. It is hilarious and I enjoy the Shopaholic series, like potato chips. I will listen to or read as many as Sophie Kinsella can write."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Rebecca gets into a lot of trouble like the other books but finds out shes going to a good mother."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Bloomwood is back... but was it worth it? I'm still pretty strong in my convictions that Ms. Kinsella should have stopped two books ago. This isn't to say that it's a weak book, it's just, like Meg Cabot has repeatedly said when asked if she'll continue Mediator/1-800, after everything eventful has happened, the convoluted situations can lead to nothing good. Kinsella has already taken the time (three books) to establish the strong bond between Becky and Luke--only to randomly (seemingly) break it in this one? Quite annoying, really. I felt like everyone's characters seemed to break a little bit, and the one relationship that I really did like the developments in, Jess and Tom, didn't really have a satisfying ending...or much of an ending or beginning at all. Will there be more books, then? It would seem like overkill, although I would personally love a spinoff focusing solely on Jess and Tom. I still did love how Kinsella wove all those stories together, eventually bringing them all back. Well done, and I was very glad to hear that Becky has a daughter--another future Shopaholic--we just couldn't have it any other way!Rating: 4/5"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Can Becky get any funnier? Why yes she can! There's a baby on the way and Becky is ready to shop! And of course get into the practice of a celebrity obstetrician! Imagine her dismay when the doctor turns out to be one of Luke's ex girlfriends! And she's after Becky's man! How in the world will Becky handle this one? And will she manage to get everything the baby needs in time? The fifth book is wonderful and you'll love it just as much as all of the others!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I can't believe this is the last one, I was disappointed to have been done with Becky and Luke! A great book though, but after reading the other 4 you would have to think it was coming. Extremely funny. Great book to read. Loved them all."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I remember the first time I read a Shopaholic novel. It was the first book in the series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, and I thought Becky Bloomwood and the constant trouble she got into for overspending were hilarious. (I loved the opening line, \\"OK. Don't panic. Don't *panic*. It's only a VISA bill. It's a piece of paper; a few numbers. I mean, just how scary can a few numbers be?\\" After all, who hasn't gone through THAT?) Five books later, I'm still having fun with Becky. The least likable book to me was Shopaholic and Sister, because I felt that Kinsella had run out of ideas and was churning out a filler novel just to continue to cash in on her successful series. In the meantime, I thought The Domestic Goddess and Can You Keep a Secret? were wonderful. (The books she wrote under the pen name Madeleine Wickham aren't bad either.) I'd had Shopaholic and Baby on my TBR pile for a VERY long time, since it was released in hardcover last year. Now I wonder what took me so long to give it a whirl. Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is back, and now she and Luke are having a baby. Which, of course, means new shopping possibilities. Imagine all the baby stuff she could get! Plus, she and Luke would need a bigger house now, and she's heard of this celebrity obstetrician that she simply must receive care from! Be careful what you wish for, Becky, because the glamorous Venetia Carter, OB-GYN to the stars, could well put her (somewhat) ordered life and marriage in jeopardy...I really loved reading this book. Sophie Kinsella has one of the sassiest voices in chick-lit I have read. (I can't help but wonder if she'd write a Young Adult novel one day. I think she'd be brilliant at it. Perhaps a prequel -- Rebecca Bloomwood, teen fashionista-slash-shopaholic?) Becky's shopping expeditions and Luke's reaction to them are hilarious, of course, but the story is riveting because it focuses more on her relationship with Luke. I had always wondered why Luke loved Becky, someone so different from him, and now I know why. This installment has more depth than the previous books because Luke is more fleshed-out; he's not just the rich, handsome boyfriend-turned-husband who has no time to notice in this one. The thing with Venetia, while unoriginal, adds some spice into the storyline. And I enjoyed revisiting Becky's friends Suze, Tom and her sister Jess. The one thing that has always irked me about Becky (besides her tendency to be annoying) and Luke is that they keep secrets from one another -- hence the big misunderstanding in this novel. Then again, without it there would be no conflict, and in turn no story. Anyway, I enjoyed Shopaholic and Baby. I don't know if this is the conclusion to the Shopaholic series, but it should be. I mean, what's next? Shopaholic and a Toddler? Shopaholic and a Pre-Teen? Shopaholic and Menopause? Well, you get the picture. I recommend this novel and I can't wait to read Remember Me?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book...I thought it was her best book yet! it kept me smiling and laughing throughout the whole book!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella is often regarded as a fluff writer. I've watched people upturn their nose claiming her novels are \\"unintelligent mindless fluff\\" and that Becky Bloomwood is a \\"ditsy Paris Hilton.\\" I think Kinsella took these criticisms and channeled them into a character that represents this British academic snobbery. What is overlooked when dismissing this book as a genre stereotype is that Kinsella utilizes some literary techniques that deepen this book for those who care to look beyond the pink cover.One of the strongest characters in this book is the fabulous female villain, \\"Cruella de Venetia.\\" Kinsella is one of FEW contemporary writers who captures the b*tch personality so vividly. I was thrilled to see that she'd created a WOMAN as the antagonist, and a BAD WOMAN! Female villains are so far and few in post feminist novels that simply this made it worth reading. Where is the B*tch Lit? I want more!Secondly, the narrative voice is so effectively comic that when reading this book on the train, I laughed out, spurring funny looks from passengers. I couldn't help myself. The narrator is friendly and you care about her right away. She gets into silly blunders, but cleverly finds ways out. It is the classic \\"get your protagonist in a sticky situation, then how do you get her out?\\"Another interesting but not innovative aspect of the book is the depiction of mother roles in current society. In a scene where Becky goes pram shopping, we discover that the mommy subculture has become in a comic way, horrifically trendy! Kinsella addresses issues like what makes a good mother through characters who show us the multiple dimensions of \\"mommy personalities\\" (I need to be general as I do not want to spoil anything).The plot is tight and successful. The end is climactic and satisfying. I put the book down feeling happy and content. I believe Kinsella is growing as a writer, and the structure and characters in this latest novel are evidence of this.I did take off one star because of the language. I am an adverb loather, and I found that the overuse of adjectives pulled me out of the story. If Kinsella's editors could clip a few of these away, I would be a five star book. In addition, I want to note that this is in no way a lyrical or poetic verse. I am not comparing Shopaholic to Booker Prize books. As a chick lit pop culture book, not literary fiction, it's my favorite of the lot!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Shopping, what a cure for morning sickness. What a concept? But what more could you expect from the Shopaholic herself? And having a new baby, what an excuse for more shopping. There's all those neat things to buy, a pram and cute clothes. Let alone a few thousand diapers.This fifth book in the series continues the light hearted adventures of Becky Bloomwood as she faces all kinds of problems, some real, some imaginary. Characteristically these problems are not the big huge problems facine all of humanity like the AIDS crisis. But what do you do when the new hottest doctor in town is an ex-girlfriend of your husband.If you're not already a Sophie Kinsella fan, this is as good a place to start as any.Great literature, absolutely not. A good read, absolutely. And today is snowy, blustery, not nice at all outside. And if you're a guy, you can take the dust jacket off and pretend you're not reading Chick Lit.Enough review, I think I'll go shopping."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I loved this book. I have read all of the others in the series and this one did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"At the recommendation of a friend, I started reading the Shopaholic series last summer. Becky Bloomwood wormed her way into my heart, Denny & George scarf and all. Now we're 5 books in, and quite frankly, I don't find her all that endearing anymore. Her eccentric quirks and her apparent lack of common sense become increasingly frustrating throughout this book. I spent the majority of my time skimming through the pages, wishing that somehow, some way, Becky would not only learn the value of a dollar (it must be nice to have a rich husband to bail you out every time you screw up! And I've never heard of banks permitting overdrafts of $3000 - mine starts charging insane fees if you go even a penny in the red!), but to learn from her mistakes, which she is apparently incapable of doing.I don't know that I will be continuing on with this series, which is sad. I'd love to see Becky embrace her Shopaholic nature, while at the same time, being a smart shopper. It can be done."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Even since I picked up \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" when I was fifteen, Sophie Kinsella has been the author I turned to for escapist reading. Her heroine Becky Bloomwood (now Brandon) was so much fun to read about with her constant shopping and worries and obsession over stupid things. But this book is different.You see, in this book Becky isn't obsessing over some stupid little thing and making a mountain out of a molehill. The crisis in \\"Shopaholic and Baby\\" is that Becky's must-see celebrity OBGYN, Venetia Carter is Luke's ex-girlfriend, and she believes that Luke might be cheating on her with the doctor. And she has good reasons to think so. Any woman in her position would think so. Because she's having these worries, this total justified panic about secret phone texts in Latin and Luke not being where he says he is when he goes out alone, when she's very pregnant, it's not funny, it's sad and miserable. You can really feel Becky's pain and panic about Luke's possible infidelity and unlike the other books, where she would worry about her wedding or something, it's not funny. I felt so sorry for Becky going through all that when she was so pregnant.I'm not saying there aren't funny parts in this book-there are. There's the typical Shopaholic moments with Becky getting somehow publicly humiliated because of a little white lie she told while shopping, some really cute moments with Luke (especially when picking out a pram) and the normal Becky personality. But overall this book is more serious than the last four, not just because of the baby, but because of the possible affair. Some parts are a little repetitive and I have to admit that what Venetia does to Becky just doesn't make a lot of sense. But the book is still every bit as appealing as its predecessors and a total delight to read. Recommended.Four stars."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I had the misfortune of buying this book before a long flight to Europe. Due to a lack of alternative entertainment, I read the book from cover to cover. While the book had some funny excerpts, my extreme dislike for the main character (Becky Brandon) overshadowed any enjoyment garnered from the book.Rather than being lovable, I found Becky to be irresponsible, annoying and pretentious. For example, after Becky's husband explains that his company is \\"hemorrhaging money\\" and asks her to reign in her spending, Becky responds by hiding her purchases from him. How very responsible of her, indeed.Of course, I realize the book is of the chick lit genre, but it would have been nice to have a modicum of reality intermixed with the fiction.To me, Becky represents the irresponsible consumerism that has resulted in the current credit crisis, and frankly, I don't find anything laughable about that. Kinsella appears to have mailed in this book, and it's evident that she exercised the same level of brain power as possessed by her heroine in thinking through the plot."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book is number five in the Shopaholic series. It's about a woman named Becky Bloomworth who has a serious addiction to shopping, and the wacky situations she gets herself into as a result. I loved the first two books of the series, Confessions of a Shopaholic, Shopaholic Takes Manhattan and Shopaholic Ties the Knot. Loved them. TThey were side splittingly funny, fast paced, and had some sly satire in them, if you wanted to see it. Book four, despite a few strong points, wasn't up to the quality of the first three, so I was a bit leery when a friend gave me Shopaholic and Baby. Despite that, I dove in this past weekend.In the end I fell back in love with the character of Becky Bloomworth Brandon. Yes, she's a ditz. Yes, she's shallow, insecure, frivolous, overdramatic, and, well, immature. But she genuinely has a caring side, and she's not a bad person. There's something madcap about her; I kept thinking of a modern day I Love Lucy type as I read the book. For a while, I wasn't quite sure I liked Becky's husband Luke - or at least I didn't buy them together. But this book truly shows that they 'get' each other and they're good for each other, in that they balance one another out.The plot of the book is almost beside the point... the real focus here is Kinsella's little jabs at modern culture, and the way the characters relate to each other. One of my favorite scenes in the book is when Becky takes her mom and her mom's friend with her to a prenatal class. The instructor is babbling all this New Age mumbo jumbo about labour not being painful, and she asks Becky's mom for her input. Needless to say, she doesn't like the answer she gets. It's hilarious. All the characters in this book 'fit' in a way that wasn't true of Shopaholic and Sister. Even Jess, the aforementioned sister, who many have wished was not invented, became more likeable in this book. And for those who have not read the other books in the series, Kinsella does a good job of recapping key points without getting bogged down with too much detail.Now, the book is not perfect, of course. The villain, an ex-girlfriend of Luke's who wants him back (she's also Becky's obstetrician... Becky doesn't know about the doctor's connection to Luke when she makes the appointment, of course - she just wants to go to the new 'in' Doctor to the Stars') is a paper thin character. More could have been done here to create a legitimate triangle.The 'big secret' Luke is really keeping is pretty obvious. There were not as many laugh out loud funny moments in this book as in the first three of the series, and yet when Kinsella tries to have more 'serious' moments, they don't quite work as well as they should.All in all, though, the things about that book that weren't great didnt' keep me from enjoying it. This novel is one you want to take with you to the beach or read on a rainy day. It's not taxing - it's a just a fun little quick adventure to help you while away an afternoon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"In SHOPAHOLIC & BABY, Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is preggers and shopping for two, a fact that should inspire merchants to giddy anticipation and give worried pause to husband Luke, who fields the bill. As in all previous Shopaholic novels, Becky is compelled to spend money on mountains of Stuff, often in multiple copies.Early on, Bex deserts the care of the established, distinguished Dr. Braine, who delivered Luke, for Dr. Venetia Carter, who, after all, is the A-list obstetrician to the rich and famous that gives out fab goodie bags at the first office consultation. Venetia is drop-dead gorgeous with long, swishy, red hair. And, on Becky's initial appointment with her new health care provider accompanied by Luke, she learns that her husband and Carter were a dating pair back in their Cambridge days. Even Luke, reluctant to give up Braine, is pleasantly surprised at renewing an old acquaintance with the woman he remembers as Venetia Grime. Then, as the weeks of her pregnancy progress and she loses her figure, Becky begins to wonder if Luke and Venetia aren't being just a little too chummy. Why are they seeing each other so frequently, ostensibly in the company of mutual friends, and why are they texting each other in Latin?In addition to her spendthrift ways, Becky's charm (and exasperation) for any follower of the series is her rampant imagination, which here, in conjuring up images of Luke and Venetia together, leads to desperate measures. What's a poor girl to do? Why, hire a private detective, of course, and then go shopping for prams. (Who else but Bex would consider purchasing five strollers for an imagined range of activities from pavement walking to extreme mountaineering?) After all, there's no situation so distressing that it can't be ameliorated by a new Hermes scarf or being featured in a Vogue photo shoot for an article on London's yummiest mummies-to-be.The Shopaholic series is so Chick Lit that I'm ashamed to admit that I enjoy the fluff more than is seemly for any self-respecting male. SHOPAHOLIC & BABY doesn't disappoint, though Venetia, in the end, isn't perhaps as publicly humiliated as she deserves. Maybe this is due to the fact that author Sophie Kinsella is basically as good-hearted as her heroine and wouldn't intentionally do anything too cruel. Sophie, in order to depict Becky's character as comprehensively as she does, must either know someone with Becky's proclivities or herself be just like Bex. The prospect of someone like that roaming the streets in real life is mind-boggling scary."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"the book was in wonderful condition when shipped and came before i expected! no complaints!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I am a huge fan of all the Shopaholic books. Sophie Kinsella is a wonderful author and a delight to read. Having said that, I was not thrilled with her choice of featuring a female obstetrician who should be thrown out of the medical profession! I loved the ending of the book, and it definitely had its funny moments. But putting Becky through such an agonizing time while she was pregnant... hmmm. Slightly controversial. I think Luke and Becky have an appalling lack of communication in their marriage. By now, the reader would expect Becky to have grown a little more outspoken than she is. I cannot believe that Luke got away with the behavior that he did. On the \\"up side\\", however, it did all end happily and one can only look forward to the next Shopaholic book, now that Becky has got herself a new little partner in crime!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Bloomwood strikes again in this cute chick lit comedy.

I have never in my life tried to read such a dreadful, plotless piece of tripe before. I slightly enjoyed Can You Keep a Secret? and was looking for another light read. This was so light it floated away on a sea of disgust. The book is 99% dialogue, i.e. there is no plot. The main character is heinously insipid.

However, I caved with the Shophalic and Baby one! Big mistake.Although our little Beck was cute in the first two books,now she has become a tired, cliched, boring character. Although she appears to be doing all the right things, the author has not made the character grow emotionally or in maturity at all and the result ends up being a storyline in which an immature, silly, self-centered woman ends up getting pregnant!One would think the storyline would turn towards the baby, but no, this baby ends up simply being a reason for our Beck to make life even more about her than she use to (if that's possible). The author simply used the baby as a writing ploy to bring out yet more irritating and annoying trait in our main character.Baby's health? who cares? as long as it has all the right accessories - and true to form absolutely everyone in the book continues to think Becky is just so darn cute and continues to humour her self-centered, immature ways.I will NOT be bying anymore books in this series. I think its just time to retire Beccy and her whole gang of enablers."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I was very disappointed to wait ten days to receive this book.

The suspense doesn't stop her from shopping 'til she drops for everything from designer prams to a Circus Tent Changing Station and 400-thread-count linen sheets for the baby. Her biggest purchase by far is a new dream house in a posh London suburb, complete with a customized shoe cupboard for herself, his and hers nurseries and a built-in electric sushi maker. Becky negotiates with her Archie Swann cowboy boots in calfskin with the leather drawstring to seal the deal. The defining factor: the boots were featured in Vogue under \\"Most Coveted.\\" What man wouldn't make that kind of deal? Becky's rationality for outrageous purchases is laugh-out-loud funny and endears you to indulge a first-time mother.Sophie Kinsella, the New York Times bestselling author of the Shopaholic series, has written a designer pregnancy manual for a new generation of moms-to-be. Those who have had children will be jealous of Becky's designer wardrobe, as well as hospitals with double beds and wine lists. Only our pampered shopaholic would think to hire an aromatherapist, a reflexologist and a homeopath for the birth of her baby. Best of all, Becky would \\"make it OK for pregnant women to have cocktails. In fact, I'd make it healthy to have cocktails. And your arms wouldn't swell up. And there wouldn't be any morning sickness. And labor wouldn't exist...\\" This is why fantasy is so appealing....Becky's pregnancy sails along smoothly due to her new mantra: \\"shopping cures morning sickness.\\" Her cravings appropriately include \\"a pineapple and pink cardigan.\\" Best friend Suze is always there to shop with her and offer these encouraging words: \\"...you'll be the best dressed one (mom) in the playground.\\" Becky's mother tells it like it is: \\"They have better drugs these days. My advice is take everything they've got.\\" Suze and Becky realize together that you can have the same lust in your eyes for a new pushchair as for a new dress. Pregnancy is really just another excuse to shop for a new wardrobe and baby clothes and nursery items.Becky's fantasy pregnancy continues as she is the featured mommy-to-be in a Vogue photo shoot --- in an Oscar de la Renta maternity dress. Every woman should experience the luxury of having a makeup artist and a hairdresser transform you into a goddess during the eighth month of pregnancy. There's nothing like a team of experts to enhance that so-called \\"glow\\" that accompanies it.The most unnerving event of Becky's pregnancy is the fact that her celebrity must-have obstetrician, Venetia Carter, turns out to be the ex-girlfriend of her handsome, \\"squillionaire\\" rich PR husband. Suddenly, celebrity tea parties and water birth with lotus flowers pale as Becky realizes that Venetia is making a play for him. Like most men, Luke doesn't see through the lies that the jealous Venetia has told to Becky until it is nearly too late. Venetia is no match for Becky's hormones and love for her husband.\\"Some things are best left a blur. Births and Visa bills.\\" No truer statement has ever been written. Becky makes pregnancy a shopping experience like no other. For a woman who doesn't know any nursery rhymes or how to change a nappy, she sure figures out quickly that the best use for a stroller is carrying mountains of purchases instead of a baby.You will laugh and cry with Becky and Luke as they prepare for the new arrival. Their visit to Pram City is a warm repartee between a loving couple expecting their first child. Ugly surgical stockings to prevent varicose veins are not fashionable and reduce Becky to tears. Becky is a visionary when it comes to finances. Her selections are unique and her desire for a designer future for her unborn baby are the bulk of her portfolio. Baby number one is a willing shopaholic devotee. Prams have one key benefit --- they allow shopaholics to maintain their habit after the baby arrives. Shopaholics have more fun!--- Reviewed by Hillary Wagy"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The only agreement I have with the previous reviewer is that yes, there are many of the same situations in Baby as in the previous Shopaholic books. Still this book continues the series well and as usual is side-splittingly funny in parts. Becky is so shallow it's appalling but again, that's alot of what makes her so funny. Baby is a good continuation of the series and there are lots of ways Kinsella can now take the series in the future. This is a very cute series and very fun reads."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"The heroine of these books, Becky, frustrates the heck out of me, but is also lovable and adorable and everything squishy and good. This book carries on the Shopaholic series that started in 2000 and Becky still hasn't managed to conquer her shopping habits, but this time it's for her new baby. Of COURSE she needs 8 prams! Who wouldn't!?Read it in 2 days, laughed a lot - great chick lit!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This is another in a great series of stories that are perfect for mindless entertainment.

If your looking for a fun, quick read, Sophia Kinsella delivers everytime. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic Books and this one by far is the best! Shopaholic, Becky Brandon, is at her shopping sprees again, only this time she's not shopping for herself. Becky is pregnant and puts her mind off morning sickness by shopping; thinks the baby needs five prams, and wants extremely special treatment for when she goes into labor. With all the new products to buy for the upcoming baby, such as prams, clothes, cribs, and bedding (etc.), Becky is overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions. She also needs to find just the right Dr to deliver her baby. On top of this she needs to find a new house because they sold there old one. The store she works at (The Look) is doing horrible in business. She even needs to find out if her husband is really having an affair with their Dr., even though he claims he's not. To put the icing on the cake, she's pregnant! With all this on her mind Becky gets very stressed and even finds it hard to shop. This is hard to believe being that she LOVES to shop, but even through all this she still manages to go out of control once again with her baby shopping. Becky thinks that her new bundle of joy needs almost everything that money can buy. I really enjoyed this book because I liked what Becky went through and how she dealt with her problems. Becky's sense of humor made this book really entertaining and was one of the reasons why I couldn't put this book down! I definitely recommend this book, and if you haven't read the other Shopaholic books, then you should because those are must-reads too!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I completely agree with most of the reviewers here. Shopaholic series is not your typical chic lit literature. In fact, I do not really read chic lit, but I devour Shopaholic books in a couple of sittings. They are all very relaxing, funny and enjoyable. Shopaholic and Baby was no exception. I loved the new Venetia Carter character and the funny ways Becky dealt with her. The book made me laugh outloud and shake my head in disbelief in some parts.

A must have, especially for anyone who has ever gone through the mania of being pregnant!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Well, typical Becky antics. She is still as shallow and immature as ever, but somehow, it didn't grate on my nerves as much as in \\"Shopaholic Ties The Knot\\". I love how Suze tried to explain the concept of nesting to Becky, and how differently it affects some women. In Becky's case, her extreme (early) shopping for Christmas signifies she is ready to give birth. Incredible. Becky's mental reactions to her gynecologist's suggestions to wear support hose and special orthopedic sandals as well as a fanny pack struck me funny also.But my favorite part is how it ended. Everything didn't get wrapped up nice and tidy like in past books. In fact, the future doesn't look as rosy as Becky would like it.I also thought the book was a few pages too long. The whole scene with Suzeand Becky at the market where Becky is pushing aroung a stroller full of baby stuff, and gets pushed to the front of the line to pay, sets off a security alert for a missing baby, was typical Becky, and added nothing to the book. This could have been left out and the outcome the book would have been the same.All in all, I think this is the best Shopaholic since \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\"."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I'm not going to get into the book but just wanted to write that I love all the Shopaholic books and this was by far, my favorite. When I read chick lit books I'm not expecting sudoku or political enlightenment and I'm sure most of you aren't either. It's a quick read because it's light and fun and you can escape everday life and live in Becky Bloomwood's little dreamworld for a while. ;) Perfect for the beach or a plane ride.

I was pleased to discover that \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" appears to have been a minor hiccup for Kinsella who once again returns to form with the fifth installment in the Shopoholic series. Our heroine, Becky, hasn't changed much since the first book found her living well beyond her means. Yes, she's married Luke Brandon, a handsome millionaire, but she still gets up to the same tricks. This novel finds Luke and Becky expecting their first child. As usual Luke is carefully providing for the child's future through well thought out investments in a trust fund. Becky on the other hand is considering naming the child after a favorite fasion designer (Hermes Brandon, Birkin Brandon, Dolce Brandon...) and investing in \\"antiques of the future\\" under the logic that \\"they'll be valuable someday\\". When she reads about a new celebrity obstatrician Becky simply must go (if this doctor is good enough for Kate Winslet she's good enough for Becky!) but she gets more than she bargined for when she learns that her new doc is Luke's glamorous ex-girlfriend who clearly wants him back. The normally observent Luke seems to be blind to the whole issue, so hormones flying and credit card waving, Becky sets out to save her marriage. Her tendency to jump to conclusions lands her in more than once sticky situation (the scene where she has Luke followed by a Private Eye is priceless) as do her impatience (she purchases a Baby Gender Predictor without reading the instuctions first) and her ability to stretch the truth fantastically (Becky's first Vogue spread). It's not great literature by any means but it'll make you chuckle more than once. And Becky and Luke have enough heart to win over a cynic or two."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the release of Shopaholic & Baby. I adored the first four books (well, maybe with the exception of Shopaholic & Sister which was just okay). I couldn't wait to read about Becky's adventures as a pregnant woman and new mother.I was not disappointed. It really is a page-turner, with all of Kinsella's fabulous humor and charm embodied into Becky. Towards the end, you realize that the same reasons Luke loves her are the same reasons we, the reader, love her.You really learn to love to hate Becky's \\"must-have celebrity obstetrician\\" Venetia Carter, as well as Lulu, Suze's friend.It's amazing the consistency of memories that pop up in this book from the others: Tom and his parents, the Denny & George scarf, Jess, Kelly, honeymoon trinkets...You will laugh, cry, and seethe anger and demand justice.I absolutely loved this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I love all the ShopaHolic books! I have read everyone and yet this one I was not anticipating that much. Simply because I am a young woman who does not have kids. I was thinking \\"Oh great, another boring baby story\\". I do not even buy romances that have anything Baby in the title. But once I started reading this book, it was just as great as the others!

Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Well, our beloved Becky Brandon--nee Bloomwood--is back....and although her faithful fans have seen her through all of her major life milestones, we are also delighted to see that she has lost none of her bumbling, ridiculous habits. Now, the married Becky is pregnant...and there's a whole new arena of previously unshopped-for goods to tap into. There are prams to purchases, furniture to scope out, and best of ALL, a new home to find. All is fine in baby world, until Becky discovers that everyone who is anyone is going to Venetia Carter for their OB needs..rather than her own rather stodgy old physician. Venetia Carter is truly \\"doctor to the stars......\\"; and Becky has visions of forging intimate and timeless friendships with current supermodels and starlets...all whom she would meet by simply going to the doctor. Finally, against Luke's wishes, Becky lands an appointment with Dr. Carter, and officially switches physicians. She is soon in the doctor's office, together with Luke, and is horrified to find that the gorgeous Venetia is her husband's ex-girlfriend.Soon Becky finds everything that Luke does suspicious...and suspects the good doctor of trying to lure her husband away. Will Luke leave Becky for Venetia? Or does he truly prefer his scatter-brained, credit-card abusing wife to the gorgeous and equally well-educated Venetia?This is a solid, dependable series by an author who has lost none of her edge...even at this stage in the game. I love consistency, and this author has it in spades.DYB"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic Books and this one by far is the best! Shopaholic, Becky Brandon, is at her shopping sprees again, only this time she's not shopping for herself. Becky is pregnant and puts her mind off morning sickness by shopping; thinks the baby needs five prams, and wants extremely special treatment for when she goes into labor. With all the new products to buy for the upcoming baby, such as prams, clothes, cribs, and bedding (etc.), Becky is overwhelmed with all sorts of emotions. She also needs to find just the right Dr to deliver her baby. On top of this she needs to find a new house because they sold there old one. The store she works at (The Look) is doing horrible in business. She even needs to find out if her husband is really having an affair with their Dr., even though he claims he's not. To put the icing on the cake, she's pregnant! With all this on her mind Becky gets very stressed and even finds it hard to shop. This is hard to believe being that she LOVES to shop, but even through all this she still manages to go out of control once again with her baby shopping. Becky thinks that her new bundle of joy needs almost everything that money can buy. I really enjoyed this book because I liked what Becky went through and how she dealt with her problems. Becky's sense of humor made this book really entertaining and was one of the reasons why I couldn't put this book down! I definitely recommend this book, and if you haven't read the other Shopaholic books, then you should because those are must-reads too!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book deals mostly with Becky's pregnancy and the shennanigans that ensue when she overshops, and signs on with an ob-gyn whom she finds out is Luke's ex-girlfriend. I was curious to see how a self-centered, feckless character like Becky would deal with the all-consuming state of new motherhood. I hope there's at least one more book in the series that shows Becky dealing with the trials and tribulations Mom's everywhere go through, and maybe FINALLY growing up (I hope she still retains her love of shopping, though...).It's a good read due to the humor and Kinsella's knack with dialogue, just not quite what I expected."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have been a fan of the Shophalic Series since the beginning. While I was disappointed with Shophalic & Sister, I was still looking forward to this book. And I am glad to say it did not disappoint! From the very beginning, I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. Becky is back and in true form in this book. I laughed out loud the whole time and found myself not wanting the book to end! I can not wait to see what happens to Becky next with a child!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Just finished the book. As usual, Sophie Kinsella has met/exceeded my expectations. I am never disappointed in her writing. For those of us who MAY have shopoholic tendencies, we can relate to her escapades/dilemmas. I'm glad I have read all her books in order. Can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella did it again! If you've read any of the other Shopaholic books, you HAVE to get this one as well. It was a fantastic, quick read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"...doesn't mean I want to read this book. This book was a gift from someone who when they discovered that I am expecting. I couldn't stand the first book, but after my coworker asked me multiple times if I had read the book, I decided to sit down and read it. I cannot relate the the main character at all. She is shallow and uninspiring. I can't comprehend what people like about these books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Bloomwood is back, as shopping-addicted (but secretly sharp) as ever, only this time she's shopping for her upcoming baby rather than herself. The continuation of the popular chick-lit series is tight, bright, frothy fun, if a bit predictable. Becky is still married to Luke, but there's trouble in the form of an evil red-headed obstetrician who just happens to be Luke's ex-girlfriend. Think Addison from Grey's Anatomy -- thin, sexy, slinky-haired, and not the type of woman you want around your husband when you are in the midst of pregnancy-induced hormones and bloat. Other challenges include a crisis with the boorish major client at Luke's new PR firm, lagging business at the shop where Becky works as a personal shopper, and difficulties the couple has finding the perfect chi-chi house to move into. One subplot handled a bit too lightly involves Becky's anti-Material Girl sister, Jess, who is torn between love for Becky's old neighbor, Tom, and a new job in Chile. The interplay between Becky and Jess is fun, and could have been expanded a bit, to my taste. Overall, if you like the Shopaholic series, you will love this new addition to the line. Definite beach reading."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all Sophia Kinsella's books, and this one is great. I could not put it down, and finished it in one day. I laughed out loud, reccomended it to others, and already loaned my book to a friend. This book was so funny. If you like her other books, your in for a treat with this one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"If you read any of the other Shopaholic books and enjoyed them you'll certainly enjoy this one too. It's funny and lovable and just all around a good read. I love Sophie Kinsella and am always waiting for her next book to come out so I can get it. They should make a movie out of this series..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"There's nothing terribly wrong with this book (except perhaps the lack of depth in virtually all of the characters), but it is an enjoyable, mindless diversion if you are looking for that sort of thing. The villain is cartoonish, and the loyal husband is the perfect strong, silent, adoring cardboard cut-out, but what did you expect? It's harmless fun, would be a good beach read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Bloomwood Brandon is back and this time her shopaholic nature is directed towards her unborn baby. Can't decide between strollers? Buy them all! Worried about childbirth? Arrange for a water birth with lotus flowers and Thai massage! Searching for the perfect birth locale? Ask your favorite boutique if you can give birth there! Becky shops her way through pregnancy, but also is in a competition with her husband to make the wisest investments for the baby. Will Becky's \\"antiques of the future\\" purchases - hot trendy items she thinks will one day be valuable - put her ahead?All is not fun and cash register receipts though - Becky wonders if her marriage is in trouble and if the store she is a personal shopper for is going to make it. Zany as always, warm-hearted, and very creative when it comes to finances, Becky is the heroine you'll want to read more and more about.This is a terrific, fun read for all women, but moms and expectant moms will get a particular kick out of it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella is a great author if you want to forget about life and have a few laughs. I love the Shopaholic series, which are light hearted good humored fun, and this book was not a disappointment from any of the others that have been written. I read it in three days and would definitely reread it again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I dropped several other books that I had underway to plunge into this one. Kinsella has another winner!Becky Brandon continues her shopaholic ways while preparing for baby's arrival. Her life is consumed by finding the trendiest baby outfits, nursery fittings and the perfect pram. Of course, the other aspects of her life tangle and the complications multiply as she finangles for a new home, worries about husband Luke's fidelity, and tries to salvage the reputation of the store where she works. There are funny scenes at every turn (the sonogram, shopping for the pram with Luke, switching to the celebrity doctor, hiring a private detective).It's great to reconnect with her friend Suze, her designer buddy from NY, and her family. Sure Becky's self-centered, scatter-brained and impulsive, but I don't think she's intended as a role model.The humorous situations that she finds herself in make super-fun reading. Amazingly she stumbles along and somehow makes it through each goofy problem, though she frequently creates another one in doing so.I hope we don't have to wait two years for the next book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This book is great! So funny! Good for when you need to relax. if you haven't read the previous ones, you should they are all awesome."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book and was not disappointed. I found that it was much better than the \\"Sister\\" book and definitely on par with the first three in the series. I love Becky when she's left to her own devices!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This isn't my favorite book in the series, but it's still excellent. Kinsella is still hilarious and Becky is still loveable. I really hope the series doesn't end here! Becky with a toddler and looking for pre-schools would be hilarious...It's good light fun and the perfect book to relax with :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Great story, very cute! I think anyone who enjoys the series, or even just a good girlie book, would enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky has evolved as a character. Shopaholic does not really begin to describe her problems anymore, and only in the most basic way seems to describe her. When I learned there were six books of this series I wondered how a woman could be that out of control with shopping and not be completely unlikable. She has, and has not, learned but he problems have grown and evolved. In this particular novel her problem is less her compulsion to spend money and more her husband who is keeping a secret and the hormones coursing through her as she carries through this pregnancy. The novel is more about her bumbling through life than her shopping, and for that I am grateful. This might have been my favorite novel in the series for that reason. Becky is still a walking embarrassment who is oblivious to almost everything, but she comes off optimistic and loving. She's an airhead, with a heart."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This is a super fun book. I recommend reading the other books in the series first to totally appreciate Becky, the main character."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have to confess I've developed a crush on Luke and in Shopaholic & Baby there's a plot twist involving him that I've been anticipating. Luke is an attractive young man who owns his own thriving million dollar business so I was wondering why women weren't throwing themselves at him left and right. In Shopaholic & Baby Sophie Kinsella introduces the (unfortunately) inevitable marriage wrecker -- the gorgeous single woman who sets her sites on the hot wealthy married man and she is determined to steal him from his very pregnant wife. Although this scenario creates all kinds of \\"yuck\\" and \\"ew\\" feelings (probably because it happens so much in real life) it gives the reader a welcome segue away from Becky's tiresome self-indulgent shopping sprees. Becky is a woman who has everything and is never satisfied. It's difficult to like Becky at times because she is so spoiled and consumed with greed; however, the author infuses just enough humor, vulnerability and humanity into Becky's character to keep Becky from falling into the despicable category. In Shopaholic & Baby, Luke's business is struggling financially, Becky is wrapped up in unrealistic fantasies of easy peasy child birth as well as being taunted by a gorgeous ex-girlfriend of Luke who clearly wants him back. Being very pregnant and suffering from body insecurity Becky is an easy target and I actually felt sorry for her character. It would never in a million years occur to Becky to prey on another woman's insecurities. Ms. Kinsella paints an accurate picture of the type of woman who would. So has Luke been able to withstand the charm and advances of his sexy ex? Although this book is full of Becky's shopping excesses it has more emotional weight to it than what one might expect. I highly recommend Shopaholic & Baby."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This fifth entry in the \\"Shopaholic\\" series has Becky Bloomwood Brandon making her way through pregnancy with other challenges added to the mix. Becky is working at a new department store as a personal shopper, but her job is easy, as the store can't seem to get off the ground. This forms a subplot involving Becky calling on young designer Danny Kovitz to get involved in designing a small line exclusive to the store. Other plotlines involve workaholic husband Luke dealing with a new difficult client, half-sister Jess starting a relationship, and Becky pursuing an \\"in\\" obstetrician only to discover the doctor to be one of Luke's ex-girlfriends. Many funny set-pieces, including Becky, her mum, and Janice attending a new agey pre-birth class in which breathing techniques are taught to help mothers-to-be handle the pain of childbirth. Mum and Janice provide a Greek chorus of advice to the class to \\"take all the drugs they've got, dears,\\" leading to the instructor losing it a bit...Becky schedules so many \\"birth assistants\\" that on the actual day her hospital birthing room bears a strong resemblence to the famous stateroom scene from \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" There are many comic subplots going on, and Becky even fears for the future of her marriage as the birth-day draws closer. Becky's shopping mania doesn't have the weight in this book that it has in the previous books, and maybe that's all to the best. Becky's imagination is front and center, whether it's solving problems or letting her suspicions get the better of her. A thoroughly enjoyable continuation of Becky's ongoing story."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"These books are fun like snack food. Rather like the glitzy movies people used to watch during the Great Depression to avoid their real lives. Shopaholic is always in trouble of some sort financially and because of her endless desire to be the center of attention, but she never pays a real penalty, and buys whatever she wants all the time. We get to ride along as she shops and that's fun.The endings of the books are a letdown because the solution to the situation created is always someone pouring endless amounts of money on the problem. Nothing at all to do with the real world. It's not meant to be, I know, but at least during those films in the Depression a viewer could come away with the thought ths she might fall in love, too, someday. It's very unlikely that any of us will make fabulous rich friends and find rich long-lost relatives. So there you sit on your old couch wondering if Goodwill is open on Sundays.Even in this volume, where we are supposed to be really concerned for Shoppy and Hubby-enabler there's Mummy and Daddy's place or that friend's castle in Scotland to take the edge off of plot developments.So, fun, superficial read and that's all. Sometimes that's enough, but I am finding the series to be repetitive and one-note."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"It's okay.....maybe.Yes, there is a sense of hesitation. After reading all of the Shopaholic books, this latest installment of the series is definitely the most 'dramatic'. I even wonder if Ms. Kinsella wrote this when she was with child because the book is oozing with hormones, so to speak. Therefore, I cannot fully commit to saying that I like it because the book failed to bring me the same old Becky Bloomwood-Brandon antics and humor. For example, I could not find a single witty Shopaholic statement that I would normally find in Kinsella's novels. Becky's shopping 'mis'adventures have lessened and her enthusiasm for shopping for baby stuff seems pretty 'normal' for a pregnant person, whereas I was looking for something over the top! Granted there was a whole chapter on Prams' shopping (or strollers as we call them here in the U.S.), and Becky ends up buying three, but the chapter, although it was a manifestation that Becky hasn't lost her Shopaholic touch, was really not that interesting.However, even though the book lacked the same dose of Becky Bloomwood funny and witty mishaps, the difference in the flavor compared to the the other Shopaholic novels isn't all that bad. There were a dramatic plots, LOTS of it in fact....such as 'Is Luke and Venetia having an affair?', 'What is the secret that is going on in Brandon Communications?', 'Will they lose the house?', 'Is Jess going to Peru, if she does, what happens to Tom?'. The page-turner is definitely the supposed 'affair' of Venetia and Luke, and I must confess that during this portion of the book I was actually quite moved just imagining how painful it must be to be in such a delicate state and finding out your husband is committing adultery. I am sure every reader is at the edge of their seats too wondering if tragedy is how Ms. Shopaholic's story is going to end. The culmination is pretty good. Ms. Kinsella proves once again that Becky and Luke's love is stronger than ever. However it is not a perfect ending. As Ms. Kinsella resolves each one conflict, the ending result is somewhat turning out to be like a Rocky Balboa movie. Brandon Communications is severly hemorrhaging money and thus the Brandons lose the opportunity to buy their dream home and end up living momentarily with Becky's parents by the time the baby was born.If Kinsella decided to end the Shopaholic series with this book then that would be fine. There really isn't much more to develop in Becky's story. Ms. Kinsella has reinforced her 'shopaholic' nature time and again with every place she has visited or every new experience she encounters. Her romance with Luke has been tested and it was proven to be quite solid. And all the other characters in the story, like Becky's parents, Suze, Jess (who is moving for a short time to Chile with Tom), and even Danny (who I still do not like and can never comprehend how he became a famous and most sought after fashion designer when he specializes in 't-shirts'!) have all been fairly developed. The series should end with this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Shopaholic & Baby proved to just as funny and charming as its predecessors. As expected, Becky goes a bit overboard buying things for the baby, and when she finds out her new obstetrician is Luke's ex-boyfriend things get interesting. I especially enjoyed the developing relationship between Becky and her sister, Jess. As with the other books in the series, Shopaholic & Baby is a great summer beach read, and will surely make you laugh out loud on many occasions!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"If you like the earlier books in the Shopaholic series, you'll probably enjoy this one too. I'm impressed by the way Kinsella keeps things light and fun but continually allows relationships to develop and characters to mature."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Great pool side read. This book (the 5th one in the series?) is an easy and fun read. I've definitely come to love Becky Bloomwood over the course of this series. Onto the next!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW THIS FUN READ MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE NY TIMES BEST SELLER LIST!! THE BOOK WAS ALSO CHOSEN BY AARP MAGAZINE.

KINSELLA'S BOOKS AND SHARED THEM WITH FAMILY AND GIRLFRIENDS!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Each time I finish another book in the amusing \\"Shopaholic\\" series, I'm pretty sure Kinsella has taken these characters as far as they can go. And then there's another adorable episode and I'm enchanted anew. Yes, Becky is materialistic -- but she's so good-hearted and besides, her passion for shopping has resulted in a career and made her something of a marketing savant. She loves Luke and her parents and her friends and is excited about motherhood. She's a Brit Lucy Riccardo for the new millennium. My only complaint about this book regards Dr. Carter. A bit too easy an obvious a villain, Dr. Carter's behavior seems just too ... dangerously wacky. Even in the crazy world of Becky Bloomwood!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I loved loved loved this book.Sophie K is sooo funny, I laughed out loud while reading this book at work!!If you have ever rationalized a purchase in your mind, READ this!!Characters are real, funny, warm, and contemorary.Read the whole series, as I did, back to back, you wont be sorry you did.

I'm a huge fan of the books and am looking forward to the film in the making. Becky is likeably crazy and manages to get in to some twisted situations. Humor and laugh out loud scenes are abundant!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"After much debating, I finally caved and bought this book. At first, I thought that the main character was self absorbed and shallow and that I wouldn't like her. However, after reading further in the story, I found her somewhat 'charming'.Needless to say, I found the book enjoyable. I couldn't really relate to the main character but I somehow lived vicariously through her. Also, the other characters were fun to read about.The plot was very predictable, but that didn't take away from the fun of the book. Overall, it was quite funny and entertaining."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"My dirty little secret: I have read all of the SHOPAHOLIC books. Obviously, I have liked them, or I wouldn't have kept on reading.Still, in SHOPAHOLIC AND BABY, author Sophie Kinsella finally may be running out of steam. These books are kind of like a one note symphony, and that note now is getting tired.On the other hand, her heroine Becky Bloomwood is so marvelously realized that it is impossible not to enjoy her skewed--but sweetly so--Becky view of the world.In this novel, Sophie has Becky happily married to hunk Luke Brandon and expecting her first baby. Nothing but the best for Sophie's favorite character. Though pregnant, Becky remains obsessed by fashion here, probably a victim of fashion, albeit a victim with swollen feet.Even if the humor is getting predictable, Kinsella is an excellent writer whose plot structure and use of language remain first-class. And, as always, Kinsella transmits a wonderful sense of place; in this story, upper class, up-to-the-minute London, as seen through the cockeyed prism that is Becky's point-of-view.All of the SHOPAHOLIC books are interesting and, just as importantly, these also are fun."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Shopaholic and the baby is another comical addition to the Shopaholic series. It doesn't have as many laugh-out-loud occasions as some of the others (namely the first two novels)- but I'd say the writing and plots are still very strong.While 99% of this book is with Becky Bloomwood pregnant, and not yet having a baby, the majority of the plot is dealing with her pregnancy and making changes to her lifestyle in order to prepare for a baby. And just falling into some of those mommy-to-be traps like finding the most sought-after doctor, clothing etc. Add in an ex-girlfriend of her hubbys and that makes for interesting reading! Of course as always you cheer bumbling Becky on.Fun, entertaining read as always! What I really can't wait for is the next book with her taking care of the baby! I think that will make for maybe the funniest stories/scenarios yet."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Liked it a lot. Becky seems to be growing up a little. She's not getting into as many sticky situations. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This was such a good book! Lots of Becky's crazy ideas and baby things everywhere! Really funny...! I hope Sophie Kinsella doesn't stop writing the shopaholic series! And the cover of the book is so cute..!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"This is another great book from Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series. I have every single one, and this book does not disappoint. Becky is as hilarious as ever and her spending is as uncontrolled as ever. It was really great to have characters from the other books brought back. The plot with Luke's ex-girlfriend was fabulous -- We all experience that little pang of jealousy about the hot ex-girlfriend. Just a great, quick, hilarious read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Sophie Kinsella just gets better and better all the time. I hope she never concludes her Shopaholic series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I just finished this book and it was delightful!!! I have been patiently awaiting it. I loved the first three, HATED the \\"Sister\\" book, so I checked \\"Baby\\" out from the library b/c I didn't want to end up with a dud. I will now be buying this book! This was the Becky Brandon nee' Bloomwood that I adore. This book was hilarious! The story had a great flow and was never stale. Kinsella has a gift for comedic writing."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have read all of the previous four Shopaholic books and this one is one of my favorites. I thought that Shopaholic and Sister was rather slow, but this one was very easy to read. I thought it was so well written that I was getting angry about things that Becky was angry about! I recommend this to all Shopaholic fans. If you have not yet read the first books in the series, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Becky Brandon nee' Bloomwood is back again with a new shopping excuse - a baby! From Baby Dior to 5 prams - Becky does not leave a single store without something in her hands. She's on a mission to be the yummiest mummy in all of Vogue (and England... and why not the world?). Yes, you read it right - Becky manages to get herself into Vogue.Besides all of the all-important shopping, Becky is also managing a career (ok so there really isn't any clients) and homelife (even if Luke hasn't been home much lately) with a breeze. Everything is going swimmingly until the \\"it\\" OB that Becky manages to get in to see ends up being Luke's ex-girlfriend... and she's on the prowl. Luke is blind but Becky isn't and she isn't going down without a fight! Hilarity ensues as Becky finds ways to make sure Luke's being a good boy and meanwhile she still is trying to figure out the sex of the baby at the same time (but don't tell Luke!).This book was a fun read and a pageturner (finished in 1 day). I felt that the ending was a bit rushed and of course the ever present, somewhat of a cliffhanger. It was nearly redeemed though by Becky telling off Luke's Mom - the purchase of this novel was validated with that single scene!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I really enjoyed the first two books of this series. But honestly, I think this storyline is tired. If you are looking for a quick fun read, you have found it. But don't start this book hoping for a deeper hidden meaning, because this series has officially reached its shallowest point."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Say what you will about sequels, but this one is good. While it is impossible to match the original, this book is still leaps and bounds ahead of most other new chick lit. Few other authors could make me laugh and actually feel embarrassed for their character like Kinsella does with Becky. Definitely a must read, but read the others first if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that this book has the same plot line as all the others. It is fun, light, reading but I couldn't help but wonder why her husband Luke would stay with her. I would like to see a little more depth to this character. I got the feeling she was even looking at the baby as just another accessory. It is fun reading but nothing I would cancel plans to go out and buy. Wait for the paperback version or get a used copy on Amazon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"I could not but this book down it was so good! I finished the book in 2 days. I think the best yet in this series. I think everyone would love this book."},{"Title":"English Traits","review":"English Traits does not equal Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays but has much that is worthwhile for Emersonians and several things that may attract others. Emerson trains his mesmerizing prose and piercing insight on England and the English from nearly every angle - not his most interesting or original subject but nonetheless intriguing. This is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject, and Emersonians should come here after the more famous works.Emerson's thoroughness is impressive; his examination is so detailed that it is near-ethnographic. However, the book begins on a personal note, detailing his first trip to England just after he resigned his pulpit when he was unknown, had published nothing, and was unsure what to do. He recounts eminently absorbing visits with luminaries like Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle that anyone interested in them or the era will relish. These first-hand accounts have significant historical value, letting us see a side of these major figures that is rarely mentioned - not least because Emerson is as honest as ever and does not spare them. This section is so worthy that its brevity is regrettable; Emerson declines to describe visits to landmarks or his initial impressions of England and the English, perhaps because he had changed so much.Next comes a fairly detailed history and description of the English \\"race\\" that is notable mainly for historical context. Much of it has been disproved or highly questioned, and it is far from politically correct by today's standards, but this makes it all the more interesting. Anyone wondering how a representative mid-nineteenth century Anglo-American saw the land of his ancestors need look no further.Some may find this trying, but I encourage them to persevere, because the bulk of the book is far more interesting; Emerson examines his subject much as he had done with abstract ones like self-reliance, experience, and love. He begins with a basic rundown of England itself: historical, geographical, economic, etc. Emerson also looks at English institutions like the church, colleges, etc.; his most interesting observations here are about the class system, particularly the upper class, and the political system. He describes them on their own terms and in contrast to other countries, including of course America. This has merit, but several seemingly obligatory topics are unfortunately missing. Emerson says almost nothing about royalty and, a fascinating Stonehenge section excepted, neglects to treat landmarks. He also mentions in passing meeting many notables - Dickens, Tennyson, Thackeray, etc. - out of which notable anecdotes could surely have been made. In any case, though, the real meat is his analysis of the English people, including topics like manners, character, speech, and habits. Emerson was a keen observer, and his foreign status gave a perspective the English could not have had, yielding many noteworthy insights.Perhaps surprisingly, given that Emerson was arguably the first truly American writer, vigorously urged cultural independence, and otherwise preached self-reliance and originality, he reveals himself to be a pretty thorough Anglophile. Maybe this should not surprise; he was after all a New Englander of English stock, and England was the world's most powerful nation. It is indeed generally hard to deny the basic truth of even his most rhapsodic compliments, but current readers - especially Americans - may grow frustrated and impatient with his constant glowing descriptions. He has also been recently taken to task for what some see as a sort of unintentional racism. However, those willing to continue will see that he eventually gives substantial criticism, particularly in regard to religion and literature; he also lambastes England's general conservatism, zeroing in on several specific abuses. All told, his honesty and willingness to criticize were quite remarkable and in many ways as instructive as ever.Such a book would generally be of little more than historical interest, but Emerson's ever-strong writing raises it; anyone alive to his style will find much to love. Perhaps more importantly, it now has considerable value for a reason probably no one could have foreseen - mid-nineteenth century England was in essentially the same position as present-day America. It was the world's most powerful nation, the military and economic superpower whose culture and language had global influence. Emerson was clearly in awe as few could help being but also deft in noticing that England was near its apex or had already passed it; great as it was, the future did not belong to it. He vividly describes how many centuries-old institutions were rapidly crumbling and prophetically notes that England would become more and more like America, to whom the future belonged. This came to pass, perhaps letting blue blood Americans annoyed by the Anglophile aspect breathe a proverbial sigh of relief - or even have a laugh at England's expanse. In truth, though, they should be more cautious, because the book has much to teach them. Many traits then dominant in England - arrogance, insularity, disregard for outside opinion - are now preeminent in America, and America may fall from the top just as England did if not careful. A close reading of this may go a long way toward preventing that, and Emersonians will want the book in any case. Like all geniuses, Emerson both epitomized and was ahead of his time; full of subtleties beneath an already appealing surface, this is an overlooked exemplar of that Emersonian paradox."},{"Title":"English Traits","review":"These days, celebrity authors earn thousands of dollars for a speech, but back in the 1880s, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the first American author known to receive payment for delivering a talk, was paid $5 and oats for his horse."},{"Title":"The ACS Style Guide: A Manual for Authors and Editors","review":"The American Chemical Society has done an excellent job in compiling this invaluable resource for its members.

It it a quasi-fictional account of his actual experience living among a group of canibals on a South Seas near- paradise. Melville's central character, Tommo, is Melville, and his experiences are broadened to four months instead of Melville's actual four weeks. Melville uses the work to comment freely on the conflict between civilization's growing encroachment upon an unspoiled paradise and the evils that civilization wrought. He also launches into repetitive descriptions of the island of Nukuheva which Melville feels is typical of the lush verdant beauty of all of the Polynesian islands. I taught this book for two years back in the 70's with a group of American literature students. I decided to revive it this year (1998)with a group of honors juniors (American Literature)at my high school. Oddly enough, the book seemed to be more favorably received this year than a couple of decades ago. Some students complained of its repetitive nature, particularly the descriptions, but most found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The book must be considered in light of the Romantic Era from which it emerged. Accounts of far-off exotic isles and high order adventure were the order of the day. In addition, the blind love of Nature and the admiration of the Rousseau's &quot;noble savage&quot; are hallmarks of the book. One must also think what readers in the 1800's thought of the sensual side of the book. Exotic descriptions of naked island girls, in particular Tommo's lovely Fayaway, left a lot up to the imagination of nineteenth century readers. Whether Tommo's relationship with Fayaway is merely platonic or highly physical is left to the reader to decide though it hints at the latter. Also of interest is Melville's condemnation of missionary work. Though at one point he concedes that the principle of bringing Christianity is good, he admonishes that the islanders should be civilized with benefits not crimes as was then more often the case. I found the book very enjoyable the second time around and would recommend it to teachers as an alternative to Moby Dick or Billy Budd as a representative work of Melville or Amercian Romanticism."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"1841. A young man of 23 is looking for adventure, he signs a contract on a New England whaler and travels to the South Pacific. Life on the ship is not what he expected, the captain is a tyrant, the life is a bore, food is terrible. The ship reaches the Marquesas after 15 months, with no commercial success so far and the prospect of another few years of the same. The islands have just been occupied and claimed by the French. What one knows of the locals is full of horror: cannibals! But also of delight: the women! On arrival in the harbour, a fantastic party with the best orgy since 15 months is happening. But nothing can distract our hero from his plan: jump ship, wait for its departure, then look for another way home. He finds a companion for the desertion and does it. Then follows an account of 4 months among the cannibals -- while in reality it lasted only 1 month. This is a fictionally embellished travel and adventure story. 5 years later, a book is published. It will be Melville's first and most successful book during his lifetime. From here on, it went down for him.The book lets us observe one of the great American writers in his initiation phase. A future ancestor of Conrad and O'Brian, two of my addictions. I wonder why I bypassed him for so long, with the exception of the Whale, which I read 30 years ago. And loved.Typee gives you an adventure account in exotic surroundings, told in often surprisingly fresh language, but totally free of any scientific pretension: few observations on flora, fauna or geology, but a lot of romantic landscaping. Young Melville was no Maturin.There is a lot of ethnology, the description of the people, their village and life takes a lot of space, so does the process of miscommunicating between the two white runaways and the tribe. As a matter of fact, not much verbal communication happened, the hero spent most of his time in a kind of fog: what was his status? was he a guest? a captive? a friend? was he destined for BBQ? Only half way through the story does he meet briefly a man who speaks some English, and it becomes clear that he is indeed a captive, but to what purpose is not clear.He does reflect on the religion of the tribe, as observed by him in the practices of rituals, and concludes that the information spread by missionaries in the US is exaggerating wildly as far as the practices of paganism are concerned. Self-serving, obviously.He takes a strong position against the morality of our civilization as opposed to the noble naked savages that he gets to know: the white civilized man is the most ferocious animal on the face of the earth, he concludes.He was a bit in love with fair Fayaway, no doubt.More Melville to follow here!"},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"\\"Typee\\" is based on Melville's experiences when, as a young man of 22, he \\"jumped ship\\" from an American whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific. It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked. While, like \\"Moby Dick\\", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface.For a first novel, written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the Typee. In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at the activities of Western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise. Gradually dread, loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as \\"Tommo\\", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast. He is finally rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the Typees.I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor of English. It was very helpful with Melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context. The chapter on \\"Typee\\" in \\"Studies in Classic American Literature\\" by D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding. Newton Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place \\"Typee\\" in the development of Melville as a writer.Highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century American romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of \\"Moby Dick\\"."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Realizing that at least some people might want to know if the book is a good read or not, I'll write a review that hopefully wont read like the opener to a thesis on early american literature: Here goes...I liked it!

Do not have any apprehensions animated by a seemingly simplistic or bromide plot, for once a reader foreign to Melville's work grasps the exquisite prose and sincere romanticism ingrained in all of his novels, you're soon to become a captive of it's pages bound by an aroused imagination. Soon to learn the fame and notoriety surrounding Herman Melville is certainly not without reason and like many noble literary giants that have gone before us, his masterpieces withstand the test of time deservingly of the title, \\"Classic.\\"The quixotic idea of emerging as a castaway on a dissolute tropical island hidden from the world, deep in paradise with only the company of an exotic but mysterious native people should not deter you from believing \\"Typee\\" is of any similarity to other inferior postdating stories of the like. Melville combines a brilliantly adventurous travelogue accompanied by earnest philosophical reflections balancing it all out with anthropological observations of the Island's primitive peoples, as well as recollections of his own home. This famed novel was an ebullient endeavor during it's day which hints the emprise of such modern films as \\"Castaway\\" while engrossing the empathy of multiculturalism found in \\"Dances With Wolves.\\" It is feasibly the first accurate portrait painted of South Pacific life through the eyes of a Westerner, influencing many travelogues to follow focusing on the region in the same fashion of Stevenson and Becke.Numerous editions have been published since the original. The Penguin Classics Edition provides an introduction by author John Bryant who puts the story into context and Melville's conclusion of the supporting character's fate, written two years prior to the first edition in \\"Sequel: The Story of Toby.\\"When first published in 1846, \\"Typee\\" was an immediate hit. Readers of the era in the US and even in Europe already knew to expect stupendous things from the then obscure author. This is exemplified by the book's quantum leap to stardom. The original draft was submitted to be published in New York but was rejected supposedly because it was \\"too fantastic\\" to be true. The apparent fact that after more than a century and a half of being published readers still have an appetite for Melville's original work, must persuade even the most discriminating of literary tastes of the caliber of his writing. Do not be deceived by the age of \\"Typee.\\" You needn't be a diehard classical literature enthusiast nor scholar to appreciate this very readable, gracefully written novel. Which is contrary to the sometimes unfathomable rhetoric of the bygone antebellum era. It remains still just as amusing and captivating to readers today.\\"Typee\\" was the first of a trilogy of autobiographical novels set in the South Pacific dealing with Polynesian life. Readers of the author's lifetime couldn't get enough of his masterpieces still acclaimed today. Although not quite as well known as \\"Moby Dick\\" is to modern day readers, \\"Typee\\" is no less gripping or eloquent."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"What I gather from some of the reviews here is that because Melville wrote some complex novels later in his career, some people will probe and muse upon everything he writes until some deep meaning or intent can be wrung out of it. I'm sure many academics in the world of publish-or-perish have concocted quite extravagant analyses of books such as 'Typee' in order to keep their jobs.From a more sensible vantage point, while Melville certainly evolved into a more complex writer, there's no reason to believe he intended writing a 'deep' or symbolic book with 'Typee'. 'Typee' was his first book, and it became an immediate success because of its colorful handling of Melville's experiences among the inhabitants of Polynesia. End of story.Melville's account is what would today be classified as 'narrative fiction', meaning he took his actual experiences and molded them slightly to communicate a larger idea he had in mind. With 'Typee', Melville's larger idea is the comparison of civilization and savagery. His conclusion is that so-called savages - like Typees - are in many ways superior to their civilized counterparts. Great message, but it doesn't make this book something you can dwell on for days or analyze to death.Most readers will find Melville's writing pretty crisp, especially given the time he was writing and the time we're reading. His theme and his approach make 'Typee' far more readable than a straight travelogue but less exciting than an adventure novel. Bottom line, this is a good read. While the plot is rather thin, Melville's digressions into the culture of the Typee are really the point of the book and he doesn't stick to any subject long enough for you to get bored. On the contrary, his observations are very interesting especially given that he had no way of understanding or explaining much of what he saw.Read 'Typee' for what it is and enjoy it as so many people have before. Take away the message Melville intended, which I promise you will not need to be especially sharp or penetrating to tease out. Please don't make 'Typee' out to be a piece of esoteric literature (like 'Moby Dick') when it clearly is not."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Although Typee is based on his own experiences in the South Pacific, Melville's popular work is wonderful adventure fiction. Disillusioned with months at sea on a whaling boat Tommo/Melville jumps ship with his friend Toby on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas archipelago of what is modern day French Polynesia. They are quickly captured by the Typee tribe who carry a murderous and cannibalistic reputation but are surprised to find that they are treated with respect and hospitality by their captors. However, it is soon apparent that the Typee, for reasons that are not clear, have no intention of letting them go for they are shadowed everywhere and under constant surveillance by groups of villagers. Toby makes an early escape with the intention of summoning help for Tommo who is being nursed for a serious leg wound by the fair-skinned beauty, Fayaway. When his friend fails to return Tommo reluctantly acquiesces to his situation. His subsequent anthropological observations are not dry text but a humorous and fascinating glimpse into an inscrutable world where the jollity, sensuality and general indolence of the villagers are lights year away from the puritanical and Protestant New England of Tommo's/Melville's own background. Some of the customs and practices have survived to this day and the words are still in use (recognisable despite Melville's esoteric spelling) as Marquesan is spoken in preference to French throughout the islands. (Some years later the people of Nuku Hiva were to be converted to Catholicism and it must have come as a shock to them to discover that they had been praying to the wrong idols for the previous two millennia.) Although the attitudes of the day were apparent in places - \`Kory-Kory, though the most devoted and best-natured serving-man in the world, was alas! a hideous object to look upon' - Melville compares the natural beauty of the many of the Typee, both men and women, most favourably with the over-preened, coiffured dilettantes of the \`civilised' world. With the sumptuous Fayaway and devoted Kory-Kory, he passes the days in sloth, lying around, eating, and swimming. He is effectively in a \`golden jail'. As months pass, though, he becomes gloomy at his isolation and inability to meaningfully converse with the villagers and, when he makes a gruesome discovery, he develops a dreadful foreboding as to the possible outcome for his captivity. The novel closes with tension and drama.Today, the village of Taipivai (River Taipi) is as tranquil a place as one could imagine, with the villagers enjoying a pace of life barely changed since Melville's time 170 years ago. Highly recommended to all who enjoy old-fashioned adventure and those who are interested in the history and culture of Pacific island communities. A second book, the less well-known Omoo, continues the author's South Seas escapades."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"(This review is based on the Library of America edition)Melville's first book - and you can call it a novel, because it is - is quite an impressive work. I have to admit that during my reading of it, I didn't know how much was non-fiction and how much was fiction. In the case of a non-fiction book, I would have been rather astonished by Melville's work. But the fact is that this isn't a non-fiction book, and that as a reader you should think more of a literary work. But do not be sad!For what Melville does remains awesome. The book begins like a novel; the narrator seeks to escape his whaler and remain some time on one of the Marquesan Islands. After numerous adventures, he's eventually caught by the Typees, and from that point on, the book becomes close to an anthropological study of the exotic habits of the tribe. Melville is very insightful and witty, and more often than not, funny. His prose is rich and wonderful. A pure pleasure to read.\\"Typee\\" is a peek at some kind of long lost Eden, where no one has to work for a living - fruits can be plucked any time - and where there seems to be no evil. The Typees all have perfect beautiful skin, due to countless bathings during the day, and they're seldom seen to either cause or receive any harm. However, things aren't so dream-like, and the narrator is constantly haunted by the ghost of cannibalism, especially as he has no clear idea of why his captors detain him and yet treat him kindly.The author manages to produce some very interesting comparisons between the exotic \\"savages\\" and the Western Man, and this reminds me of many a sociologic book. Society, culture, humanity, all of these - and more - are considered from a very unique perspective in \\"Typee\\". Life among the cannibals, in an Eden of sorts, that is, in short, what the novel is about. Excellent read from a master of literature."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"All things considered, Typee is an excellent book considering it was Melville's first. The themes hidden inside a simple voyage onto the Nukuheva island are utterly breath-taking. Although Meliville states that \\"He has stated such matters just as they occurred, and leaves every one to form his own opinion concerning them,\\"(xx), we all know that the truth was stretched out such as the fact that, in reality, he was only on the Islands for four weeks, not four months. But his imagery, symbolism, and entire demise of the meaning of \\"civilization,\\" is what makes this novel, a remarkable one.The magnificent scenery and what it stands for is the readers first see as Melville's first main themes in Typee. Melville's imagery is what catches the attention of his readers. They delve deep within the picture he displays with the words he selects. The entire island that is described constantly through the story gives a sort of reference to the garden of Eden, but of course has a hidden meaning. Some critics interpret the reference to the garden of Eden as a symbol for innocence. But when Tommo first hears of the dreaded Typees, he only believes in their cannibalism. After living with them for four months, he always has that first reaction of the Typees in the back of his mind. Other critics would argue that the injured leg that Tommo is mysteriously diagnosed of only comes and goes according to his true feeling of the Typees at that moment. The Garden of Eden is known for it's beauty, it's tranquility, and it's innocence. All these things are attributes of the island but yet they also show that there cannot be innoncence without violence. The Typees are figured out in the end and the sayings are true but not how the rumors are spread. Tommo figures out that the \\"savages\\" are more civilized than the white men are back at home. Those French that landed to come take over are not helping the savages; they are destroying their villages and culture, like \\"savages.\\" Ever since the beginning, Tommo notices that the savages are probably the truly more humane of the two. \\"'Yet, after all,' I quoth to myself, 'insensible as he is to a thousand wants, and removed from harassing cares, may not the savage be the happier man of the two?'\\" (29) This quote demonstrates two things. The undoubtable influence Shakespeare had on Melville and the remarkable foreshadowing that was to display the complete way of life, even of those most \\"savage,\\" the Typees.Another main part of Typee is the theme of forbidden romance. Tommo falls in love with the beautiful Fayaway and in the end, he could not even console her as she sobbed while he escaped in a row boat home. Melville proves in his writing that even though Tommo was entirely happy at times, there was always a moment of doubt. Here he demonstrates that even though this is \\"paradise\\" or \\"utopia,\\" man will always miss his own culture no matter how violent they can be. Even though Tommo degraded the white man at every sign of native compassion to each other, he still wanted to go back. Don't forget that he was a prisoner in this peaceful place, and he escapes the island through the one thing that he feared, violence. Was it that he had learned the way of the Typees or had it always been there?"},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Much of this first novel of Melville's reads more like a documentary than an adventure novel. This story of Tommo's time as a prisoner to the Typee savages (mirrored after Meliville's own experiences with a Tahitian tribe) isn't the most exciting book you'll read. Most of it is actually taken up by detailed descriptions of the (imaginary?) Typee tribes-people, their customs, habits, ect. Because it is based on real experiences, it is somewhat difficult to determine what is fiction and what is really true of Pacific-Islander life. In-depth descriptions of how food is processed, how clothing is made, and how island life is organized ring true, while a few parts of the book, like the beauty of the people and their habitually lazy lifestyles, seem exaggerated.Melville's writing style reminds me of Jules Verne. The mundane tone used to describe (in great detail) people, objects, and occasions is very similar to what you get in Verne's novels (thinkFive Weeks in a Balloon). Also similar is the constant but dry and never-distracting humor always just beneath the surface, helping to make this otherwise lengthy-feeling descriptive work entertaining to read. Admittedly, there aren't the same sort of intense life-and-death situations here, but the tone and descriptive writing certainly have similarities to Jules Verne's style.This book is most well-known for its poignant social commentary. The unfavorable comparisons of Western society to the stress-free life of the islands, and the condemnation of the corrupting influences of military and religious 'civilizing' influences on tribal people might have been offensive or enlightening to some in the 1850's, but seem like nothing original today. The unrefined, unashamed, and unladylike behaviour of the Polynesian women may have shocked readers at the time of publishing, but today, while lovely, it doesn't cause consternation.I wouldn't recommend this book for the thrill seeker, or adventure lover. Only for those interested in the early work of Herman Meliville or a documentary-like story from the 1850's about life in an uncivilized tropical paradise."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Herman Melville's style of detailed descriptions certainly comes though in this slim 210-page volume written in 1846. He describes life aboard ship, the geography of the island and the technical aspects of making clothing, tattooing and preparing food as well as many native ritual customs. This is all seen through the eyes of his lead character, Tom, called Tommo by the natives. The book put me right there with him, when, exhausted and starved, he and Toby, the other seaman he jumped ship with, find their way into the world of the Typees. The two sailors are treated well, but are kept virtual prisoners and there is apprehension throughout about the Typees' cannibal tendencies. In spite of that, there is also joy as Tommo views the simple and carefree life of the people he considers savages and contrasts it to life in the so-called &quot;civilized world&quot;.The Typees seem perennially happy and content. They spend a lot of time amusing themselves as food is plentiful and there is not much work to do. Their lives are idealized so much that I found myself raising a quizzical eyebrow at times. But the story was so good and so well written that I didn't let it get in my way of enjoying the book, which must have been received with similar delight when it was published as it not only painted a picture of a better world, it appealed to everyone's sense of adventure.I loved the book, especially the social commentary. I found myself reading it quickly and at odd times during to day just to see what would happen on the next page. It sure was a good story and seems as fresh and meaningful today it when was published more than a century and a half ago."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"I just finished Typee and enjoyed the book a great deal (I'm 38, male, and love reading for general education and enjoyment). A few months ago, I made a noble attempt to wade through Moby Dick (I jumped to the last chapter after about a quarter of the book) and I was curious to see if &quot;early Melville&quot; was any easier.Typee is billed as both an adventure novel and as shocking anthropology. I found Typee well written, but a bit dense with long, detailed, descriptions about trees, landscapes, etc. that don't apply to characters, nor plot (and did put me to sleep). These long passages make it hard for me to call this an adventure novel, but this style seems to be standard fair when reading early American adventure novels (like &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; by J. F. Cooper).Reading Typee in 1997 doesn't produce the same moral outrage as it did when it was first published in 1846. But, looking for Melville's cultural observations and comparisons was a great part of what made Typee so very enjoyable. So, for me, it is isn't the adventure that makes the book worth reading, but the author's, and my own, observations and comparisons of different lifestyles.While reading Melville's observations on a primitive culture, I began to marvel at the his ability to transcend his culture and to describe the vastly different culture he had experienced. In Typee he writes about everything from eating raw fish, primitive idol worship, polyandry (multiple husband) marriages, and cannibalism, all without the negative judgment or superiority one might expect from an American in 1847. I must admire the observer when, discussing cannibalism, he writes: &quot;But here, Truth, who loves to be centrally located, is again found between two extremes;...&quot; When reading Melville's cultural observations he inspired me to keep an open mind.I also enjoyed Melville's comparisons between the island culture and his home culture. It is great fun to read Melville's comparison of the stress free, non-capitalistic islanders and the debtors prisons of America. It is unique to see that Melville was able to say maybe his culture isn't the best and that western influence might not be the best influence. He writes early in the book: &quot;Thrice happy are they who, inhabiting some yet undiscovered island in the midst of the ocean, have never been brought into contaminating contact with the white man.&quot;But my greatest pleasure, when reading Typee, was in making comparisons between the changes in American culture since the books publication and today. To a buttoned-up, victorian society the descriptions of island women dressed only in tropical flowers must have been a mind bender indeed. However, to our post-flower child generation these descriptions seem tame. When Melville states: &quot;The varied dances of the Marquesan girls are beautiful in the extreme, but there is an abandoned voluptuousness in their character which I dare not describe.&quot; it is hard to believe that he could describe something that our current generation hasn't seen in the movies (and with a PG-13 rating!).In conclusion, I encourage you to read Typee. I think it is an enjoyable book and today's readers can find the value of the book without having to get someone else to explain it to you. In addition, I believe that everyone can finish it and thereby allow you to proudly claim that you have indeed read Melville. And, once you have finished a &quot;classic&quot; and been able to see its value, you can begin to understand the common thread that caused your American Literature professor to label Melville, together with F. Scott Fiztgerald and Jack Kerouac, as one of the observers of American society. I am now off to read &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;On the Road.&quot;- Anthony J. Godwinp.s. Did you know that Herman Melville wrote Moby Dick, but that Moby Dick never wrote him back!"},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"I read this book to get a better sense of Melville's abilities and his style. Having read Moby Dick, I was prepared for a complicated and somewhat dissolute read with great symbolism. Typee is none of that, though it has elements of the style that would, through Moby Dick make Melville post-humously famous. Written today, this book would not be a hit, though one can see why it was when it was published in the 1800s. The symbolism in Typee is not as substantive or immediately obvious as in MD, but it is present and gives this work more depth than is at first apparent. I don't know that I have an accurate sense of what Melville is all about after reading this and MD, and I would probably recommend one read Billy Budd or at least another novel in order to really get a feel for Melville."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Two young American sailors jump ship in the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, to escape the harsh regime of a tyrannical whaling captain. They head for the hills, planning to hole up there till their ship departs. But, there's nothing to eat up there and they have not had the foresight to take any food with them. They must venture into the Polynesian \`backlands' and throw themselves on the mercy of the locals. They know that there are two valleys, one inhabited by the peaceful, friendly Happars (Hapa'a ?) and the other by the fierce Typees, a group of notorious cannibals. After considerable hardship and feats of physical endurance they descend from the steep, volcanic ridges into a valley. But which one is it ? Uh-oh, you guessed it, it's the one where the Typees live. But lo and behold, the Typees turn out to be a most friendly, hospitable group providing food, shelter, clothing, and sex, not to mention a lazy lotus-eater's existence. Melville (for he did live with such a group in 1842) acknowledges that the Marquesans were far from savages, that their violent reputation probably stemmed from the treatment they'd received on the few occasions that Westerners contacted them. He criticizes the baneful influences of so-called \\"civilization\\" on Pacific islanders in general and is especially disparaging towards missionaries.TYPEE is a novel, not a straightforward account of Melville's own stay. Tom, the protagonist, comes to realize that though the treatment he receives is benign, he is a prisoner. His friend disappears, but Tom, with a leg swollen by disease, cannot escape so easily. Having cannibalism always in his mind, Tom worries that he is being 'fattened up' for some horrible end. While Melville gives details of Pacific island life---daily routine, how to make tapa, breadfruit and its uses, houses, some details of war, funerals, and even cannibalism---his (Melville's) inability to speak much of the local Polynesian dialect hinders him from much understanding. Hence, his take on social class, on religion and ritual is from a totally uninformed point of view. Though he repeatedly claims that the people did almost no work, that is highly unlikely, even if their life must have been easier than the life of average people in the USA or England at the time. Readers of the 1840s, unlike those of today with access to television, the Internet, numerous films, and a myriad books, must have thrilled to read details of such a remote place and different culture, presented in such romantic, adventurous form. Despite the 19th century literary style, which might put off casual readers, TYPEE still holds your attention. Will Tom escape ? How ? If you are looking for a theological/philosophical treatise, forget it. This was a best seller in its day and made Melville's reputation. As for the Marquesans, well, there were perhaps 100,000 people there when Western ships first arrived. By 1900, only two thousand were left. Today there are still less than ten thousand; disease, violence, and alcohol did their dirty work. Melville wasn't just whistling Dixie. I enjoyed this book as much, if not more, than when I read it first at the age of twelve many moons ago."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Heritage's 1963 edition of Melville's Typee -- a sand-colored slipcase contains the hardcover book, bound in textured cloth with a three-color design. 24 Covarrubias color illustrations.

It goes into minute details about the everyday life of the Typee. At times I felt a bit glassy eyed and skimmed forward over some sections.Melville comes across a bit dense and self centered, and obviously applied a double standard, one for whites and one for natives. After toying with the affections of a young native woman, he casually abandons her and does not seem to understand why her family would object. Perhaps he would have had a better understanding if he was abandoning the daughter of a prominant politician in New England.He was somewhat a nosy Parker, inserting himself in situations where he was not wanted, and showing little regard for the customs of the Typee.

When I drive long distances it is a favorite to listen to. Melville paints great visions of the south tropical Pacific Islands and touches so sweetly into the simple lives of simple living. It is full of suspense, intrigue, beauty, and laughter.

The great symbolic prose of Moby Dick is not to be seen here, but it is interesting to get a sense of the development of Melville's writing. This book is a semi-fictional account of Melville's experiences in the South Seas. While his own visit was a brief one, the hero of this book ends up in the Typee Valley for four months. Melville used numerous current accounts in order to flesh out this story. A strong point of this Riverside edition is that it also includes several of these sources, so that the reader can get a sense of what else was available on South Island life at the time. Most of these contemporary sources are imperialistic or surprisingly inaccurate. This is a good read for those who are interested in the development of cross-cultural relations between Westerners and the natives of the South Seas. Not surprisingly, Westerners come out in a bad light. It will make you question what the word 'civilization' means."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Herman Melville's &quot;Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life&quot; tells the story of a white sailor who lives for a time among the Typees, a native people of a Pacific island. According to a &quot;Note on the Text&quot; in the Penguin Classics edition, this book first appeared in 1846 in no less than four different editions.&quot;Typee&quot; is a marvelous story of cross-cultural contact. It is also a fascinating glimpse at a pre-industrial culture; Tom (known as &quot;Tommo&quot; to the Typees) describes in detail the food, dress, tattooing, physiology, musical instruments, architecture, warfare, religious practices, and social customs of the Typees. The book is full of vividly portrayed characters: the gentle beauty Fayaway, the &quot;eccentric old warrior&quot; Marheyo, the talkative &quot;serving-man&quot; Kory-Kory, and more.Melville's prose style in &quot;Typee&quot; is irresistible: the writing is fresh, lively, and richly descriptive. There is a satirical thrust to much of the book. And there is a lot of humor; at many points I literally laughed out loud. Such scenes as the description of a wild pig's frustrated efforts to break open a coconut really showcase Melville's comic flair.A major theme of &quot;Typee&quot; is that of the &quot;noble savage&quot; (Melville actually uses the term). The narrator often wonders whether Typee life is in some ways better than Western life, and is quite critical of the work of Christian missionaries among Pacific Island peoples. The book is richly ironic, as Melville's narrator reflects on the problematic nature of cross-cultural observation: &quot;I saw everything, but could comprehend nothing&quot; (from Chapter 24).&quot;Typee&quot; is more than just a colorful travelogue or a philosophical reflection; it is also a genuinely exciting and suspenseful adventure story. Melville's story of a visitor to a strange alien world curiously anticipates a major theme of 20th century science fiction; thus a novel like Ursula K. LeGuin's &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; would make a fascinating companion text. Also recommended as a companion text: &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; another 19th century American classic which casts a critical light on Eurocentric Christianity."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"This is not a review of the book \\"Typee\\" but only the Kindle edition. The Penguin edition is based upon modern scholarship, choosing among four texts to create one version that may be close to Melleville's original intent. But the Kindle version is full of typos, word substitutions, and other artifacts of optical character recognition. There is about one typo per pageShame on Penguin for offering such a corrupted version of what was a well-edited edition. Buy the paperback if you care about this."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"There are plenty of free electronic versions available of Typee. But I decided to buy this one anyway assuming that the time spent by the editors on the footnotes and on combining several editions of the work, would be worth the money. But to my disappointment, this Kindle edition is just a scanned version of the printed book with OCR software applied to it. The book is not divided into chapters, there is no link between the footnotes and their location in the text (I didn't manage to figure out what the numbers of the footnotes actually refer to) and there are frequent OCR errors. If you want to read Typee on your Kindle, there are probably better versions available than this one."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"If you're going to read an early 19th century novel, you better be prepared for a stilted writing style. Melville is certainly no exception. Particularly absurd is the dialogue. Did people really talk that way in the 1840s? I doubt it. Early Hollywood must have gotten its images of cannibals and South Sea island life from this book. Based in reality, the tome is Melville's first novel, and it was a great success upon publication. Most readers would never visit the South Seas, so they got their images from this. It did make me wonder what life is like there today. There's some tittilation in the descriptions of Melville's affair with the native savage Fayaway, a teen girl he takes up with while held captive by the Typee tribe. I wondered if they did it. Melville makes a pretty good crank when he rails against the damage done by Christian missionaries. I'd had this book sitting around since 1968 and finally decided to read it. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Typee was a difficult book to read but worth the effort. There isn't much plot beyond \\"Tommo's\\" rehabilitation at the hands of the Typee and his fears that they might be cannibals. Is he being nursed back to health or fattened for a future supper? As with Moby Dick, the bulk of the text is in the form of essay and commentary. There are lengthy discussions on the language, the architecture, the music (or lack thereof), taboos and tatoos, and diet of the Typee. These extra chapters though don't have the humor that is present in Moby Dick. They are still an interesting observation on one subset of Polynesian culture."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Under the influence of Defoe's journalistic style, Herman Melville wrote \\"Typee,\\" a combination of travelogue and novel about some weeks he had spent as a guest-turned-prisoner of a tribe of savages on a South Pacific island. How much of the account is fact rather than fiction is difficult to deduce from the tone of Melville's presentation, but the question of veracity doesn't diminish the entertainment value, because \\"Typee\\" is a colorfully detailed adventure yarn that reads like National Geographic crossed with Boys' Life.Melville is serving as a sailor on a whaling ship called the Dolly which is cruising the South Pacific and lands on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas, among the easternmost of the archipelagoes in the vast group known collectively as Polynesia. Deserting the ship because of the captain's tyranny, he and another like-minded crew member, named Toby, plunge into the mountainous wilderness of Nukuheva with the plan of later obtaining passage on another ship leaving the island, which has heavy French marine traffic. They enter an isolated valley inhabited by a tribe called the Typees, who invite them to live in their community. Melville and Toby accept the invitation because they have nowhere else to go for the time being, and the Typees seem friendly despite their reputation as cannibals.The Typees treat Melville (who has told them his name is Tom) extremely well, but they refuse to release him from captivity; Toby meanwhile has gone off to the harbors for medical relief but never returns, leaving Melville to describe the customs and activities of the Typees. Their religion is festive, but they have a strange relationship with their gods, whom they berate by abusing their idols. Their language, which has a tendency to double words, is quite comical to English-trained ears, as for example in their designation of the French merchants as \\"wee-wees.\\" The girls and the scenery are fantastically beautiful, but there are also dangers, such as the Happars, the rival tribe who occasionally wage war against the relatively placid Typees. Of special note is a young warrior named Kory-Kory whose brotherly affection for Melville could very well have inspired the character of Queequeg in \\"Moby-Dick.\\"The implications of the story are fairly simple, if overromanticized: Civilized man confronts the noble savage, discovers they are skilled artisans and healers and primarily peaceful fruit-eaters who eat human flesh only when it is that of their vanquished enemies; and, upon astonished reflection, realizes the corruption and the hypocritical facades of his own technologically advanced society. What would now be called political correctness was in the 1840s merely a perspective by an observant world traveler with no ideological agenda to push. But, although the valley of the Typees may be a paradise, it's not Melville's paradise, which is why he endeavors to escape his gracious hosts. It's a good thing he eventually did, because he had better books waiting to be written."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"The earlier reviewers said much of what I wanted to say, and for the most part, said it better. I'll try not to repeat them. One of the fascinating things about this book is how Melville could go back and forth from describing the Typee people as the world's happiest, living the best lives, to his own perspective that to become one of them would nevertheless be a most horrible fate. Near the end of his sojourn with them, their tatoo artist-priest becomes increasingly insistent upon tatooing the lids of Melville's eyes, but it is not the imagined physical pain of this that terrifies Melville: it is the fear that he will lose all ties to Western Civilization, which, almost in the same breath, he so effectively criticises. As an American school teacher in rural East Africa, I often noticed this love-hate relationship to our own culture among my fellow volunteers. Like Melville, we almost all &quot;went native&quot; and tended to see the best in the Africans' lifestyle. Like him, we constantly contrasted it with Western Civilization, and found the primitive life the clear winner. And yet, like Melville, we nearly all came home. In my case, when I did, I found that, after two years, American faces looked ugly, overstressed and mean compared to the African faces I had been looking at. Yet I stayed home, and they gradually started to look better. I was initially depressed by the filth, the environmental degradation, the aimlessness of so many lives back here in the developed world. I suspect this might have been Melville's experience too, and part of what drove him back out to sea time and again. And yet, in the end, home is home, and we all come back. You should read this book. Much of it, at least, is fast paced, exciting, educational, and profoundly thought provoking. Despite its rough edges, it may have been Melville's most imortant work. I'll let you know after I finish his sequel: Omoo."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Yes, it was a fun read, and my rating reflects not whether Melville succeeded in what he was trying to do - rather, my rating is a reflection on my enjoyment level.The imagery is beautiful in this intensely pictorial novel. The scene where the narrator's Polynesian &quot;girlfriend&quot; acts as a sail during his canoeing jaunt in the lagoon is one of my favorite mental snapshots, not only from this novel, but from American Romantic literature as a whole.But, just when one is relaxing into the somnolent atmosphere, Melville gives us pages upon pages of breadfruit recipies as well as detailed descriptions on the manufacture of tappa. All very informative, and in keeping with Melville's intentions in writing this travel novel, but these passages turned me off a bit.His next novel, Omoo, is laugh aloud funny, and a superior adventure novel to Typee."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Melville was 22 in 1842 when he deserted a whaling ship inthe South Pacific and was captured by a tribe of Tahitianheadhunters. His first novel, &quot;Typee,&quot; was borne from theseexperiences. Although his tale of life among thesavages proved hugely popular as an adventurous yarn,the book is memorable for its anthrological observationsof primitive tribal life: the young girls preparingbreadfruit and frolicking in the crsytal blue seas,the lazy weathered warriors wearing their tattoo masks andlolling in huts. Some people banned the bookfrom libraries. Certainly they objected to naked islandgirls engaging in free love, but what really angeredgood churchgoing souls was the author's antagonisticattitude towards missionaries. The book is America's firstindictment of colonialism and its withering effecton native cultures. Observes Melville, &quot;The sympathy whichChristendom feels for them has, alas!, in too manyinstances proved their bane.&quot; The exuberance that runsthrough these pages will wane for Melville in his lateryears. None of his other great works will be as widelyread. He will be considered a failure, fall into debt,suffer ill health. His son will committ suicide beforehis eyes. No one will buy &quot;Moby Dick&quot;; the crisp,unopened copies of the first edition will lie in awarehouse until they are consumed by fire. Theauthor will lapse into depression, madness.

I join the ranks of the multitudes who will forever wonder how much of its account is true. It would be so nice to believe that it is wholly true. But however true or false, the book leaves one (or me, anyway) with, at the very least, the most pleasant of dreams. The young Melville is the captive guest of the natives of a tropical isle, where life is forever lazy and paradisic. There are so many scenes that are memorable for both the attractiveness of their content and the author's tolerant and amused way of narrating them. In addition, beneath the charm and the humor runs a thread of menace. What a delightful mix for the reader! This book is either for light reading or for profound reveries about human social possibilities. Above all: Enjoy it.Note: I found Melville's follow-up book, Omoo, to be a total bore and terribly written. Hard to believe it was the same author."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"This is a true classic and should be required reading at some point in one's life.Melville lived with alleged cannibals, but they harmed him not. The Marquesas shouldbe on the adventurer's modern bucket list."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Typee, Herman Melville's first novel published in 1846, rocketed him into the public eye. He in fact did spend four months with the Typee people prior to the corruption of their culture by European contact. Written like a memoir, it is hard to discern what is true and what is fiction. The protagonist jumps the whaling ship that brought him to the Marquesas with his young mate Toby. They find themselves captured by a tribe living in Eden like splendor in a valley hidden from time. They are treated as royals with handmaidens and servants and every need taken care of. But, they suspect they are being fattened like a calf for slaughter as these people are known to be cannibals. This account is considered to be the most accurate description of the exotic customs of the early Marquesans. I was drawn to the story because in my talks about early Hawaiians from the same root stock there have been questions about whether or not they were indeed cannibals. The Hawaiians accused of eating the great navigator Captain James Cook deny that cannibalism was a part of their culture even though human sacrifice was commonplace. In Melville's account, the people were cannibals, but only the chiefs and high priests ate human flesh and it was done in a secret ceremony hidden from the eyes of outsiders. He describes the common people as loving kind, playful, and never cross with one another. There was so money so no acquisition or hoarding. Working together in communal harmony they shared in the bounty of their water-rich valley. There were feuds with neighboring tribes, but internal harmony prevailed. Melville who went on to write Moby Dick and numerous other South Seas tales died in obscurity."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"There is little evidence while reading Typee that its author would in only five years produce a major work of world literature such as Moby-Dick. There is the common fact that both of them are seagoing narratives that present much factual information delivered primarily to assure the reader of their authenticity as well as the proof that their author really does know something of the subject matter of which he is writing. Beyond that, however, they bear completely different intentions.Accepted largely as a factual account, Typee does, in fact, rely heavily on fictional invention woven quite skillfully into an account that stems from Melville's own experience among the Typee, a race of cannibals he encounters after deserting a whaling ship ruled by a tyrannical captain ported at the Marquesan island of Nukuheva in the South Pacific. Among other inventions, Melville expanded the three weeks he spent with the tribe into four months, although the perspective and attitudes of the narrator are most certainly shared with Melville.And so this is really a novel/travelogue hybrid, or novel masquerading as a travelogue. It can be seen as an example of a particular type of story that has appeared in many guises in the more than 150 years since its original publication--the adventure of a Western white man who, through an extraordinary chain of events, becomes the captive of an alien and/or exotic race of people with strange and unique customs. Other examples range from numerous fantasies of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Dances With Wolves and Planet of the Apes.Due to an infection in his leg, Melville (or Tommo, as he is called in the book) is kept by the Typees while his fellow escapee Toby is allowed to leave to seek medical help. Melville maintains a thread of tension throughout much of the remainder of the narrative. Tommo had learned to fear and dread this horrible tribe of cannibals but, surprisingly, they are very kind and solicitous of him. He wonders if they are merely being kind to lull him into a sense of complacency before they convert him into a special feast. They are benevolent captors that grant him extreme liberty within the parameters of his captivity, including the waiver of one of their taboos in tolerating his activities with the beautiful maiden Fayaway. Young women are not allowed in boats but upon Tommo's insistence they allow her to join him in short rides. The paradisiacal aspects of this serene, largely quiet and slow-paced life become nightmarish whenever he contemplates the very real possibility that he may never be able to leave this idyllic culture and will live and die their captive. Although he acknowledges many virtues of their culture and comes to admire and respect many of them, he resists succumbing to their customs completely. One can certainly feel his horror as he evades a tattoo artist insistent upon marking up his face and his dread that the king may order that he become \`one of them.'Other reviewers have criticized Melville's excessive descriptive passages. Yes, he goes on ad infinitum and tells me more than I would probably care to know about how to make tappas or how wonderful the taste of bread-fruit is but that is a characteristic not only of the true life adventures that were popular when Melville started publishing but of nineteenth century fiction in general, virtually all of which was produced before the emergence of the new narrative medium of film. It is also a practice that evolved with Melville into the extensive passages on whaling in Moby-Dick.I am not sure I would have sought out this book if I did not know that this author would soon evolve into one of the great American novelists. However, I do have that knowledge and I know that this young writer already possesses a great narrative skill and a mastery of language, both of which will flourish even more fully in the next few years. This book is especially impressive coming from a young man who has not yet emerged from his twenties. Taken as an apprentice book from the author of Moby-Dick it is a noble accomplishment. Taken as a novel fairly successfully passed off as a true-life adventure I can admire its skill and artistry. It made such a large impression upon its contemporary audience that for many years afterward Herman Melville was referred to as \`the man who lived among cannibals.'"},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is more of what Herman Melville does best. He offers an intellectually arresting argument about the nature of civilization while going into great detail about the every day life of a group of Polynesian natives in the Marquesas Islands.Typee was Herman Melville's most popular work during his lifetime. It is a partially autobiographical account of a man's time among a secluded tribe of Polynesian natives. \\"Tommo\\" escapes from a cruelly run whale ship and finds himself living among the Polynesian Typee tribe. The narrative is absolutely full of concrete detail about virtually every aspect of daily life among the Typees. Typee has everything from sensual descriptions of bare-chested exotic girls to treatises on island vegetation and edible fruit. The detail is stunning.Surrounded by all of this plentiful detail is an argument about the nature of \\"European\\" (and presumably American) civilization vs the untainted existence of the \\"noble savages\\" living in the Typee valley. Melville discusses these differences particularly in chapters 17, 26 and 27. Melville's discussion is earnest in its philosophical questioning and worth reading.Also of interest is Melville's criticism of Christian missionaries in the South Pacific. Although Melville writes in support of the aim of Christenizing Polynesia, he strongly criticizes the cruel methods of the missionaries.The Good: Part Castaway-style adventure story, part philosophical questioning of the nature of civilization and part anthropological text on the life of Polynesians, Typee has a lot to offer.The Bad: Many modern readers will dislike the amount of detail Melville goes into when describing things.The Bottom Line: Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life is an easier book to get into than Moby Dick. It has a lot of concrete detail, but its themes are simpler. Though lesser known Typee is a must for any Melville fan."},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"This book describes the story of Tommo, who finds himself in a valley with the dangerous (rumored cannibal) tribe of the Typee. Through a series of animatedly depicted scenes, Tommo's interaction with the natives is recorded first hand. Melville spent 4 years traveling through several Polynesian Islands and this undoubtedly influenced this book.Expect to see the typical Melvillian depiction of Christianity as oppressive, the culture of the innocent natives praised, all wrapped in the most creative/inventive/genius of language that Melville so strongly commands. My onyl critique is that the middle section of the book is quite slow, and his repeated explanations of the goings on in the natives lives becomes rather cumbersome to read. The volatile and exciting ending is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Typee: A peep at Polynesian life, during a four months' residence in a valley of the Marquesas","review":"Herman Melville tells a somewhat autobiographical tale in this story about time spent among cannibals in the South Seas. Somewhat autobiographical because there is a lot of fictional elements to this story.After ditching a ship run by a mad captain, our main character finds himself on an island with only one other person as they go through the jungle trying to survive on what little food they grabbed. When at last they find a tribe of the island, they are both wary and overjoyed. Because he has an injury, he is unable to leave with the friend and instead is left to the friendly hands of the natives, who really don't want him to leave anyway. So much so that they hold him as a very comfortable hostage. While recuperating from his injury he observes their life and how carefree it is and admires them as a people.While some elements of this book are autobiographical, I do have to say that Melville really isn't as interesting as the natives think he is. He is injured for the vast majority of the time so I'm surprised he held such a fascination to them. The natives were mostly fairly described and in fact compared favorably to his English brethren, which is a surprise considering the time it was written. I think the most derogatory thing that he wrote was that they seemed to like to be lazy, but would work when needed to. Compared to how he made fun of the English, its actually pretty interesting what he thinks of them.While Melville has a lyrical way of writing, I found this book to be very tedious. Yes there were beautiful descriptions of the island and its people that made it seem a very desirable place, but these were repeated over and over and over. I stopped caring about breadfruit around the fifth time it was described and some of the other repetitions grew old after the second go around. I just wish he had branched out a bit in his descriptions. I did find some of his adventures interesting but he describes these incidents far and few between.Definitely not one of the better books I've read in awhile. I know its a classic, but so much more could have been done with it.TypeeCopyright 1846260 pagesReview by M.

It operates on many levels, exploring complex relationships and an almost forgotten historical event, linking the two through the actions, needs and desires of the main characters.This is the dramatic story of a race against time to save the life of a child, two year old Sam Marshall. The adored only son of journalist Jo has contracted severe aplastic anaemia and his only hope is a bone marrow transplant from his half-brother, John, who is a close match. But John is missing, his fate curiously linked to one of history's enduring mysteries - the fate of the Franklin expedition - and he's lost in the most inhospitable place on earth.Essentially THE ICE CHILD is a story about the power of unconditional love and in particular a mother's love for her child. McGregor writes beautifully and has created a deeply moving story that will grab you from the very first page. This is storytelling of the highest order. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"I've gotta pick up books like this out of the blue more often! It was such a tremendous surprise to me to find a well-written and articulate novel, based on a historical happening that I had never heard about. Most of the other reviewers have given a good synopsis of the surface story in this book. A young single mother is raising her son after the accidental death of the child's father, who was an academic explorer. The child comes face to face with a catastrophic illness, aplastic anemia, and the only real potential donor is the step-brother of this boy, a young adult, who the mother had alienated by charging him with responsibility for the death of the father of both. The story revolves around the search for this step-brother who is blaming himself for the loss of his father, and trying to follow in his father's footsteps as a means of forgiveness and absolution.Underlying this poignant story is the true story of the 1845 Franklin expedition. I had no idea that even that late in the 19th century they were still trying to find a passage through the Northwest, over the American Continent. As per usual, the British need to explore and expand human knowledge, put them in the driver's seat. Two ships, combining sail and steam as the ultimate in technology at that time period, tried to make their way through the ice floes of the northern seas. Even with their best efforts including the metalization of the hulls of the ships and massive provisions from the new methods of storing foodstuffs in cans (for longer keeping), the ships were doomed to failure.I checked online to the great quantities of information available concerning the Franklin expedition. Such notable groups as National Geographic are STILL searching for evidence of these ships and the locations of both the ships and the men, who were never heard from again. Only a few buried bodies and a a couple of canisters with information written by the captains concerning the whereabouts of these great ships have been found in over 150 years.McGregor did her research and got the expedition information right, even though she had to create a 'voice' in the presence of a young boy on ship. In the midst of the heroic efforts of these men to survive and further the growth of human knowledge, the story of what actually led to their demise is horrifying. Once again, like with the shuttle Challenger, the greed of those men/corporations providing materials for these 'ships' doomed these men to almost sure death. In this case, it was the canned goods, which were sealed with tin that leaked lead into the meat inside. On top of that, the meat inside was often put in without prior cooking, and the temperatures reached for sealing the cans were not high enough to cook either the middle of the meat, nor complete the vacuum. This meant that the meats were raw, and over time became disgusting and putrid, as well as many of the tins contained botulism (one of the faster acting toxins even used in biowarfare today). There is written evidence of an inquiry into the tin cans from the 1850's and the exposure of this horrific negligence in order to gain more money by the man who supplied these goods to the royal navy of Britain. Once again, man's inhumanity to man raises it's ugly head.The book is extremely articulate, the pictures drawn by the author well-done. The agony of the mother and those who love this child who is going through chemotherapy and the push for a bone marrow transplant are accurate (as I've been through it with a friend's daughter who did not survive with leukemia).I went through this book in two days flat even with work and dissertation.Highly recommended!!!Karen Sadler,Science Education"},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"As an imaginative exploration of history's hold on us, this book deserves top marks. Through the device of three separate stories it succeeds in establishing the resonance of events, remote in time and place. Skillfully and credibly Elizabeth McGregor forges a connection between a disastrous voyage of polar exploration in the 1840s and 21st century Britain.Unfortunately, one of the novel's central supports, the modern-day story of a journalist, her polar explorer lover and their desperately sick child, fails to carry its weight. It revolves around a cast of poorly constructed characters with whom it is difficult to develop much empathy. The plot, thin at best, borders on the banal. Although exhaustively researched, that part of the story never really grabs hold, never rings true.However, Ms. McGregor is on much firmer ground when she takes us to the Arctic. There the story takes on a luminous life. The characters are compelling and the account of their ordeal moving. Here, the fruits of the author's research evoke fascination - as opposed to irritation. In the hands of this skillful writer the story attains a magisterial quality, worthy of the tragedy at its heart."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Although Elizabeth McGregor moves back and forward in time in her novel &quot;The Ice Child&quot;, it is so well written that no confusion abounds. This tale of obsession and romance will lead readers into new territories and through a myriad of emotions. The drama, action and authentic charactors keep you turning the pages through to the end. Well plotted and easily read.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"The Ice Child flips back and forth between two different stories. The first is the ill fated Franklin expedition and the second is about the man obsessed with the first and how that obsession affects his family. McGregor skillfully balances both stories while keeping you on the edge. Some scenes are predictable, but the book makes an engrossing summer read. It may not become one of your all time favorites, but read it for the harrowing scenes of the Franklin expedition and a mother who will go to any lengths to save her son."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Three stories -- one good, one thin but decent, and a third just hack writing in the thriller style. The good part of this novel is about the failed Franklin expedition -- interesting history, well-rendered, good focus on the boy, Gus and the second in command, Crozier. The decent story is of a polar bear, also well-researched and captivating. Tied to these two is the modern day story about the explorer and the journalist. The author creates stereotypes instead of real people. The story of the child is nothing but a tear jerker. The behavior of the half-brother, John, is extreme and unbelievable. And the idea that an intelligent and drop-dead beautiful woman like Catherine would fall for the warped John is absurd. Other than that, it's a decent read."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Meticulously researched double fictional saga about the Franklin expedition to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage in the Arctic in the mid 1840's and also about a current day attempt to find Franklin's lost expedition. I especially enjoyed the fictionalized account of a young sailor under Franklin's command. The entire tale was spellbinding. It was only in the last couple of chapters of the book that the story faltered for me and even then it didn't ruin the read for me.Another great fictionalized account of this expedition isThe Terrorby Dan Simmons."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"I got this book at a book exchange grocery store in Arkansas. I enjoyed reading it and am with many of the other reviewers who had never heard of the Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The mix of present day with past and the incidental story of the polar bear kept the book fresh and one could never declare they were bored while reading it. I came away feeling the book would make a great movie and with an insatiable curiosity about this expedition. I loved and appreciated the authors footnote at the end of the story. I gave my book exchange book to my friends in Arkansas to read and now must get another one for my Northern Wisconsin friends."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"I opened The Ice Child expecting to read an historical novel, informed by the abiding mystery of the lost Franklin expedition. What I got was a warmed-over romance novel, ridden with cliches and purple prose, its characters about as convincing as pasteboard puppets. It's too bad, too, since the parts of the novel actually set during the 1840's when Franklin was underway are quite decent -- McGregor could have written a fairly compelling historical novel, but instead has produced a mashed-up mini-series. Readers looking for a fully mature historical fiction drawing upon these themes would do much better to pick up Andrea Barrett's Voyage of the Narwhal, now in paperback."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Historical fiction is often difficult to read, but McGregor did a wonderful job blending a historical story (which she stayed very true to throughout the novel) with two other main story lines. Transitions were almost always seemless and, although a few chapters in I sometimes got confused with all the names and the switching back and forth, I am so glad I stuck with it. After those few chapters of getting to know the characters and their situations I was enthralled and didn't want to put it down for anything. Her characters are very realistic and the lives of the characters have become a part of me as though I were by their sides through their hardships."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Elizabeth McGregor's The Ice Child is not an entirely satisfying read. It tells the story of the Franklin expedition, from the useful device of a fictonal boy on board who grows into a man during the disastrous trip, and the it is also the story of people obesses with the Franklin expedition, including two half-brothers, both in danger of never growing up in their very different ways, one physically and one emotionally, and the women who connect them both. The book does have an emotional impact but the writing, at times, lets the story down. Some of the characters, particulary the grown son and his mother (the truly evil and selfish first wife) seem half drawn. The Franklin expedition sequences are quite exciting and the author keeps both stories moving swiftly and effectively along. For many, this book will prove a cool read in the summer sun. For me, the entire book did not live up to the promise of the best parts of the novel."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Although it's reasonably well-researched, this book never came together for me. The link between the modern story and the historical story of the Franklin expedition is tenuous at best. I kept expecting some real thematic connection to appear, and it never did. The modern story, with wooden characters and atrocious dialogue, is totally non-convincing. The story of the expedition is slightly better, but it grafts on unnecessary fictional elements to the very real drama of the actual events. Why bother to write a novel about a dramatic event if you're going to dilute the drama with poorly done fictional gobbledygook? There are scores of non-fiction books on the Franklin expedition and the fascinating aftermath that are far more gripping. (For starters, try Arctic Grail by Pierre Berton. It covers much more than the Franklin expedition, but when you see the story of the expedition placed in historical context, you get a much better sense of what happened and why, and a much better understanding of the characters as well.) Perhaps a good editor could have brought some unity to all this, but as it strands it's the movie-of-the-week version of a far more complex and intriguing subject."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"When Jo Harper falls for Doug Marshall, she falls for his obsession as well. Doug Marshall has an overwhelming obsession to find the truth about what happened to an Arctic expedition in 1845. The story jumps back and forth between what actually happened on the expedition, and what is happening in real time. But undertones abound, and with Doug Marshall's obsession comes a sadness so deep I felt it in every page. Doug has a son, whose life is all but ruined because of his father's obsession, and it is his son whom the story eventually focuses on. In bizarre and unexpected twists, Jo Harper and Doug Marshall's son become linked in spirit and in time, and the story becomes a race against life and death as one son's life becomes dependent on another son's recovery from a broken heart."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"This book was a different kind of story. It kept my interest. The two different stories, one a historical fiction and one a novel, both came together in the end."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"PICKED UP THIS BOOK--JUDGING BY THE COVER---I FIND A LOT OF GOOD BOOKS THAT WAY.I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS VERY, VERY EASY TO READ---WAS NOT A LABOR.THE WRITING STYLE BY THE AUTHOR IS WHAT DOES THIS JOB.THREE STORIES--MELDED TOGETHER---VERY INTERESTING.AS STORIES THAT SKIP AROUND---I FOUND THIS ONE VERY EASY TO FOLLOW---GOOD JOB!!"},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am fascinated by the disappearence of the Franklin expedition. This book provides another possible outcome of the lost expedition. The Franklin material is interspersed with the tragic story of Jo Harper. Harper's story is timely in that her son is in need of a transplant, and the lack of bone marrow donors available. The ending was kind of predictable, but yet I never knew for sure if the donor would be found in time...or would Jo's son perish as those Franklin pioneers so long ago. I feel the author could have used less Franklin material and shortened the length of the book (433 pages in the paperback). Still, all in all, an exciting story."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Only three stars because there are 3 stories here, but the \\"main\\" one isn't as good as the others. I enjoyed it enought to stay with it until the end. Guys will really enjoy the jump back in time (Mid-1800's) to the story of a very young man sailing away to the north Atlantic on a journey expected to take 2-3 years. That was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Prior to reading &quot;The Ice Child&quot;, I'd never heard of the Franklin expedition and was unfamiliar with past Arctic Explorations and the search for the Northwest passage. McGregor writes a story that switches from the Franklin expedition of the past to the present day tale of a mother trying to save the life of her ill son.The chapters of &quot;The Ice Child&quot; which are told from the point-of-view of a member of the Franklin expedition are remarkably well-done, involving, and educational. While we can already guess the ultimate fate of the Arctic explorers, I was still engrossed by their story and was delighted to learn what life as an 1845 explorer was like.The novel's present day story pales in comparison however. Nothing about the present day characters particularly grabbed me and I never felt emotionally involved with their tale. The central character suffers so much tragedy in such a short time that I felt I never got to know her. She merely moved from one tragic event to the next without ever becoming a fully developed character. This part of the novel was very weak, and for that reason I'm giving it 3 stars.However, two weeks after reading the book I find the story of the Franklin expedition popping into my mind at odd moments. I'm still haunted by their tale, and believe &quot;The Ice Child&quot; would have been a much better story if it had stuck with the Artic exploration alone."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"This is a stunning novel, a tale of two remarkable journeys, present and past, of suffering, endurance against the odds and huge courage. In one, a small boy and his mother battle against a terrifying disease; in the other, a crew of sailors and their officers struggle into the unimaginable bleakness of the arctic to find the elusive North-West passage that they hope will open up a northern route from the Atlantic to the Pacific.THE ICE CHILD has it all: from meticulously researched historical writing to a full-blown love story. The very personal present-day drama concerns the journalist Jo Harper and her young son Sam who suffers from aplastic anemia - a disease similar to leukaemia and which requires an urgent bone-marrow transplant to give him a chance of survival. Sam's half brother John is the most suitable donor, the only match so far: but John is obsessed with his father's legacy, the desire to discover the truth of what befell the mysterious Franklin expedition to find the North-West Passage, and he has disappeared.Sam's mother Jo's determination is truly moving and we are kept on the edge of our seats until the very end as she moves heaven and earth to save her son. The story cuts between the present and the past, and we see the historical narrative through the eyes of a young crew-member serving under Sir John Franklin. Gradually the truth of the tragedy that defeated the expedition is revealed just as the present-day crisis reaches its climax.The very diverse plot elements in this story are masterfully managed by Liz McGregor, who has the lightest touch with marshalling detail and paints sweeping backdrops against which to set her tale. The descriptions of the arctic, its flora and fauna, and the desperate struggles of the men on the ice are at once bewitching and heartbreaking. I have read several non-fiction accounts of the Franklin expedition; this was by far the most affecting because the novelist's license to dramatise has given Liz McGregor the freedom to portray in the greatest depth the motives, the experiences and the extraordinary valour of Franklin's men.I loved this book, and can't recommend it enough: it has something for everyone, and will touch your heart and your mind in equal measure."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"This is one of those books that I've owned for a while because someone gave to me and I just never got drawn into the story or desire to read it, until recently. Call the synopsis and artwork uninspiring or whatever, but I just would pick it up time to time and never decide to read it.It ended up that this fall, I was completely out of material to read in my home and decided to tackle this. I'm not sure why I had such a feeling of disregard going into this, and I will admit it may affect my overall review of the book and how I perceive the story.I felt the story just lacking. The most interesting part for me were the Franklin expedition parts, it seemed like everything else was boring and then when she'd write about the goings on with Franklin crew there was intrigue and interest there. It also had an air of ickyness for me just from the description of the rotted meat and the fact that I have a weak stomach.It reeked of depressing feelings and sadness, but in a lackluster boring way. I've read many sad stories before that told of triumph through crises and how people have overcome their turmoil. Over halfway through the book I realized that I was grimacing every night when it came to reading time. I actually said to my husband \\"God, time to pick my way through this horrid book again.\\" To which he replied \\"You say that all the time, if it's THAT bad, why don't you just NOT READ IT!\\"So, keep that in mind, I read only 1/2 of this book.Maybe it does get better.Maybe there is a story to learn or grow from.Maybe it turns into the best heart-warming tale ever told.But, the way I think of it is this. If you feel like gutting your neck for a whole book to get to the \\"good part\\", then the \\"good parts\\" aren't worth it."},{"Title":"The Ice Child","review":"Amazing story. Beautifully written.

His perception of the dynamics involved in relationships between men and women brings to mind the movie The Stepford Wives. In the movie, women are merely automotons, meeting the basic needs and desires of men, never needing to relate intimately with them or get involved in their lives. Rather than offering a hollow substitute, Dr. William Van Horn's book, The Seven Steps to Passionate Love, teaches couples how to enjoy a relationship of satisfying substance built on a solid foundation. You will not only learn what skills and tools are necessary to build and maintain true intimacy and passion in your relationship, but also how to heal the pain each partner brings into it. You will also learn how to break the destructive patterns that prevent lovers from effectively communicating. If this book had been available ten years ago, my husband and I would not have wasted so much time, money and energy on other ineffective books, tapes, videos and marriage councelling. We have literally fallen in love again and enjoy a truly intimate,loving,passionate relationship we never dreamed possible.

When I read &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus&quot;, I had trouble relating to the women John Gray described, so it was difficult to apply any of his teachings (most of which, by the way, seemed very sexist to me).Dr. Van Horn talks about experiencing love on a whole new level and that's exactly what my marriage needed. Now, my husband and I are even closer to each other than we were when we first met. It feels good to share this love again and it spills out into our relationship with our children and friends.

About 20 years into our lonely, workaholic marriage, I was seriously thinking about leaving him. Yet because I did not want to subject our son to the anguish of divorce, I started to search for books that could help us learn how to improve our relationship and deepen our love for one another.Two books helped tremendously: David Schnarch's Passionate Marriage, and William Van Horn's 7 Steps to Passionate Love. Each is brilliant in a different way. Schnarch's book helped us to see that \\"emotional gridlock\\" was inevitable in a longterm relationship, but that there were ways to grow individually and collectively into a much more fulfilling relationship. Van Horn's book has helped us to see what we must do day-to-day to create a more satisfyingly loving experience. Van Horn's book is lacking re design, editing, and proofing, but these are minor complaints. Today, we are a far happier couple because of the things that we learned from these two wise books."},{"Title":"The 7 Steps to Passionate Love: Why Men Are Not From Mars and Women Are Not From Venus","review":"I started seeing Dr. Van Horn in the summer of 1996 at a time in my life when I was severely depressed.

Dr. Van Horn teaches you the the truth about why you feel the feelings you do, and why you act the way you do and how to change!

It's an indepth introduction to vedic teachings. The easter philosophy is well explained with Chapters one to four giving clear insights into who and what is your real identity and vedas give an understand as to what life really is. Chapters Two and three explain how vedas influence great men of the decade and the vedic background info of its compilation. Fifth chapter focus on Law of Karma and reincarnation. The sixth chapter is on reincarnation of different lives in different bodies. Chapter seven describes a little about universe structure and heaven n hell. Chapter eight reveals the evolution theory and vedic spiritual growth with a cycle of repeated birth and death. Chapter nine gives an insight of human existence. Tenth and eleventh chapter explain how God is Supreme Power whose influence should be recognized in our everyday Life.Chapter Twelve speaks of spiritual world which is found only in vedic literature.I remember reading 'Our Daily Bread' booklets and having read Bible stories & Bhagwad Gita parts, do feel that Vedic Literature stands class apart when it comes to spiritual knowledge and it demands understanding and indepth reading.As most of vedic philosophy scholars know, originally refer original four vedas : The Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva Vedas. The book on Vedas refer to upanishads, Vedanta sutras, Brahmanas and aranyakas - all the texts revealing knowledge whereas the remaining parts of Vedic literature consists of the Mahabharata, Bhagwad gita, Ramayana and Puranas.Stephen's Book is must read for people who are trying to understand human evolution and existence and how to attain happiness, cause of suffering, real unity between us, how to achieve freedom, how to achieve individual and global peace, law of karma and incarnation, the Absolute - Supreme God realization and much more."},{"Title":"The Secret Teachings of the Vedas: The Eastern Answers to the Mysteries of Life Volume One","review":"The Secret Teachings of the Vedas is a great book to look into the lofty spiritual insights of the Vedic literature. I rarely write any such reviews, but I've been reading Knapp's books for some years now and have always found them easy to read and understand the uplifting nature of the Vedic philosophy. I also wanted to say that I don't understand how Henry Booth wrote in to say he was disappointed. It's as if he took a few points he had problems with and forgot all the other significant things in the book.Like he says Knapp believes you only go from one physical birth to another. This is absolutely untrue since the book spends many pages dealing with the spiritual realm, along with heaven, hell, subtle realms and subtle beings. If that is not life between physical births then what is? Maybe he just didn't get that. Or did he really read the whole book? He also says that Knapp doesn't buy the Big Bang theory, which he says is a proven premise. But that depends on who you talk to. Some scientists are already saying that the Big Bang theory does not uphold the law of matter and energy, and does not properly explain how various elements could have been created. Others feel that the superclusters in space are not what would be expected from an explosive model like the Big Bang, nor would the smooth nature of the background microwave radiation that is detected. So these and other factors point out that there has to be some other explanation. So maybe there is good reason why the Vedic literature does not support what some think is the Big Bang.So these theories are changing, as is always the case in science. But the Vedic literature does say that the universe is expanding, which is the premise from whcih the Big Bang theory was developed. So it perturbs me when someone writes a review of something based on their own lack of information. So let me conclude that this book on the Vedic viewpoint remains a great source of spiritual wisdom and insight. There are a lot of other points that this book deals with. No one will go wrong with buying this book."},{"Title":"The Secret Teachings of the Vedas: The Eastern Answers to the Mysteries of Life Volume One","review":"For too long, and for too many insidious reasons, the Vedas have been ignored, marginalised or just plain derided by Western scholars.

Full of \\"wages of sin are...\\" stuff. Very little love to be seen among the \\"punishing god\\" writings here. So narrow-minded is the author that he even disparages Advaita Vendata, which is a very legitimate school within the Hindu tradition. Describes India's greatest 20th century saint, Ramana Maharshi, who was an Advaita sage/teacher as teaching \\"Shaivism\\"; not clear if due to ignorance or confusion. In some of his other writings, Mr. Knapp also criticizes Shankara for corrupting Hinduism (Shankara is generally considered as historically the most famous teacher of Advaita). Preaches horrible punishments to anyone who is not a vegetarian. Does not seem to feel that any other branch of Hinduism, much less any other religion, has any redeeming merit. The author is a vociferous advocate of, literally, a \\"personal god,\\" which most Westerners studying Eastern spiritual traditions are not interested in, since they most likely would have stayed being Christians if they felt that that a \\"personal god\\" resonated with them (I will note for interest that even Joseph Campbell explicitly told a priest who was asking him about beliefs that he does not believe in a personal god). I felt dirty and sullied upon reading the book; it lowered my vibration, instead of raising it. If you would like an open-hearted and loving discourse on Hinduism, I would recommend instead \\"Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi.\\"Namaste."},{"Title":"The Secret Teachings of the Vedas: The Eastern Answers to the Mysteries of Life Volume One","review":"I had been looking for a good book for long to understand the basics/essence of Vedic Philosophy and got tired of reading books written by arm-chair authors from some university.

Stephen Knapp has been praticing vedic culture for more than 40 years and contributing significanlty to preserve and protect this highest knowledge that is universal. So, this is a practical book also. This book has truly inspired me and has brought some positive changes within me.I read a lot of books on self help, personality development, leadership (all time best-sellers) and I've to tell you that to be honest they are all mundane. I'm already feeling that I wasted all these years looking into all other books except Vedic Knowledge.

The book can't be faulted in its style of writing which is easy to follow - the issues I had were with the theology and \\"science\\". For example, Knapp rejects the idea that the universe started with the \\"big bang\\" which has pretty much been proven by scientists & nobody except a few fundamentalists rejects this any longer. The idea that the universe is bounded by a layer of earth & water is also pretty ridiculous. Knapp's argument against evolution of the eye is also pretty old and has been refuted by biologists such as Dawkins.Regarding the theology, I can't accept the idea that after death you are immediately plunged into a new physical body (animal or human) without having the chance to review your life & have some kind of input about what happens next, as has been explained by Michael Newton, Robert Monroe & various others. The idea that having sex outside of marriage will mean that you have to embrace a boiling hot body as punishment after death is barbaric and belongs back in the dark ages. But if this is what the Vedas teach then I can't fault Knapp's explanation of it in the book.On a positive note, Knapp's writings about detatching yourself from the material world are quite good & worth reading. The section on seeing spiritual India is good and there are lots of photos of temples which really makes one want to visit India at some point."},{"Title":"Barbapapa's Ark","review":"I loved the Barbapapa cartoons as a kid in the late 70's and early 80's and I am glad to introduce the Barba family to my child who loves them so much there is no day without the Barbas (we own both books and DVDs) !

It has not withstood well the test of time. On the basis of five trips to Spain during the 1920s, Ellis (the author of, among other works, a volume with the curious title, &quot;The Task of Social Hygiene) brings together here a series of brief essays, part travelogue, part pseudo-sociology, and packages them as an effort to identify the eternal &quot;soul&quot; of the Spanish &quot;race.&quot; For example, there are chapters on &quot;The Women of Spain' and &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; as well as on the cities of Segovia, Granada, and Seville (but not, curiously, on either Madrid or Barcelona). This book is not without worthwhile pages. For example, his discussion in the introductory chapter of Spain's democratic spirit is fascinating. Ellis is a good observer of human behavior and when he says that &quot;the Spaniard shows that he is entitled to courtesy by knowing how to return it&quot;, the strength of his observations lends credence to his judgement. Most anyone who thinks about Spain these days would tend to consider democracy as a relatively recent development, and in a modern, political sense that is true. Reading Ellis, we are reminded that there is also a social sense in which it is valuable to consider the term, and here Spain's history is quite rich.Ellis' artistic judgements are, on the other hand, often baffling, even comical. Of Spanish art he says the following: &quot;Aesthetic sensibility - Velazquez always excepted - meets us nowhere in Spanish art.&quot; His chapter on &quot;Don Quixote&quot; is uninspired; one wonders if he even bothered to ever read the novel. His final chapter, on contemporary Spain, offers some interesting insights into intellectual climate in which the group of writers know as the Generation of '98 was working.Overall, one would do much better reading a younger compatriot of Ellis, the always interesting Gerald Brenan, who spent a good part of the twenties living in Southern Spain."},{"Title":"One Eyed Fat Old Men","review":"Very good short stories that are sometimes very funny or sad.

Though not as exotic as Angel Lust or as adventurous and fast-paced as Harvest, this particular book is crafted on the premise that horror works best on a subtle, psychological level. It is also a testimony to the maturity that Perry Brass has reached in his writing technique. By eschewing its reliance on fictional locales, the settings of New York and Switzerland and the situations they present compelled me to read on.From a gay perspective, the characters were not as positive as I would have liked. I suppose that their flaws were simply meant to flesh them out as well as to imbue the story with a sense of humanity (a necessity in this genre). Thus, the characterizations of Allen and Destry were credible yet intriguing. The story was further spiced up by a host of colorful minor roles. Occultwise, howevever, I was never quite rewarded in the way I would have thought. Perhaps, this was the author's intent so that the air of expectancy would not be diminished. From the way Warlock resolves itself, I get the distinct impression that there's a good chance of a sequel.Perry Brass is a sensualist who seems to achieve his literary goals by incorporating mellifluous and very lyrical depictions of everyday actions into his narrative. The fact that he did not rely on the usual horror cliches enables this tale to keep its contemporary edge while exuding a Lovecraftian aura. Granted, this book is not for everyone. But then, neither is Lovecraft or gay erotica."},{"Title":"Warlock: A Novel of Possession","review":"This book was not what I was expecting. Or maybe it was, and I just don't know it yet. From the beginning, I just couldn't grasp what was happening in the story. The main character, Allen, is basically a frustrated gay man with a very poor opinion of himself, apparently centered around his small endowment. He is picked up by Destry Powars, a big hairy brute at a bath house who's rough look, vulgarity, and belittlement of Allen just make me wonder \\"Why?\\" Allen follows him home basically because he \\"couldn't say no.\\" Ends up going on a trip with Destry to Switzerland where some pretty wild things happen.The story just doesn't make sense. The characters are never really flushed out, so you don't know why they are the way they are. They ask questions that are never really answered. There is some mystery and possibly even a little horror thrown in, but it's usually barely touched upon and not fully explored. I mean are we dealing with warlocks, vampires, Satanists, or just some regular folks who follow a troll with some unknown magical powers? There's even a bit of erotica there, but it's not worth the couple paragraphs spent on it, as Allen usually goes on a mind-bending daydream during it so you forget what's going on.Overall, I think it can be entertaining, but there's a lot better stuff out there."},{"Title":"Warlock: A Novel of Possession","review":"This is my first Perry Brass novel, a celebrated gay author.It is impressive but I shall tell straightforward that my enjoyment was severely dininished by its unhappy ending. I know it is my own personal problem but I have this thing about romances going awry, unless of course the ending is operaticly tragic, in which case I can reconcile myself with it.This is basicly a romance, if a gloomy one. Not so young, not really beautiful Allen, obsessed with his tiny little penis, meets vulgar, charming, wealthy Destry (what kind of name is Destry, by the way?) but quite soon, while their intensely physical passion grows, things start going wrong: dark, hideous things start surfacing under the glossy film of Destry's life.Mr Brass chose to give kind of a supernatural colouring to his tale, frightening little and not so little touches of psychological horror, but he could just as easily have skipped all that: I guess the financial world of globalisation is dirty and frightening enough on its own real own.Anyway the result is duly scary, the writing good, the story fast paced, the book a page turner.I see just a flaw but unfortunately it is a major one, therefore the two stars (and it could have been one).The main hero, Allen, is simply foolish and unbelievable: curiosity is one good thing for a character, even necessary to keep the story going, but Allen simply cannot help but sticking his nose nearly everywhere throughout the story without learning better judgement from any of his bad experiences. It is hard to believe and too ordinary a device in the long run, not to mention that such a tract is inconsistent with the character as it is introduced at the beginning: a tiny little individual afraid of life who would never repeat blunders.There is a lot of graphic sex, but it really gave me a strange feeling of estrangement: its main point seems that of outlining an obsession, a grim sense of predestination."},{"Title":"Warlock: A Novel of Possession","review":"Allen Barrow is a bank clerk. He leads a quiet, ordinary life, with quiet, ordinary friends. In his mind, his most distinguishing characteristics are his tiny penis and his difficulty getting hard. And then one night at the baths, he meets Destry Powars. Destry doesn't mind Allen's shortcomings, and Allen performs much better with Destry, who carries him off to a spectacular apartment.The book here becomes a bit reminiscent of John Preston's Mr. Benson, without the S/M. Wealthy, dominating older man whisks younger guy out of his humdrum life into a world of power and privilege. Only in this case, Allen shares the privilege rather than serving it. But where does it come from? What is Powars' mysterious business, why is he carrying Allen off to Switzerland, who are \\"they\\", and what is their hold over Powars? What is in the locked room of his apartment, and what is in the odd herbal drink Powars insists Allen partake of? And what is it that Allen has that Powars' needs so desperately?A sexy, mysterious novel."},{"Title":"Warlock: A Novel of Possession","review":"Perry Brass certainly knows how to weave a fantastical story of eroticsm, sensuality combined with a stimulating story and unforgettable characters. A sad poignant start to this story begins with a non-descript man who is described in many, many terms as small, mild-mannered man with a small endowment, who leads a quiet life of unadorned annonymity within the gay community. A dead end life, with a dead end job. He is 'captured in spirit and body by a powerhouse of a man - wealthy, strange,powerful - a madly in love with this small man. A different love story (if you like these for a change of pace) Destry Powars loves like no other. Too late for everything. An ending like I have never read before!!

Long live Mary Wesley."},{"Title":"An Imaginative Experience","review":"Mary Wesley's charming, witty and poignant novel of grief and love opens with a young woman's impulsive act of mercy, as seen by two men whose imaginations are instantly engaged.Julia Piper pulls the emergency cord to stop a London InterCity train in order to up-end a sheep near the tracks, thereby saving its life. Maurice Benson, a self-described bird-watcher or &quot;twitcher,&quot; redolent of alcohol and tobacco, wonders if &quot;there might be a story there.&quot;Sylvester Wykes, a newly divorced publisher, recoils at the suggestion. He had received an impression of vulnerability, even despair, from his brief glimpse of Julia and when the train pulls into the station, contrives to prevent Maurice from pursuing her.For Sylvester it seems the incident will end there, but for his occasional musings. But Maurice is determined, partly to revenge himself on &quot;toffee-nosed&quot; Sylvester, to follow it up. &quot;He had what he liked to think of as a flair,&quot; developed during brief stints with the police and a private detective. &quot;Neither career had remotely satisfied those who employed him and in consequence had given him small job satisfaction.&quot;Wesley's dry and occasionally biting humor serves to underscore Julia's terrible loneliness and isolation. She has, we learn, just lost her child and her ex-husband in a car crash. &quot;Julia's mother raised her voice to a shout. 'It was all her fault, that accident; everyone knows Giles was a terrible driver.' &quot;The story meanders leisurely among the characters as Julia picks up the pieces of her life and Sylvester forcefully puts his own house in order, hiring a cleaner through the notice board in Patel's grocery. They communicate, sight unseen, through notes, until the reader begins to wonder if they will ever meet. The cleaner, naturally, is Julia, finding solace in the resurrection of Sylvester's garden.Meanwhile, the twitcher, growing more odious and bloated with every appearance, stalks her, his petty curiosity turning mean and sinister.Wesley populates Julia's neighborhood with a human comedy of venal sorts, none of them as horrible as Julia's monster of a mother, but all thick skinned to a fault.Discussing a party in Julia's apartment building one neighbor asks another if Julia is invited.&quot;Angie said, 'No one with any nous invites a woman whose partner's a drunk.'&quot; 'But he's dead,' said Janet.&quot;Angie said, 'They came once in the early days. He was belligerent, bopped someone on the nose, nobody we cared about luckily, but Peter said we mustn't ask them again. They were contrary to the Christmas spirit.' &quot;But in the way of a tightly contructed novel, which this is, the raucous party brings Sylvester and Julia (and Maurice) together, showing that even awful people have their uses."},{"Title":"An Imaginative Experience","review":"The book is what I wanted and it arrived on time, was in good shape."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"Not for everybody but full of info and down-to-earth experiences to help you get \\"into\\" the cowboy life."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"I am 63 years old and something of a reading nerd. something about this book rang my bell as a grand book first time I read it.

Yee Haw!"},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"This the second Time Life Classics of the Old West I've read. Life With The Apache was a little better 5 stars ( see my review).Andy Adams compresses a number of cattle drives together to make one in the book. He used a fictitious name but the main character is himself. He had 12 years total in the saddle as a cowboy. The first edition was in 1903.The original text was used and the publisher lets us know there may be some spelling mistakes as nothing was changed. There are several mistakes like did n't instead of didn't. A few misspelled words. INMO it did not detract from the reading. The book is a page burner and those interested in cattle driving will want to read on. I read the 387 page book in two days. Plus there are some nice B/W prints. Some of them are really great and I'd like to have lithographs like them to put on the den wall.The owner contracts out with the US government via The Blackfoot Indian Agency to drive thousands of cattle from Texas into Montana and hand over the cattle to the US government to be given to the Blackfoot Indian Agency to be distributed to Indian families. Foreman Flood and his handpicked team of cowboys do the cattle driving.We see the long 3,000 mile journey. A member of the team called Rebel ( ex confederate soldier) kills a man drawing guns on him in a bar who supports ex General Grant. The Rebel only wanted to relax a little in town and get a drink, but is insulted. We see another foreman (leading another herd of cattle) drowning ...horse and cattle swimming, a river. A sad eulogy by a minister. Lots of good food cooked on the range from the chuck wagon. We see the cattlemen giving 3 head of cattle to an Indian chief to feed his squaws and papooses. Also a group of rustlers who tried to sweet talk the cattleman to allow them ( the rustlers) to \\"cut\\" their cattle from the main herd. All a sham to just get some of the cattleman's cattle. The rustlers are delivered to the authority for justice. Lots of scenery description, events and more. A good description of Dodge city and the no nonsense gun shooting allowed by the town's law enforcement.Again we see how dangerous it was going through big steams and rivers as sometimes there was quicksand. About a hundred head of cattle get bogged down in quicksand under the waters of a river.A huge steer has to be destroyed as it got bogged down in quicksand and a number of horses, ropes and cowboys pulled and pulled to get it out. Unfortunately one of the steers legs was held by the suction of the mud so much the leg was completely twisted off. Gross!Good story telling around the campfire.I loved the part about hiring another man to make \\"Bear Paws\\"...donuts. He makes hundreds and hundreds of them. The word gets out how good they taste and cowboys from other camps come to eat his great \\"Bear Paws\\". Some say the best they ever ate in 40 years on the range! Also a funny card game to see who will get the spare turkey egg for breakfast. Each gets one but there is one extra. Another funny part is when the cowboys after a long hard day are trying to get sleep. A coyote gets in the camp looking for something to eat. One of the tired cowboy throws one of his boots at the coyote. In the morning he discoverers his boot went in the campfire and is all burned up.Those who want a true description of an 1888 cattle drive and learning about the life of real cowboys will appreciate this book. After the railroad connected to the various cattle producing areas and the receiving/distribution centers throughout the US the long multi thousand mile cattle drives were over and this part of the old west ended forever. Cattle ranchers could ship their beef faster, cheaper and easier.There is small part with a couple of miners. I would of given the book 5 stars if it would of had more occupations than just cattle driving. I liked the two Time Life Classics of the Old West so much I bought another nine used in the series and may buy more if I can afford it. The Log Of A Cowboy 4 1/3 stars and proudly added to our family library."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"\\"The Log of a Cowboy\\" was published in 1903 and tells the story of a five month long trail drive that took the circle-dot long horns from just a little south of Brownsville up into the Indian territory of the Blackfoot Agency - a 'pasear' of nearly 3000 miles.When I came to this book, I didn't exactly know what to expect. The only other western I had read since childhood was \\"The Virginian\\", a book that seemed very fictional (although I enjoyed it greatly). \\"Log of a Cowboy\\" is entirely different. It reads more like an autobiography -- which some historians have suggested it is. Certainly there is an authentic feel to the book that is unmistakable. Rather than being over the top, the stampedes and gun battles are underplayed, although they certainly maintain their own levels of excitement.My own response to the book: I found it hard to put it down. The story was full of adventure and cow and cowboy trivia and it was just plain fun. I ended my read with a great deal more respect for the cowboy and his craft. Who knew that cattle liked to bed down on higher terrain?!?Five Stars. Despite being fiction, \\"Log of a Cowboy\\" remains a wonderful historical resource. Persons interested in the Old West should find it a satisfying read, although they should not expect a overly polished presentation. And for those who are considering this book for younger readers it should be noted that there are some very non-PC(politically correct) speech and actions.

While not great literature (or is it?), it has a freshness that makes it fun to read. The sheer labor of the trail drives made them heroic! The image of hundreds of trail herds making their way north is awesome.Many modernizations of Andy Adams' original novel have been made. This one is easily readable and very enjoyable. Jack Hannah's song based on it, \\"Trail Drive\\", is true to this story that tells of trail boss Flood and the trail hands' adventures in Dodge City, as they \\"trail 'em slow\\" to Montana.If you yearn for a simpler time, love adventure, remember \\"Wagon Train\\" and \\"Rawhide\\" fondly, or just want to be transported to another life, this book will do it."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"The Log of a Cowboy is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville.

Adams was disgusted by the unrealistic cowboy fiction being published in his day; &#34;The Log of a Cowboy&#34; was his response. It is still in print, and even modern reviewers consider it a compelling classic. The Chicago Herald said: &#34;As a narrative of cowboy life, Andy Adams' book is clearly the real thing.

The writing is very descriptive to allow your mind to receive a clear picture of Adams intention of recreating the old west.After reading \\"The Log of a Cowboy\\", I felt I knew what the real duties of a cowboy were during the long cattle runs of the cowboy era."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"This was a very detailed and interesting account of a trail ride. Very interesting and historical 19th century account of everyday life."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"All has been said in the previous reviews ... this is a fabulous book which I have given to all my friends!"},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"My only comment is the author glossed over some of the hardships. There is a section of the drive where they have to round up the cattle after a stampede and go some time without sleep or food. He mentions this but doesn't dwell on it. I'm guessing this fits with cowboys not complaining in the face of hardship. Cowboy Up! Read this book!"},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"I am fascinated with roads ... their origins and the relationship between geography, humanity, flora and fauna.This book, while fiction, is written from first-hand knowledge of ten years on the trail. Andy Adams is a captivating writer; while this is not a page-turner, I found myself stealing minutes and then hours to read about the adventures of driving a herd of 3000 cattle from southern Texas to Montana. The nerve, physical agility, ability to live in the raw elements, the world of men, the tests of courage are all testaments to the backbone of the American spirit. I appreciated that it lacked profanity or violence which would have closed me down in a heartbeat. Andy Adams was born in Indiana and had my Midwestern values. He was willing to have a good time in Ogalalla while heading the counsel and advice of his foreman - well worth the read. Hollywood can't capture the authenticity of this writer. I'll probably read more of Andy Adams' works and check out Route 183 to see the terrain. I'm sure that it will match his description and I will make a guttural connection to the cattle drive experience."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"This book is a lot of fun to read, taking the reader back in time to a late-1800s cattle drive from Texas to Montana. The book is written well with spare prose, wit and exceptional details about a cowboy's often difficult and sometimes boring life on the trail. There's refreshingly little of the syrup found in so many western stories. It's written simply enough for pre-teens interested in the west, yet it will yield a lot of enjoyment for the seasoned reader."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"Andy Adams was a prolific writer, and thanks to the University of Nebraska Press, some of this former cowboy's output is still in print. This true-to-life story of an 1882 cattle drive is his best known, and its retelling 100 years later in Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; is evidence of its importance among early works of Western fiction.Here the protagonist is a young cowboy much like the author, who trailed beef from Texas to Montana at a time just after the buffalo herds were being extinguished from the short grass prairies and homesteading had not yet fenced in the high plains. Oklahoma was still &quot;Indian Territory,&quot; Little Big Horn was a recent memory, and Native Americans were in the last shameful stages of being forced off the open rangeland. The railroads were snaking across the land making frontier boom towns where law and order either prevailed (Dodge) or more often did not (Ogallala), and the vast cattle herds of Texas and Mexico finally had a market and access to it.Adams was born into this world and as a young man cowboyed during the height of the cattle drive era. His book is an account of one trek, delivering 3,000 head of cattle to the Blackfoot Agency in northern Montana. For the protagonist, the initial excitement wears off once the daily routine is established, and besides the occasional stampede and wet weather, the highlights of the journey are brief visits to the cowtowns they pass along the way and the many river crossings, some of which pose enormous difficulties.We get to know all the men in the outfit by name, and a few stand out, including Flood the foreman, McCann the cook, and the protagonist's trail mate The Rebel, who is older and wiser and something of a mentor. Other personalities emerge, primarily around the campfire on nights when the men get to swapping stories. And Adams passes on a lot of first-hand knowledge about trailing cattle, riding horses, and the day-to-day operation of a drive. Days and nights of the routine are punctuated by episodes of another kind: a rigged horse race, in which the cowboys lose several hundred dollars in wagers, two saloon shootings, the breakdown of the chuck wagon, pulling cattle out of a boggy river, meeting potentially hostile Indians, an encounter with cattle thieves, and a long drive across a waterless expanse of Wyoming.Reproduced from the original edition published in 1903, the text has an old fashioned look and feel that suit the subject matter and the prose style well. There are also five illustrations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; Adams captures the excitement and the reality of the old West before it was romanticized and mythologized by the movies and popular fiction. As companion volumes, I would recommend Ramon Adams' &quot;Cowboy Lingo&quot; and &quot;Come an' Get It,&quot; which provide much informative background on open range cowboying. With a good road atlas at hand, you're also able to follow the track of the drive across six western states, from Brownsville to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"I have found this to be one of the best western books ever written. Written 100 years ago it has the feel of life in the late 1800s not glossed or romanticized.If you're interested in this book take a look also at the website westwardho dot us. Although they don't intend to print fiction, they are thinking about making an exception for this terrific title. Why?The folks at westwardho say, \\"Log of a cowboy is so near to truth that it is hard to call it fiction. It certainly is more true to life than some of the news articles written in the recent past!\\"I appreciate much of the modern miracles we take for granted - internet, mobile (cellular) phones, satellite TV and the ability to produce tremendous, special-effects driven movies. Still, I wonder if we are missing something in all our instant self-gratification lifestyle...Don't get me wrong, I am not one to call the old days the good days. We not only have more luxury today, we also have more opportunity and greater political and intellectual freedom. I am merely trying to point out that many of us fail to seize opportunity and fail to recognize the value of our more primitive instincts.Read THE LOG OF A COWBOY and see if you don't also wonder. Then also try finding a copy of Africa's equal, MEMORIES OF A GAME RANGER.

It was written in 1903 by a former cowboy who gives us a clear and candid picture of the hardships of the cattle drive. The book provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses, the good points and bad points of the men we call Cowboys. In additon to telling the story of the hardships of the trail, the book gives us samples of the tales told around the campfire at the end of the long day. Recommended reading for anyone with an interest in the Old West; required reading for anyone who wants to write Westerns."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"I have completely lost track of the number of editions and printings I have seen of this book, over the years, and a quick search with Google will produce a number of different free e-texts available on-line. However, almost every edition known to me is missing an introduction; there is therefore (1) no information about the author, and (2) no information as to whether what we have is a novel written in documentary style, or an actual nonfiction account of a typical trail drive in the early 1880s.Well, folks, it's a novel, as the largely symbolic names for the characters might indicate: Priest, Flood, Officer, Strayhorn, Forrest, Blades, Wheat, Straw, etc., etc. I finally got around to reading it, and enjoyed it. Nothing spectacular or overdrawn--- it would not be surprising to discover that every incident is based on something that directly happened to the author or one of his cowboy sidekicks during his trail-herding days. All the classic situations are here, including visits to Dodge City and Oglalla, fiendishly difficult river crossings, stampedes, rustlers, con-men and segundos, chuck wagons and remudas, saloon gunfights and card-sharping. The number of 20th Century western authors who turned to this 1903 novel to obtain some authentic details to insert into their own trail-drive sequences is probably also close to uncountable."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"This is an excellent book about the life of a cowboy. It is told by a man who tells the story of a cattle drive he was on in the early 1880's. From Southern Texas to Northern Montana, we get an inside look at all of the drudgery and excitement he experienced. We gets vivid descriptions of a stampede, trips into Dodge City and other frontier towns along the way, stories around the campfire, crossing rivers, deserts, as well as a gunfight. The power of this book is Andy Adams' ability to put us right along side him as all of the events are recreated. His enthusiasm for and knowledge of the job of a cowboy gives a Western enthusiast everything he or she'd want to know. I found myself captivated by nearly every chapter. I don't have any complaints about the book except that the attitudes of the 1880's don't always fit in neatly with the political correctness of the present. Read the book and you'll find out what I mean and you'll also enjoy a very good look at an important chapter of American history."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"I'd give The Log of a Cowboy 5 stars as an excellent story of life on the cattle drive trails. It's a great read...But, the quality of this particular edition is very poor.Blurry print, ink blotches, and even some unreadable sections, makes this edition a poor choice. It looks as though someone just ran the text through a poor quality copier.Given a price of $38.00, I would certainly expect better.Try any of the paperback editions, and avoid this one."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"Jack Schaeffer and Elmore Leonard whetted my appetite for Westerns of high calibre, though I'll admit to suffering withdrawal symptoms subsequent to the death of the former and Mr Leonard's relinquishment of themes Arizonan.Whilst I look forward with keen anticipation to the eventual publication of Elmore Leonard's erstwhile uncollected Western stories, in recent years my disappointment with the present dearth of quality Westerns has been alleviated somewhat by three books of tremendous vitality that share a very similar, almost primitive, first person narrative voice.TRUE GRIT by Charles Portis, I've mentioned before and I'll enthuse about this book till I'm blue in the face. The other two books are stories by men who actually lived that long-vanished western life.\\"Andy Adams' LOG OF A COWBOY says the blurb on the book jacket, \\"is the classic account of life on the great trail drives of the old American West . . . from the southwest tip of Texas up to the Canadian frontier in northerm Montana.\\" That's U.S. 83 to twentieth century man - the Road to Nowhere, as it's ruefully known.And the third book in this trilogy of true toughness is Leroy Judson Daniels TALES OF AN OLD HORSE TRADER (as told to Helen S. Herrick).Again, I quote from the blurb: \\"When Daniels was born, the United States was younger than he is now.

Before I read it, I knew it was fiction, but after I read it I was very surprised to be reminded of that. Partly that is due to the spare style. If I was still in school I would want to write an essay comparing it to the Odyssey and Huck Finn."},{"Title":"Log of a Cowboy","review":"Andy Adams is one of the rare authentic 1800's trail riding cowboys who had the ability and desire to put his experiences in writing for us to read in future generations. He obviously realized that he had lived through a time period that would capture peoples imaginations for years to come, but that would soon disappear forever. What sets him apart from the others is his beautiful writing style, and flair for the dramatic. This story of a three thousand mile cattle drive from Texas to Montana is written in first person, and sounds for all the world like an autobiographical story. It is only the occasional reference to his main character, Tom Quirk, that reminds you that he is not describing actual events in a long cattle drive. But the details he includes, his knowledge of horses and longhorns, the stories told around the campfires, and his understanding of the sometimes bullish behavior of his cowboy companions, including their rigid adherence to the Cowboy code of the west, lets you know that he did experience this world in first person. He had ridden those trails for many years, and had seen the unfenced expanses of the American west in those glorious times. This is a book that deserves inclusion in any serious collection of Western history books."},{"Title":"Dead Funny (Modern Plays)","review":"Terry Johnson is one of the finest playwrights working today. If he is not as well known in the USA as he is in his native England, it is just that his plays have not travelled to Broadway where, I believe, they would be instant &quot;new classics.&quot;DEAD FUNNY is a brilliant dissection of two rotting marriages, friends who come together in the fan club they've created for the British &quot;low&quot; comedians who create laughter by pretending to be silly, sex-starved clowns. Perhaps the American equivalent would be Rodney Dangerfield, Lou Costello, Red Skelton or today's Adam Sandler...not the brainy, quick-witted stand-ups like Seinfeld or Joy Behar.It's a memorial service for Benny Hill which provides the setting for DEAD FUNNY. The hosts, Eleanor and Richard, a 30-something husband and wife who have long ago substituted excoriating wit for affection and their friends, Lisa and Nick, who seemingly have a happy, fulfilled family life, joined by their older, buffoonish friend, Brian for an evening of fun and games.This is a terribly funny, sad, bitter, hysterical, shocking play which deserves as big an audience in this country as it had in London during its long and very successful run. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"A Night of Watching","review":"My Danish-American mother gave me this book to read when I was 12. It's a pity that it's no longer in print, as I am looking forward to my own child reading it. The book's strength is its description of flawed and ordinary people who managed to do the right thing at a time when it really mattered. The book upholds the importance of affirming the value and dignity of individual human beings even if the goverrnment or prevailing ideology discourages doing so. A paean to ordinary decency."},{"Title":"A Night of Watching","review":"This book had a great impact on my life. Having met one of the members of the Dansih undersground after reading this book, and hearing his account, I was impressed by the ring of truth from the author. As a Danish-American, I was truly inspired by the heroism. I wanted to buy a copy for my Jewish-American friend, but was dismayed by the fact it is out of print. This book had a major impact on my general philosophy of life and how to behave in a moral manner. It shows regular people can be heroes. It should be recommended reading for high school kids as an uplifting example of positive morale acts. It is, for adults, an affirmation, in historical perspective, of decency and respect for other human beings.

It is also an excellent read."},{"Title":"A Night of Watching","review":"I found this book many years ago, when I was considering the non-violent ways people can respond to injustice and evil. I never knew about this story - as most people had never heard of Oskar Schindler at that time. The book was excellently written and provides a fascinating consideration of how one can remain a civilized person in the face of powerful and violent opposition. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good novels about war, obviously; but I would also strongly recommend it to anyone who liked \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" ...."},{"Title":"A Night of Watching","review":"My husband found this book in an antique store in Fennville, Michigan, in Sept 2009 and purchased it for me. It was a rare find indeed. Arnold's fictionalized story of the Danish Underground in 1943 and the feat of smuggling some 8000 Danish Jews into Sweden is a captivating read based on historical fact. The main characters are flawed, fantastic, and real. Many people are in fact a blend of good and evil and Arnold's story showcases the human conundrum of deciding what is right and wrong in a world gone awry. Arnold's eloquent prose carries the story forward and his keen descriptive abilities paint a marvelous picture of Danish landscape, the Danish people and their struggle to protect their fellow Danes.

Of course you have to suspend belief in certain scientific and geographical principles to enjoy them, but you are more than rewarded by the nonstop action and high adventure. If you ever yearned to explore a strange new world of marvels and monsters, then this is the series for you.This particular collection republishes three of the seven volumes in the series- including _At the Earth's Core_ which was the first. Pellucidar, in case you are new, is a subterranian world on the inner surface of the earth's crust. This world can be accessed by either drilling through the the crust or by natural openings at the poles. Burroughs inhabited this world with a rich variety of marvels almost around ever corner. These stories are a nonstop collection of survival, exploration, and empire building in strange and savage lands.If you enjoy this collection then you'll also want to track down _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_ where ERB sends his greatest character into his greatest setting.These books are especially good for escaping from the dissappointments and frustrations of daily life. I once locked myself in my apartment for over a week in grad school and read back through the whole series...."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"Introduced to the fun of writing in 2006 by Chris Baty's NaNoWriMo challenge, I met his challenge and commenced searching for information about not only editing, but selling my work. I bought Ms. Sander's CIGSP as a step toward my goal of making money from my writing efforts.I found CIGSP to cover the entire field of self-publishing, but weak in coverage of the details. Amazon's new CreateSpace hands the writer a powerful augmentation of POD, relieving the author of many publishing chores, freeing him up to focus on marketing his product. Amazon itself provides many ways to do this if one spends enough time educating oneself on their tools available."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"The book is well written and simplified. It arrived in great shape and was delivered in a timely manner as specified. Would shop with Selleragain."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"There are quite a few positive aspects about this book. It does give you a comprehensive guide to the different forms you will need to file for different entities to get your company off the ground as well as a few marketing and distribution techniques. However, you will have to plow through close to 200 pages of pure unadulterated drivel to get to it.I know this is a book for novices, in fact it was one of the reasons I picked it up, but it is written in such parochial language it almost bordered on insulting. The first half of the book is dedicated to explaining how difficult it is to be a self publisher and the different types of books that can be published (e.g. poetry, cookbooks, memoirs, etc...) It came off more as an extended guide a High School counselor would pass out to her students on career day than an actual guide for grown men to use to start their own publishing company.It also should be noted that the book is geared towards the publication of non-fiction titles, especially when discussing marketing and distribution strategies. Many examples that were used would not transfer easily into the fiction literature arena. And I also found it quite disconcerting that the author referred to her own titles so frequently. It would not have been so confounding if it were not for the fact the titles she kept referring to were non-fiction titles geared towards the self-pampering of housewives and career women. She often referred to the seminars she attended on luxury cruise ships and the high end department stores where her books were made available. I could not help but wonder what would be the equivalent for fiction titles that revolved around inner city life, blue collar romances or hate crimes.I appreciated the overall description of the nuts and bolts of the publishing industry and what is needed to actually publish a book under your own imprint. But this information was found much too late in this book and not terribly informative for self-publishers of fiction titles.For what it's worth, this could have been condensed into a twenty page pamphlet and it would have had the same effect."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"I guess I expected so much more.

There are plenty of reasons to self-publish, not all of which have to do with wanting to make a profit in a niche market that might not be received so well (or marketed so well) by a traditional publisher. For instance, you might want to preserve family history and memories for your loved ones. You might want to publish fiction, which operates by somewhat different rules than non-fiction (much of TWFSP could apply to fiction as well, however Bowerman makes no bones about the fact that fiction is harder to turn a profit from when self-publishing). You might have a novel idea for a gift product that loosely falls into the \\"publishing\\" milieu.In these cases, you might find Sander's CIGSP to be an equal or better resource. She addresses her book to anyone at all who might wish to self-publish for any reason, and thus covers these aspects better than Bowerman does. There are some other areas in which the CIGSP differentiates itself from TWFSP. Sander comes from a more traditional publishing background originally, unlike Bowerman, and this informs her assumptions. Her marketing suggestions are more mainstream, where Bowerman believes in highly-targeted campaigns that take advantage of whatever niche your subject falls into in order to maximize your return on time investment. Where Bowerman keeps suggestions regarding the choices involved in publishing your book as simple as possible, Sander goes into a great deal of detail regarding everything from paper weights and colors to typefaces and even embossing choices--wonderful if you're planning on creating gift books or the like, but potentially confusing if you're going for the comparatively plain, practical books Bowerman assumes.Sander's book does a good job of providing an overview of self-publishing and handling the myriad of reasons for getting into the business. However, if you're a non-fiction writer looking to make a serious profit, I think TWFSP would do a better job of telling you what you need to know."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"This book was disappointing for several reasons.Not enough real info as far as how to go about getting a book out there to sell, unless you're doing a stapled or comb-bound type of book you can have printed at just about any local copy shop.No discussion about why you would want to trademark a title (she says she'll discuss it, but never does).Endless mentions throughout the book of the author's other books, which, with the one exception of the first one she actually sold herself, add nothing to the education of the reader as far as self-publishing goes.Too much time/paper spent on the pros/cons of self-publishing, instead of info on how to go about doing it.There is a little useful information in this book, but borrow from the library first, before buying."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Self-Publishing","review":"First - What's good: - I was going to be snide and leave this part blank but that is unfair.

VERY much focused on Non-Fiction! Very little appreciation of changes to the industry since about 2003 or 2004 - its a rapidly developing world - this book is either dated or the authors would prefer not to provide insight into those changes.

It reminded me greatly of career planning guides given to sophmores and juniors in high school (in the 1960's and 1970's) which seemed to say - don't think outside the box and you will be very happy in your 8x8 cubicle.There are MANY other EXCELLENT books an this subject - See Aaron Shepard, Dan Poynter, Morris Rosenthal, The Rosses - take your pick.

That was helpful. I would have liked more resources though - tools for marketing and distributing a book and examples of letters, press releases, etc would have been helpful. I felt like this guide skimmed too much of the surface without diving in deep.Also, it is not as helpful to someone considering the POD route to publishing, as a lot of the book is focused on the aspects of publishing the POD's like iUniverse do for you. I would really like to see a book focused exclusively on succeeding with a POD publisher.All in all, this is still a worthwhile read.

So how exactly she was chosen to write a book about self-publishing is odd.The self-publishing she writes about is old school. Doing it how she suggests would take you years and cost $10,000-$20,000! It makes sense she feels this way since she really comes from the old school big publishing house world where she worked as an editor and it takes an army of corporate drones to publish one book.She did have some decent information on formatting and a press release template which was nice. It's also a good read to understand how crazy the old-school self-publishing and big publishing companies really are, that is why I rated it 2-stars.But if you want to learn how to self-publish in the 21st Century, pass on this book.

Sewing skills are needed but once you have followed the directions and made the suggested pattern adjustments as a master pattern, you can adjust any commercial pattern to fit you perfectly with very little fuss.

This is the ONLY place I have gotten information on how to adjust a dolman and a raglan sleeve for a larger then standard bust.This book assumes you have no fitting skills. It tells you all the tools you will need. They tell about fitting shells and why shells from different pattern companies might serve you better.

I was extremely disappointed, as the authors address only basic fitting for slight adjustments in flat patterns, which are not usually helpful for adjusting to persons with real shape problems and especially not helpful for those with a very large bust. Also, the book does not address the many small adjustments that are necessary for a really great fit.

My hips are 3-4 pant sizes larger than my waist, a very definite pear shape no matter what my weight, so I needed LARGE alterations to have pants that fit both in the hips and the waist.

But the book by Julie Gilbert, Edna Ferber's great-niece, was the only Ferber biography I could find, so I decided I would start there to learn about Ferber, and I'm really glad I did. Is the Gilbert book objective? Of course not. No one writes objective biography.I applaud Gilbert for her courage in presenting Ferber as a real person, exposing the extremes of her personality. Ferber was outsized-she had a benevolent heart coupled with colossal rage: \\"When Ferber got worked up over an issue, there was nobody who could touch her. She was a dervish of indignation. When she was calm she exuded power; when she was upset she exuded great power.\\" Katherine Hepburn, twenty years Ferber's junior, says: \\"We were dangerous women. There aren't any more of us around.\\"I give the book only four stars for two reasons: One, because I wish Gilbert had included photos. I love the image that Gilbert writes of Ferber and her sister Fan looking together like a Diane Arbus photo: \\"visually similar and visually sour.\\" A picture of these two together would have added a lot to the book; and two, because Gilbert doesn't include sources. Perhaps most of Ferber's papers are still in the family's control; regardless, I would like to have known where Gilbert found her information.That being said, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in Edna Ferber, and also in New York, theater, and party life of the 1930s. Whee, Ferb! Wot a girl!"},{"Title":"Ferber: Edna Ferber and Her Circle: Paperback Book (Applause Books)","review":"This is a biography of an unusually successful and an unusual woman. Though some of her more well remembered works survive through countless productions of Showboat and viewings of the several versions of the movies made from her plays and books like Giant, Cimarron and Stage Door and the endless productions of her plays, she herself is less well-remembered than other groundbreaking female writers like Edith Wharton. Yet, as we learn from this biography, she was probably one of the most successful American writers portraying the grandeur of this vast country. And as she was able to portray the role of women in creating the patterns of American families, she herself was a powerful and independent woman. This biography tells her story from a point of view of an insider. Julie Gilbert writes of her grand-aunt in a way that describes her through the author's personal vision and then goes back to review Ferber's earlier years with outside research and access to intimate personal information that would be otherwise unavailable. Ferber's story is as fascinating as her stories and this biography is fun and informative. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Ferber: Edna Ferber and Her Circle: Paperback Book (Applause Books)","review":"Is there a renaissance of interest in the writings of Edna Ferber? Stamps were minted honoring her this past summer [2002], and now the reissuance of this biography, written by Ferber's greatniece and originally published about 1978. I hope this indicates a resurgence of interest in her writings -- but you would be better served to read Ferber's writings themselves, than this biography.I've been in love with the writings of Edna Ferber since I was 12 and someone gave me a used edition of \\"Amreican Beauty\\". I realize that she won't go down in the annals of the classics of American literature, such as Faulkner or even Carson McCullers: her writing lacks the quality of universality, and I suppose, self-discovery [on the reader's part]. But she is great at the sociology of America, at giving the reader an intuitive feel or understanding of an era or people. I even did my first term paper in high school on her: \\"The Effects of Minority Races on the Writing of Edna Ferber\\" -- and I still remember with pleasure the note the instructor wrote, to the effect that my love for Ferber's writings was apparent.So although I had read reviews to the effect that Ms. Gilbert did not let her closeness to her aunt affect her objectivity, I couldn't resist reading it. I was prepared for her to be critical. I was not prepared for her to be vindictive and viperish. She related Ferber's life backwards: 1960 to 1968, 1952 to 1960, 1938 to 1950, 1916 to 1938, etc. -- so you begin by seeing her as a crochety old lady [and indeed, this was the bulk of the book, rather than the period in which Ferber was writing -- although I suppose it is understandable, as that is when Ms. Gilbert would have known her] without having any idea what made her that way.What did come out was that Miss Ferber took over of the support of her extended family [besides her mother: her sister, her sister's 2 children, and their children] -- and that the family felt some guilt at this, and I felt Ms. Gilbert's book was an attempt to whitewash the family's guilt, saying in effect, \\"See, it wasn't easy for us, we had to put up with this disagreeable old lady.\\" When she sticks to facts, it isn't too bad; but she's always jumping to pseudo-freudian conclusions, or attaching a moralistic interpretation to the actions of others. For example, although she quotes letters of praise from Noel Coward [who was not a person to suffer fools gladly] fairly frequently, she usually adds that the work \\"wasn't Ferber's best\\" [I wonder what she did feel was her best?] and that he undoubtedly did it out of friendship. She makes numerous allusions to a freudian problem which Miss Ferber had in her relationship with her mother, but during her tale of the early part of Ferber's life, never mentions anything to provide support or justification for such comments. If someone outside the family had written it, I'm sure they would be subject to a lawsuit for libel and inneundo.The biography is entitled \\"Ferber and her Circle\\", but is only tangentially about her \\"circle\\"."},{"Title":"Poems (English and Italian Edition)","review":"Natalia Ginzburg published in &quot;Das imagin&auml;re Leben&quot; one poem by Franco Fortini. I want to read more from this author."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"The Mirror's Cracked from Side to Side is a quotation from Alfred Lord Tennyson, \\"One fled the web and floated wide; The mirror crack'd from side to side; \\"The curse is upon me\\", cried The Lady of Shalott.' Christie uses this quote as the theme of terror and murder in her novel. This book was published in 1963; it is the final Miss Marple mystery which takes place entirely within the confines of St. Mary Mead. Miss Marple is very elderly in the novel.The murder occurs at Gossington Hall where a movie star named Marina Gregg and her husband Judd Rudd are recently installed.During a reception for the film star a local woman named Heather Badcock dies. An autopsy shows that the middle aged woman died after ingesting six times the normal dose for a sedative called Calmo. There are two other murders in the book by the means of being shot and another death by cyanide being placed in a nasal atomizer.Ther are fewer characters than usual in a Christie novel. Your reviewer proudly guessed the murderer! This is not an earth shaking Christie novel but it has been filmed (featuring Kim Novak, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson) and seen on the BBC in 1992. An interesting footnote is the dedication of the book to Margaret Rutherford the actress associated with the role of Jane Marple."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"My two favorite Christie mysteries are \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" and this \\"Mirror Crack'd.\\" I like Ackroyd for its stunningly clever twist-ending. I like this book for the stunningly true-to-life motive it reveals for the murder.When you get right down to it, most fictional murders are motivated by \\"McGuffins.\\" Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term \\"McGuffin\\" to indicate the artifact that sets the fictional characters in motion. It's usually something like a jewel stolen from an ancient Hindu statue, or a cache of money stolen from drug dealers. In more sophisticated stories, the McGuffin is often not a thing, but an emotion like some obsessive thwarted passion. This last does motivate some actual people. Still, as presented on the page, these murderous obsessions usually have at least a whiff of room deodorizer about them. They're manufactured to smother all the messy stew of emotions that motivate real people in real life. They're trumped up to bring the fiction to dramatic closure - like one of those famous perpetrators in a Perry Mason mystery who breaks down on the stand yelling, \\"Yes! I did it! I did it! He was leaving me, after all I'd done for him...\\"However \\"Mirror Crack'd\\" stands almost alone in presenting a truly authentic motive - a motive that derives from the kind of everyday, but oh so deadly, offense that might drive any of us to homicide.This is a good book to launch you into an appreciation of Agatha Christie if you haven't read any of her work yet - and a must-have for any established fan interested in starting a core collection of her books."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"One of Miss Marple's best stories - takes place in the same location as, and years later than, The Body in the Library. Probably contains one of Aggie's most striking twist endings, maybe because it's so tragically heartbreaking. As usual in a Christie book, the characters are well defined, the plot nicely structured and the writing: swift and descriptive. The beginning especially is well-drawn as Marple reflects on the modern world slowly creeping up on her quiet but eventful St Mary Meade. Overall: an excellent doozie you can read in one or two days."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"this book is ,with single word,wonderful.there is no point in prolonging."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This book is extremely readable, and, while the case itself is not one of Agatha Christie's most complex, the denouement is definately a shock and Miss Marple is delightful all the way through. The characters in this novel are not typical of the Miss Marple books: Marina Gregg, a famous film actress, is the most luminous character, hardly a likely addition to St Mary Mead. This novel can also be seen as an interesting social document, for we are informed of all the changes to which the village has been subjected in the 1960s, including &quot;the development&quot;. However, the Marple atmosphere is retained almost intact, and the novel does not disappoint. The ending is interesting and unusual, too, though the reader would not be advised to attempt to work it out for himself, as clues are not in abundance. Not quite classic Christie, though as enjoyable as always."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"The world is changing for elderly Miss Marple. Her little village of Saint Mary Mead is being taken over by modern innovations such as supermarkets and development housing, leaving the elderly spinster a little befuddled, especially when she's confined to her house with a procrastinating gardener and an overbearing house-nurse. The doctor suggests that the cure for Miss Marple's current restlessness is some \\"unraveling\\", and she agrees - if only there was a mystery to unravel!But luckily (for Miss Marple and the reader, at least) there's a murder on the way. Miss Marple's old friend Dolly Bantry has long-since sold her home Gossington Hall (the crime scene ofThe Body in the Library) but only recently has it been come into the possession of the actress Marina Gregg and her latest husband. A gifted actress but with a nervous disposition, Marina is certain - in her childlike way - that she will finally find her happily-ever-after in Saint Mary Mead.It is not to be. During a garden party to raise money for the Ambulance Association, one of Marina's guests falls suddenly and unexpectedly ill and is dead in a matter of minutes. The deceased is a scatter-brained woman named Heather Badcock and the cause of death is a drug overdose administered to her in a tampered cocktail. Yet there is no reason that anyone at all would want to kill a simple village woman; it seems far more likely that the poisoned drink was for Marina.It's clear that the actress knows more than she's letting on: during the party Dolly Bantry noticed an extraordinary expression come upon Marina's face as she greeted her guests; an expression she can only describe by misquoting the lines of Alfred Tennyson'sThe Lady of Shalott: \\"The mirror crack'd from side to side / \`The doom is come upon me,' cried / The Lady of Shalott.\\" It is this strange, frozen look that holds the key to the murders that follow, though naturally it is only Miss Marple and her preternatural gift of recognizing human behavior that can get to the bottom of it all - with a little help from reoccurring police inspective Dermot Craddock.Though not Miss Marple's best mystery, \\"The Mirror Crack'd\\" still remains an enjoyable and intriguing read. With her usual deftness at describing the paradoxes of human life, whether it be the insecurity of movie stars or the inconsiderate nature of kind women, Christie fills the novel with suspicious suspects and masterful misdirection. Drawing heavily on Tennyson's poem for inspiration, there is a certain tragic grandeur to the proceedings that aligns quite nicely with the fate of the Lady of Shalott. Furthermore, there is no doubt at all that this novel was influenced heavily by 1940s actress Gene Tierney; so much so that revealing anything of her biography would immediately ruin the mystery. Look her up on Wikipedia *after* you've finished the book.Perhaps because my reading experience was rather spoilt by having watched the1980s film starring Angela Lansburyprior to reading, but some aspects of the mystery felt too broadly telegraphed, and many red herrings are introduced only to be dropped abruptly with no resolution. There's quite a lot of padding concerning Miss Marple's domestic arrangements, and at least one anecdote involving a young engaged couple that Marple passes on the street is completely pointless. Looking back, a good portion of the story feels like filler.Still, no Agatha Christie mystery could be deemed a waste of time, and \\"The Mirror Crack'd\\" is a diverting read that may even fool long-time readers with its twist ending; a solution so mundane that it's almost terrifying. Some of the most frightening crimes are the ones you could easily imagine yourself committing..."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This is not Christie's best, and though it's a great Miss Marple story in terms of developing her character and giving us a glimpse into her life as she ages and England changes (though still stays fundamentally the same, allowing her sleuthing skills to be just as good as they ever were) it's really a sub-par mystery.The entire thing revolves around a film star and a woman who dies at her party after accepting a glass that the star was supposed to be drinking from. Obviously the intended victim was the star, and there seem to be plenty of people who'd like to do her in. Inspector Craddock does the leg work as Miss Marple reads film magazines to help her solve the puzzle, and occasionally goes for a walk. The problem is that along the way to solving this mystery (which I regret to say I was able to figure out on my own, for the third time since I started reading her novels) there are a lot of false clues which never get followed up on. Normally in one of her books, all the false clues are resolved somehow and some explanation is given for why they seemed so mysterious and what was really going on even though they weren't the answer to the main mystery. But this time, it's as if Christie simply forgot to add the finishing touches. For example, in the beginning of the murder investigation a police officer mentions how suspiciously a character is behaving and vows to check up on that person to see what the reason might be. But the character never shows up again, and apparently has zero bearing on the crime. On the other hand, characters who DO have some role to play are highly under developed, abruptly killed off within a few pages of each other, or revealed to be someone else in a \\"twist\\" that feels like something Christie just threw in at the last minute since there was no hint of it at all. As a matter of fact, once you read the ending, you realize that just about everything between that and the crime at the beginning was just fluff and filler to help cover the fact that the explanation for the murder was so simplistic. SO simplistic that even I was able to figure it out, and was therefore pretty bored by all the red herrings drawn across the path, rather than intrigued.Overall definitely not up there with her best efforts, which is why it's not famous like many of her other books. There are a lot of relatively obscure Christie books that deserve a lot more accolades than they've received, but this is not one of them. Recommended for Christie completists only. See if you can guess the ending too!"},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Signet edition?

There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now?

Soon the investigators decide that the drink may have been intended for Marina because a long line of ex-husbands and betrayed wives would have a motive to kill her.

It seems at one point that the next murder might be committed by Miss Marple herself.This is a well constructed plot and the clues are there for the observant reader.

Even Col. and Mrs. Bantry's lavish Gossington Hall (the scene of the crime in &quot;The Body in the Library&quot;) has changed. After the Colonel's death, Mrs. Bantry put the house up for sale and it has now been purchased by the American film star Marina Gregg and her husband Jason Rudd.

The world around her is changing. This is one of only two Christie novels where I was able to guess the identity of the murderer. It's a very good murder mystery, but it could have been a better Miss Marple mystery. The best parts of the book are when Miss Marple is on the spot. Unfortunately, I almost began to wonder if Miss Marple would be in this novel at all. She left her house no more than three times and was therefore decidedly shoved into the background. The parts without her were rather dull, dry, and far too abundant. I found myself rushing more to see if I'd solved the mystery correctly rather than out of any sense of real enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This book has the best murder motive of any mystery I've read. The characterizations are strong, and I like Miss Marple here as I always do, but it is the motive, as well as the ingenuity of the murder itself, that makes this book memorable.

Besides the charming old village, there is now a supermarket and a modern neighborhood of tract homes. Despite the physical changes taking place in the area, however, human nature remains a constant.Having taken up residence in the local manor house, movie star Marina Gregg hosts a cocktail party. When one of the neighbor ladies suddenly dies from poison, it appears the fatal concoction might have been meant for Marina.Aside from Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple is probably my favorite fictional detective. Her quiet way of getting at the truth is always clever and insightful. She's a delightful character, and Christie can be relied on to create a fascinating plot. Despite the seemingly unconnected details, the clues are there if you can just decipher what they mean. The outcome always ties up the loose ends very satisfactorily.If there's anything to criticize here, it's that our dear old Miss Marple has become so decrepit that she must have a somewhat annoying companion and, since she rarely gets out of her house, her actual presence in the story is more limited than usual. Christie relys on other characters for most of the legwork in this tale and they aren't quite as engaging as Jane Marple. We just don't get the usual clicking knitting needles to the extent that Miss Marple fans have become accustomed.That minor criticism aside, this is another first-rate Christie whodunit. It isn't my favorite Miss Marple mystery, but it's pretty darn good just the same. If an entertaining muder mystery is what you seek, THE MIRROR CRACK'D will fill the bill. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Life has begun to change in St. Mary Mead, or has it?

Miss Marple is beginning to feel her years and now must have live-in help (thoughtfully supplied by nephew Raymond West). Some things however, remain the same. The new arrivals have the same problems and flaws as the old with murder as the inevitable result. Although forbidden to garden and no longer as adept at knitting Jane Marple is still quite capable to ferreting out the solution when a young woman is killed in a failed attempt in the film star's life.For Christie fans, particularly Miss Marple devotees this is a must read. It is nice to catch up on village life, visit with some old friends and meet some new ones. It is particularly comforting to see that Miss Marple is doing well and up to her old tricks of beating the police to the punch.

Without the burden of numerous side stories, Agatha succeeds is drawing the setting of a murder mystery that not only quite convincing, but also extremely fair. For the experienced detective reader it is possible to catch the killer before a third of the story is told, there is even a very clear hint on the first few pages. It is just the challenge to not let Agatha change your mind before Mrs. Marple explains what at the end is so terribly obvious.Trivia: the motive of the murder is based upon a tragic accident in the life of actress Gene Tierney (I cannot explain further, because that would ruin the story).This story is clearly one of the reasons why Agatha Christie is still rightfully known as the Queen of Crime."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This Christie mystery is really more simple and pleasant than some. The motive to the murder was legitimate and you feel almost sympathy with the murderer. The conclusion is summed up in a few words--nothing too complicated like One, Two, Buckle My Shoe or others. And you needn't feel confused or tied up in a tangle of evidence and clues--those are few and far between.If you are a fan of the sinister or like your mysteries dark and complicated, this simply isn't your cup of tea. I have to admit, although I don't always like the simple, pleasant mysteries, that Christie knew what she was doing. Can you see Miss Marple chasing after a serial killer across continents wielding an assault rifle and going down in hand-to-hand combat? No, never. So Christie was wise and keeps her characters in their natural habitats doing realistic things. That way she knew her mysteries and her detectives would receive respect and credulity--quite important for the success of her books."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This is an excellent book by Agatha Christie. I read And Then There Were None and I thought that was the best book I had ever read. After reading The Mirror Crack'd I have changed my mind. A great boild up with a shocking ending."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"As Miss Marple has always said, small villages allow one to observe all the possible sides of human nature. Such is the case in Miss Marple's small village of St. Mary Mead, when film star Marina Gregg and her husband buy an old mansion, hoping for a peaceful life. Yet when a poisioning occurs during a party at the mansion, all thoughts of a peaceful life are shattered.Miss Marple herself is wishing for a more peaceful life, recovering from and illness and disliking the woman who has been sent to live with her. She soon becomes embroiled in the mysteries surrounding Marina Gregg, who is certain that the poison was meant for her. When more deaths occur among those who live in the mansion, Marina is desperate to leave, but must allow the police to carry out their investigation. But of course, Miss Marple makes the most of her idle time to research and piece together the reason why that first death had to occur, and finds the murderer in their midst.\\"The Mirror Crack'd\\", which makes much of Tennyson's poem \\"The Lady of Shalott\\", is as quick-paced as all of Christie's mysteries. The wide cast of characters, with storylines that may seem superfluous at the beginning, all contribute to the mystery at hand. As usual, the twist of an ending that seems to be Christie's forte, is fitting and believable."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"I confessed that having read most of Agatha Christie's mysteries, and a fan of other mysteries as well, I correctly predicted the true killer and victim of the murder of one Mrs Heather Badcock in The Mirror Crack'd From Side To Side.In this novel, Ms Marple was many years older (30 years after her first appearance in Murder in the Vicarage). She was necessarily less physically active but her mind was as keen as ever.The title was taken from Alfred Tennyson's the Lady of Shalot:...Out flew the web and floated wide;The mirror crack'd from side to side;'The curse is come upon me,' CriedThe Lady of Shalott....It referred to the face of actress Marina Greggs, observed shortly before Heather Badcock died from drugged wine glass which was originally meant for Marina.The setting was Ms Marple's village of St Mary Mead, the scene of the crime was Gossington Hall, the very same mansion in which a previous death was discovered many years before in the novel The Body In The Library. The Hall had passed through several hands since the Bantrys in the earlier novel. In this novel, it was just renovated by the new owners; film director Jason Rudd and his wife Marina Greggs. Marina Greggs was making a comeback after several years of recovering from a breakdown due to giving birth to a mentally deficient child.On the day of the crime, Gossington Hall was venue to a local fete and there were numerous visitors. Ms Marple herself however, did not appear at the Hall until much later. However, she was informed of the events and interviews by many other people, some like local \\"gossip\\" of Mrs Bantry her old friend and Ms Knight her companion, others more official like Chief Inspector Dermot Craddock who apparently continued to hold enormous respect for Ms Marple's insight. Readers were not always told the specific words given to Ms Marple, but they were given first hand accounts of the interviews.Several crucial clues were given in very subtle manner but they would only be meaningful to readers who did not start on the wrong premises. I was fortunate enough to bring with me the skepticism developed as a mystery fan not to take anything at face value and hence I was able to come to the conclusion pretty fast. That however did not diminish the pleasure I derived from reading the book.Another aspect which made this novel interesting was Agatha Christie introduced new types of characters, or at least characters with fresh and different portrayals. One of her maxim was either a study of the victim, or a study of the crime, or a study of the culprit, would reveal all. Readers could use 2 of the above to solve the crime for themselves."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Miss Marple is in her element at St. Mary Mead amidst the church, the vicarage and the Blue Boar. The many people who make up her old familiar network are also there to help her indulge her passion for sleuthing. The most important lessons from this mystery concern controlling women and their enablers. Miss Marple knows how they work and she tells us all about the havoc they bring into the world."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Very difficult Audio CD to listen to. Reader has very strong accent and a lot of the words seem slurred/mumbled, voice dips low. Very hard to understand. I am quite disappointed."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"This isn't Christie at her best. The solution was too obvious (I knew it pretty much instantly, although that could be just me) and there are too many red herrings thrown around. During the book you get more and more sensational revelations, but they are never really cleared up (not that they matter...). The end feels rushed. A lot of stuff happens and then it's suddenly over."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"I would select The Murder of Roger Acroyd & The Moving Finger as her best but The Mirror Cracked is up there. Not going to rehash the plot or the killer except to wonder if Ms Christie might have gotten the original idea from the true story of what happened during WW11 to the actress Gene Tierney. Ms Tierney gave birth to a daughter who was severely retarded with other physical disabilities. Many years later, so the story goes, Ms Tierney met up with a very over the top fan who told her that despite having German measles, she had gone to a Bond rally to meet up with her favorite star. Ms. Tierney just was stupified when realizing that this woman had given her German measles (not known at the time, I believe, for birth defects in the first 3 months of pregnancy). I wonder if any other Christie fans might know more about this story?"},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"The first tape was broke,so I actually didn't get to listen to the tapes, but the seller has said he would refund the money."},{"Title":"The Mirror Crack'd","review":"Miss Jane Marple is the main character in several of Dame Agatha Christie's mystery novels. She is a small, old woman who lives in the village of St. Mary's Mead, England. Her eye-sight is beginning to fail. She is very plain looking, which allows her to blend into the surrounding wherever she goes.Miss Marple has never been married. She lives with Miss Knight, her caretaker. Miss Marple's nephew, Raymond, sent Miss Knight to work for her because Miss Marple's doctor insisted that she have someone with her twenty-four hours a day. Miss Marple doesn't like her very much because Miss Knight babies her, and Miss Marple wants to take care of herself. Her uncle is Canon of Chichester Cathedral.Miss Marple is a very friendly and smart person. She enjoys knitting a lot, but because of her bad eyesight, she drops many stitches, and her doctor told her to start unraveling her knitting rather than knitting it. She is very talkative, sensible, and spunky.She is very good at solving murders, which is her job. She is a detective. She does her detecting by going to the site of the murder. She also researches the background of the suspects, reads newspaper and magazine articles about the victims, and talks to the suspects and the people who know them.All this made Miss Marple a very unusual and very popular detective. She appeared in a dozen very popular novels by Agatha Christie.Agatha Christie's own life has a mystery, too. In December, 1926, she disappeared from her own home. The day after she disappeared, her car was found abandoned and the police started searching for her. They found her ten days later, staying at a hotel using an assumed name. She never told anyone where she went or what she did during those ten days.Dame Christie wrote more than seventy-five novels. She wrote about Miss Marple and about Hercule Poirot, the strange little Belgian detective. She also wrote plays. Her most famous, &quot;The Mousetrap,&quot; ran non-stop in London for twenty-one years. She was created a Dame of the British Empire in 1971. She died in 1976."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"Crystal is 16-year-old girl who has the begging stage of a modeling carrier, in her hometown New York. At first modeling is exciting for Crystal but soon it becomes less about her and more about her body/appearances. When her friend Rowena goes to the hospital over stress and trying to kill her self, Crystal realizes modeling is hard work and not fun and games. Especially when she has a big movie deal with the famous movie writer, Joe Sidney, he tries to get in her pants and make her do things she doesn't want to do, like change her name. Crystal also has the pressure to model from her mom, who could have been a model too but never through with her aspirations, and her dad, who wants Crystal to experience different things but also make a good living.This book had allot of different conflicts but the only thing that really irritated me was that they wouldn't say the problem was resolved or something else happened you would just have to keep reading and figure it in the next chapter, which was very frustrating but kept me reading!I thought this book was well written and had a very good plot line. When the plot line got stared it seemed like it would be predictable and the more you read it wouldn't go as predictable as you would think. I also think this was a good book because it showed a different side of modeling and its not all about the glamour and being famous. It made you think about the dark side of some models have to do. The only bad thing about the book was that the ending wasn't very interesting, it just basically wrapped of the book up and finished with a bad ending, I think the ending would have been okay if their was a sequel to Crystal that explained more about her decision and her life more."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"Walter Dean Myer's novel Crystal (1987) is about how a 16-year-old professional model living in New York learns the truth about what it takes to be in the fashion world. This book is recommended to grades 8-12 and also anyone who wants to know what the fashion industry is like.At 16, Crystal Brown is in the spotlight as a black fashion model. The world of money, bling bling, fame, and celebrities are all a part of her life. Her career take a lot of time away from family, friends, school, and regular teen attributes. As a model, Crystal has to work with a photographer with a bad temper, and an agent who is very demanding. While Crystal's mother is very supportive of her daughter's success, her father is very protective of his baby girl. In the end, Crystal is stuck with making a career decision that might change her life.I like this book because it tells me what the fashion world is and what it's like to be in it. The kind of conflict seen in this book is Man vs Society. The novel is effective because it shows how Crystal has to deal with all types of people in the fashion industry and try not to break. The strength of this book is that it teaches you how to survive in a competitive world of fame. The weakness of this book is that it doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat like I thought it would. I think people who are interested in getting to the fashion world should read this book because it shows you the inside world of the fashion industry. This book kind of reminded me of the book Just Say No by Omar Tyree because both show you the inside to the life of fame. Although both show you the inside life of fame Just Say No is more interesting to me because I want to be a singer so it can tell how the music business works .So I recommended this book to grades 8-12 and also anyone who wants to know what the fashion industry is like."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"CRYSTAL is a fine book with an important message. I love the vivid pictures of the modeling world, and the way Crystal herself is such a real girl. She's beautiful, but you won't hate her for being so lucky, because Myers keeps her real and presents the downsides of modeling and Crystal's life being devoured by it. While it's aimed at girls ages 10-14, older girls would enjoy it also.The only reason I took of half a star is the ending. I won't spoil that for you, but if you've read it, maybe you noticed that Crystal has no ther talents, as far as we know, besides her modeling. If Myers had developed her poetry more, or schoolwork or acting or anything, given her a talent besides being gorgeous, then I would be more satisfied. Perhaps she could have gone into a different, less sexy kind of modeling; cereal ads, TV commercials, whatever; or maybe she could have a talent like poetry (which she has, but it's not mentioned very often) that she could turn to.But I really loved this book. Myers is so good at thinking as Crystal would: for example, Crystal is meeting a new person, and it says something like \\"In her mind, Crystal made the woman up. Powder, a less ridiculous lip color, mascara...it didn't help.\\" Of course, a model would think of make up. It's so perfectly told. I also like the fact that Crystal is black, and beautiful. It teaches African-American girls that they don't need pink apple cheeks and golden hair to be pretty--and also, that your looks are tiny compared to what's inside you. All in all, it's a terrific book, well-researched and brilliantly told. Read it!"},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"The book Crystal, by Walter Dean Myers was a good book in my opinion. This book was a great acount of what life is like to be a teenage model in America. Crystal is a drop dead gorgeous African American fashion model in New York City with a big modeling career ahead of her. Crystal overcame many obstacles in this book. There was always pressure for her to stay thin, look beautiful, and date the right boys for publicity purposes. In this book, Crystal went on many photo shoots where the photographers criticized her and told her that they didnt think she was pretty enough, or that she was too dark. Crystal learned to balance her modeling career along with her education. This became stressful at times for Crystal because she would have photo shoots in the morning, then go directly to school until late. Crystal's mom was always pushing her to do more modeling because she was a model herself when she was younger but her career never went anywhere. Crystal's dad is very protective of his daughter because he knows that she is very beautiful and doesn't want her to date any guys. Her photographer and agent try to pressure her into taking more seductive photos and wear more seductive clothes for the photo shoots, but Crystal doesn't want to.Crystal develops a strong friendship with a fellow model who she works with. Crystal's friend didn't take all of the pressures of modeling as well as Crystal did, because she didn't have any family or friends besides Crystal there for her. She ended up overdoseing on pills. Crystal visited her in the hospital with hopes that she would live."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"Crystal Brown is just beginning to achieve success in the competitive glamorous modeling profession. She is a high school student by day and a participant in a fast-paced lifestyle in the evenings. The direction of her career forces her to decide which is more important to her - fame and fortune or self-respect. Athough the universal appeal of Crystal might not be as strong as other works by Myers such as Bad Boy or Monster, his character development and narrative are of high quality."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"Walter has given us a blunt view of societal point about models. The modeling industry has looked as women and men as \\"money\\" or \\"sex objects\\" rather than human beings;as mentioned in the book. What has been miscontrued is that glamour does not make the individual, but the individual makes the glamour. Crystal was wanting to be recognized to live as a normal individual and a young adolescent girl. She was noticing that her grades were declining and she was losing a good friend by the name of Pat, as well. Crystal had the modeling business set for an innocent road in making money or a career, but her agent Loretta, photograper, and movie producer Joe Sidney had other plans in mind. Also, Crystal did not want to ruin her friend Pat's reputation. Pat was intelligent and had a future as well as Crystal. Tragic happens to await during the time Rowena and Crystal begin to communicate more profoundly and become friends. Their careers were at different pivotal points, but Crystal was developing stronger in the modeling business, while Rowena was getting weaker in the modeling business. Rowena felt sorry for herself and did not want to admit she admired the strength that Crystal had inside her. I left it to my imagination to figure that Walter Dean Meyers, wanted us to infer on the boy at Rowena's mother house may have been Rowena's son. I don't recall Rowena mentioning about whether that was her brother or son, or whose child it may have been. Crystal was a very matured teenager, which she had the support from her church, Sister Gibbs, father, friend, teachers, along with many others. She understood that God had given her that talent to model, but not to use in vain. She made a very wise and mature adult decision to live as a regular teenager throughout all the disappointments, which made her much happier than her mother's dreams/nightmares. Opera was her mother's choice and modeling was somewhat of Crystal choice until other immoral decisions were made for her. I can relate to Crystal in modeling, because I used to model about her age, which I was 16 and a half at the time. I graduated from Barbizon Modeling School, which the modeling agency offered me a contract to go model in Richmond, Indiana as a full-figure model. I decided to decline the offer, because I felt like Crystal morally, because there was too much at stake being in my youthful."},{"Title":"Crystal","review":"This was a nice book.

It is a classic that most people have not expirienced. As older book go, it has a slow start, but eventually becomes a great story of a boy on his first commision on a ship with an abusive captain. The survival aspect of the book and the strength of these men's convictions makes this a wonderful story. The trial seems so unfair and upsetting.

Read this exciting book and I guaranty that you will love it's adventure and suspense. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"Though I am not typically an action and adventure reader, Mutiny on the Bounty is one of my favorite books. After borrowing it, I read it for the first time as an adult and enjoyed it enough to read the remaining two books in the trilogy. Several years later, when I wanted to reread the series and found that my father had gotten rid of them, I added them to my Christmas wish list.I find myself carried along into the time period, caught up in the stories of the various participants. There is a reason this book is something of a classic. Though I cannot name what exactly draws me into this book and back to it, it's very definitely there. I do think that the writing is very good, and the story quite engagingly told.However, this is fiction. William Bligh's name has been unfairly blackened for the majority of people due to this book and the sequels that follow. When going back to the source materials from the general timeframe of the mutiny, we discover that much of what the book says is patently untrue. Bligh is portrayed to have flogged his sailors frequently at the least provocation. In reality, Bligh believed that floggings were to be avoided if at all possible. He ordered maybe seven floggings in seventeen months, a rate much much *much* lower than that of the average sea captain. This is just one example. The problem was that two of the mutineers came from prominent families that several years after the mutiny did everything they could to blacken Bligh's name to make the crime of their family members seem justifiable. And this was a time period when the story of a crew standing up to their unfairly tyrannical captain and going off to live on a tropical island was very appealing and romantic. For more information, I would recommendThe Bounty : The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty.I would rate this story a 5-star for story-telling, but because it engages in inadvertant character assassination, I'd bump it down to a 4-star. The authors probably didn't know any better having read many of the popular history materials of their day. But, the end result is still that Bligh has been to a large extent denied the praise and acclamation that he deserves for his open-sea boat voyage and other accomplishments, as well as having his name become synonymous with cruel tyranny."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"From Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall comes a timeless saga of the men who served aboard the H.M.S.

I highly recommend it as both a thoroughly enjoyable read and an account of a historically significant voyage."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"This novel has recieved much attention over the past fifty years as one of the finest nautical adventure novels in western literature, yet if one gives the work a close reading, even more may be apparent. Nordhoff and Hall's most well known work (the subject of three different motion pictures) begins a trilogy that measures up well to more epic works as well. The enduring story, and concequently myth, of the &quot;Bounty&quot; has only grown in prominence since the 18th century, and this American novel is its finest narration. From Coleridge to London to Michner, many writers have been influenced by the historical tale. Nordhoff and Hall, coming after all but Michner, combined careful research with vivid characterization and dramatic scenery. Despite its popularity, this is a fine novel"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"I recently decided to try reading some classic books. Mutiny on the Bounty was the first one I tried. Although some of the navigational and shipping vocabulary was unfamiliar to me, the plot of the book and the triumph of good and truth made this story one of the best I've ever read. Better still, it is based on actual events! I think you'll agree with me that Captain Bligh makes a most agregious villian-his parts were almost difficult to read. Still, Roger Byam's heartfelt account made this a fascinating read. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"The story of the Mutiny on the Bounty is actually a trilogy of three books. \\"Mutiny on the Bounty,\\" is the first, detailing the mutiny itself and the fate of several of the mutineers (and some innocent bystanders) when they are eventually caught. \\"Men Against the Sea\\" follows the men who were kicked off the ship when the mutineers took control, and \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" is the story of 9 of the mutineers who were never caught because they went to live on the remote and difficult-to-access titular island.The captain of the Bounty, one William Bligh, is painted as an embezzeler who is also harsh on discipline. He bullies the quatermaster into signing false consumption reports (and then sells what isn't eaten at port), threatening to hang anyone who disagrees with him. Similarly, he is a harsh disciplinarian who orders flogging for the least offenses, regularly insults his first mate (Christian), and is quick to invoke the Law of the Sea to keep the men in line, rather than trying to win their affection and respect. Eventually, he pushes Christian too far, which precipitates the mutiny.This book is probably the least interesting of the trilogy. It follows a standard narrative structure, being narrated by one (fictional) young officer that Bligh believed to be part of the mutiny. Because of Bligh's testimony, all those left aboard the Bounty (however unwilling) were guilty of mutiny, which sets up the situation where the narrator must depend on the testimony of mutineers to prove his innocence. But overall, there is something meandering about the story that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the book. The most interesting aspect of the book is how well it relives the golden days of British seapower and how it demonstrates the difficulty of the average seaman when faced with a petty tyrant for a captain."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"\\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is the first entry of a very interesting trilogy that includes \\"Men Against the Sea\\" and \\"Pitcairn's Island\\". What makes the trilogy unique is that after the events of the famous mutiny the second half of this book and the next two novels all happen simultaneously as the crew members of The Bounty split up into three groups. The primary novel follows Roger Byam, the stories narrator, who departs with the mutineers but was not in fact involved in the taking of the ship. \\"Men Against the Sea\\" is the story of Captain Bligh and 18 members of the Bounty crew who were set adrift and their voyage back to England. The story of Fletcher Christian who led the mutiny and his group is chronicled in \\"Pitcairn's Island\\".\\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is a first person account of the true life taking of the Bounty by Lieutenant Fletcher Christian after an intolerable amount of verbal abuse heaped on him and the rest of the crew by Captain Bligh. This is the only classic novel I can ever recall reading that has two authors; those being Charles Nordhoff and James Normal Hall. In fact the two collaborated on around a dozen different books none of which I had ever heard of besides Botany Bay and that was only because of the usage of the name in Star Trek. The writing is very similar to the style of the times which uses a formal, sober third person account of mutiny. Sometimes these older books can feel a bit dry but Mutiny on the Bounty is anything but. Nordoff and Hall don't demonstrate the poetic skills of a Rudyard Kipling but this is a magnificently well written book. This is one of those books where there authors make writing seem effortless. The pacing is well done dividing the book into three parts. First is the lead up to the mutiny and the mutiny itself, then we have Roger Byam's time in Tahiti and finally Byam's capture and return to England to stand trial.If you ever want to know how treacherous the life of a sailor is this is the book to read. Ironically Captain Bligh manages to return to England in a 23 foot launch with just one lost life while the fully stocked ship transporting Byam manages to wreck itself near Australia and lose a good portion of its crew. Bligh is written as a rather detestable character but not cartoonishly so and given the extreme dangers of sailing in the late 1700's, keeping discipline, even in the midst of a tyrannical Captain is not such an absurd notion. This is a book that fully earns the title \\"classic novel\\". I honestly have not a single complaint concerning the book and would recommend it to just about any reader and look forward to reading the next two novels."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"Great literature is always the perfect gift! The seller was wonderful, the book was in great shape and came in a timely fashion. Would definitely buy from them again."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"I have read many books in my life but none had touched me so as Mutiny on the Bounty. This literary piece was one of the best books I have ever read. I read it for the first time when I was 12 years old and I still fell excited every time I read the book. This is a superb book that you won't want to miss."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"Before reviewing Mutiny on the Bounty, let me observe that it contains scenes of extreme violence against sailors in the form of corporal punishment that will nauseate sensitive readers. The violence in this book exceeds what would earn a movie an R rating. Captain Bligh's name will go down in infamy, and this novel deserves more than its share of the credit for making that be the case.H.M.S. Bounty was under assignment to go to Tahiti to secure breadfruit trees. It was hoped that these trees would grow well in the West Indies and could become a cheap source of food for slaves working there on the sugar plantations. Breadfruit trees do not have seeds, so had to be transported and transplanted to perform this experiment.On the way to Tahiti, Captain Bligh turns out to have several weaknesses as a leader. First, he seems to have stolen food from his men in order to increase his personal income. Second, he chose to think the worst of people rather than the best, so he favored the stick over the carrot. Third, he was incautious in his speech and constantly humiliated the men under his command. No one who reads this book would want to have served under Captain Bligh. In fact, many would rename him as Captain Blight.The weakness of the Bligh characterization is that we are given no comparison to what other British naval captains did at the same time. Was Bligh just a little worse, or twice as worse? I still don't know, and I have read a lot about this era. My impression is that what most of us would condemn was pretty typical except for the stealing from the crew's stores.The best part of the book contains a look at Tahitian culture during this time, and the psychological experience of being falsely accused of a capital crime. Fans of trials will also enjoy the way that the court martial is portrayed. You are given even detail to appreciate the nuances of what the issues were that the various accused were dealing with.I found that the book could have used more editing. Much of the novel could have been eliminated with no significant loss to the story. As a result, many modern readers will find that the book is very slow to get started. In a sense, the real appeal of the book begins with the mutiny about a third of the way through the book. In fact, a better structure might have been to have told most of the story of the voyage through flashback interspersed within the trip back to England and the court martial.The sailing descriptions assume a level of knowledge about masts, sails, and wind that are well beyond my awareness of sailing. The novel would have benefited from either explaining more about these points, or eliminating most of them.The book's final weakness is that the authors chose to use a fictional character with a unique role and no experience at sea as the narrator, rather than taking on the voice and perspective of one of the actual sailors. That choice caused the story to have a bit of a &quot;fairy tale&quot; quality that reduced its appeal to me.After you have read and enjoyed this well-known book, think about where your words could wound as much or more than a whipping. Learn to measure those words carefully before you release them. In many cases, you would be better not to say them at all.Appeal to the best in all you meet!"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"We will probably never know exactly what occurred aboard HMS Bounty to cause a piratical Fletcher Christian to cast off Lt. Bligh and 18 other men in a 23 foot lauch to face near certain death either at the hand of savage islanders or the brutal open sea. But let me hazard a guess that events most certainly did not unfold as presented by Messrs. Nordhoff &amp; Hall.The authors' attempts to cast Christian as Melville's Handsome Sailor and Bligh as Forester's crazed Captain Sawyer are at best laughable and at worst slanderous to the name of an officer whose only faults appear to be a salty tongue and a tendency to coddle his men. It is axiomatic that pirates and mutineers are not noble men, and it is difficult to present a captain who promotes sailors to avoid putting his officers on watch and watch, who allows his friends on board (including Fletcher) free and full access to his grog, and who took great pains to return those who remained loyal to civilization (losing only a single man to island savages) as an unrepentant tyrant.It appears that Bligh is an imperfect leader, perhaps evidenced most strongly by the fact that the Bounty was not the only mutiny the man suffered, nevertheless, historical documents related to the events described in N&amp;H's work suggest that their presentation of these events is one-sided in the extreme. Bligh's problem, it appears, is that he would give an inch, his men would take a mile, and then eventually Bligh would berate his men to return the ship to order. I recommend to the reader The Bounty Muntiny, which consists of a number of documents written or released by Bligh and Fletcher's brother Edward in the years following the mutiny. Although these documents raise more questions than they answer, they suggest &quot;blame&quot; for the historical events cannot so easily be laid at Bligh's door.That book also reveals the interesting choices N&amp;H made in editing the courtmartial proceedings they present. Notably failing to mention that Heywood (the mutineer on which Byam's character is likely based) was seen with a cutlass close at hand during the mutiny and fabricating testimony to shore-up the fairy-tales invented by the mutineers. If I were to hazard a guess, I would suggest that the dissipation resulting from a crew spending months at leisure in the tropics among libidinous women and food and drink far superior to a ship's stores was a much larger motivation for the mutiny than Bligh's foul language.But, then again, maybe one's view of the mutiny depends much less upon the actual facts of the matter than upon whether one values ordered liberty or Godless, Freemasonic, French Revolutionary-esque hedonism."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY is one of the greatest novels of the sea, of the 18th century sailing ships and the men who sailed them. But it is far more than a sea story or an adventure story. It is a splendid examination of the abuse of power and of the necessity for society to maintain support for authority, no matter how greatly that authority may at times by misused.Different people tend to view the novel from faulty subjective viewpoints. Some see Capt. Bligh as a gross tyrant who got exactly what he deserved. But at no time does the narrator of the story attempt to justify the mutiny. Others see Fletcher Christian as a romantic hero, but the narrator makes it abundantly clear that his actions in seizing the ship and endangering the entire crew were misguided, to say the least. Always there is a sound balance and a mature evaluation of the actions of all characters, including the officers of the naval court who try those accused of the mutiny.The novel also presents a beautiful balance of scenes, from the harsh punishments on board the Bounty to the idyllic interlude of life in Tahiti to the appalling existence of prisoners chained hand and foot for months at a time, and from the depths of despair at a sentence of death by hanging to the dazzling strangeness of sudden freedom. Whether it is description of scene or action or feeling, the authors capture the essence of every element of the story with perfect clarity and depth. In short, this is an exceedingly well plotted and well written work of literature, which can be enjoyed by a wide range of readers, not just those who love adventure yarns."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"Mutiny on the Bounty is a stunning work of historical fiction that is a pleasure to read.The novel chronicles the events of the HMS Bounty as seen through the eyes of Roger Byam, a midshipman on the infamous Bounty. Through his eyes, the reader sees the terrible events unfold aboard the ship--the cruelty of Capt. Bligh that ultimately leads Fletcher Christian and much of the crew to mutiny against the captain. With Bligh left at sea, the crew returns to the South Pacific, seeking to make a new life for themselves and hoping to avoid capture and court martial by the British authorities. The conclusion of the novel is heart-wrenching and simply superb (and will be left as a surprise).This novel relies a good deal on historical fact, though the authors clearly fill in the gaps with literary license. The characters are superbly developed and the story is riveting throughout. There is much nautical vocabulary, but this shouldn't distract readers as it can be glossed over without losing any significant content. I am not a historian and can make no statements about the veracity of the portrayals in this book. I do know that readers will find this novel difficult to put down. It is simply a classic story."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"I finally got a copy of this book after a lifetime of seeing the story altered and parodied in cinema and television. If you want a great account of the events, that is also interesting reading, look no further. Dont bother to rent the DVD version of the movie, which has just been released. Otherwise you would think that Bligh returns to tahiti to capture Christian personally, which isn't in the book. You would think that Byam got to confront Bligh after being wrongly accused, which isn't in the book. And you would think that people were being keel-hauled from the bounty, which was explicitely stated in the book as being a practice banned years before.

One of the most amazing things about the book is that it has the excitement of a fiction book while staying fairly true to its historical roots. It is a harsh demonstration of seagoing life in the late 1700's (the voyage takes place in 1788-1789) and a beautiful description of life on primitive Tahiti. Nordhoff and Hall use imagery on par with the best authors of our times to bring a view of 18th century Tahiti to our minds where we can imagine the peacefull life of the Indians and sailors there. It also does a great job of creating a theme so emotional that it is difficult to put to words. Another reviewer on this site accurately described it as something along the lines of \\"a story of misuse of power and the necessity of men to support authority figures to keep order even if they abuse their power\\" (not an exact quote). This is especially relevant to life at sea where without strict discipline a ship and her crew would be in constant peril. The narrator, Rodger Byam (a fictional character based very strongly on a real midshipman on Bounty named Peter Heywood), tells of his life on Tahiti with his adopted family, his wife and daughter, and his trip in irons back to Mother England, where he discovers that he is to be tried for a mutiny which he had no part in. In several amazing plot twists however his case goes from death to freedom when a man thought to be dead surfaces from a tragedy at sea. I give the book five stars as it is not only on of the most well written books I have ever read, with simply dazzling imagery, but also conveys very emotional theme. It is a must read for anyone of any age capable of reading it."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"I've read \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" more times than I can count since I was a teenager and I've read just about everything I have been able to find about the Bounty since then. \\"Mutiny\\" is not a history but a romantic novel about the ship and crew. In that regard it paints Bligh as the villain and Christian as the hero. The reality was that Bligh's biggest problem was with his harsh tongue and that Christian's act of mutiny was impulsive.Nevertheless, the saga of the Bounty is perhaps the most famous and enduring sea story. A small ship, about 90 feet long and 20 feet wide leave in 1787 on what should've been an obscure expedition to deliver breadfruit from Tahiti to the Caribbean and instead the crew sailed off into immortality.\\"Mutiny\\" is a very romantic telling of the story through the eyes of the young midshipman, Roger Byam (in reality, Peter Heywood). Byam is befriended by and admires Fletcher Christian and he witnesses the abuses of Bligh towards the crew. The ship sojourns in Tahiti which is almost Eden-like to the English sailors. Soon into the homeward journey Christian leads a revolt and throws Bligh and his loyalists off the ship, he returns to Tahiti where the crewmen who couldn't go with Bligh are abandoned along with some of the mutineers who want to take their chances and Christian and 8 others of the crew sail off into oblivion. Byam and the others are caught by a British frigate sent off to avenge the taking of the Bounty and after an ordeal of their own Byam and the others stand trial for mutiny and face the hangman's noose.While not historically accurate it \\"Mutiny\\" is still a very enjoyable book and a deeper book than it is given credit for. The clash of cultures, men rebelling against oppression is what \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is about. Part III of the Bounty Trilogy, \\"Pitcairn's Island\\" is even better than \\"Mutiny\\"."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"This is a wonderful book about the taking of the ship Bountyby its crew. It is well written much in the character of aromance novel. The work teaches the futility of managingsmall groups via coercion and excess force. Captain Blighis nowhere near the equal of Fletcher Christian in managingthe crew and handling daily ministerial decisions.In almost every instance, Captain Bligh resolves conflictwith excessive punishment and flippant directives.With every moment, the crew resents his presence even more.The readers can appreciate the easy contrast between CaptainBligh and Fletcher Christian. Further into the novel,a military court procedure leaves the judges perplexedand ultimately disappointed in the disproportionatepunishments administered by Captain Bligh. Near the end ofthe novel, his judgment is questioned and the audiencedevelops more sympathy for the person of Fletcher Christianand his crew.

It is appropriate for the highschool reading audience."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"This book is exciting and written with such great detail that it seemed like an actual personal account as a crew member. The historical acurasy of the voyage as well as the ship is incredable. It definatly keeps the readers interest no matter how many times he/she has read it."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"If the pleasure that you derive from reading books about turn of the 19th century British Navy is based mainly upon the recounting of broadsides and boarding in the smoke (a la Aubrey/Maturin, Hornblower, et al), then the Bounty Trilogy (Mutiny on the Bounty, Men Against the Sea, and Pitcairn's Island) should probably not rank high on your list of things to read. However, if what you enjoy about the genre is the period itself, British Naval culture of the era, and intense if non-martial conflict between men, these three books should be high on your reading list indeed. For not only is the period well depicted and the history well laid out in a non-obtrusive fictional account, but the even-handed characterization of the primary actors is a joy to read. There is neither the sermonizing about Bligh nor hagiography of Christian that would be the approach expected of most most modern writers as they view bygone times through the moral squint of contemporary sensibilities. If written along such lines, the Bounty Trilogy would be a vapid depiction of Bligh as a purely bourgeois-imperialist ogre and Christian as a singular paradigm of revolutionary goodness. Instead, Nordhoff and Hall have given us complex characters that fully and deeply engage the reader and make the books a joy to read in-spite of the reader's knowledge of the ultimate outcomes of each volume. Highly recommended to anyone who feels they fit into the above described category of likely-to-be-pleased reader. 5 stars for the entire trilogy."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"The target audience for this book is not limited to naval buffs or adventure readers.

Worthy of a \\"classic.\\" If you are considering this one, go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty,","review":"I would contend that one simply cannot fully summarize or comment on the book \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" without reading the full Bounty Trilogy. The central issues raised in the first book are resolved implicitly and at length in \\"Men Against the Sea\\" and \\"Pitcairn's Island,\\" where the authors flesh out the denouement. Yes, they are novels, and entertaining in their own right, but on a deeper level they provide moral lessons that make the conclusions inescapable and unforgettable. This was required reading in my high school class and it wasn't until years later that I came to appreciate the full meaning and broad scope of this story, which addresses timeless issues central to the human condition, providing a greater understanding of people, society, and their relationship with the cruel indifference of nature. Although they are novels, I have done some further research on the story, read the trial transcripts, and have found that the facts of the story only bear out more strongly the implicit thesis of the authors. These works are some of the most memorable and useful literature I have ever read. To paraphrased a great philosopher: Read me now, and believe me later.

I was quickly taken into her autobiography and I couldn't put her book down, so I read it all in one sitting. There are many bittersweet moments in this story and most of them are centered on the problems Brenda had experienced, as another reader said &quot;One womans own private hell.&quot; And then I realized that's what makes her book so good, because she told her story like she saw it. She didn't sugar coat her words, she wrote it like she felt it through her experiences. She survived through many tragedies, and forms of abuse-from family, friends, and then felt the ultimate hurt when someone in her family experiences some of the same problems that she too had gone through. When she decided to no longer play the victim, I cheered! This is a dark story that makes you realize that we each have a story to tell with secrets to reveal, shows that we shouldn't be so quick to judge others, and that we are all human. There is light at the end of the tunnel for Ms. Weber. Brenda's love possibly was her way to salvation. While we did see mainly the downside of her life, that is what made this book so real. I'm glad Ms. Weber no longer has to hold her feelings inside and I hope that her story will be able to reach those who need a way out of abuse. Brenda you are a survivor and I was honored to read your remarkable story!"},{"Title":"I Promise Not To Tell","review":"At 4:00 a.m. I finished the last of 150 pages. Pages that were stark in their honesty and gut-wrenching with their truths.Brenda Weber shares her story of inherited molestation and abuse that began at the age of four and continued in one form or another well into her adult life. Not until her son, also molested, and also an abuser, is found out, does she realize the pattern. She is not alone.This book is very important. Woman AND men who have ever experienced abuse, sexual or otherwise, will recognize themselves on every page.Too many times, society inflicts its beliefs on the survivors of abuse, leaving them to feel helpless, hopeless and sometimes, to blame. With I Promise Not to Tell, Weber unveils the truth behind these damaging behaviors.It's a curse thing. It's a generational-curse thing. It's an inherited thing. Whatever society might want to call it-abuse is a bad thing. And unfortunately, the people who experience abuse go on to be abused more, and sometimes become abusers themselves. They also might pass on behavioral traits to their children, one of those traits being how to be a victim. Victims can become both victim and abuser.As we journey with Weber along her incredibly honest path of discovery, we learn that her mother was abused. In a flashback, Weber is astonished to discover that she, herself, was molested at the tender age of four. Her subsequent relationships start badly and end badly. She doesn't get it-until she DOES get it.Readers who have never experienced the cycle of abuse will be irritated with Weber for not making right choices; for playing the victim; for accepting abuse and running from one bad relationship to another.It is my hope that those same readers, people who have never experienced the cycle of abuse will finally realize that the person inside the storm can't see outside the cloud.My mother could be the woman in this book. Right down to the bad choices in men, the repeated bad mistakes, and the false hope each new relationship brings. Right down to passing along the behaviors, especially those of being a victim.Unfortunately, my mother died without realizing the full dynamics of the demons imposed upon her. We still don't know who it was that molested my mother; she never gave a name. But we do know it affected her life, and the lives of her children. Three out of four children have been divorced. The two girls have made repeated bad decisions concerning men. I am one of them.Bravo, Ms. Weber! Thank you for taking the blinders off and letting the world see the truth."},{"Title":"I Promise Not To Tell","review":"Exceptional! One of the best books that I have ever read.

All of these imbedded emotions cause her to make unwise decisions leading to more pain and destruction in her already shattered life.However, all is not lost, as Brenda's journey finally leads to freedom and peace as she realizes her worth and puts life priorities in order.A book for all those who have walked the path of abuse in one form or another, a book of sharing the hurts and shouting the victories.Shirley Johnson"},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"Tina Rosenburg has won the Pulitzer Prize for her work as a non-fiction author and as a journalist. She graduated from Northwestern University with both a B.S. and a M.S. She has written for papers and magazines such as Harper's, The Washington Post, The New York Times Magazine, and many others. Her non-fiction works include Children of Cain: Violence and the Violent in Latin America, The Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism, and her latest book, Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World. With Rosenburg's MacArthur Fellowship award, she was able to travel throughout Latin America and report both the violence throughout South American nations and her own experience recording the violence. Rosenburg is currently serving in the World Policy Institute as a senior fellow.[1]In Children of Cain: Violence and the Violent in Latin America, Rosenburg's thesis is that whether or not a military junta or a democratic republic runs a state, a state cannot function properly unless that state respects its citizens and the citizens respect the state. If there is no respect for state or citizenry then there is a breakdown in society. Street violence and or state-sponsored violence become the norm of states that suffer from this social breakdown. This work is divided into seven chapters.The first chapter is where Rosenburg lays out her underlying thesis. The following six chapters are divided by country. Each Latin American country receives its own special analysis on why and when violence became the social norm for that country. In each chapter, Rosenburg tries to maintain a list of influential characters, the movers and shakers of each particular country. Rosenburg does this well by giving a thorough study of each chapter's main characters, and the impact that those characters play in the social breakdown of their own country.The style Rosenburg used to write Children of Cain: Violence and the Violent in Latin America wasn't as journalistic as it was personal. Each chapter read like a diary entry rather than one of Rosenburg's column pieces. The style Rosenburg used for Children of Cain reminded me the similar writing styles used by journalist authors such as Robert Fisk and Stephen Kinzer. Throughout the book, Rosenburg's consistent emphasis was what made each country accept violence as a social norm. Rosenburg exemplified this very well by giving descriptive histories of national revolutions and counter-revolutions, testimonies by government officials, and testimonies by members of the popular leftist movements, and those who had been caught in the middle. Rosenburg emphasized that in Latin America violent acts of revenge or rebellion resulted in more violence; a cycle which lasted for decades in the countries Rosenburg explored while writing Children of Cain.The way Rosenburg organized Children of Cain was enjoyable and easy to comprehend. Each chapter felt as if it had been a repeat of a previous chapter, but with the names, dates, and places changed. The organization of this work is great; because it gives its readers who are interested in one or two case studies the opportunity to read those studies in whole, rather than flipping around throughout the book. The only problem with the way Rosenburg organized her work was the lack of linkage from one chapter to the next. Certainly there was a linkage of the violence and instability, but Rosenburg failed to link one country to another in their shared institutions of violence. Many countries which Rosenburg discusses did in fact share fear tactics, disappearances, assassinations, and general death threats. Rosenburg does not touch on what role this had in the spread of violent acts from one country to another. However, she could have skipped over this supposed linkage because it may have played no role at all.The author consulted many sources, too many to list. Roseburg interviews everyone from people in the poverty stricken slums of Columbia to former political prisoners in Argentina. One source in particular that I found to be useful in exemplifying Argentina's Dirty War was a document that Rosenburg came across. The document is a brief testimony of a member of Task Force 3.3.2. The massive collection of sources that Rosenburg uses has helped to shape the history of Latin America in a light so rarely seen in such violent graphic detail.Rosenburg set out to explore why Latin America had become as violent as it was and if there were any similarities to the violence each country experienced. Rosenburg answered her curiosity of Latin American violence by proving that an overall disregard for the state and human rights was a root cause of the cycle of violence in all of the countries explored, except for Nicaragua. Nicaragua is an exception to the cycle of violence because of the extensive external role played by the United States. None of what Rosenburg had to say in Children of Cain has conflicted with any other works I have read by Noam Chomsky, Greg Grandin, Walter LaFeber, or Stephen Kinzer.In conclusion, Rosenburg's Children of Cain is an excellent source of investigative journalism on a broad scale. I would highly recommend this work to anyone interested in studying the causes of the epidemic of violence in Latin America throughout the 1970s and 80s. This work would be useful to students studying modern Latin America.[1] \\"The 1996 Pulitzer Prize Winners General Nonfiction,\\" Pulitzer.org, [...](accessed October 24, 2011)."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"I first read Children of Cain when I was working in human rights about 20 years ago.

The author does an excellent job of explaining how the violence and the source of the violence is unique in each of the countries and yet the similarities in how the citizens of these countries deal with it. What is so interesting is that all of these countries share a common heritage of being former Spanish colonies in the new world but due to the different settlement patterns and social structures established each developed in radically different ways. It is when the author profiles Argentina and Chile the two countries most similar to the U.S that the book is most chilling. How quickly people who are proud of their democratic traditions can relinquish them for the promise of security and material comforts should be seen as a cautionary tale for this country and the events of the past 9 years. My biggest complaint is that the authors book just ends without a conclusion or a epilogue bringing all of the stories together in some way.

She begins with these individuals to show you the end product _ then retraces the steps of Latin America's dark, recent history to show you how a nightmare became real. Rosenberg not only tells the story of the downtrodden and displaced, but also the story of the &quot;victors,&quot; or the elites. It would be difficult to sympathize with anyone responsible for the murder and torture that has plagued Latin America this century, yet Rosenberg reveals the fears of the persecutors, valid or not, with the same perception with which she portrays the persecuted. In addition to nightmarish governmental indifference and inhumanity from all sides, Rosenberg sums up each country's recent history in a brief and concise two or three pages. As a student of, and journalist in, Latin America, &quot;Children of Cain&quot; remains my most worn and dog-eared reference book. I see the faces Tina painted everywhere I go. Neophytes who yearn for a basic understanding of Latin America and seasoned scholars alike will come away with a better understanding of these national histories that seem so foreign. Reading &quot;Children of Cain&quot; will put everything you read afterward into context."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"This is the best book on Latin America I've ever read--it is extremely accessible for people who know nothing about Latin America, and for those who do, it is a major contribution to our understanding of the region. Rosenberg's vinnettes and explanations of the violence seemingly endemic to Latin America are brilliantly written and compelling. She captures the essense of the countries she writes about, and deftly explains their histories so that we understand the reasons for the violence. We can no longer just hear about the violence plaging Latin America and see it as irrational, wondering where it came from. Wonderful portraits of the perpetrators of violence, marking Rosenberg as different from the throngs of writers--journalists and others--who have focused on the victims of violence, on the corpses and grewsome stories. More attention needs to be given to the perpetrators and also those who live with such violence, who watch it and become numb to it, including ourselves. A major contribution to Latin American studies and the study of violence."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"Not only has Ms. Rosenburg done a spectacular gob in writing an extremely readable book, she provides her audience vivid decriptions using a very personal approach that employs the use of specific people, their experiences and dilemmas. She also provides her audience with the neccessary historical and enviromental (social, politial and economic) information to put these personal and organizational accouts into the cotexts neccessary for reader to truely appriecate the psychology of the forces driving these extaordinary historical events.Moreover, Ms. Rosenburg provides the reader with six different cases from six differnet countries. From Escobar's Medellin to Argentina's &quot;Dirty War&quot;, she examines and analyzes different types of violence motivated by unique sets of circumstances.I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN; A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN LATIN AMERICA!"},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"This is the second book by Tina Rosenberg I have read. The first one was Haunted Land about Eastern Europe after the fall of communism, which I also highly recommend. I'm so pleased with Rosenberg's style that I'm after her book on South Africa as well.For almost a decade Rosenberg traveled through Latin America not shying away from really messy situations trying to make sense of a history of violence and very little respect for human rights. Tina experienced many of the situations herself such as being soaked with diluted acid by the police in the streets of Santiago, Chile, during marches against Pinochet or taking a nightmarish truck bed trip through guerrilla infested Peru. The Latin American economic, political and military elites also had their points of view captured by Rosenberg resulting, as far as I can tell, in a very well balanced collection of personal perspectives on the problem - violence in Latin America - intermingled with background historical information.Rosenberg is very competent in summarizing the recent history and the roots of violence in Latin America. The author brings the historical review to life by interviewing perpetrators and victims. Violence in Latin America as viewed by Rosenberg emanates from a history of inequality. The native populations and the unwillingly imported black slaves and their descendants have been for five centuries exploited and victimized by greedy white Europeans. The resulting instable societies in turn fall prey of guerrilla groups, organized crime, drug lords, or the old fashioned military economic and political elites. The victimized population looses faith in the state and became passive or takes matters on their own hands solving social problems or even threatening or overthrowing governments. To tip the balance back the oligarchies can inevitably count on the CIA for supposedly counter insurgency help.It's a chilling book with no solution on sight and Rosenberg didn't even include some remarkable facets of violence in Latin America such as domestic violence in a notably sexist society and the petit and not so petit common crime. Colombia is the first market worldwide for bulletproof cars - Brazil is the second.It's an important book mainly for American readers since it shows the impact of American interference. Sadly it offers no solution - maybe there isn't.Leonardo Alves - Tucson, Arizona - June 2002"},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"I'm so glad someone recommended this book to me because I will never forget it, It's wonderful insight into latin America and it's societies. Great interviews and vivid desriptions of life in a place where life means so little to so many people."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"Having recently returned from living in South America for two years, I was very interested in reading Tina Rosenbergs work. It did not disappoint me. From the poorest of the poor, to the wealthy untouchables, she captured the feeling of Latin America extremely well. She did this so well because she spent so much time with her subjects.For example, Gladys from Peru, she spent weeks with her, returning often. She did not gloss over the painful life that woman lives. Tina Rosenberg went to the core of why the Latin American countries are the way they are today: poverty and history. Poverty drives a young man in Columbia to do things for money that would turn our stomachs, such as kidnapping and murder; the history of his country and the region has made people too accustomed to this violence. Rosenberg exposes these roots so well, readers will feel that they are amongst the people of these struggling, violent countries"},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"GREAT BOOK, the best at capturing the feel of what it is like living in many of the Latin American countries. I do wish she had gotten the opinion of teh peasants more thought. She seems to interview ONLY those in power, while it makes sense since many poor people are scared to talk about the real situation due to the consequences it might bring. A must read for all those who think the Monroe Doctrine and US intervention are a good thing. A bit disheartning thought, leaves you with a bit of a feeling that many of these countrie are without help."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"I read this book as part of a college course in Latin American politics several years ago. I accidentially came across it in Amazon.com's catalog, and it left enough of an impression on me that I felt like I had to leave a review for others! I believe the author received a &quot;genius grant&quot; from the McCarther foundation, which enabled her to write this book.If you like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's writing, or if you're just interested in Latin American culture and politics, I think you'll like this book."},{"Title":"CHILDREN OF CAIN Violence and the Violent in Latin America","review":"I have lived in Latin America most of my life, and it is the BEST book I have ever read on the recent history of the continent.

However, the book is really much more than that. It gives brief biographies of 14 fascinating women from the Eighteenth Century. These were women such as Abigail Adams, Rose Bertin, Vigee-Lebrun and Madame Pompadour who were women of their time and yet, in many ways, curiously modern. Some defied convention, some worked within it, but all were unique personalities. The writing is enlightening and interesting and the illustrations are lovely. If you like the Eighteenth Century and women's place in history, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Gothic mysteries have always been among my favorites, so seeing the title, The Moor, immediately drew my attention. Then when I saw Sherlock Holmes had been teamed with a female partner, Mary Russell, I was hooked. This is a delightful book!Interestingly, the author provides an editor's note in which it is claimed that the manuscripts have been found and were originally written by Ms. Russell. This is an added note that lends a curious, but nonetheless minor,twist, because as with any mystery involving Holmes, you soon get so tied up into the story that it matters little who is the author.Later in Sherlock Holmes' life, we find that he has taken not only a new partner...but she has become his wife! Mary Russell, who prefers to go by that name, is an intellectual, an Oxford student of theology, and, once in a while, partner to the famous sleuth. What is interesting is that the story is oftentimes written from the point of view of Ms. Russell This change is almost transparent, yet lends a new and highly entertaining perspective to the traditional cases where Holmes is the leader in finding clues and solving the case. For King has &quot;humanized&quot; Sherlock in a gentle, loving way and allows him to call upon his wife for help in a way that shows both his love and respect. A truly delightful team!The Moor takes us to Dartmoor, where Holmes once solved the case of the Hound of the Baskervilles, at the request of the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. Nearing his 90th year, in the early 1920's, the Reverend has summoned his godson, Sherlock, to find out what is happening on the moors. For there have been strange sightings of a coach and dog, claimed to be a woman who married a local lord who soon died. She &quot;was never officially accused and tried, but for her sins she is said to be condemned to riding in a coach made of the bones of her dead husbands, driven by a headless horseman and led by a black hound with a single eye in the centre of his forehead.&quot; More importantly, a local man has been killed and found on the moors.The book opens with Mary Russell receiving a telegram to come immediately to Devonshire...and bring her compass. Mary is not thrilled to be summoned and returns to her reading only to receive another telegram two hours later to bring maps, close her books...and leave now. This tug and pull of the two individuals in their own professional lives erupts throughout the book to show each person's independence, yet reliance on each other. An intriguing diversion from reviewing the clues, until both are so caught up in solving the mystery that, upon meeting after each doing their own research, they both proclaim the resolution of the case!The exploration of the moors, its occupants, its hidden dangers are reminiscent of other stories set in Dartmoor, but still beckon and capture the reader to roam through the site, inspecting each stone, each change in the weather and what it may mean and how it can help solve the mystery. The characters brought forth are delightful and serve to introduce you to the community of those who become close by necessity as they must depend upon each other in this strange, wild land. Ms. Russell's love of reading takes her into the hundreds of books written by Reverend Baring-Gould, where she finds &quot;pieces&quot; of evidence that slowly pull together to help solve the case.In the end, the activity behind the mystery is somewhat mundane... However, watching the Holmes couple, go their respective ways,to gain and add to the clues that leads to the final discovery, provides a new dimension for Sherlock Holmes' fans. If you're one...look for the entire series with Mary Russell as his wife!"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"While &quot;The Moor&quot; is not up to &quot;Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot;'s promise, I still pity Ms. King. It's the crowning irony of her career that when an author writes a book this good, she will inevitably not please everyone. Fans of the Holmes-Russell detecting duo will cry foul over this mystery's lukewarm punch. Fans of the emotionally satisfying Holmes-Russell courtship and marriage will sift &quot;The Moor&quot; for bodice-ripping scenes--in vain. And fans of the Sherlock Holmes Canon will yell automatically, but we who love her books them anyway.Still, it's one of her best, and for the same reasons all her Mary Russell books--even the weak ones--are good. Dartmoor unfolds before us as a kind of moral proving ground, a Presence. We are introduced to Sabine Baring-Gould in the winter of his prolific life, and to his house, which is another Presence--ramshackle, book-lined, with the smell of dinner wafting through to the dusty library. Ms. King knows what she likes, and delivers: innumerable fires in the grate, banked up against the storm outside, and chairs drawn up to the fire-irons, and the tea-things close to hand. She knows Holmes looks must fetching slumped in a fireside chair at 2 a.m., his fingers steepled as he ruminates a difficult case with Mary.And she knows that what her fans really want is not merely a cold-blooded mystery nor an incongruous bodice-ripper, but for her characters to be true to the real adult people they so obviously are, and to love each other. Which they do, in spades. Holmes' unspoken devotion to Baring-Gould was nicely understated. And King's most romantic scene in the Beekeeper books occurs as Mary, in slightly over her head while sleuthing, paces the floor for Holmes' return. A deftly written moment, and one that makes me wonder how some readers could have so completely misunderstood what Laurie King was trying to say about the integrity of erotic love and emotional bonds.Alas, &quot;The Moor&quot; was over too soon, and I was left immersed in an atmosphere of old books, old hymns, the power of the moor, and the passing of something grand and beautiful. Not bad, for a historical mystery."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This book features Sherlock Holmes in his late 50s, and his godfather, Revd Sabine Baring-Gould, a real person who lived in Devonshire, England from 1834-1924. The story takes place in 1923, a few weeks before Baring-Gould's death. Mary Russell, the narrator, is married to Holmes, and they have both been summoned to Dartmoor to solve a murder mystery. The story itself is weak, and requires knowledge of 'the Hound of the Baskervilles' for a full appreciation. This is compensated for, however, by the wonderfully vivid and realistic descriptions of Dartmoor, and Lew House, where Baring-Gould lived. As someone who grew up a few miles from this spot, I can vouch for the absolute accuracy of the setting. Laurie King has also read just about all of Baring-Gould's 150 books, and quotes delightfully from many of them. The skill of the book lies in the imaginative conjunction of a fictional and a real character, and for any reader with knowledge of either man, the result is very pleasing. As a lifelong afficionado of Sabine Baring-Gould, I am most indebted to King for bringing him into greater prominence."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The fourth in Laurie King's series featuring Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, this one returns to Dartmoor, the setting of the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novel, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'. And, like in its predecessor there are tales of a ghostly hound out on the moors, this time accompanying an equally ghostly carriage.This series are always well worth a read. Laurie King brings carries off three significant tricks, each alone being worth the price of admission: characterisation of her leads, local and contemporary colour, and a great plot.In terms of the first, both Holmes and Russell are depicted as somewhat prickly characters, unwilling to suffer fools gladly, and each with their own areas of interest and expertise. Russell works well by herself, but sparks of all kinds fly when her husband is around (being narrated by Russell, we never see Holmes by himself). In this book, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould also features strongly, and occasionally view with the leads for our attention. Given he is virtually bedridden, this is no small feat.The depiction of different kinds of characters and their environments helps bring the story to life. Between those who live on the moor and those who live in the village, lords of the manor and their servants and so forth, we have no opportunity to mistake where and when the book is set. Two scenes which didn't really advance the plot but were wonderful are Russell's meeting with the local witch (as the moor dwellers call her), Elizabeth Chase, and a scene set in the pub where the locals spend the evening singing to entertain themselves - with its attendant rivalry between those who live in the village and those who live on the moor.Russell's growing understanding of the moor as a place and a presence in the life of its inhabitants also works very well.And lastly the plot: it's a cracker! I'm not going to give anything more away, but the final outcome was not what I had expected at the beginning of the book.In summary: what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The Moor, another adventure of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes by Laurie King, gets off to a slow start and never really picks up. The writing is flawless (King's talent in this regard is exceptional)but the story consists almost entirely of Holmes and Russell walking the Moor and finding nothing. While the Moor itself may be the focal point of the book, it's hardly enough to sustain real interest for mystery fans. This has been an entertaining series to date, but to continue in that vein, King must deliver exciting stories to accompany the mood and settings of turn of the century Britain."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"First of all, let me say Laurie King is my favorite mystery writer outside of Dorothy Sayers. A new book of hers comes out (either the Russell or Martinelli series) and I devour it in an evening, unable to put it down. But I found The Moor rambling and hard to get through. Everything is described in the minutest of detail: characters, their reminiscing, even the meals they eat. Sure, parts of it are beautifully written, in Ms. King's inimitable way, but get me to the action! That's why I read the genre in the first place. I didn't feel like the chase started till two thirds into the book. Then I found the story and conclusion compelling. I miss the tightness of King's earlier books (pre-Letter of Mary). Really good things: 1) King creates a palpable sense of place with misty, peaty Dartmoor; and 2) Mary Russell becomes less of a snotty know-it-all, as she copes with the moor and the emotional residue of her most recent case."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"THE MOOR starts well and ends well, but it's way too long -- with a lot of seemingly repetitive sequences (how many baths? how many walks on the moor?), at 369 pages I was begging for it to be over. I think a good editor could have cut out almost 100 pages. This is the fourth entry in the Mary Russell series, and Holmes is much less active this time. King continues to create a definite sense of time and place, and excellently weaves an eery mood. All the travel on the moor definitely makes you feel cold and wet. The plot provides great fun in that it revives &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; story in detail. You do NOT need to read the previous books in the series to understand THE MOOR. But quite frankly I enjoyed the previous books much more."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"It took me six weeks to get through this book ... and only because I was determined. The start was dreadfully dull. It was so slow every time I'd pick it up I'd fall asleep. I have to agree with the reader who said it was like a sleeping pill. The 3rd book wasn't as good as the 1st and 2nd, and this 4th installment was awful. If not for the interesting literary tidbits incorporating Sabine Baring-Gould into the story, I probably would have turned the book into the used bookstore. The ending was dull and uninteresting and did not make this read worthwhile. It was a simple and silly and too quick ending after all that work to get there."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This book is a paean to a unique geographical zone in England. It's not really a detective or adventure novel.Author Laurie R. King obviously is fond of the Dartmoor area, in the southwest corner adjacent to the port town of Plymouth, and the people who inhabit it.While Dartmoor is the name of the prison located there, the title of King's book is how the overall area may be better known. The moor is a center of: exploration for relics of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, whitewater kayaking and canoeing, mining for various clays and metals such as tin, farming and raising of animals, and the study of local myths and legends.Geographically, the moor is an elevated region at about 2,000 ft of about 350 square miles, circularly-shaped, isolated from normal commerce, and a massive target for rainfall and ocean-based storms. As a bowl-shaped area it holds water, and spawns rivers. The moorland is capped with many exposed granite hilltops (known as tors).Conan Doyle cited his earlier novel about Sherlock Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles, in the moor. He also introduced the character of a church rector named Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould (SBG). Actually SBG was a real person (28 January 1834 - 2 January 1924) who is remembered particularly as a writer of hymns, the best-known being \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers,\\" and is a primary character at age 90 in \\"The Moor.\\"Author King's novel is set in 1924. It's basically a set of short adventures, mostly by Sherlock's wife Mary Russell. All are aimed at exploration of some area or facet of the moor or the people who live within it, and originate from SBG's home. By this device, King shows us what she likes about the moor. And she does that with her skill in setting scenes and creating dialogue with lavish use of the full power of the English language. That's the redeeming characteristic of this novel.\\"The Moor\\" is not, IMHO, as described on the cover \\"a novel of suspense featuring Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes.\\" Russell is the featured character in the little adventures of discovery about the moor. Author King really doesn't get serious about plot until the last 50 or so pages, and Holmes doesn't really do any deduction. The only suspense is to learn if King will bring the book to some definitive ending, or run out of paper.I would rate this book at 3 stars because I love to read someone's writing using the full strength of the English language. By another author, it's 1 star, and a pass."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"In The Moor by Laurie R. King, her fourth pairing of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, the author has the husband and wife team return to the moors made famous in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles. This time they are summoned by the eccentric scholar Sabine Baring-Gould to explore some mysterious occurrences which includes two deaths and the appearance of a ghostly coach which is accompanied by a hellish hound with one glowing eye.Laurie King claims in her Editor's Preface that these stories were found in a trunk that was mysteriously left at her front door. Purportedly the notes of the real Mary Russell, this story is set in 1924. Each chapter is introduced with a quote from one of Baring-Gould's many works.Russell has her hands full with the aging and sexist Baring-Gould who has a close relationship with Holmes. The problems of a woman in male society are well portrayed, and she eventually wins the respect of the elderly scholar. It is a long story that is rich in local characters and legends. By the time of this novel Holmes and Russell have settled into a comfortable relationship based on mutual respect and the main dynamics are between them and the people of the moor.A well-written tale with lots of atmosphere that will appeal to the historic mystery buff."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This is the fourth in the 'Mary Russell series of cozy mysteries featuring Mary and her husband Sherlock Holmes.The story opens just a few weeks after the events of the previous novel, A LETTER OF MARY.

Mary is reluctant to leave her studies but the idea of investigating a case with Sherlock Holmes on the moors of Dartmoor, scene of one of his greatest triumphs. When she discovers that once again a mysterious hound has been seen roaming the countryside at night Mary is quite ready to join in on the case. Little did she realize that the case would lead her into spending multiple cold wet nights on the moors in pursuit of the elusive hound.This is a charming series of cozy novels featuring the famous Holmes and his bride. The repartee between the two is worthy of Nick and Nora Charles, and while this is not quite the Holmes of the original canon he is close. The stories of this series are not the intellectual puzzlers of the originals but will give the reader a surprise or two.

This 4th volume of the series is a little on the tedious side as the reader goes over half the book slogging through pages of description of the wild, desolate, haunting moors and its curious inhabitants.

While the other books in the series took me only one or two nights to read, this one took me at least two weeks, if my memory serves me. And the fact that I gave it three stars is saying something.The plot is sluggish from the beginning, and only has a few sparkling gems in the heap. Mary Russell might as well not exist during the entire first half of the book. It is only at the end of the book when the truly interesting plot begins, and still Russell is shoved into the background. It is disappointing, to put it lightly. This is definitely not the book to read if you're new to the series. Try starting from the beginning with the first book, &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice.&quot;If you want a thrilling and well-written Mary Russell book, read &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; or &quot;O Jerusalem&quot;, which are my personal favorites, with &quot;Justice Hall&quot; coming at a close second."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I love the Mary Russell books by Laurie R.

(Who else would have the sang-froid to calmly blow off a &quot;the game's afoot&quot; style telegram from the great Sherlock Holmes himself?) To me, this interplay makes both charcters more enjoyable.The mysteries themselves are good, too--you will not guess the outcome early in the book. Frankly, though, the richness of these tales shines through in the details and the dry humor, as when Mary is re-creating the actions of a murderer dumping a body. After a long spell of intense concentration while mimicking his motions, she looks up to find half the local populace quietly watching her. I also think Ms. King writes of meetings--that is, characters encountering one another for the first time--better than anyone else I can think of. Mary's introduction to the Reverend Baring-Gould was a priceless scene of mannered mayhem--second only to her first encounter with Sherlock Holmes himself, in The Beekeeper's Apprentice.These books are wonderful, and reading The Moor only made me want to read the next one the day it comes out."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I've read Laurie R. King's work before, but this is the first &quot;Mary Russell&quot; novel that I've read, or tried to read, and it will be the last. It's premise of Sherlock Holmes marrying this boring shrew of a woman was unbelievable to me. Also, he seemed to have become dumber in his old age, asking questions that would have been &quot;elementary&quot; to the old Holmes. The plot, a phantom coach and a ghostly hound on the moor, is poorly developed and while supposedly a sequel to &quot;The Hound of Baskervilles&quot; isn't nearly as interesting as it could be. The book was incredibly slow to start, and I was so bored I couldn't read it for more than five minutes when I can usually sit and read for hours. There's hardly any mystery, no adventure, no sense of thrill, no brilliant deductions by Russell or Holmes, nothing which would mark a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Apologies to Ms. King, but she is no Doyle, and should stick to her non-Mary Russell novels."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I love Laurie King's Russell/Holmes mystery series. Taking us chronologically beyond where Doyle left off, she pairs Sherlock Holmes with Mary Russell, an intelligent, witty young Jewish theologian who captures the attention of both his mind and his heart. To properly experience the series (and comprehensibly follow the development of the complex relationship between the protagonists), you must read the books in order: &quot;Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot;, &quot;Letter of Mary&quot;, and then &quot;The Moor.&quot;That said, &quot;The Moor&quot; is acceptable as a mystery novel, and hints at further character development for Holmes. For the most part, sadly, it lacks the friendly verbal sparring between Holmes and Russell which is what makes the other books so delightful.Do read it, if only as a link through to the next in the series. Do not, however, read it before you've read its prequels."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"As a great fan of Sherlock Holmes, I could not resist buying this book. Although the book was off to a slow start, I soon became immersed in the story. I might call it, Hound of the Baskervilles, part 2! The story was great. It captured the spirit of the Sherlock Holmes novels. It made the story of Holmes' marriage quite convincing (no small feat). I intend to read more of the Mary Russell stories."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This boring book promises much but delivers little"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"A \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" book? Where is Sherlock Holmes? Ah, are we talking about that peripheral figure who hardly acts as a Doctor Watson for the clever and smart Ms Russell? (\\"Me, me, me, me, the centre of the universe!\\"). Sorry, but she's precisely the kind of woman Holmes avoided his whole life. And the book is soooooooo slow - I have lost patience and will probably not read it through. Too much time for too silly a story featuring too silly a protagonist. Watson recounted the adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Mary Russell recounts the adventures of Mary Russel. Holmes is here a mere background actor.By the way: The female author is obviously enormously proud that she succeeded in \\"taming\\" Sherlock Holmes into a marriage. Of course, it's OK that Holmes had a \\"wild youth\\" and nothing to do with women, at least that we know; but at long last what every man really wants is to have a wife and be caught in the saint institution of marriage. Did someone count how many times the word \\"husband\\" appears in the book? Certainly more than in the whole Conan Doyle series.The positive aspect? I didn't buy the book, I borrowed it from a library. So no wasted money; just wasted time."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Of the four Mary Russell novels I have read, the plot for this is the weakest. While King's descriptions and characters still make the book a decent read, the ending has all the suspense of a Scooby-Doo cartoon, and is just as inventive. Don't let this be the only Mary Russell novel you read. The first three are definitely better."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This was my first and last Mary Russell novel and it doesn't surprise me that I'm not the first reviewer to say that. I'm not a purist so I don't mind it being unfaithful to the canon, but this book was just awful on its own merit. I agree completely with those who thought that this book was boring. I feel that \\"The Moor\\" was just a complete waste of my precious time and hard earned money. I will definitely not be reading anymore Laurie R. King books."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I guess that we should hand one star over to the author for creativity, but any true Doyle fan knows that Sherlock Holmes would never marry anyone. This novel is a disgrace to literature,and I am sure the great creator of Holmes is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this almost blasphemous pastiche. Not a good read. Go find the originals.... with this you are just wasting your time."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I really appreciate thar Laurie King is continuing the Holmes genre and love the fact that he has met his match in a &#34;young modern women&#34;. The story, told from Russell's point of view, allows those of us who enjoy the tales of Holmes to continue with an old friend, while making a new one.The Moor is a wonderful story of Dartmoor and a revisit to the family of Baskerville. It also shows another layer of the Holmes/Russell relationship and how each maintains their identity while forging a life together."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I hate being asked to write a review. Laurie R. King writes intellectually and amusingly: a terrific combination. The end."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This a great series. I recommend any book in this series. I can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I haven't read The Hound of the Baskervilles in over a decade, so revisiting Dartmoor and the eerie misty moor with its bogs and the dominating Baskerville Hall was just as creepy and suspenseful as the original. In The Moor, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes are investigating a murder at the request of Sherlock's old friend Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould. They are trying to find out if there is any truth in the rumors that the curse of the Baskervilles is once more in play.There is a new owner of Baskerville Hall, because the last living heir needed to sell. There are many new characters and places to explore as this dark mystery unravels. This is an excellent addition to the Mary Russell series. Giving 5 stars and making it another favorite. I read it on kindle."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"King is back on track with another good mystery with \\"The Moor,\\" one of the strongest novels of this series since \\"Beekeeper.\\" The title, \\"The Moor,\\" should evoke images from Sherlock's past. Yes, King makes nice use of Doyle's \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" in a playful and reverent manner, and she still makes it her own. \\"The Moor\\" takes us to Dartmoor, where Holmes once solved the case of the Hound of the Baskervilles, at the request of the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. (The characterization of this historical person with the moor, Doyle, and of course, Russell and Holmes is wonderful.) There have been strange sightings of a mysterious coach of glowing bones and, of course, a dog; it is claimed to be a woman who married a local lord who soon died. King's masterful characterization of Russell and Holmes as individuals and a couple continues to evolve as does her characterization especially of Baring-Gould and many of the locals. Her ability to describe and to create the setting is uncanny: Baring-Gould's home is ramshackle, book-lined, with the smell of dinner wafting through to the dusty library. Ms. King delivers innumerable fires in the grate, banked up against the storm outside, and chairs drawn up to the fire-irons, and tea-things and a pipe close to hand. She knows Holmes looks most fetching slumped in a fireside chair at 2 a.m., his fingers steepled as he ruminates a difficult case with Mary, while the wind whips over the moors and gently rattles the windows. Strongly recommended for lovers of Holmes or this series."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"After reading the preceeding books in this series, I was really disappointed. It ran on forever about the rain, rocks, fog, and the travels over the moor. I got it already! Its was WET! I lost the thread of the story very early on. I think I should have just reread the original Hound of the Baskervilles. It would have been more interesting. The end was abrupt and unsatisfying. A review I read by another reader that said this should have been read before, out of order. She was right. OH JERUSALEM wasn't much better. The same theme of dirt, bugs, hostility. Ok. There's a lot of history in this one, but I wasn't looking for a history lesson. I MAY look into the next book in the series. I hope it gets back to the mysteries and relationship of Holmes and Russell. I'll read the sample and if it goes the same way as the last two then I'm done. Too bad. It started out great. We'll see."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I liked the relationship between Holmes and Russell, although I thought Russell's character was much more interesting in this book. But still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Next time I read this - because these are definitely books I will reread now and then as time goes by - I need to read The Hound of the Baskervilles first. It's great fun to watch the investigation into new reports of spectral happenings on the Moor, punctuated by Holmes's disgust with the common man's susceptibility and Russell's very private never-spoken niggling question as to whether in such a weird (in the classical sense) place as this the supernatural might not be real. But best of all is the emotion in the story: another glimpse of Holmes the human being, the fierce friend.The Moor is a prime example of why this series isn't mere fan-fiction, why it rises above the level of most pastiche. I'll probably grow repetitious with these reviews, but so be it: Laurie R. King's Sherlock Holmes is beautifully true to Doyle's, having realistically aged since the last of the original stories, and having found a new lease on life. LRK knows the world she's writing in, both the real world of the 1920's and the earlier London and its environs of the original stories and books - knows it well enough that she can move so confidently from, as here, London to Yorkshire that the reader never questions a detail. Generally the books in the Holmes and Russell series pay only passing homage to the original works; obviously The Moor is a law unto itself. In more ways than one. And honestly, who could resist doing honor to The Hound? It's such a beautiful opportunity to both tie the progenitor and the offspring together and to create the distance this Holmes desires between the things that man Doyle wrote about him and what an intelligent and loving wife would set down. And it also ties together the fictional hero and the man who wrote his \\"biography\\", Sabine Baring Gould, in a lovely manner.Yes, I'm the one who constantly complains, bitterly, about the use of real people as characters in fiction (as well as the use of other people's characters). But there is a world of difference between the Jane Austen, Lady Detective books (not to mention Jane Austen, Vampire or whatever) and this sort of treatment. This was ... wish fulfillment, in a way. Like the Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor - which was something of a valentine to the artist, not so much never-was-or-could-be as an I-wish-this-could-have-been (and I really do) - it's a lovely thing to imagine that this great aficionado of Holmes, Sabine Baring-Gould, was in fact the detective's old and valued friend. I think he would have loved it. As with the setting and Holmes himself, it is obvious that LRK knows what she is talking about inside and out, and has the utmost respect for both the fictional and the actual. It's what makes the series not only tolerable but wonderful."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Sherlock Holmes returns to the moor, but with his newly wed wife, Mary, in tow. Sounds awful, right? Actually this turned out to be a very interesting read. Mary and Holmes must figure out the reason for the reappearence of a spectral hound and carriage combination haunting the moor. It appears that this shadow from the past is determined to plauge moor residents once again. Sherlock, along with his new partner, trek around, interviewing people and trying to fit a very grim mystery together, all while dealing with...OMG! GROUPIES!! From Holme's past, living in the renovated Bakserville Hall. (Poor Holmes, he can't go anywhere without being mobbed here.) Also, not everyone is who they seem, and Holmes has an unexpected family issue to contend with. (Does this sound like an episode of Days of Our Lives yet? Because honestly, I'm really trying not to make it that dramatic.)One of my favorite things about this series, and this book in particular, is the descriptions of food. Laurie King can really make you hungry, or desperately wish for a hot bath on a miserably cold moor night after walking through the fog and mud.Mary, is, as always, an intersting counterpart to the grumpy, aging detective. Intelligent, and witty, she can put Holmes in his place, and often does. I enjoy the banter and relationship between these two.An intriguing reworking of an old case, with a likable new companionable for our favorite detective. I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Laurie R. King has breathed life into the Sherlock Holmes genre, creating a character, Mary Russell, who's an even better companion for Holmes than Watson was. This book takes us back to Dartmoor, and we get a much more complete and fascinating glimpse of that highly unique and interesting place than we got in The Hound of the Baskervilles. The game's afoot again, and Holmes and Russell have another mystery to solve. One of the very best reads in the Holmes/Russell series."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This is the first book I have read by Laurie King, and I will have to try another before I judge her too harshly. This book was filled with rich \\"sherlock holmes\\" style story telling and fit the period nicely, but it had too little action for me and I found it too boring to finish. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this is not for you."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The Moor is the fifth book in Laurie R. King's Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes series. This book is a direct descendant of Conan Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles. This also marks the first time King uses a historical personage in her novels.Holmes get a call for assistance from his godfather, Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. Baring-Gould is an actual historical figure who did write the vast amount of books that Russell reads throughout The Moor. I love the way King incorporates real people into her novels and provides them a history with Sherlock Holmes. Baring-Gould has been hearing rumors of a coach made of bones carrying a woman and accompanied by a hound with one glowing eye appearing on the moor.This mystery has echoes of Hound of the Baskervilles and it is helpful to know that story before you begin The Moor. Holmes returns to Baskerville Hall, which has a new owner. Also, the current mystery revolves around an old ghost tale come to life which is similar to Conan Doyle's story.This is one of the great examples of what I think Laurie R. King does so well throughout the series. She is able to return Holmes to the scene of his most famous mystery, but still make this tale exciting and new. She always pays homage to the great stories that are the inspiration for this series. The only downside to this story is that there is a lot of footwork involved in this investigation so the story occasionally drags. But King's description of Dartmoor and the people that live there is wonderful. As is the somewhat wistful salute to the inhabitant's culture and legends that are beginning to be lost to city-living and modernization.This is the only book in the series that feels like a direct sequel to a Conan Doyle story. It manages to pay tribute to the original and still be a good mystery in its own right.The next book in the series is Justice Hall."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The fourth installment of the Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes series proved to be a surprising disappointment, despite Holmes and Russell's return to Dartmoor, scene of the very infamous crime that took place in front of Baskerville Hall which was well-chronicled by, of course, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.We begin with Russell firmly ensconced at Oxford and working on her theological studies while Holmes is, ostensibly, away on a case. A telegram arrives from Holmes summoning her to the moor. She, of course, folds it and returns to her studies--only to be interrupted a few moments later by another telegram asking her to leave again.Of course, she goes, and finds herself the guest of the Reverend Sabin Baring-Gould, a rector who lives in a rambling pseudo-Elizabethan monstrosity and fancies himself the squire of Dartmoor and its residents. He has asked Holmes to look into sightings of ghostly carriage, followed by a huge dog with a glowing eye, and the murder of a moor resident.So, Russell and Holmes spend much of the book tramping around the unwelcoming, foggy, cold, wet and harsh moor, attempting to interview its residents about the victim and the sightings. Alternately, Russell reads some of the many volumes produced by the aging and infirm squire, who has a very close--but inexplicable to Russell--relationship with Holmes.King does deliver in her writing--the reader truly feels as though they, too, are lost in the pea-soup fog or trudging in bracken and liable to step in a bog and sink at any moment. When respite is offered in the form of stops to local pubs or in front of the fire in Baring-Gould's study, the comfort and relief is equally felt.But the plot was not really all that complex nor the mystery all that difficult or interesting. The characters are mildly intriguing, but with the exception of the \\"witch of Mary Tavy,\\" I found them all very lacking compared to who King has given us in the previous books in the series. And when drawn parallel to young Henry Baskerville and Stapleton, they seem down right cardboard.All this would be alright, but there simply isn't enough character development (virtually none, really; Holmes and Russell's marriage remains distant and still feels sterile, despite tasteful hints of conjugal relations) to drive the novel on that alone. Even the big reveal of why Holmes has such high regard for the reverend isn't all that earth-shattering, and I thought Russell's level of shock upon discovering it was out of character for her.Admittedly, some of this may be the fact that I simply am not that interested in the real-life Rev. Baring-Gould, who (as in the novel) did care deeply about the moor, was a prolific writer and did, in fact, collect the songs and folklore of the area. King said she was drawn to center a novel around him because one of his grandson wrote the \\"definitive biography\\" of Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, A Life of the World's First Consulting Detective, by William S. Baring-Gould) using Baring-Gould's life as a model for Sherlock's. (In the interest of full disclosure, I have not read the biography; I'm content knowing about Dr. Bell and Doyle's internship under him).And Baring-Gould the elder's life does seem like it was interesting: apparently his parents travelled widely, taking their son with them and essentially using the world for his education. But, for whatever reason, this premise simply wasn't enough for me to be fully engaged in the book. Yes, Baring-Gould is well-written, and yes, the real-life man was clearly passionate about the moor, but I simply couldn't connect. The excerpts from his books that head off each chapter began to grow tedious for me.All in all, the novel wasn't unreadable or terrible. And as fans of character mystery series know, each new installment is always a bit fraught, especially when the standard has been set as high as King has set hers. I certainly enjoyed what I learned about the moor and certain scenes of the book did linger. But for all of that, I just can't help but think that perhaps King set her sights a bit too high in deciding to use The Hound of the Baskervilles for her first selection of the canon into which to weave her characters."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"When I try to explain the premise of this Mary Russell series to my friends, who've admired my previous book suggestions, they all look at me with, well, lets face it - disappointment and sometimes concern. They get over it as soon as I can get them reading the first book in the series. These mysteries are intelligent, historical, bringing in theology and I just really appreciate Laurie King's use of language, her editing eye, really interesting and intriguing stories and characters. This is a great mystery series with both a strong female and male lead."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Watching a friend's vacation slides may be an agreeable way to spend an evening, but Laurie R. King tests readers' patience with the same technique when she sends Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, to \\"The Moor.\\"The title refers to Dartmoor, nearly 400 square miles of fields, hills and treacherous marshes in the southwest of England. Conan Doyle set \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (\\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals. Getting to the heart of the hound mystery takes up the last hundred pages, with remarkably little of the suspense which the novel advertises."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This is the fourth book by Laurie King about Mary Russell and her partner, Sherlock Holmes. King is a superb writer and she captures the eeriness of the English moor, but I was a bit disappointed with this novel, and give it a lower rating than the first three books in the series.This is a good book -- with interesting characters and circumstances -- but the pacing is very sloooooow, the mystery is not terribly interesting and, most egregious of all, the dialogue between Russell and Holmes, usually the high point of this great series, never sparkles. Perhaps others are disappointed at the lack of detail concerning the couple's romantic life; I am more interested in their intellectual communion, and that is sorely missing here. I also noticed a fair number of typographical errors for the first time in the series, suggesting lazy or hurried writing, or perhaps a lack of editorial assistance. Perhaps Ms. King should take a rest between novels? It's a shame that this book does not live up to expectations, being a continuation (of sorts) of Holmes' greatest adventure. The mood of the moor and Baskerville Hall are great, the many characters are well written, but unfortunately the spark is not here. Still a fun read for fans, but not as good as the three previous efforts. I will continue to follow the series, but will probably buy them used."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"this is my first foray into laurie king's world and mary russell. the tale is has a decidely vicrtorian feel and doesn't make her heroine too feminist acting considering the times. mary is a good foile for holmes and the adventures have a nice mystery touch. a new spin on holmes to be sure."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":".. bowled over by the first book, &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice,&quot; but found this one, &quot;The Moor,&quot; somewhat of a disapointment.

Sadly, it's been downhill ever since, with only her third effort, A LETTER OF MARY, showing some spark of the first. THE MOOR isn't likely to win many new fans, either, with it's limp plotting that takes an ice age to get rolling. Basically, King has concocted a lame sequel to Doyle's masterwork, THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, but without the characters, pace, or sense of danger which bind the original into such a ripping yarn. Example: You know King is in trouble when her biggest clue - presented to us half-way through the book - is Tiggy the Wounded Hedgehog. Mary Russell - the series heroine and Holmes' much, much younger bride (a development which I still find ridiculous) has become a sulky, hot headed shrew. Worse is the way that King has turned Holmes - when she bothers to include him - into a whimp, to the point that one can imagine her have him gleefully changing nappies when the inevitible Sherlock, Jr.(or Little Mary Russell Holmes) comes along. Holmes fans looking for the real thrill of adventure would be better off with Lary Millett's gripping Watson pastiches - SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE RED DEMON and SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE ICE PALACE MURDERS - than slogging through this uninspired MOOR."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The Moor, the fourth of the Russell/Holmes series is one of my favorites. The mystery again is subtle and really doesn't play out in full until the end of the book. The climax is much less dramatic than in other installments but none the less enjoyable reading. This book is more descriptive in character, an interesting journey into the life of the moor. I enjoyed reading about the landscape, the animals, and culture of Dartmoor. What I enjoyed most was King's ingenious inclusion of the The Hound of the Baskerville's story. Really clever. The secondary character of Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould was well developed. First seen as a grumpy, sexist, opinionated octogenarian, the reader along with Russell begins to see his softer more endearing characteristics and comes to regard him and his love of the moor highly. Russell is coming into more of her own, but at the same time has less of a need to cover or hide her weaknesses to Holmes. Their relationship seemed more realistic and their banter and interplay as always is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book for me. Well done."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This book is awfully slow going and pretty boring. The author spends most of her time describing things like her opinions, her surroundings, and the books she reads to fill in the time because even she is often bored. Unlike Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, the sense of mystery and tension just isn't in THE MOOR. Naturally, things pick up at the very end, but after trudging through some 400 pages to get there I mostly felt relief that the story was finally over."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"In The Moor, Laurie King presents a skillful and sympathetic portrayal of the bleakly beautiful world of Dartmoor. The Moor is not, as many have suggested, a true sequel to The Hound of the Baskervilles, but is instead a re-visiting of the same geographical area with an entirely different viewpoint. Leaving behind the breathless sensationalism of the orginal Conan Doyle tale, King creates a world centered on the moor itself.To be certain, King's Holmes differs greatly from the man Doyle wrote about. The Holmes of The Moor is less supernaturally prescient and much more human, his formidable detecting skills almost overshadowed by his concerns for his ageing friend and mentor, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. King brings Holmes to life as Doyle never did, fleshing in the cold-blooded skeleton.This book may not please those who are rabidly dedicated to the canon, but it is ideal for any Doyle reader who has wondered &quot;What was Holmes REALLY like?&quot;."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I've given up trying to read this book. Like everyone else, I started with the wonderful 'The Beekeeper's Apprenctice' and am trying to read my way through the rest of the series, but none of the others have matched BA so far. And this one is just so bad, after struggling my way at the rate of 1/2 pages per day (v. rare for me I can tell you), I've now given it up as hopeless. I think the worst for me is to see Mary become the total antithesis of what she started out as - I think some reviewers here described her as a shrew, and a more apt expression couldnt be found. Most of the fun, in reading these pastiches was, alongside Holmes, to have the development of Mary into the wonderful character she was in the first and second books. I'm so disappointed with this, and even though O Jerusalem has good reviews I might take a break before getting back to the Russell series again."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I had anticipated a story with suspense, spooky, erie scenes involving the moor. At least, I was hoping for some supernatural scenes, even if they would be eventually explained away later as some phosphorescent paint splashed onto a dog's face, or whatever. What I read was a story about a constantly bored Mary, and a boring story line. All the books I read are subjected to my own rating system from stupid or 0 to E for excellent. I almost did not want to finish this book, which would have meant a &quot;0&quot; rating, but I gave it a Fair rating, instead, partially because I love all Holmes stories. I was tempted to give it a &quot;stupid&quot; ratine, but I could not. In brief, there was almost no suspense, very little mystery, and a total lack of the power of Holmes' presence. So a fair rating was probably too high for this disappointing story."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes return to the moors of the Hound of the Baskervilles, investigating another haunting hound.

Dare I say I like this series better than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's?It's great to see Holmes matched up with a woman who is his equal in brains, curiosity and ambition. Her independence delights. I have always been disappointed that Conan Doyle deprived Holmes of the incomparable Irene Adler and though Mary Russell is not quite Irene, she is quite somethingIt's back to the Hounds of the Baskervilles for this case, but in this case, the relationship between Holmes and Mary Russell overwhlems the mystery.

I have not yet read &quot;O Jerusalem&quot;, i will try it, but if it continues in the pattern of the previous three I plan on not finishing it. &quot;The Moor&quot; had great possibilities, but the solution is given away by the end of chapter 13.

All around it was a disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"In Laurie King's excellent new addition to her popular BeeKeeper's Apprentice series, Holmes and his wife, the intrepid Mary Russell, return to the Devonshire Moors, home of the Baskervilles and numerous ghastly legends. They help out Sabine Baring-Gould (a true British eccentric in the most Monty Python sense) and bond further. King takes a lovely scholarly approach to her mysteries, much admired in this less than literate age, although her details are more Sayer-like than Doyle-esque. I still have a little trouble with Holmes as a love god, but maybe in the next book, Mary can elope with Lord Peter Whimsy. Here's hoping!"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"For those who worried that Laurie King was losing her touch, and that the once-sparkling partnership of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes was in danger of becoming dull, worry no more. THE MOOR, despite its superficially derivative premise, is a fresh, original, and thoroughly engaging mystery featuring Russell and Holmes at their intellectual and investigative best. King has done her homework here and it shows -- she not only shows the reader the brooding vistas of Dartmoor, she transports them there.Also not to be missed is the eccentric, prickly, but always fascinating character of the Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould, a real individual in more ways than one. Again King's scrupulous research comes into play here, as she weaves fact and fiction into a seamless whole.Many of King's former weaknesses in crafting a mystery -- such as failing to introduce us to the villain until the very end of the story -- have been diligently amended here; and, as always, there are enough tips of the hat to (and, occasionally, sly but affectionate pokes at) the Conan-Doyle &quot;canon&quot; to tickle the fancy of Sherlockians. Holmes is at his ascerbic, brilliant best, and Russell shows a human, fallible side that makes her all the more likeable in the end.This is, in my opinion, the best Russell book since THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE, and more than worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This 4th novel in the Mary Russell series continues the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his late-life partner (and wife), with a return to the picturesque setting of _The Hound of the Baskervilles_. Like all old-fashioned mysteries, it presents the elements necessary to solve the puzzle (attentive readers may do so long before the novel's resolution), but the solving of the mystery is only half the point. Long on leg-work and perhaps a little short on adventure, this novel shines in its exploration of setting. The moor comes across as vivid and colorful, its inhabitants real and (as King's version of scholar Sabine Baring-Gould complains) endangered. In my opinion, the pleasure of seeing it through Russell's observant eyes justifies the time we spend rambling with her through her world.King's Russell is an intelligent, interesting woman, and King's take on Holmes does nothing to diminish the man, building believably on the character Doyle created.I had been buying the King books in pairs, but this entry inspired me to collect the remainder of the series...and to revisit the Doyle works as well. I hope Laurie King has many, many more Russell manuscripts in that fictional trunk of hers."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"&quot;The Moor&quot; is the fourth in the series of Mary Russell novels by acclaimed mystery author Laurie R King. For those who haven't kept up to date on the plot developments of the series - Russell is a young woman in her mid-20s and happens to be married to Sherlock Holmes (who is in his 50s or so). In their 1920s world, this partnership investigate a series of mysteries together.&quot;The Moor&quot; takes place in Devonshire, more specifically around Dartmoor. As any Holmes fan can tell you, Dartmoor is the site of Baskerville Hall and thus the site of &quot;The Hound Of The Baskervilles&quot; - arguably Holmes' most famous case. Holmes is staying with his elderly friend, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould, and invites Russell to join him (she is engrossed in theological research).It soon becomes apparent that the folktales of the Moor have come to life again. A ghostly carriage has been seen racing through the Moor, a large dog has made some appearances...and a local tin-hunter has died. Holmes, as a favour to Baring-Gould, has agreed to investigate.What follows is pure Holmes. The smallest thing (in this case, a hedgehog) provides a major breakthrough in the case and a host of shady characters appear to be up to no good. In typical King fashion, Mycroft makes an appearance - this time by requiring Holmes to check on the progress of a top-secret military vehicle stored at the army base on the Moor. Holmes' comment to Russell when she queries the need for such a vehicle following &quot;the war to end all wars&quot; is a cynical one, based around the idea that war is inevitable. As we all know, Holmes was right.The setting of this novel in Devonshire has enabled King to have a considerable amount of licence with the local dialect. Devonshire men don't drink beer, they drink &quot;zyder&quot; (cider) and so on. Perhaps most charming is the nickname Holmes was given during the time of &quot;Hound&quot;, &quot;Znoop Zherlock&quot;. Russell acquires one of her own, although much to her feminist chagrin it is &quot;Zherlock Mary&quot;.Another feature of the setting is that King again plays travel writer, much as she did in &quot;A Monstrous Regiment Of Women&quot; (the second part of the series). Where King's descriptions of the Middle East left a little to be desired, her evocation of Dartmoor - a place which Russell grows to love - is significantly better. The reader can almost feel themselves at the top of the Tor looking out on the bleak expanse.King's humour is also more prevalent here. Upon being asked &quot;What is it, Holmes?&quot;, Holmes responds with the wonderful, &quot;What is what, Russell? I do wish you wouldn't ask me questions with no grammatical antecedent&quot;. Holmes' additions to Russell's list of important events are also slyly humorous.It is not only Holmes' wit on show here. The Devonshire locals all exhibit a dry sense of humour which alternately exasperates and charms both detectives.A particularly well-written scene deals with Russell's first-person account of riding a horse across the Moor. Without ever having taken this action, I found myself laughing out loud at the sardonic humour with which Russell gets used to the foibles of her mount.As well as playing &quot;guide to Devonshire&quot;, King also provides some interesting information about English folksongs - a passion of Baring-Gould. These insights in themselves, along with the scene of the &quot;singing battle&quot; between the Moor men and the villagers, are worth the read.Of course, Holmes could hardly appear on Dartmoor without some sort of &quot;Baskervilles&quot; reference. In this case, the old Hall has been purchased by an American who made his money in Alaska. At dinner at Baskerville Hall, the man's secretary proves himself an avid Conan Doyle fan. Even Holmes himself suggests to Russell that she read Conan Doyle's work again to pick up what proves to be a relatively irrelevant clue - but a recurrent theme of King's work is the difference between the reality of Holmes' work and the version of it portrayed by Doyle.In the event, the solution to the mystery appears almost to come from thin air. In this case, there is a section during which the reader is presented with all the clues to see what they can do with them - although there is not much of a chance that the average reader will come to the same conclusion Holmes and Russell do.Where &quot;The Moor&quot; suffers is by its references - on a regular basis - to &quot;Baskervilles&quot;. While King has done a good job of returning someone else's literary creation to the scene of one of his great triumphs without simply retelling the story, there is certainly something to be gained by reading &quot;The Moor&quot; with a copy of &quot;Baskervilles&quot; nearby. This is not a major problem, but King does become heavy-handed in her references at times.Overall, this book should be taken as the fourth in the series and should be read after the first three. This is to ensure that the reader does not miss anything in the dynamic between the two partners. As a mystery novel, &quot;The Moor&quot; holds up quite well and can be recommended - although more to those who are already familiar with Russell."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I am reading the Mary Russell books in order so I, obviously, don't have a problem with the premise of Mary and Sherlock working together. My problem with &quot;The Moor&quot; is that Mary is reduced to a mere plot device in the first half of the book. The only reason she is there is to give author King an excuse to write a Sherlock Holmes mystery. When Mary finally gets going in the second half, her role is much more diminished than in previous adventures. The second half of the book does make it all worthwhile, though. While not outstanding, &quot;The Moor&quot; is a decent read for fans of the Mary Russell series. If you haven't read any before, though, for heaven's sake don't start here. Go back to &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; and welcome aboard."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"In the fourth book of the Russell - Holmes series Laurie R. Kingpresents us with a novel that echoes the time and pace of the surroundings - the moor. As many reviewers noted, the pace is slow. Time is spent on atmosphere, character development, and in subltle humor that will not be to the taste of everyone. I liked this book better than books two and three in the series, but that might have been because I was in the mood for more leisurely pursuits than when I read the other two. I think Ms. King handled the challenge of returning to the scene of perhaps Holmes' most famous case, in a deft and successful way, but don't read this immediately after watching an Indiana Jones movie. Put the kettle on to boil, let the tea steep, and take your time."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The fourth in the Mary Russell series. I agree with the other reviewers about the slow pace of the book - but I liked it. It's a great series - the books are generally a quick read, and usually touch on some topic in enough detail that your interest is sparked into finding a little more about what you're reading about."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I'm rather surprised by the several negative reviews of The Moor. Certainly, it is a little different from the other Mary Russell novels, but I found it to be so enjoyable, only falling short of The Beekeeper's Apprentice. The pace moves like a little stroll in the park, and it's thoroughly pleasant. Mary Russell is, as always, a charming character, and I really enjoyed Holmes and Russell's quiet, rather loving interactions in this novel. The stately character of Sabine Baring-Gould (an extraordinary person in his real life also) overlooking Russell and Holmes in their treks across the moor also adds a lot to the novel, some sense of old English nostalgia. His presense as an old, sometimes difficult, friend also allows for further character development of the two primary characters. Sure, the mystery does take a backseat in the novel. With two dominant characters like Russell and Holmes, it seems there's little room left for plot, but that is how every Mary Russell novel seems to me. It's not a bad thing. Overall, I truly enjoyed The Moor. It's another excellent read in the series and is just a wonderful novel for light afternoon reading. I can't wait to read the next Mary Russell novel."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I just finished reading this book. I love the way Ms. King has written this series. I have enjoyed the series very much so far adn look forward to reading more adventures of my favorite detective."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I was initially bowled over by Laurie King's &quot;Mary Russell&quot; series(and her Kate Martinelli series too). THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE remains one of the best Sherlock Holmes sequels ever. But it seems each Russell book is a bit less effective than the last. THE MOOR has some wonderful bits of atmosphere, and Ms. King always finds amusing character insights, but the book starts and ends with little of genuine interest ever happening. Halfway through I had to admit that there was nothing other than sheer stubborness to keep me reading."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"After a few rather good works in this series, The Moor is a big let down. It is one of the most boring Sherlock Holmes pastiches I have ever read.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"First, I have to say that it took me a month to read this book. I fell asleep after every ten pages. This was my first Laura King novel, and my last. The characters were uninteresting, the plot virtually nonexistant, completely nothing to hold a person's interest at all. I can suspend my belief far enough to accept Holmes getting married, but losing his deductive skills? When Holmes is in the novel, which is few and far between, he is constantly asking, &quot;Who are you?&quot;, &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;, &quot;How did you get those bruises?&quot;. Holmes would have deduced all that information within the first few seconds of meeting someone. Furthermore, how could Holmes ever forget who his Godfather was? Come on, Ms. King, did you do any reading of Doyle's novels at all? A very lame attempt at what could have been a great novel. A ghostly carriage on the moor, the return of the &quot;hound&quot;, Sherlock Holmes, murder...who could ask for anything more? I could...I want my money back. Don't waste your time or money...unless you have insomnia."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The company mailed the video set in very short order. The item was in excellent condition. I recieved the package well within the timeframe given."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"IF YOU LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES...I am having a unique and enjoyable experience, I recommend it ( or a variation ) to you.I recently discovered the \`Sherlock Holmes' series written by Laurie R. King. I am in love. On my most recent visit to the library I took out the fourth book, \\"the Moor\\", and then I perused the books-on-tape section. The library had only one of Mrs. King's books on CD, a contemporary story about a San Francisco detective named Kate Martinelli, \\"The Art of Detection\\".So I am listening to one in the car and reading one at home. \\"the Moor\\" is my favorite so far in the series. It has everything. Mrs. King manages to weave together a real historical figure, the Baskerville estate, the moor, Sherlock and his new wife, the hound, songs and stories and amazing characters, atmosphere, realistic travelogues, and even a really good murder plot, and more. Every time I crack open the book I am transported.The other story, \\" The Art of Detection \\", surprises me. My only \` less-than-perfect' feeling comes from the narrator, a woman who reads too slowly for my taste. The storyline is interesting from the first moment, because it involves the mysterious murder of a Sherlock Holmes fanatic, whose house is even partially a re-creation of 221b Baker Street. The story seems to move slowly ( which may be the result of the slow narrator ) but it is so realistic that it begins to become boring. I don't mind this because detective work is boring, mostly. Then suddenly Mrs. King does something extraordinary.The plot eventually involves a manuscript which is given to the detective. The manuscript might be a lost Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which takes place in San Francisco. Eventually Kate begins to read it. When Kate begins to read it, a man's voice takes over the narration; and a vibrant, resonant English accent tells a story as if it is Sherlock Holmes telling a story in the first person. It is magnificent. I become totally engrossed. When Kate is interrupted, or stops to talk to someone, the woman narrator takes over. And when she begins to read the story again, the man's voice continues. The affect is powerful. This \`method' also causes me to reflect. Kate has a hard time explaining how engrossed she is in the story to her partner or her fellow policemen. Since they are not reading it, they aren't relating to the story and easily make jokes. Mrs. King has utilized a very effective tool to operate on many levels, raising this \`detective' story to a different height."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I honestly like the actual text of this book well enough. The Mary Russell series, particularly the first four, are an entertaining take on Sherlock Holmes. This narration, however, is very disappointing, primarily because the reader can't do a consistent American accent.

Maybe non-Americans with particularly dull ears could enjoy this, but I couldn't even finish the book."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"This book continues on in the tradition set by the Beekeepers Apprentice.

She has managed not only to capture Holmes but also to provide the detailed settings that Conan Doyle sometimes missed. And as for my fear that a &quot;Mrs.&quot; Holmes would be portrayed as a feminist in the political sense, I'm glad to say that my fears were baseless. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"I purchased this book for my mother as a Mothers Day present. She read 25-30 pages and put it aside. So I read it.

Not an unpleasent read but not exciting."},{"Title":"The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel","review":"The first of the Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes books from Laurie King -- Beekeeper's Apprentice -- was terrific. The next two -- Monstrous Regiment and Letter of Mary -- were disappointments by comparison.

For example, we are shown that a Ring-Necked Pheasant exhibits a wing-whir after its song, even thought it can be difficult to hear in actual recordings.Some of the bird names, both common and scientific, are a bit out of date. The Boreal Chickadee is called the Acadian Chickadee here. Sedge Wren is Short Billed Marsh Wren.At rough count, there seem to be around 200 bird species documented here, and they (like many birding books) appear to have a slightly east-coast bias."},{"Title":"In Search of the Neanderthals: Solving the Puzzle of Human Origins, with 183 Illustrations","review":"The authors really do a great job in doing a detailed study of Neanderthals, their lives and their world. They catalogue the fossils found, examine how we know what we know from the bones, tools and even the ash from the fires.The only problem is that the book was published in 1993-1994 and does not take into account later DNA tests and the four-year-old child who lived five thousand years after the last of the Neanderthals SHOULD of died (found in 1999)who showed signs of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals. So, while the conclusion in the book that we did not come from Neanderthals may not be correct (and still open to debate), the chapters dealing in detail with Neanderthal tools, camp sites, society, art and burial are a must for people interested in the subject..."},{"Title":"In Search of the Neanderthals: Solving the Puzzle of Human Origins, with 183 Illustrations","review":"Having only a cursory knowledge about human pre-history, I asked a colleague in the anthropology department for a good primer. He gave me this. It was a veritable cornicoupia of information, even as the authors sought to provide their own answers to quesitons of acadmeic controversey.The central question Stringer and Gamble seek to answer is: are modern humans kin to Neaderthals, or are we distantly related? In answering this, readers are treated to a briefing on the ice age world of the Lower and Middle Paleolithic, the relation of Neanderthals to other early humans, the way in which Neanderthals have been understood (and seen) by science and the public, before the book really hits its stride in disucssing the archaeology of Neanderthal sites and what they tell us about these early humans.The authors belive that modern humans are related to (rather than directly from) Neanderthals, and that by the Upper Paleolithic, were being replaced by modern humans coming out of Africa (\\"Out of Africa II\\"). The evidence in support of this is strong, although not overwhelming: mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) as well as behavioural data are primarily used.In all, it was a worthwhile and fascinating read, and certainly provides more depth on the specific case of Neanderthals than other books on early humans."},{"Title":"In Search of the Neanderthals: Solving the Puzzle of Human Origins, with 183 Illustrations","review":"The book was in perfect condition and the shipping was really fast."},{"Title":"Enduring Liberalism: American Political Thought Since the 1960s (Modern War Studies)","review":"Apart from having read this great, informative work, I had this man in an Integrated Liberal Studies class at the UW-Madison, where he teaches.

Ostensibly about the trials and tribulations of a Venetian shipping entrepreneur and his circle of friends, the real subject of interest has long been Shylock, one of Shakespeare's most famous and controversial characters.Was Shakespeare ripping into an already persecuted minority, the Jews of Europe, by showcasing Shylock's twisted desire for vengeance in this, a play from around the time of his mature middle period, the late 1590s? Or was he deftly attacking the persecutors, by giving his villain a human face and holding up a mirror to the supposedly \\"gentle\\" Gentiles, a pun frequently presented in the text?I don't know. I know I was uncomfortable reading \\"Merchant In Venice\\", uncomfortable with the realization that even if Shakespeare wasn't anti-Semitic himself, he was writing to entertain an anti-Semitic audience with forced conversions and legalized theft. Yes, Shylock delivers his famous speech about the humanity of Jews: \\"If you prick us, do we not bleed?\\" But his ruin in Act IV is pitilessly celebrated all the same, by a group that includes Shylock's own daughter Jessica, a positively presented character who joins her Christian friends in calling her father \\"the Jew\\".Alas, the language of this morally squalid play is beautiful throughout, especially in Act V, where ribald puns about horns and rings and some engaging banter between the otherwise unengaging leads remind one of Shakespeare's greatest comedies. But there's also a substantial boredom factor, like the repetitive tediousness of a casket-choosing contest Portia puts her wooers through and the droning goodness of bland Antonio, the nominal lead character. A promising clown, Launcelot Gobbo, has one funny scene with his \\"more than sand blind, high-gravel blind\\" father before slipping into the background.My old Signet edition has an introduction by Kenneth Myrick that offers an interesting interpretation. As Myrick presents it, the core issue here is not Jew vs. Christian but narrow-minded legalisms vs. affairs of the heart. \\"The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps over cold decrees,\\" observes Portia.But that's subtext. To get to subtext, one must wrestle with assorted jeers at Shylock for the crime of his faith, not to mention the inanity of Antonio's situation, putting himself in debt for a friend who, it turns out, really didn't need the money.I never liked \\"Merchant Of Venice\\", but I never really hated it. It's a glass half-full/half-empty kind of thing. There's enough dimension to Shylock to discredit the notion of him as a mere ethnic whipping boy, just not enough to make one believe Shakespeare intended a sympathetic interpretation. Even the harshest scene in the play, for those of us who feel sympathy for Shylock, the one where he is denied his famous pound of flesh, contains Portia's great soliloquy about \\"the quality of mercy\\", not to mention a tense and clever courtroom drama.\\"Merchant Of Venice\\" is not one of Shakespeare's best plays. It is fine in parts, however, and interesting throughout, a reflection of ugly people in an ugly time that captivates you with moments of true beauty."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"This may be the most controversial (to modern culture) play that Shakespeare wrote. It deals with the racial disparities popularly belived in Shakespeare's day to exist between Christians and Jews. Christianity is presented as a tenet of generosity, goodwill, charity, celebration, and joy. Judaism, however, is contrasted starkly as a sort of disease that plagues its followers, causing them to be miserly and humorless. Shakespeare gives us some very direct social commentary that rivals his work in The Tempest. Evidence that Shakes is trying to make a point is the way he plants a typical Jewish merchant with reasonable grievances in a field of blind and clearly absurd (albeit our modern bias of &quot;evolved sensibilities&quot;) stereotypes accepted as the norm. The regular helping or irony is served up by an ambiguously glossy denouement, leaving more questions than answers on justice and prejudice."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"Any teacher knows that getting high school students to enjoy reading shakespeare is a monumental task.

Following the text, an essay by Alexander Leggatt follows illuminating \`The Merchant of Venice' for the modern reader. In addition, an eleven page \`Further Reading' list pinpoints books and essays on topics like the play itself, Shakespeare, the time in which he lived and the Globe Theatre. Rounding out the vital information is a three page \\"Key to Famous Lines and Phrases\\" complete with speaker and verse notation.As far as the play itself, I will keep my remarks limited, saying only that for the modern audience, Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" borders on the provocative. All with politically correct upbringing or today's cultural sensitivity training cannot help but focus on the reigning prejudice of the early Medieval and Renaissance time period, namely the exclusion of Jews from all forms of normal life since mainstream thought withheld that this race was primarily responsible for Christ's crucifixion.Indeed, today's reader will pose the question as to whether or not this play should be deemed more tragedy than comedy and must remember that as a comedy, \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" focuses on marriage, couples (Bassanio/Portia, Lorenzo/Jessica, Gratiano/Nerissa) and their emotional and financial interrelationships and uses sly humor and innuendo to poke fun at Venice's societal \`outsiders'(Shylock, Morocco, Aragorn and in a lesser sense Antonio) who do not form a Shakespearean couple per se. Looked at from this perspective, the character of Shylock becomes simply the play's foremost societal outcast, in spite of the famous speech where he asks seemingly so poignantly, \\"If you prick us, do we not bleed?\\"Bottom line: Shakespeare is Shakespeare. If your modern sensibilities are offended by Shakespeare's treatment of Shylock the Jew, the Prince of Morocco and the Prince of Aragorn and question the unhappy and solitary Antonio's intense feelings for Bassanio, simply keep in mind that the world at that time looked at such things differently. Within the definition of comedy, this play with its multitude of lovely speeches and images works well indeed.

Hurt people hurt people. Shylock seems evil - \\"the devil incarnate\\", one of the characters calls him, yet one of the most powerful moments in the play is his \\"Hath a Jew not eyes?\\" speech. He is badly, deeply wounded. All of the hate and bitterness and desire for death that he carries is a result of the way he has been slandered, abused, and injured by the people around him. Much of this abuse goes on during the play, though little of it by Antonio. Antonio clearly despises Shylock's way of making money - usury - and it's possible that his harsh words have nothing to do with Shylock's religion, only with his profession. (though historians say it is nearly impossible to separate the two - Jews were usurers and usurers were Jews. There wasn't much else the government allowed them to do.)A forgivness/mercy reading places at the center of the play both Shylock's speech, and Portia's beautiful speech on the quality of mercy at the trial. The decisions by the Duke and Antonio to have mercy upon Shylock when the tables turn. Perhaps, as some critics have said, Antonio's condition that Shylock become a Christian is not an attempt to rob him of his identity, but to make him like the rest of them, and thus welcome him in. Doubtful that it works - it's hard to see Shylock leave, nearly ill at the end, and know that there is really no justice for him. His wounds are real.The romantic comedy element of the play really isn't that great -- especially the ring manipulation at the end. Not only is it tiresome, it's absolutely clunky to have Graziano and Nerissa mirroring their masters.There are some interesting things swirling around the chests. When the right chest turns out to be \\"Who chooseth me must give and hazard a much all he hath,\\" this seems to reinforce the theme of mercy and forgiveness taking place in the foreground.

He is handsome, well loved, and wise to boot. He spreads his business risk by sponsoring several ships each going to different destinations.But is he really the hero? He has it all, and by the end he'll have neither lost nor gained anything.Antonio's ventures leave him short of cash when a close friend asks money of him. To help his friend, he signs a bond with the local Jewish money lender, Shylock, who instead of lending money at interest against collateral, or simply on Antonio's well earned creditworthiness, makes his loan interest free and asks for a pound of Antonio's flesh should he default.Why does Shylock ask for this? Because he's had enough. He can no longer stand the insults from Antonio and the other merchants of Venice. They spit at him, call him names, and now their proudest member comes hat in hand for a loan. Antonio can have it but on Shylock's harsh yet generous terms.This is the tragic mistake, the flaw, the display of hubris that we would find in any tragedy. In asking for a man's life as a surety, and then expecting to collect when the man defaults, Shylock goes too far. He is trying to make his own justice, outside of the courts, usurping the privilege of both the government and of god.Shylock pays a terrible price. His own words trick him and he must forego his revenge. Worse, he loses his fortune also, he is forced to convert away from his faith, and his daughter repudiates him. He is brought down as surely as are Shakespeare's other great tragic heroes such as Macbeth, King Lear, and Hamlet.And Antonio? His ships finally come in, and he ends where he started.

What I think this shows is that anti-Semitism thrives in an envirornment of ignorance: it is easier to despise someone at a distance and turn them into a monster in your imagination, whereas if you had to interact with them regularly you would see that the stereotypes break down and are not actually true.The fact that a genius of the stature of Shakespeare was not immune to this syndrome should not be surprising, he was after all a product of his culture and played to his audience who harbored these ideas, and he may have thought he was holding a mirror up to the society in order to display the ugliness of anti-Semitism."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare, is a play that many readers will enjoy. Although this play may seem lighthearted, it addresses important themes and reflects societal views. The theme of appearances versus reality is depicted through the gold, sliver, and lead caskets that Portia's suitors pick from, illustrating the clich&eacute; that \\"all that glitters is not gold\\". This theme is revisited when Portia dresses as a man and cleverly solves the conflict between Bassanio, Antonio, and Shylock. Shakespeare also addresses the anti-Semitic views of the Elizabethan society though the antagonistic interaction between Antonio and Shylock. At the conclusion of the play, all the conflicts are happily resolved: Bassanio and Portia are reunited and Shylock converts to Christianity. The audience leaves the play with that warm and happy feeling. I would highly recommend this play."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"I played Nerissa (Portia's friend) in my college production of Merchant, and I have to say as an experienced Shakespeare reader that this play is really unique compared to some of his other plays.

Read it or go see it!"},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"After reading most of the other reviews here, I am fully aware that most of the reviewers didn't read carefully enough (or watch carefully enough if they saw the play.) Now, I'm not saying its not open for different interpretations, but there is one thing I would really like to get straight.I read MoV for a Bar Mitzvah project on Anti-Semitism. Naturally, my sympathies went to Shylock. However, even if i were Christian, i still would've favored Shylock. What many people believe is that Shylock is a cold hearted ruthless person and only wanted to get back at Antonio because Antonio was a Christian.Not true. Shylock specifically says something along the lines off, \\"Why should I lend money to you? You spit on me, and call me a Jewish dog!\\" I'm not saying that Shylock was a good guy, but I am saying that he is not the villain.In fact, the \\"Merchant of Venice,\\" in this story is actually Shylock, not Antonio, contrary to popular belief. My thoughts on the story was that Shylock requested a pound of Antonio's flesh because he did not trust Antonio. Who would trust someone that spat on him? The fact is, Antonio doesn't pay him back in the end.Now, there's always something else we have to put into consideration. Would the judge had given the \\"spill one ounce of Christian blood\\" verdict at the end if Shylock were not a Jew?This is the mark of a great play. A play that really gets you thinking. But I encourage you, I beg of you, that when you read it or see it, please do not hold Shylock up to being a cold hearted villain. Hold Antonio up to that image. (joking, of course, Antonio's not a bad guy, he's just not a good guy.)"},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE can be described as a tragedy only if one follows the modern definition of \\"tragedy\\" and not the Greek. The genre of tragedy in which Shakespeare wrote required that all of the players, or at least all of the main players, die at the end, &agrave; la ROMEO AND JULIET, JULIUS CAESAR, MACBETH, and HAMLET. In fact, MERCHANT OF VENICE can only be described as a tragedy if Shylock is seen as the main character and not Antonio. (Note, in the list of players at the beginning of the play, only Antonio is called a \\"merchant of Venice\\".) In sum, THE MERCHANT OF VENICE can only be described as a tragedy if it is completely removed from its historical context.Shakespeare intended that the actions taken by Antonio, by Shylock, by Bassanio, and even by Portia be seen as comically extreme. Antonio goes to the lengths of seeking help from a man he despises to help a man he loves. Shylock demands nothing but justice, even when the demands of the agreement he made is met and even doubled. Everywhere in this play is there action taken to the extreme.Only a refusal to acknowledge the historical context would be blind to the comedy. There are stage plays, television shows, and screenplays aplenty which follow the example set forth in MERCHANT OF VENICE, showing how comical people can be when their actions are taken to the extreme. If MERCHANT OF VENICE can be view in THIS context, then the comedy shines through.As a writer, I find it comical that anyone would use MERCHANT OF VENICE to point the finger of \\"racism\\" at Shakespeare. Part of a writer's challenge is to present convincingly views even he or she disagrees with. The best writer would try to dismantle and disprove the very beliefs he or she holds dear. That Shakespeare has often been judged a racist based on his portrayal of Shylock serves only as testimony to the continuing success of this play. Shylock's speech, complimented by another reviewer, is ample proof that Shakespeare's own views are well hid. Shylock's speech demonstrates magnificently that Shakespeare was able to get inside the head of any man (or woman) in his stories and write the words which that man would speak, faithfully render the thoughts which that man would think, have that man act as only that man would act, and all of it be believable. Simply put, unless you knew beforehand a writer's views on any subject, it would be difficult to find the needle of truth in his or her haystack of fiction if that writer has done their job well, and in this case Shakespeare was damned near flawless!It is true that the movie, starring Al Pacino, does not present this play as a comedy, but that hardly detracts from its excellence. It shows, in fact, that MERCHANT OF VENICE plays well as both a drama and a comedy. In our age, however, given the importance of religious tolerance, I'll admit that it is probably best played as a drama.As for the Pelican series of Shakespeare's plays, they are an excellent resource for anyone wanting to read and study the Bard's work. I've several volumes in this series and hope to eventually own them all. Each volume contains two identical essays, \\"The Theatrical World\\" (which provides a good understanding of the historical context, as well as an idea of just how much we know about Shakespeare as an individual) and \\"The Texts of Shakespeare\\" (which gives more historical context and also discusses some of the difficulties which editors have experienced in presenting these plays in print to modern audiences). There is then an introduction to each play, which is best left unread until afterwards if you aren't familiar with the play. The footnotes are few, but well-chosen, and do help in understanding words and phrases whose meanings have changed over the centuries."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"A person is not born to the side of good or evil, rather, their character is shaped by their environment. When a society mistreats an individual, the public is responsible for the consequential character development. More regrettable is the fate of the individual who is cursed with the weight of a flawed disposition through the iniquities of civilization.Shylock is one such condemned human being. Though viewed in Elizabethan culture as the epitome of evil, modern readers see him for what he truly is: a proud man who is the victim of society's wrath. The Christians in the story are constantly abusing Shylock because of his religion.Although Shakespeare's intention was to provide the audience with a deplorable villain, he ironically created a character that is more pitiful than the intended hero and heroine. While modern readers might criticize the anti-Semitism of the Christians, the public's treatment of him and other followers of his faith justify Shylock's desire for revenge. Being the victim of society's revulsion since he was young, he was naturally hardened by the hate that was thrown against him everyday. His miserable childhood was likely what left him bereft of any emotion except greed and disgust of Christians. He became incapable of any softer feeling, even to the point where he did not love his own daughter.The lesson that I took away from this story is that we should treat others the way we want to be treated - the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;. Antonio was always abusing Shylock, and in return nearly lost his life."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"Shylock is the only sympathetic character in the play. Modernity has altered the villain in \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" from Shylock to the entire cast of characters EXCEPT for Shylock. Any sense of comedy in the play died for those with a sense of religious tolerance, and Shylock comes off as merely oppressed. I found Act 5 almost nauseating after the forced conversion. That, coupled with the happy racism makes a perversion of decency and happy endings. This play is a tragedy. The recent movie version done starring Al Pacino turned it into a tragedy, and amazingly, a play written as a comedy seems to work very well as a tragedy.Antonio gladly spits upon Shylock and calls him a dog, but stunningly, when Antonio finds himself in a financial pinch he goes to Shylock for money. More brash is Antonio's promise to act the same in the future: \\"I am as like to call thee so again, / To spet on thee again, to spurn thee, too.\\" (1.3.127-28) From this point on, sympathy for Antonio is paralyzed in a modern reader's mind, from reminders of past images, from slavery and anti-Semitism, where the dehumanizing of a group of people is accepted by a society. The entire text afterward reads like an indictment of humanity, as if Shakespeare is making the Elizabethans laugh at their own behavior.In perhaps the best argument in Shylock's defense in the trial, he point out the fact that those who speak of mercy own slaves. \\"What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? / You have among you many a purchased slave.\\" (4.1.89-90) Shylock, as fanatical as he is over the pound of flesh, is asking for only a pound of a man, when the slaveholders own the entire person. The play is littered with prejudiced remarks that clearly show how animalistic Shylock was to them.Every conversation involving Shylock has ridicule from the Christians, without remorse or a feeling of comedy. The Christian children are taught to mock Shylock, they run after him in the street. The merchants spit on him, the Duke reviles him, his daughter renounces her religion and robs him.Still an amazing story, with a few of the best on mercy and prejudice ever written."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"What scholars today call \\"The Problem Plays\\" seem to me to be problems more for us because of our changed sensibilities from those of Elizabethan London rather than problems in the plays themselves. \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" is called anti-Semitic by eminent scholars such as Harold Bloom. In our post-Holocaust age and our sensitivity to stereotypes of all sorts, Shylock bothers us in a way not dissimilar to watching the great Al Jolson perform in blackface. That is, it is clearly the work of a great entertainer, but it jars us, makes us wince, and we are (justly) unable to watch with the same enjoyment as the audience for whom the work was created.Still, this is Shakespeare and Shylock is immortal. When I read through the play, I place Shylock as \\"the other\\" rather than as a caricature of the Jewish race. More than that, he is simply a vicious person irrespective of his ethnic ties and origins. I do like Bloom's insistence that this play was written as a dark comedy and was performed as such for centuries. The editor of this edition, John Russell Brown also states this. At some time around the 19th century, Shylock acquired pathos and the play has been performed as a drama ever since.Does it work as a drama? You will have to answer that for yourself. However, if you insist on a moral drama you will have a great many moral contradictions to settle that do not matter as much if the play is done more for simple cleverness and laughs. Can we really take seriously the casket game that Portia's late father left her as the way she must select her spouse? Does Antonio (the Merchant of Venice) seem a proper embodiment of Christian values?To me, the play does seem awfully light hearted with all of its darkness given to Shylock. He is a villain with infinitely more substance than Snidely Whiplash, but provides much the same function. He must be hated; he must be spat upon and jeered by the audience to fill his role. And he must lose in the end. Not because others are more virtuous (any serious analysis of the play shows everyone in the play wanting in virtue), but simply because he is the bad guy.Portia is the wonder of the play. Her glow is so bright that it is obvious she is light to Shylock's darkness. Her defeat of Shylock is acceptable in a comedy, in a serious drama she seems to have gone too far considering what is really involved.In any case, this play has delighted audiences for centuries and will continue to do so. It is a great read and this critical edition aids the reader's understanding. The opening essay is fine and the appendices showing the various sources of the tale are also interesting in helping us see the genius of Shakespeare in what he developed on his own and how he wove the various components into this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"As Harold Bloom says, this has become an unplayable play after the Holocaust. This is only an additional reason why one should read it. The play is fantastic and gives us one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters: Shylock. Whether you see him as villain or victim, Shylock is unforgettable. As is his speech defending the Jewish."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE is a perfect play, a romantic comedy with a memorable tragic hero and a fairy tale element, as well. Venetian merchant Antonio and his best friend, Bassanio, find themselves in trouble with the Jewish moneylender Shylock over a sizeable unpaid debt. Bassanio had borrowed the money on his friend's credit, and Antonio had been confident that he would be able to repay Shylock. But when Antonio's ships miscarry at sea, and when Shylock's daughter, Jessica, elopes with Lorenzo, a Christian, taking much of her father's gold with her, the moneylender vows revenge: he will insist on his right to extract, in court, \\"a pound of flesh\\" from Antonio. Bassanio had used the money to woo Portia, a witty and beautiful lady who lives in idyllic Belmont and who must, according to her late father's wishes, marry whichever suitor chooses the one casket out of three that contains her portrait. One of the caskets is made of gold, another of silver, and the third of lead. Bassanio's realization that the leaden casket is the one with Portia's picture in it proves the old maxim that appearances are deceiving and that \\"[a]ll that glisters is not gold.\\" In the end, it is Portia who saves the day by impersonating a lawyer in court and using the letter of the law itself to defeat Shylock and save Antonio's life.Considering the general anti-Semitism of his era, Shakespeare gives Shylock marvelous depth that itself repudiates any charge of anti-Semitism on his part. Shylock's greatest moment is, of course, his speech beginning \\"Hath not a Jew eyes?\\" and continuing, \\"If you prick us, do we not bleed?...If you poison us, do we not die?\\" Furthermore, Shakespeare makes it clear that the Christians in the play - even including the honorable Antonio and the likeable Bassanio - have publicly insulted Shylock by spitting on him and calling him a \\"dog.\\" As a consequence, we understand Shylock's hatred of Christians and sympathize with him, even as he mercilessly prepares to take Antonio's life. Only Shakespeare could have so successfully placed such a complex tragic figure at the center of a comedy."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"This play can be read as anti-semitic. In fact, it's pretty hard to defend it from such charges. Shylock is a pretty rotten character and the fact that he is jewish is difficult to overlook (particularly since the other characters mention it on pretty much EVERY page). However, I think it is important to mention that the &quot;heroes&quot; of this play do not necessarily have to be interpreted as heroes. They are by no means perfect and there are many subtle (and some not-so-subtle) instances within the text in which their biases against ANYONE unlike them is illustrated. If one reads the play this way, then Shylock becomes more of a tragic figure rather than an absolutely heartless villain. I don't know. My feelings about this are mixed. There are a few funny parts of this play and the language is, as always, beautiful. The theme of putting a price on human beings is one which has been explored numerous times since. Overall, it is enjoyable, but perhaps not so much so as some of the other comedies. Do not read this play without having read a few others by Shakespeare first. It is an excellent play, but not his best and not his most enjoyable either."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"Till today, every pen-stroke William Shakespeare made draws respect.

He picks the lead casket, which just happens to be the right one. Meanwhile, in order to get the money Antonio asks the help of a Jew named Shylock who is out for revenge because Antonio is a Christian. He makes Antonio promise to give him a pound of his flesh if he does not pay Shylock back. Shylock's daughter Jessica elopes with Lorenzo and this also makes Shylock angry, mostly because Lorenzo is a Christian. Portia and Bassanio get married as do Portia's assitant Nerissa and Antonio's friend Gratiano. When he fails to pay back the forfeit, a trial is held to find out if Antonio deserves to have a pound of his flesh taken out of him and at this trial Portia and Nerissa dress up as a doctor and a clerk to fool their husbands and the other men by asking for their own wedding rings. They succeed in letting Antonio get away with his life and say that the life of Shylock is in the hands of the Duke, who makes the Jew give all his money to Bassanio and Antonio.I recommend this play to others and also all of Shakespeare's other plays. If you can get into them they are good reads."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"As another reviewer mentioned it is a totally different experience to read a play (especially Shakespeare) when you haven't seen it performed. Yet I decided to do just that with Merchant of Venice, and though my opinion would undoubtedly be different if I had seen it performed, as it stands I can only offer my opinion on it as a written work. As I read the work itself I had a difficult time seeing past the blatant anti-Semitism to analyze the work itself. After reading the play however I went back and read the introduction [...] and the introduction pointed out several things that if they are to be believed would help alleviate my dislike of the treatment of the character of Shylock the Jew. First apparently Shakespeare's prime target in making Shylock a sort of villain was really moneylenders in general, people mostly disliked by those making up much of Shakespeare's audience. The fact that Shakespeare made his moneylender Jewish is more of an exotic touch having to do with the play's setting in Venice. Apparently Jews were incredibly rare in England in Shakespeare's time and though the audience would of course know of them the chance that any of the commoners in the general admission area of the Globe had ever seen a Jew themselves is about as likely as them having seen a Moorish prince like the one courting Portia. As to Shakespeare's cruel treatment (or rather the other characters' cruel treatment) of Shylock's faith, Kenneth Myrick explains that during Shakespeare's time Jews were known particularly for their love for the letter rather than spirit of the law, and were disliked for that attitude. Apparently the characters in Merchant of Venice showing animosity towards Shylock and his faith would be similar to characters in a modern day tv sitcom making fun of a fundamentalist right-wing Christian. Which is not to say that that makes the behavior of either group acceptable, but for myself it puts it into a different light than if people were saying the same thing to a Jew today. Anyway when I was able to look past the anti-Semitism of the play and look at its other qualities here is what I thought: Shakespeare is creating with this play a kind of fairy tale. The caskets that challenge the various suitors to Portia, so that only the noble Bassanio might marry her; the villain who in a jealous and vindictive rage plots to end the life of Bassanio's true friend; and the deus ex machina appearance of Portia in drag to save the day and make the villain pay. This last bit is what makes it more interesting than the classic fairy tale, as it is the fairy princess that swoops in to save the hopelessly trapped knights. And in that it has strong and liberating roles for the female characters, Merchant of Venice succeeds. However I must admit that even without the anti-Semitism holding me back a bit, I just didn't find this work as humorous or as well written in general as some of Shakespeare's other play. Certainly his tragedies surpass it in writing skill, and of his comedies that I have read, this is the least humorous. I must qualify that however by saying that this is Shakespeare nonetheless, and even if it can't compare with his other work, he still is one of the greatest playwrights in the English language."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"For many people who enjoy classical literature, whether Greek tragedy or Shakespearean comedy, it comes down to which version of the work is the best. I have read the Merchant of Venice many times, and was looking to read it again. However, there are well over 50 versions to purchase on Amazon alone.My review, then, focuses not so much on the play itself, but on this Signet edition. Whichever side of the \\"Shylock shows Shakespeare as a racist\\" issue you are on, the reality to me is that this is wonderful literature. That being said, I highly recommend this particular version for several reasons. The introduction to Shakespeare, his time, his language, the theater, and other areas is well written. While perhaps not new information to Shakespeare buffs, I think people reading Shakespeare for the first or second time would find it extremely enlightening. There is also an 18 page introduction to MoV that is like a Cliff's Notes version with some insight as readers prepare to absorb the beautiful language ahead.With respect to the play, this edition does not bog the reader down in defining every other word, but rather only those words that are completely foreign to the modern speaker, or that had a completely different meaning 400 years ago. After the play are some excellent essays that may help enighten those readers who are wondering about Shylock and his portrayal. I also enjoyed the history of dramatic performances and who played whom in past productions."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"It seems to me it is more helpful to rate and review the edition than the play itself, and this edition is superb. Along with the other Oxford Shakespeare books, this one has outstanding notes that are presented in such a way as to be easy to glance at while reading without breaking rhythm too much. I have found that each time I think to myself, \\"I don't quite understand,\\" there is a note on point that sets me back on the right track. There are also high-quality but very accessible essays and background information provided after the text of the play.Every time I'm going to read a Shakespearean play, I look for a version in this series; it is certainly worth a couple extra dollars or the frustration of reading from different page numbers than classmates if you are reading for a class."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"We studied this play in a class. We have also done Julius Caesar and are doing Twelth Night this fall and As You Like It this Spring. The Merchant of Venice is wonderful. It is about Antonio (the merchant) and his friend Bassonio. Bassonio is very poor but he loves a rich heiress named Portia who lives in Belmont. Portia's father, who was dead , had set up a test.There were three caskets and one had Portia's picture in it. Ther was an inscription on each casket to guide the choosers. Whoever chose the right casket got to marry Portia, but if he chose wrongly then he couldn't marry anyone else. Bassanio wants to borrow money so he can go choose in hopes that he could marry Portia. Antonio borrows money from Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, for Bassanio. Shylock has a daughter, Jessica, who elopes with a Christian named Lorenzo. Shylock agrees to lend the money but if Antonio doesn't repay it in three months then Shylock gets to cut off a pound of his flesh. Antonio has ships due in within two months so he thinks that there will be plenty of time. Bassanio choose the right casket and marries Portia. He gets a letter from Antonio saying that he couldn't repay Shylock in time. Portia dresses up as a lawyer when the matter is taken to court. Antonio wins. The reason I gave it an eight is because of the Elizabethan language."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"This is a wonderful play - and unless you have seen it or read it you don't know it at all. That's because everything the popular culture tells us about this play is false (for example; how many of you think this play is about a merchant named Shylock? ;-)The Merchant of Venice is a lively and happy morality tale. Good triumphs over bad - charity over greed - love over hate.There is fine comedy. Portia is one of Shakespeare's greatest women (and he ennobled women more than any playwright in history). There are moments of empathy and pain with all the major characters. There is great humanity and earthiness in this play. These things are what elevate Shakespeare over any other playwright in English history.Plays should be seen - not read. I recommend you see this play (if you can find a theater with the courage and skill to do it). But if it is not playing in your area this season - buy the book and read it."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"The book &quot;Merchant Of Venice&quot; was a classic that I enjoyed reading. The characters particularly brrought the story to life and a joy to read, the romance, the heartache, the hatred. This was my first Shakespeare play that I have read and I am now about to read Romeo and Julliet."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"This is an outstanding play. The comedy is rich, but the story is also well constructed. Portia'passage on mercy (4.1) is one of the most unforgettable passages in Shakespeare's writings. I can not overestimate Shakespeare's brilliance in the way he constructs the dramatic irony of this play. Shylock's emphasis on the letter of the law over mercy leads to his own downfall. I feel this play was a bold move on Shakespeare's part. To be sure, it is a great play in itself, but I suspect there is more. I can not help but think the Gospels inspired Shakespeare in the writing of this play. It is almost as if Shylock represents the Jewish authorities and Portia represents Christ. To elaborate further, Antonio may have been derived from the cripple that Christ heals. So leave it to Shakespeare! A comical play, a good story, memorable passages, and divine roots all rolled into one. Shakespeare, I salute you!"},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"First off, one thing needs to be made clear: in rating this play a mere &quot;2 stars&quot;, I'm rating it as opposed to other Shakespearean plays; if rated against the general run of books available, it would be at least three stars, maybe four.The problem is, there are some very good things to be said about this story, but also some very bad things. A modern reader almost certainly takes a very different message from the story than one in Shakespeare's time, when it was perfectly acceptable to stereotype Jews as venal moneylenders, and when forcing a Jew to convert to Christianity at the end of the play could be considered to be in keeping with the &quot;happy ending for all&quot; required of comedies at the time.Granted, Shylock is not a particularly attractive character, so it is difficult to feel much sympathy for him, but as difficult as it is to make him sympathetic, Shakespeare (apparently unintentionally) manages. The man is not only cheated out of his (contractually due) spiteful revenge, but is not even allowed to accept a lesser payment once it is made apparent that he dare not hold Antonio to his word. He loses his daughter; she not only runs away but steals from him in the process, and yet he is not even allowed to disinherit her. And, of course, he's forced to convert to the religion of the people who did all of this to him. He may have been unappealing, but not enough to deserve all of THAT.Further, although Antonio is shown as being generous and brave enough to accept his fate when he thought it was unavoidable, he is a fool for allowing himself to be in that position to start with, and is all too quick to allow Shylock to be cheated of ANY recompense once he's given leave to do so. A TRUE hero would have INSISTED on paying the man his principle and more once let off the hook for his life, even when the &quot;judge&quot; ruled that Shylock had refused any payment other than his bond.In spite of all of this, the play is not unenjoyable, and is as well-written as one expects from Shakespeare, with some interesting plot twists and some good lines (ironically, some of the best being given to Shylock, making it clear that Shakespeare wasn't COMPLETELY unaware of the humanity of the character). The language is also somewhat less obscure to the modern reader than in some of Shakespeare's work, especially his comedies.Definitely worth reading, but be forewarned that the attitude toward Shylock (and to a lesser extent, toward his daughter) will be downright offensive to most in the modern audience."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"This play is one of the major works of anti semitism in history. This play made me very angry and hurt that Shakespeare thought this way about the jews. Shylock was a fully dimensional character but he was just a human representation of a bigoted idea. Shakespeare had never met a jew in his life because all the jews had already been expelled from England. The ending was sad and pathetic. Maybe I missed something in reading this."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"When I want to read Shakespeare, I want to read Shakespeare. Not a bunch of malarchy on Shakespeare's sources and stuff like that. I am facinated by the story and the characters; and couldn't give less of a damn about the analysis.

Try MacBeth or even Romeo and Juliet.... We seriously believe, even though it has been emphasized that Billy has mocked the place of women in society though they seem triumphant. We resent the fact the switching of the roles, which looks as if Billy were jesting them.

In our literature class we had to memorize a segment of the book. This part was during the time when Portia was to marry the merchant who found her photo in one of the three decorated chest. The first seeker opened the brightly decorated one think surely her photo would be in it only to find a note which started out, &quot;Oh hell, what have we here, a carion death in whose empty eyes there is a written scroll, I will read the writing........... I can still recite the whole thing to this day. That passage meant a lot to me and can be applied to everyday life. What Shakespeare was saying is for us not to judge a book by it's cover, walk into everything with an open mind. I am presently a master instructor at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy and use the segment to get across to the new police officers to enter into each crime scene with an open mind.

Mahood's treatment of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, is both scholarly and readable. A fine list of illustrations, the lastest textual analysis, a balanced portrayal of the attitudes toward the question of usury and the Jewish faith,and the definitive text of the play make this a book worth reading"},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"Shakespeare borders on anti-Semitism in this play. In nearly every scene, the Jewish Character is either reminded he is a dog, or that he is evil because of being a Jew and this extends to his daughter; Jessica, whom the stupid clown Lancelot considers to be cursed because of the fact that she is a Jewess.I think the racism in the play spoiled what would have been a funny and enjoyable read. I was trying to convince myself that Shakespeare was not trying to group all Jews together and that Shylock was just a greedy and unfeeling person who just happened to be Jewish. This is all very hard to do looking back from our time at all the atrocities committed against the Jews because of such racist propaganda (even the unknowingly racist).Another thing I have issue with is Portia's testing of her husband to see whether he is faithful, and the fact that she forged a document, plus she impersonated another person , lied about devoting her time to God etc... It lessens her status as a heroine and makes her out to be worse than Shylock in that she employed questionable techniques to free the Merchant of Venice; Antonio. The end never justifies the means.The only real hero in this play, to me was Antonio, although I think Shakespeare made his character to be less realistic with his lack of conflict and complete goodness, a trait that is hard to find in human beings.All these are my opinions and I think you have to read the play itself to determine whether it is racist. On the upside, the story is interesting and full of suspense (for something of its length) and very funny in parts. Check out Portia's description of her suitors for example. All in all, a good play but definitely not his best because of the racism and the lifeless Merchant of Venice."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Folger Library General Readers Shakespeare","review":"Honestly, I have read better Shakespeare plays.

Ms. Routman does not get bogged down with quoting today's &quot;educational standards&quot; in her book, because she does not write in order to please State Boards of Education (which I'm sure she accomplishes, anyway). This is the &quot;inviting&quot; thing about &quot;Invitations&quot;! She writes out of her love of learning, and even more, her love and belief in children, ALL children, as capable learners!As a novice myself, entering into the world of teaching, I have found Ms. Routman's book to be my bible, at my fingertips in the classroom and on my desktop when preparing lessons, research papers, and answering some of those tough questions like, &quot;Well, Johnny doesn't WANT to read! What can I do to motivate him into a love of learning?&quot; Ms. Routman answers this question and more.I'm not talking about an author who gives wonderfully idealistic examples of &quot;what to do&quot;, but an author who describes, through concrete examples, lessons, approaches, philisophy, and ideas as to HOW to set up your classroom and get your kids reading and writing. She also includes an abundance of resource information (in her &quot;Blue Pages&quot; section) as to where to seek out additional information. An entire section is outlined in detail on how to present &quot;fantasy&quot; writing for children. It's as if somebody took the time to do the work for you, yet she leads you to a place where you want to go beyond what she's done and create even more for yourself and for your students.I have used many ideas and suggestions from this book, from &quot;flip books&quot; to the tiny &quot;eight-page&quot; booklet (out of a single piece of paper, no less!) in order to encourage my students' writing in ways which are both fun and meaningful. Never have I been met with a grunt or groan in my classroom when using an &quot;enterprise&quot; from Ms. Routman's book.As for the &quot;veteran&quot; teacher, well...while I cannot claim to be one, I have seen (during my student teaching experience) teachers who are afraid (yes, afraid!) of making the leap from so-called &quot;tried and true&quot; ways of teaching to utilizing today's newer ideas in education. Routman addresses these issues in a non-condescending, respectful manner, and attempts to sort out ways of individualizing education, emphasizing cooperation in the classroom, and including ALL students in lessons no matter what their &quot;seeming&quot; ability is said to be, in order to bring each and every student to his or her fullest potential. This is not an easy task in today's classroom where the teacher lives and breathes under a microscope.Perhaps there are better books than this one out there...if there are, I haven't yet located one which includes the wealth of knowledge and insight that this one does.Call me an &quot;over-zealous novice&quot; if you must.

It is chock full of ideas that teachers can adopt and adapt for their classrooms, yes, but there is no sense of order to the book.What I like about Regie Routman's Invitations, is that it matches my own theories and ideas about reading, writing, grammar, spelling, etc. What I don't like is she only gives you a lot of theories and ideas, but no framework to do it in. She doesn't tell you how to build up a foundation, how to get where you want to go. I suppose she doesn't want to because she figures that is a very individual process.Other authors tell you what to do along each step of the way, and how to implement it. What is hard about Routman, is she doesn't give you a plan, a framework on which to build.Routman is also very verbose. She has so much to say about a given topic, that I got lost, and I lost a sense of the big picture. I wish there was an abridged version of Invitations. It is so verbose, that it is boring.I'm afraid that when someone opposed to Whole Language reads Invitations, they will see it as wishy-washy and loosey-goosey. Sadly, that's how it comes across even to a sympathetic reader. Why does she try to cover so much in one book? Why does she go on for so long on tangential topics? Why does she spend so much time quoting the excerpts from her letter-writing correspondence and interviews with teachers? It was a waste of my time.Frankly, the most inspring and helpful material I got from Invitations was on pages 12-23 (which isn't saying much for a 500-page book). She discusses her philosophy of education and what she believes. Personally, I found this to be the most useful and inspiring. Inspiring, because it was full of noble and worthy goals. Useful, because it reminded me of several important things to be aware of, such as focusing on the strengths of every child.I was assigned this book as required reading for a course in Reading & Writing Instruction in grad school. What I don't understand is why the instructor chose this book. It is poorly organized, poorly written, too long, and uninspiring. Because all the ideas are presented willy-nilly, there is little that a new teacher can take, grab hold of, and actualize.Even for an experienced teacher, I don't think this book would be very helpful. Perhaps there are some people who just like a lot of vague ideas, and then will make use of the ideas in their own way. I have met 1 or 2 teachers who are so confident and are such catalysts, that they probably work best that way. But for myself, my team-teacher, and most other teachers I have met, people want concrete steps and directions when they try something new. Perhaps there is a group of teachers who work from a \\"big picture\\" perspective and so this book would work well for them.What I couldn't stand about Routman was this: she would start the chapter regarding classroom management by talking about how behaviorism is old school and doesn't have a place in Whole Language. She says that rewards and punishments should not be present, except intangible rewards like use of the computer, etc. Then she goes on to say that praise is a vital tool to reinforce the behaviors you want to see children repeat. That's pure behaviorism."},{"Title":"Invitations: Changing as Teachers and Learners K12 with Updated, Expanded, and Revised Resources and Blue Pages","review":"I am a former teacher-turned-stay-at-home-mom and I find myself referring to my tattered book over and over again."},{"Title":"Poppies and mandragora: Poems","review":"Great collection of poems.

Her poems are more positive although they cover the same topics as Edgar's: escape, longing for freedom from suffering, and grief."},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"From the moment I began reading Allen Wier's TEHANO, I was struck by the sheer immensity of the research that went into this tale's telling. Wier is able to include historical, biblical and ethnographic scholarship that informs all levels of his narration, thus making for a rich reading experience, but none of this ever gets in the way, is never obtrusive.There is a strong and sure realism at work here, but not the hyper-realism of some such as Robbe-Grillet, for example, and Wier never loses his perspective with it, whether he is giving the reader an overview from a hawk's vantage point, or a close-upin miniature of two people in love, tribes in battle or any one of the many meetings, partings and diremptions which mark the fate of many characters in the book. Just as he handles the human condition with balance and insight and compassion, Wier also manages to keep the reader cognizant of larger forces at play, of the Civil War and slavery, of Westward expansion 'Manifest destiny' and, for many characters, an almost reflexive genocidal impulse.TEHANO is written with a respect for story telling and a reverence for the West and I think Allen Wier's achievement here, beyond the book's scope and ambition, is a seamless melding of history and literature sewn together with such skill it is hard to find a flaw in the skein. The end of the book, which does as one reviewer suggested, come so soon, is never telegraphed and involves some genuinely masterful and intricate choreography that gives the narrative the shape of a river flowing from headwaters to mouth, expanding here, constricting there, coming finally to that place where it can no longer contain all the creatures in its wake.There is great violence, great compassion and great humanity here, the work of a thoughtful writer who still believes in the virtues of strong-telling through strong narrative."},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"You need this book. As a reader and a bibliophile, I promise that you will not be disappointed.Before you even begin to read, the heft of the book assures you of many happy hours. It is a satisfying size that promises days spent in the past. The tintype photos on the front provide realism and ask to be decoded. The colors of the jacket and cover are of the Old west's worn saddles and Victorian wallpaper, and the creamy pages and font hearken back to cowboy times when people read the long evenings away.I taught myself to read when I was three and picked books thereafter for their size because I felt so bereft when my time with the characters was through. In seventh grade, I read all that Dickens had to offer and have searched since for that same feeling of being caught up with people and being surprised at every chapter with new connections and harrowing adventures for my favorites. This book took me back to those delicious afternoons when I had nothing to do but read and could stay with my new friends until the end, laughing, crying, and shaking with fright until they were safely home.Although the tale is epic, the big plot moves in ever smaller spirals as the characters meet each other. There is an intimacy and a believable quality to the intersection of these disparate lives. It would be tempting for an author, in the grand sweep of such a plot to focus on events rather than flesh out the characters, but these characters are drawn with satisfying detail. Each chapter is written with the finely honed care of a short story where economy of words is necessary, yet the reader will know the people well after the first introduction of each. The minor characters are a delight and often provide humor and respite from the more intense action. They are as carefully crafted as the major characters and certainly as memorable. You will be able to see and hear these people long after you put the book down.The intricacy of the plot is easily followed because of a character list with short descriptions, chapter headings and subheadings, and the connecting thread of Gideon the undertaker's journal. The theme of twin ship is threaded throughout as well as the idea of freedom, not just from slavery but from parental expectation, social convention, and personal demons from the past. The reader does not have to wait for the ending to view redemption. Small victories are sprinkled throughout. A particularly poignant chapter describes two escaped slaves, Knobby and Elizabeth, viewing the ocean for the first time. Never having left the plantation, they are baptized in the waves and healed by the salty water as they speak marriage vows to each other.The large cast of characters provides favorite moments for each type of reader. You will find romance, battle, action, history, mystery, family drama, faith, fables, domestic fiction, slave narrative, and travelogue. The sensual detail used for even the minor events provide a sumptuous feast. The author has used stunning imagery with a gritty, photographic quality. A reader may often have a reading experience where he can picture a character and perhaps even hear their voice through skillful point of view, but in this book, you can even smell the sweat of labor or the cheap perfume of the whorehouse, and you can taste the salty bite of oysters as Knobby and Elizabeth eat seafood for the first time or savor the sweet treats that Gideon the undertaker loves even more than beer.Without being preachy, the author takes the reader deep into the Native American culture to see that all peoples have more in common than we would like to admit. While the more violent aspects of Indian life are not sugarcoated, they are balanced with the powerful love that families have for one another and the impending sense of a way of life ending. The Indian perspective is balanced with that of the white settlers, and the reader sees that nobody was right in this conflict that led to senseless killing on both sides. A balanced portrayal of the rich and poor is also shown along with the struggle between con men and immigrants and believers and unbelievers. Characters on both sides of each issue are likeable and interesting. No stock villains are shown here.While many characters make choices that would cause the reader to wince and there is much cruelty as one would expect when reading about the Old West accurately depicted, there is a hope and tenderness here as well. There are sinners who keep their word and saints who stray. The only disappointment about this book is that it ends too soon.You have found the perfect summer read, but even at the first reading, Tehano is a book that you know you will be reading again and for years to come."},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"A wonderful read - an imagined world full of vividly realized characters, places, and stories. I say stories because there are four major story lines and several minor ones, all of which play out between Manhattan and Matamoros, Mexico in the latter part of the Civil War and the early postwar years. The characters include soldiers and ex-soldiers both Blue and Gray running from the war, native Americans under siege once the war no longer occupied the whites, slaves escaping their masters, and multitudes of Midwestern farmers, speculators, and freebooters of all kinds looking for a new start or a quick killing. This is multistranded historical fiction in the tradition of Annie Dillard, Larry McMurtry, and Charles Frazier: storytelling that pays close attention to landscapes and to the vernacular, everyday customs, and artifacts - in a word, the culture - of the people. The experience of reading TEHANO is like tuning a guitar, with the various story lines constituting the strings. When you put on new strings, you start out with a lot of slack, so you can wind the string several times around the tuning gear to make the string hold tight. As you twist the tuner and the wire pulls taut, you begin to hear a tone, a pitch, and the tighter you wind the wire, the clearer and more focused the tone. As you do this string after string, each one makes its own sound, but it's unclear for awhile how the individual sounds cohere. The last step is the final tuning, when you adjust the strings to each other, bringing each one into relationship with the others so that the ensemble creates a harmonious whole. The novel had that kind of effect on me, with the various \\"strings,\\" after having been slowly tightened during the first 600 pages, finally becoming aligned and tuned together in the last 100 or so pages. At the end, I felt I was indeed holding a finely tuned instrument."},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"Well, where to begin....there are some great story lines in this novel. However, the scope of the novel is just too ambitious to bring together for a satisfactory ending -- which is a mess. Throughout the course of the story, too many loose ends are left hanging, and too many questions are left unanswered. I highly suspect that Weir wrote the ending first then attempted to weave the characters' sagas together into one story after he knew how it would all end. When the story finally reaches its conclusion, the characters seem wooden whereas they were viable and dynamic early on. Either Weir bombed with the last 1/4 of the book because he didn't know what to do with this large cast of characters once they were assembled in the same setting, or he was trying for some existentialist tale about the casual violence of the wild west and the lack of interest in it from onlookers. Frankly, I no longer cared much about it either as I turned the final pages of the book.As a 6th generation Texan with more than a passing interest in history, I did find a couple of (minor)historical inaccuracies in the novel -- I won't reveal them here as I don't want to spoil the parts of the story that are really good, but they bothered me nontheless. In addition, Weir gets tangled up in some of his own details about characters and events; either he or his editor should have caught those mistakes.So, I feel the story just doesn't ring true at the end. This, coupled with too much meandering once the story really gets going, caused me to draw on sheer fortitude and will in order to read to the finish. The ending was entirely predictable --- from about halfway through the story. I really wanted to like this book as I love stories about the frontier. Oh well. The picture on the cover is outstanding!"},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"Tehano is a fascinating book that's difficult to describe in a brief review. It reflects both the early twenty-first century in which the author lives and the mid-nineteenth century that he describes.Tehano's graphic portrayals of sex and violence, its insistence that all cultures can justify their own brutalities on their own terms, and its refusal to draw easy, totalizing moral conclusions make it seem contemporary indeed. But its affection for individual characters, its delight in the storytelling impulse, and its combination of intricacy and accessibility remind me of much nineteenth-century fiction. It's a sprawling novel, with about twenty major characters and hundreds of minor ones. If you like to get lost in a book--to have the experience that you're no longer reading words and sentences, but that you're directly apprehending a world at least as real as the one that you inhabit on an everyday basis--then I think you'll spend an enjoyable week with Tehano.Major details about setting, plot, and characters are readily available, so I won't repeat them here. I'll just add that the book contains several \\"character transformations\\" that are surprisingly convincing: my favorites are the young, uncertain Dorsey Murphy who becomes the self-assured Blood Arrow, wife of Wahatewi; and the conniving, red-haired Orten Trainer who re-invents himself as the scalped, tongueless, authentically pious Preacher Orten."},{"Title":"Tehano: A Novel","review":"Once you declare a novel brilliant, you may as well stop.

Once you have gone this far, what you can possibly go on to say is something under every heading--character, narrative, meaning. All three are brilliant, masterful, unique. This above all, Wier's style is a singular achievement in our time [say, 100 years, since 1910]. His style, line by line, invokes a muttering \\"Wish I had written that line.\\" The neglect of this novel by critics stuns me, as Melville's few readers were stunned when MOBY DICK first appeared.

The first half of the 19th century is only dealt with briefly. If Time ever intended to publish a Great Ages volume about the years 1800-1850, it never got around to doing so. Still, as a popular history of 1851-1914, Age of Progress is quite entertaining; and its coverage of certain topics - the Great Exhibition, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Paris Commune, Art Nouveau - stands out."},{"Title":"Lover Within: Opening to Energy in Sexual Practice","review":"I read this book with a skeptical eye.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the subject is so alien to me, as I'm sure it will be for most people, that sometimes I had to read a paragraph or two over and over until the light went on in my brain to grasp it, so it took me a LOT longer to read than most other books. That being said, it is the most amazing read. Once I understood how to do the exercises, which sometimes can be a little frustrating since you are not used to this kind, it really delivers what the author promises. I went through a break up when I was half-way through this book, and I have NEVER been able to control, soothe, or handle my feelings on break-ups without a lot of crying and a short depression period, so I tried one of the exercises a few times and I could not BELIEVE the results.

It was written during WW2, but it is about a spy adventure the summer prior to the invasion of Poland. A husband and wife team get recruited to check out a spy chain that has become suspect. At first things seem to be going well, but then they get identified by the Nazis and must flee for their lives.Along the way they meet an American journalist and a British student, each of whom has their own reasons for wanting to strike a blow against the Nazis.Many of the elements used in the story are typical of MacInnes's later, more polished, work. However, the story is more of an action-thriller than the romantic character-based thriller novels that MacInnes eventually became so good at writing."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"Above Suspicion is the first thriller by Helen MacInnes, an author largely forgotten about now, but once a very established and successful writer. She married Gilbert Highet, a Classics scholar, in 1932 and translated German literature with him. Like the characters in this novel, both her and her husband spoke fluent German and spent their summers travelling in Europe. Gilbert Highet also served as an MI6 British intelligence agent and his wife's novels were so realistic that her third book, \\"Assignment in Brittany\\" was required reading for Allied intelligence agents about to be sent to work with the French Resistance. As you can tell, you are in safe hands for a realistic novel about Europe in 1939, which is where Above Suspicion is set.Frances Myles lives with her Professor husband Richard in Oxford. The married couple enjoy climbing and travelling in Europe, as MacInnes did herself. It is 1939 and Europe is poised on the brink of war. Frances and Richard are hoping for one last summer of peace, but it is not to be. When Frances goes to collect Richard from his rooms for a party, she finds an old friend visiting and he wants them to do a job. He is hoping they will go abroad that summer as usual, meet a man in Paris and then continue the journey as he directs them to obtain information the authorities need badly. An agent who has been running an underground railway in Germany has stopped sending the normal messages and they are afraid he has been captured or compromised and they are hoping that \\"a couple of innocents abroad might be able to get through all suspicion.\\"Richard is happy to go, but does not want Frances involved. Frances is, however, absolutely not going to be left and, as things should continue as normal, she gets her way. What follows is a chase across Europe, with the couple under scrutiny from the moment they leave England. Europe has changed - now men march everywhere, there is violence in the air, their rooms are searched and they are followed. While in France a woman states, \\"one war is enough for one lifetime,\\" but war is coming and both Frances and Richard know it is unavoidable. While in Europe they meet up with Robert Thorney, who they know from Oxford, and Henry Van Cortlandt, an American journalist. \\"You're not the kind of people to handle trouble; you're not tough enough,\\" Van Cortlandt tells Frances, but this is the story of normal people being called upon to do extraordinary things.This really is a superb story - with excitement, seriously unpleasant bad guys and a real undercurrent of fear. With hindsight it is easy to say that everyone knew what would happen. In 1941 it was not sure at all which way the war would go and so, in many ways, MacInnes is writing some stirring propaganda here. During the novel, Frances attempts to explain to their new American friend why war cannot be avoided and gives a plea for friendship and involvement to the country she was later to spend the rest of her life in. Frances is an excellent heroine - headstrong, opinionated and always very brave, she believes in what she is doing. Above Suspicion was made into a film in 1943, with Joan Crawford, and it is wonderful to see her books appearing on kindle."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"Published in 1941 and set in 1939, Above Suspicion, through its two main characters--a British husband and wife who are recruited to undertake an intelligence gathering mission in Germany--presents a nice mix of action, intrigue, atmosphere, and political discussion. The husband and wife are joined by a fellow countryman and an American as they try to carry out their mission while evading Nazi pursuers. The sense of foreboding as the characters move through Nazi-controlled areas is palpable.Most of the political commentary is spoken by the wife, who has an understandably bleak view of Nazi Germany and an unfortunate view of its people (invariably gruff, tasteless, and poor tippers) while regarding the British as unfailingly friendly, charming, and civilized. She also presents a rather sympathetic view of Britain's evolving response to Hitler's aggression. In retrospect, the political views come across as simplistic and the characterizations as stereotyped, but politics never gets in the way of the story, which builds suspense in the manner of a Hitchcock movie. It is, in fact, rather nice to read a novel from that era in which the key female figure has political opinions of her own, refuses to back down to opinions offered by men, and plays a vital role in the action (she comments, in fact, on the ability of women to exercise their minds while retaining their charm).Ultimately, Above Suspicion is a perfectly paced thriller that (again, like a Hitchcock movie) places likable, ordinary people in a dangerous situation and follows them as they use their wits and resourcefulness to prevail against their enemy."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"This is one of the most outstanding espionage novels ever written. Small wonder it was a best seller in 1942. Helen MacInnes was unrivaled in her ability to put fictional characters and a exciting plot into current world events and political tensions, all woven into actual geographical backgrounds. Richard and Frances Myles are so life-like that you feel like you are there with them throughout their harrowing experiences in pre-war Europe. All of her novels were written in this fashion, but this is one of her best. I first read it in high school, and recently I pulled it out and read it again. And it was as exciting and entertaining as it was all those years ago. A great way to spend a quiet evening."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"I absolutely LOVE Helen Macinnes!

They are wonderful stories, well written."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"I'm inclined to describe this as a vintage thriller, very much a blast from the past. On the eve of the second world war, an English couple, Frances and Richard Myles are asked to travel to Europe. Their mission is to retrieve information about a fellow Englishman who is running a spy network. There is a question as to whether the organisation has perhaps been compromised. It becomes a cloak and dagger operation. Frances and Richard are amateurs but are obliged to pit their wits against some very unpleasant individuals.I thought that this was a nicely atmospheric thriller. The tension mounted chapter by chapter. All of the characters were well fleshed out. Frances and Richard were a well matched couple.It felt claustrophobic in places as Frances and Myles travel from one roundevouz to another, each more fraught with difficulty. The rising tension in Europe with the rise of the Nazi was well portrayed, and the air of unease and uncertainty added to the tension and fear that is now known of that time in history.It's not a violent book as a lot of thrillers are. This one relies on atmosphere to set the stage and to to supply the mounting tension.It's been years since I've read this author and I'm very glad to have this available to kindle. Time and money well spent."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"This is set just before WW2, and it starts in England with a young couple being recruited for a spy mission into the heart of Germany.

Historically accurate."},{"Title":"Above suspicion,","review":"It was so nice to see this book & others now available on Kindle. Helen Macinnes always has a good, solid plot & engaging characters.

This Helen MacInnis early WWII suspense novel was an exciting page turner but not as good as her other WWII novel set in Britany, France. Some readers higly recommend this novel. An author who has published a best books list stated that she reads this novel every five years. Once is enough for me, but I can understand why one can feel that way. It is a delightful book because of its form and style and it just flows very well. Its two main chatacters, Richard and Frances Myles, are two fun loving, young and witty people. Richard teaches at Oxford and they seem to be having a great life there. They love to travel and have lots of travel experience and so they are recruited to find some lost British spies in Europe about three months before WWII starts. They get into some tight spots but always manage to survive. Most of the evil things committed during WWII were not known until after the war.

An Oxford don and his wife are recruited to do some spying while on their summer holidays in 1939. They are \\"above suspicion\\" because they have gone to that area of the Alps for years. Unfortunately, having a wide social circle can sometimes be a liability as they discover. The novel was exciting without being sensational. The plot is plausible with some delightful ironies. The husband and wife, a cultured, intelligent couple, complement each other very well. I think the book is semi-autobiographical since the author was married to someone in British intelligence. There is some violence, but it's not gratuitous, but deadly serious. I look forward to reading many more novels by Helen MacInnes.

Ramsey's lifelong guilt about surviving the trip is amplified by the fact that he slept with Belle Leeming, the wife of the leader of the expedition; his memories are haunted by the details of Stephen Leeming's death; and his equilibrium is unsettled by the news that Leeming's body has been discovered in the glacial ice. Although Ramsey acts like a man with a dark secret, it's unclear how much of his recollection is a result of post-traumatic stress and how much really happened.Nearing the end of his life, Ramsey is haunted by his past and afraid of having his memories challenged; he fears \\"a change in the essence of his life, a change as absolute as death.\\" He has lived with his nightmares for so long that he doesn't want them minimized or publicized by the grotesque charade that will inevitably result when the body is exhumed. Nevertheless, by the end of the book, as Leeming's experience is subjected to increased scrutiny, the reader (as one of the minor characters puts it) is not quite sure \\"what it was all about.\\"But Leeming's plight is only half the story; the other half is an extremely witty parade of academic caricatures (auguring the works of David Lodge) that lightens the seriousness of Ramsey's burden. Combined with Ramsey's self-mocking reflections, the tone of the book is both poignant and cynical without ever being depressing.Given the success of Keneally's \\"Schindler's Ark\\" (the basis for \\"Schindler's List\\"), as well as his numerous literary awards, it's baffling and sad that this thought-provoking and pleasing book is out of print."},{"Title":"Textbook of Advanced Cardiac Life Support","review":"This text is a must for ACLS.

I don't know if I have 10 or 20 years left of activity, or time to change my external options. But Angeles also encourages the reader to consider inward change, picking up old ideas and running with them. Or, perhaps, to drop the mask and go through new gates, embracing aging as a time for calming down. Too often we think of goal setting as a call to wild and crazy. I'm reconsidering, and believe it might be to embrace contemplative but just as crazy options.I give this as a gift for 2nd marriages, 50/60+ birthday gifts, and people facing the changes brought by grief, loss, and retirement.

Jung said you only get faith to doubt. I don't simply believe the author is great and believable because she's a well read anthropologist and that I am wiser for reading her; that would be too easy and comfortable. I ask myself am I getting wiser and notice whether or not.I got a new perspective on faith (in old age) respecting my mother's incomprehensible so called resolution process stage toward death even though I didn't understand it and suspected she had lost her mind and was a vegetable. Dying properly will be important to me though I don't think I'll understand my own sense at the time any more than I do at the beginning of a physics problem.When a bunch of old people get together to talk about wisdom I worry they won't respect the wisdom process of youth and project their insecurities of losing their minds on youth.Meade had old men empower youth to think for themselves with open ended stories. I try to to read this book as an open ended story that makes me think and doesn't substitute inspiration for me thinking and doubting.I am very interested in discovering sexuality and romance untied to family in old age. I've missed having children and fear it would be unkind to have a child at my age. But, I have my own needs to have my inscrutable resolution process validated whether it be in dying or early confusions in research.It is a relief to read this book rather than risk finding or not finding my meaning of life in my research.It is a break from my very personal deep questions. Perhaps everyone's lives have extremely personal meanings that can't be turned into a science with such a book, but I must honor the fluff of a process and validate the author for trying so she'll get to a safer more productive place as I did my mother.Perhaps old folks need to validate each other as having grown peculiar and see where that peculiarity goes with reverent curiosity rather than control it away.Fear of abandonment in old age had my mother try to make me fear myself inadequate so I would need her. She could not let me go enough. I have unfounded insecurities I am overcoming.This sort of negativity can be projected as a so called electrode through generations. One gets infantile life scripts because one needs the protection of the critical parent ego state. This wound prevents us from writing our own story.One day I must read Arthur Franks in \\"The Wounded Storyteller\\"!The old must struggle for faith that we can actually attain wisdom and kindly impart it to help whole communities find freedom to find who they truly are rather than fear to be able to contrive other's approval and perhaps negative fear manipulation to merely achieve its appearance.I haven't finished this book yet. Perhaps ,when I get more read, the author will feel safe with me and share the vital wisdom of her process. Perhaps my mother also trusted me when she consciously said \\"I don't know what is wrong with my mind\\" and I kindly said \\"You are just very old and not making neural nets.\\" in a sense, she was affirming my wisdom and that I still had my mind as I affirmed I loved her though she had lost hers.So this book can be good and true if approached by a person trying to be good and true. My church is using this in a wisdom circle powwow group. I wonder what this group will become with this book.

What else could one ask for?"},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"There is nothing new in Angeles Arrien's book about the second half of life. Indeed, there isn't meant to be. Our lives at midpoint are about putting aside newness and embracing the ancient, the everlasting, the always true.We live in an age that worships youth. Alongside this naive, if not indeed tragic pursuit to resist aging in all its aspects, we find ourselves as a society becoming ever more superficial, ever more devoted to what is external only, short on endurance, shallow in meaning. Small wonder so many of us approach midlife in a state of \\"crisis.\\"Yet there is no crisis. Arrien reminds us, by assembling in this collection of eight chapters named for eight gates, that this is not a time in our lives to resist or fear, but that it is, in fact, a time of wonder and beauty -- of the deeper and more meaningful kind. To pass through each of these \\"gates\\" is to be opened and enriched by the enlightenment of the second half of our lives. In each chapter, Arrien has brought together age-old quotes and wisdom from many different cultures, tested by time and place. Each chapter describes the gate through which we must pass, the task we must undertake to do so, the challenge, the gift we receive if we meet the challenge, reflections that help us to understand more fully this threshold, a list of practices to make this gateway a discipline.The gates: silver (facing the new and the unknown); white picket (discovering one's true face); clay (intimacy, sensuality, sexuality); black and white (relationships and the crucible of love); rustic (creativity and service); bone (authenticity, character, and wisdom); natural (happiness, satisfaction, and peace); gold (letting go).Each chapter guides us, gently yet firmly, toward facing what is around us as well as what is in us. The overall effect is soothing, I find, to the degree that it has helped me, approaching my own midpoint in life, see the aging process for the beauty and freedom it brings. It is a time to free oneself of the cumbersome masks one has worn in a more naive youth, to embrace wisdom and meaning rather than that which passes quickly and leaving no lasting mark. It is a time to gather all that we have learned in the first half of our lives and bring it all to fruition, entering a time of unbounded creativity, love based on truth rather than illusion, and finding a peace that will make crossing that final gold gate a time of celebration for a life well lived.If we have lost respect for aging in our society, it is time we take it back. Arrien reminds us, by bringing back the wisdom of the ages, that age in ourselves is something to be welcomed rather than resisted. To resist it is to rob ourselves of what may well be the best time of our lives."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"What a surprise this beautiful book was for me. Because I have and will continue to listen to Dr. Arrien's taped set on The Second Half of Life many times, I had not thought to buy the book. It came as a gift, whatta gift! The surprise is how the content compliments the tapes. No mere regurgitation of previous material, it is chock full of imagery and archetypal information that meets my mind in what it knows and gently points in the direction of making me and my life bigger----indeed, wiser. Like Dr. Arrien's The Four Fold Way this is a book to be read slowly and savored again and again. From my experience with her materials, I know this new jewel, The Second Half of Life, is a deep well from which to drink and will keep my elder years a time a growth and expansion. I recommend it without reservation---it has gone to the top of my list of books I will be gifting my friends with!"},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"I have been listening to many of these Sounds True and similar audiocassettes recently, looking for good meditation material. Fortunately, since the exploration is pretty hit-or-miss for me, the Seattle library has a lot of them (including this one), so I am able to preview them. For my taste, The Second Half of Life is better in its intention than its execution. Overall, for my money, a more successful work (also available both at Amazon and the Seattle library) is A Woman's Spiritual Retreat: Teaching, Meditations, and Rituals to Celebrate Your Authentic Feminine Wisdom, by Joan Borysenko. Although it focuses primarily on women's wisdom and growth, as opposed to second-half-of-life wisdom and growth, it hits a lot of the same notes and also draws on myth and ritual. (Another, much shorter work in a similar vein that I also found more successful is the meditation CD, Celtic Spirit Meditations, by Mara Freeman--also available at Amazon and reviewed by me here.)Certainly, the intention of The Second Half of Life is to help people do some positive growth in their later years, drawing on wisdom of many cultures, and as the positive reviews attest, it does accomplish this very well for some people. However, for me, Ms. Arrien picks some good myths, tales and themes for her foundation, but then doesn't do enough substantive and rigorous work with them. The basic pattern (except for the Preferential Shapes exercise, see below) is to tell a tale or introduce a character or concept, give her interpretation (which often seems either too simplistic and schematic or too arbitrary, as other reviewers have noted), and then to say, \\"So where am I with __________ in my life?\\" [Fill in the blank with the theme or symbol just discussed.] The psychologizing offered, although constructive, seems--well, mostly self-evident. To someone who grew up loving much of the original source material in its pure, story form, some of the interpretations actually diminish the stories' inherent symbolic meaning.I did find both the description and the interpretation of the Nine Muses pretty good, and was pleased to come across a theme I'd been looking for but hadn't found elsewhere (except in Layne Redmond's wonderful music CD Invoking the Muse, also available on Amazon). The Pandora's Box story has an interesting comparison of this myth in different cultures (including what was left in the bottom of the box, according to the different cultures). The Preferential Shapes section gives you something specific to do, an exercise with your preferences for five universal shapes. I found this exercise to provide some helpful insights, albeit in a fortune-telling kind of way. The 12 Labors of Hercules got a retelling that was somehow both cursory and redundant, and the interpretations here felt especially arbitrary and forced to me. Like another reviewer, I found the Eight Gates rather suspect in how Ms. Arrien drew together elements supposedly from many sources to arrive at this particular interpretation (and I also could have done without the gnomes!), although there is some good material about initiation and transition here. Overall, there seems to be a lot of focus on schematic, numbered, arbitrary hierarchies.I also found the material overall to be too repetitive and slow-moving, and like another reviewer with the same problem, was irked by the verbal delivery (the uneven rhythm, the tone, and a tendency to do repetitions of phrases that did not feel naturally emphatic and became quite irritating). It would be nice if Amazon would provide not only the Search Inside This Book function for books on tape (sadly missing here), so that people can get an idea of the specific content and tone, but also audioclips for books on tape, as they do for music CDs. These audiocassettes are often quite pricey, and long, and one's personal reaction to the voice of the narrator is pretty important. The Sounds True website does have audio samples for many of their authors' items, including this one."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"If you're looking for a way to effectively cope with challenges to your health and body as you age, you can add this book to the list, The author takes us through looking at our secret longings and how they shape us.

I'll start general and get more specific.First of all, the reading (and writing style) is of the worst kind of condescending pedantry. Arrien reads like she's a bored, old-style Catholic school nun lecturing a 3rd grader for being unchaste, yet coming off as self-consciously new-age at the same time. And there are fingernail-chalkboard constructions in the writing that will grate on you after five minutes. It's that horrible lecture/sermon style of paralellisms wherein the writer, in an effort to reinforce a point, starts each statement the same way and ends it differently. I'll give you an example to illustrate, I'll give you an example to explicate, I'll give you an example to show how bad this thing is, I'll give you an example to start making you frantic, I'll give you an example to cause you to drive your car into a bridge piling just to shut her up. This one construction occupies what seems to be at least 10% of the content of this thing. And she delivers each one exactly parallel, in the same tired, dogmatic lecturing style all the way through each disc. It's really irritating after about 10 minutes.Second, and a bigger deal, Arrien claims to be an anthropologist. Her whole premise in this work, \\"the eight gates\\", is based on what she wants us to believe is a body of universal wisdom known by (all?) primitive peoples that, once understood, will open the door to enlightenment for humble westerners like you and me. Basically, it's the notion of \\"the noble savage\\", a very romantic and false construct that has never held up under any scrutiny (I accept that some indigenous societies have ways of looking at the world that make more sense to me than others). But no actual anthropologist worth paying any attention to would ever say things like \\"indigenous peoples believe\\", without naming anyone in particular and then go on to make some sweeping generalization that has no foundation in fact (none of what she says would make any sense at all to any indigenous society known to me). Her illustrations are total nonsense. I am married to an anthropologist for 22 years and know dozens of them and frequently discuss these issues. These notions are pure drivel of the \\"native peoples are necessarily pure, being unencumbered by the corruption of our decadent society, and therefore somehow infinitely wise\\" variety and, worse, just plain fabrications. It's ridiculous and laughable and an offense to anthropology, or any social science, for that matter. She should be ashamed of herself for pretending to be something she is not (I don't care if she claims to be trained in the discipline; her words speak otherwise).The only reason that I'm giving this two stars is that she's obviously well-intended and wants to be helpful (I'm assuming). Otherwise it would get one. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"Ms. Arrien's book is Ground Breaking.

Although the message of some books comes through more clearly and personally when narrated by the author, this is not one of them. I found Arrien's intonation and inflection to be conducive to boredom and even sleepiness rather than enlightening or even interesting.If it were only the narration that I found lacking, I would hesitate to write a negative review. However, the book itself lacks clarity and fails to do justice to its title. I had expected something more pertinent and on target to the meaning and living of the second half of life. Arrien wanders around and through many stories, anecdotes, and truisms with which I was familiar. But some of them are given a strange, inaccurate twist in her telling. One example is that of the Brooklyn Bridge. The author claims that it is known to New Yorkers as \\"the miracle bridge.\\" While the story of its construction involves a series of events that could be labelled by some as miraculous, her claim of its local common name as \\"the miracle bridge\\" is not factual. She goes on to state that John Roebling and his son Washington were killed and injured, respectively, in the same accident. Not true. She writes that Washington Roebling was unable to speak and was paralyzed and that he tapped out instructions to his wife, who carried them to workers on the bridge site. A highly fabulous story and simply not true. In fact, Roebling was partially paralyzed but was able to view the construction site from his bedroom, using a telescope, and he did give his wife instructions, but was able to use his voice and his hands. Arrien's telling of this story put into question for me everything else she shared in the book.I'm going to donate my copy of the audiobook to my local public library, as I know that Angeles Arrien is popular with some people. I hope they find some benefit from listening to The Second Half of Life. I would encourage anyone considering a purchase of it to first borrow a copy from the library.

I have enjoyed and learned from all her books: The Four-Fold Way: Walking the Paths of the Warrior, Teacher, Healer, and Visionary; Signs of Life: The Five Universal Shapes and How to Use Them; The Nine Muses: A Mythical Path to Creativity; and The Tarot Handbook. They have inspired my writing and the writing I do in community with others. Arrien is a consultant to many organizations and businesses, serves as president of the Foundation for Cross-Cultural Education and Research, and is a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences.In her latest book, The Second Half of Life, Arrien invites readers to reconnect and resurrect their dreams that may have been derailed along the way. She describes the thresholds we must cross, in our middle years, in order to fulfil the final stages of our destiny. It is a real honouring of our elder years, which I very much appreciate in a culture that wants us to look and act as if we are not aging at all.The book was elegantly designed by Bren Frisch and Karen Polaski for Sounds True. The hand images at the beginning of chapters and the foot images at the end of chapters are symbols of entering and leaving the eight gates. They also symbolize much more, including the purifying or marking of hands and feet before or after an initiation, as is done in many cultures of the world.The eight gates, each with a chapter devoted to it, include \\"the task,\\" \\"the challenge,\\" and \\"the gift\\" followed by \\"reflections.\\" As Arrien points out, \\"Reflection is one of numerous contemplative wisdom practices found in all world traditions.\\" Journaling your insights is suggested as \\"an old reflective practice\\" and one that will help you notice \\"what is arising in the moment.\\" \\"Practice\\" follows \\"reflections\\" as a way to build upon reflection by taking daily action that supports change. For instance, the Silver Gate (the first of the eight gates) compels you to look back at what you already know of yourself and to begin the \\"long journey back home to our true selves.\\" The practice is to track the five stages of the soul--the call, the search, the struggle, the breakthrough and the return.The task at the White Picket Fence is to \\"uncover or awaken to the essence of who we truly are beyond masks...\\" The Clay Gate (the third gate) is \\"our initiation into intimacy, sensuality, and sexuality.\\" Arrien quotes a wide array of poets, writers and thinkers, including Eduardo Galeano who wrote, \\"The body says: I am a fiesta.\\" When you think of your body in that way, it helps to embrace it more fully.The Black and White Gate is a double gate of relationships and the only one you must go through in the company of at least one other person. Relationships (including those between mates and lovers, parents and children, teachers and students), according to the author, \\"teach us about our capacity for love, forgiveness, and respect for others.\\"At the Rustic Gate of weathered wood, readers are asked to explore meaningful work, service, and creativity. The challenge of this gate is to stay connected to the Four Rivers of Life and ask, \\"How will we use our generative energies?\\"The sixth gate is the Bone Gate, which brings us to the \\"bones of who we are\\"--a metaphor for our authentic self. The Bone Gate urges a development of character, integrity, and wisdom. Again, Arrien passes on the wisdom of indigenous peoples who say \\"In order to return to our true nature, we must befriend four essential symbolic bones in our body\\"--the backbone, the wishbone, the funny bone and the hollow little bone. The hollow little bone allows \\"the Mystery to work us rather than trying to work the Mystery.\\"The seventh gate is the Natural Gate, where \\"we are encouraged to come home to our natural rhythm and our internal sanctuary.\\" Many spiritual traditions recognize four natural sanctuaries as the desert, the mountains, the waters, and the woods. In the Practice section of the chapter, Arrien suggests spending an hour outdoors every day and spending at least a half hour every day in silence \\"to deeply listen to the center of your being.\\"The final gate in the initiatory process of the \\"second half of life\\" is the Gold Gate, the gate of \\"surrender, faith and acceptance.\\" The challenge is to release critical judgments, accepting circumstances rather than resigning ourselves to them. Theologian Mary Reuter, to whom Arrien refers, \\"says that we can experience fearlessness through three layers of detachment: detachment from material gain; detachment from self-importance; and detachment from the urge to control or dominate others. To hold onto nothing is the root of happiness and peace.\\" In the practice section of this chapter, Arrien suggests creating a Book of Revelations, including favorite memories, turning points, spiritual practices and important dreams. It sounds like a worthwhile way to assess what one truly values and to acknowledge longings that have not yet been satisfied.The Second Half of Life is very rich in resources throughout the book and in the extensive bibliography. That doesn't mean it's at all overwhelming. I found the book a very gentle way to initiate oneself into the fullness of our elder years.

In this way, each of us has the capacity to \\"restore, renew, and heal ourselves\\" and to leave a legacy to future generations.Arrien introduces the reader to the story of the \\"8 Gates,\\" metaphorical rites of passage where we confront our demons and our angels. She encourages journaling and contemplation at each gate, as well as daily action to practice those areas that are most difficult for each one of us to attain.She has organized her book around the 8 gates of wisdom she believes each ofus must open and traverse to reach our potential. In each chapter, she gently guides us to the Task, the Challenges we face, the Gift we recieve once we pass through this gate, what we might Reflect upon and how we can put this into Practice now.Other reviewers have described the \\"Gates\\" well, so I won't do that here. The Second Half of Life is both contemplative and practical. Arrien's work is gives inspiration to people in mid-life to encounter their next decades with anticipation and joy."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"If you have been reading books about spiritual life and transitions for some time, you will probably find that when you read this book that you have heard this all before. Arrien quotes the usual source materials from the bible to Native American sources. Although Arrien says the eight gates she talks about come from \\"world tales\\" and \\"perennial wisdoms\\" I felt she made them up in a kind of arbitrary way. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I could do without the little gnomes making comments at some of the thresholds and gates. The book's physical presentation is quite nice, with an attached satin bookmark and excellent photographs. There are questions and assignments at the end of each section for further contemplation. Perhaps because this book was pieced together from a Sounds True tape series it does not have the depth and continuity I would have hoped for."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"I have been a reader of Ms. Arrien's work since my first reading of \\"The Fourfold Way\\". As her other works have been, \\"Opening the Eight Gates of Wisdom\\" was the perfect book at the perfect time of my life. It is full of reassurance that I am in a healthy place of consciousness and answers questions that I have been asking of my life. Thank you, Angeles, for another great work!"},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"Each of us-male and female-could benefit from the thought provoking literary journey through the \\"opening the eight gates of wisdom\\" as set in Angeles Arrien's book The Second Half of Life. The book is a glorious examination of wisdom; cultural wisdom traditions and personal examinations. The imagery, poetry and symbols feel universal. Just as she speaks in person, Angeles is an authentic voice in matters of the human experience."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"This is an amazing book. It touched me to my spiritual core. Mid-life seems to be a time of change and contemplation. One needs to take time for a review of the past and to ponder where you want to go/be for the next phase of life. I read this book with a small group of women. We took a chapter a month, worked on the questions at the end of each chapter, and had very interesting, introspective and supportive discussion. Angeles Arrien is an amazing scholar and interpreter. This book caused many \\"a-ha\\" moments. Beautiful words, beautiful images, beautiful wisdom."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"The Second Half of Life: Opening the Eight Gates of WisdomI love this book so much I bought a copy of it for my 93 year old mother for Christmas."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE SECOND HALF OF LIFE as an enlightening & forthright guide to spiritual maturity.Even though most of us are living longer than our parents & grandparents, & can look forward to decades of \\"retirement\\" -- what are we going to \\"do\\" with all that time? Now that we've been put out to pasture, are we simply \\"supposed\\" to decay into old age -- or is there something else?Dr. Angeles Arrien, working with images, poetry, metaphors & other forms of symbolic language from all over the world, introduces us to the Eight Gates of Initiation so that by mastering their lessons & gifts, we may harvest the meaning & purpose of our life & our dreams while readying for spiritual maturity.Having reached THE SECOND HALF OF LIFE (which at several times seemed unlikely) I found the treasures within, while not \\"new\\", are eloquently & elegantly restorative, illuminating & healing.A kind & meditative gift for those you love who are wondering what to do with the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Second Half of Life, the","review":"Thia book is changing my life. Just sent the 3rd book to friendsafter buying one for me. Highly recommend this book and thisauthor, Angeles Arrien."},{"Title":"The Marriage Truce (Mills & Boon Historical)","review":"Or possibly three and a half. Contains a despicable villain, a grey cat called Merlin, and lots of people giving well-meant advice.From the back of the book:Relations between the Chandlers and the St Clairs were not good, considering Nicholas Chandler had eloped with the wife of Devin St Clair, the Marquis of Huntington. Now the two families had to meet, for Dev's sister Jessica was to marry Adam Chandler Dev had no idea when he attended the betrothal party that he would end up engaged to Nicholas's sister, Sarah, all because he had come to her rescue when she got into difficulties!

On one particular night our villain attacks Sarah outside and Dev comes to her rescue. Unfortunately people think he attacked her and so they end up getting married.In the beginning it is in name only and things progress from there. I liked both the H and h, hated the villain and loved the cat!"},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"I like this book as there are many illustrations and after reading the book I had a deeper understanding of buttons. This is an informative book and I would encourage those who are interested in collecting buttons and those advance collecters to read it. Another book similiar to it and I would reccommend is Antique &amp; Collectible Buttons : Identification and Values."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"It would have been great if the photos were in color, this is something that makes looking and finding the buttons so much easier. Having color photos adds a lot."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"Compiled and written by Sally C. Luscomb (the co-publisher of &quot;Just Buttons&quot; magazine for a 35-year run), The Collector's Encyclopedia Of Buttons is now in a fully updated and significantly expanded reference which presents more than 3,000 collectible and classic buttons from across all time periods, materials, and manufacturers. The Collector's Encyclopedia Of Buttons features entries that cover everything from abalone buttons, to work-clothes buttons, and zodiac buttons. Straightforward, highly accessible writing and enhanced black-and-white photographs, The Collector's Encyclopedia Of Buttons is a one-of-a-kind resource for professional dealers and dedicated collectors."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"This is the very best reference book available under $200. This updated issue is beautiful, includes price estimates of buttons featured, and is the reference book every Button Collector owns. (The only other MUST own button book is Big Book of Buttons, $200, IF you can find one at all.) My button club uses it for many of our meeting programs. \\"Most Excellent\\" book! Janice in Niwot"},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"Although this book is considered \\"the Bible\\" on button collecting books, I was somewhat disappointed in it. There were very few color pictures, and the black and white photos were small. Somewhat cut and dry in text, but I've discovered that such books are hard to find, and this was the most extensive one I came across."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"This book is nice to look for pictures and information if you are interested in buttons . I am very happy with my purchase of the book. I would recomend it for a reference book on buttons."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"I found this book very informative and I learned a lot about buttons. I would have liked the pictures to be in color which would help me identify them. It will become my reference book."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"Very good descriptions and pictures; easy to understand. I am a button collector and got this copy for my granddaughter whom I'm trying to &#34;turn-on&#34; to button collecting."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"One of the standard resources for collectors. I found one or two errors (for instance, it claims that horsehair buttons were only used on upholstery, when they were in fact used on clothing in the early 18th century). Alphabetic arrangement makes it easy to locate information."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"Very unhappy with this book. Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification. It has a lot of information and very small print. Seriously considering returning it."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"I was quite disappointed in the photos of this book...many of the details are missing. Wish they would have put a bit more effort into the reason one would buy this book."},{"Title":"The Collector's Encyclopedia of Buttons","review":"This is a terrific book with in depth info on a wide variety of buttons. The reference bible for any button diva!"},{"Title":"St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper","review":"This is war literature at it's best! The author - who served as a colonial paratrooper - gives an excellent account of his experiences in the French-Algerian War. He covers a lot of different aspects in an excellent writing style. The book provides a good insight in the long conflict, the French Army, the Algerian terrorists and the European and Algerian society in the country."},{"Title":"St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper","review":"If you have an interest in the French Algerian War this is one of the finest memoirs written on the subject. The book was written by a French Paratrooper who fought in Algerian. He was a citizen soldier not a long term professional career soldier. It provides an extreamly interesting view of the war from the point of view of an average French citizen called up to serve his country. This was one of the most brutal wars ever fought and strange as it seems it provides insites into the two wars we are waging in Iraq and Afganistan........"},{"Title":"St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper","review":"This book; \\"St Michael and the Dragon: A Paratrooper in the Algerian War\\" by Pierre Leulliette offers the reader a first-hand account of the fighting in Algeria during the FLN nationalist uprising in the 1950's and later, the French involvement in the Suez Crisis of 1956.The author served with distinction, as a young French paratrooper, in the 8th B.P.C. (Bataillon des Parachutistes Coloniaux: Colonial Parachute Battalion). Pierre Leulliette left the Army after three years of service and returned to France, but came away troubled by what he saw and what was done during his time in the military.This book is one of very few accounts in English to cover this conflict and is well worth the time tracking down a copy. Apparently this book was banned when first published (1961) due to the details of Algerian prisoners being tortured by the French military."},{"Title":"St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper","review":"Lieulliette felt no compulsion to refrain from relating his experiences and his emotions exactly as they occurred. The book provides an alternative angle to the French episode in the Algerian War and Suez Crisis, a humanist angle which is typically missing from the tomes typically available to English speakers who wish to learn more about the conflicts. I'd consider the book a good read even for someone with no further interest in the topic, although one must keep in mind the seeming hopelessness about the War during the period in which he served, and how radically things changed not long after his departure from the scene."},{"Title":"St. Michael and the dragon;: Memoirs of a paratrooper","review":"Torture and HonorThis book is a memoir of a French Para serving in Algeria, 1954-1957, with extensive details on tribal aspects and dynamics of dealing with an insurgency. As well the book has extensive information on the Para's use of torture and draconian methods of interrogation. Later due to this aspect of the book it was banned in France at the time of printing. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."},{"Title":"Transitions: The Art of Todd Lockwood","review":"Transitions is simply incredible. Page after page of stunning fine-art paintings featuring some risque but quite discreet costumes. Wonderful portrayals of the human condition under inhuman conditions! Fantastic creatures in analytic detail brought to you by a master illustrator - the Art Director behind Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition.There's decades of painting skill on display here. Well worth the cost and certain to be a sought-after collectible. Mine is remarked with a personal note - also available via the artist's website: http://www.toddlockwood.com"},{"Title":"Transitions: The Art of Todd Lockwood","review":"Wow, I just loved this book. I keep refering back to it. I think the artwork is fantastic. His passion for dragons really shows.This is a very inspirational book and excellent art all around!"},{"Title":"Transitions: The Art of Todd Lockwood","review":"I have found Todd Lockwood to be an artist with an inimitable sense of humor, and great to chat about. I had purchased his book \\"Transitions\\"; available almost nowhere, from Amazon. What a fantastic collection to have in one's library. He executes dragons immaculately, as well as the swarthy slayers, buxom women, and assorted bestial anamolies. He has rendered one of my favorite horror pieces, the Spell Rune Golum, and a close second is Ghost. The Golum is a formidable apparition of sticks and cloth and assorted bits of rubbish and toss-away things (doll heads, plastic spoons, etc). I brings to mind the Spell Golem creature made famous by Stan Winston, Pumpkinhead, and is equally frightening,; as shown on the face of the young woman ensnared in it's grasp. It's featureless face appears to be howling to the storm, a beastial cacophony. Get this book before it disappears forever. Genius."},{"Title":"Transitions: The Art of Todd Lockwood","review":"When I think rare I think extraordinary. This is rare, but not extraordinary. Not taking anything from the artist, reading Joe Jusko's book with his wisdom being revealed on every painting image in his book, I am a little disappointed in this artist book."},{"Title":"Transitions: The Art of Todd Lockwood","review":"The cover - that female figure in front of a burning phoenix - gives a fair idea of what's inside. The drawing is outstanding and varied. There are science fiction scenes, fantasies with demons and dragons, sword-and-sandal, and lots more.The real surprise for me was the huge and detailed black and white drawings. Pencil is a seriously under-rated medium. Lockwood shows just how much expression and detail the medium can support.Still, the world of fantasy art is a large world. It is populated with people like Boris Vallejo, Julie Bell, Frank Frazetta, and too many others to name. Lockwood's work is creative and competent. I just don't see the spark in it that would let his work stand next to the greatest masters of the field."},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"I love this little book and the big inspiration it offers for prayers. The fact is, I pray at red lights -- odd but true. As I run errands everyday, I find myself thinking of someone or something else I had forgotten. Joanne Redmond reminds me of a dear and close friend who offers careful and well thought out nudges to remind me to pray. As long as we do it, we remind oursleves that there are many who need prayers just as much as we do. It's a wonderful book with lovely pictures. Great idea with a lasting memory of what is really important. Another book I adore, which has a incredible, but simple prayer for moms in the back, is Mommy-CEO, by Christian family columnist, Jodie Lynn."},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"Redmond has captured the essence of what it means to be in daily conversation with the God of the universe. Rather than offering lofty platitudes or religious doctrine, Redmond breaks through to what it means to have intimacy with the Father. God designed us to be in relationship with Himself, and Redmond shows how easy this can be in the midst of our hurried lives."},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"I'd say get this book, but then i will also give you the Lord's prayer for free. We all need Salvation because life can take away your life and my life, and if we Die in Our Sins then we end up in Hell.\\"Our Father who art in Heavenhallowed be thy name. Thy KingdomCome, Thy will be done on earth as itis in Heaven. Give us this day and our dailybread and forgive us for our trespasses as weforgive those who trespass against us. And leadus not into temptation but deliver us from evil.Jesus, I pray this in your Holy name. Amen.\\"The second free prayer is the one on Salvation.\\"Jesus,Save from eternal damnation. I repent of my sins, and I askyou to forgive me. Please, come into my life right now and everyday, and take meto Heaven once i die. I pray this in your Holy Name. Amen.\\"Get this book, and pray the prayers above, and the Holy Ghost shall come into your life and guide you everyday. But prayer is important. Always. Jesus is not about one day, but everyday.He is our Creator. So always pray, make it into a beautiful habit. Prayer is talking to Jesus Directly. Once the Holy Ghost speaks to you, it is a beautiful feeling that does not compare to any joy you may have experienced at all in your entire life. It is God speaking to you, the Energies are so beautiful, ultimate happiness, it is Ultimate love. You simply want more of it. But yes, Jesus Christ is beautiful.As for myself, i am an independant Christian. I believe only in the Holy Bible-Jesus's Word,in Prayer, and Christ Jesus Only."},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"This book is amazing!!! It gave me so many great ideas of how to pray during my everyday activities. The size is perfect for carrying around, and I loved the photography."},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"I love this beautiful little book. It gives me just enough of a start to a really good little prayer -- then I take it from there. Light-hearted, just pure and simply delightful, this book has given me both real joy and relief.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Say a Little Prayer: 101 Everyday Ways to Pray","review":"The book is so inspirational.

It is so light and perfect-- I carry it in my bag with me everywhere. It is the perfect gift-- I can't wait to give a copy to my friends!"},{"Title":"THE BRIDAL SUITE","review":"This book was really really good...in the beginning and the middle...my only complaint is that the ending came too soon! Basically the story's about Dana and Griffin who meet when he takes over her computer company...he fires her after a misunderstanding but the next morning turns up begging her to work for him again.....they go off for a huge sale meeting thingie and end up having to share the bridal suite...personally, I love books like this where the two characters are forced together....and fall in love...*sigh* i'm just a romantic at heart"},{"Title":"THE BRIDAL SUITE","review":"Here's another story you'll need to make room for on your keeper shelf ... who could resist a pirate like Griffin McKenna?Description from the book back cover:The newspapers called her new boss a financial genius, the gossip columns branded him gorgeous. But Dana Anderson could think of other words to describe Griffin McKenna: arrogant, egotistical, self-important ... When Dana and Griffin arrived at a conference to find they had to share a room, Dana was ready to run - a whole weekend spent with Griffin in the Bridal Suite? But then she experienced for herself the McKenna take-over technique ...DO NOT DISTURB! Anything can happen behind closed doors!"},{"Title":"THE BRIDAL SUITE","review":"This book did not hold my interest. The plot was thin and there was way too much thinking. I found myself skipping through pages and pages. While there was chemistry between the hero and heroine, the conflict was flimsy and they had almost no time together before deciding they were in love. They spent a total of two short meetings in his office and two days and a night together."},{"Title":"THE BRIDAL SUITE","review":"This was very a very entertaining read. Great dialogue and chemistry between the her and heroine, and very romantic. Thank you Harlequin for re-releasing these out of print books in kindle format."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"This book is much more informative and essential to the working actor than the countless others you can find on a bookshelf. Instead of giving the same advice (which usually isn't good to use in an audition situation), it expounds on the idea that you already have some idea about what you need and gives you real, nose-to-the-grindstone advice on how to tighten things up and give a real whammy of an audition.As well as advice on choosing the appropriate 16 bars or monologue, it gives advice about representation, Actors Equity, resum&eacute;s, headshots, you name it.Here's a hint: This book is soo worth it, we used it as a textbook in a collegiate course about auditioning."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"If you plan on a career in theatre, this book is a must. Not owning it, is like a hairstylist not owning scissors. It is a necessary item in really owning and excercising one's craft. I have had the pleasure to work with Darren Cohen personally, and can only describe it as an actor's dream. This book is the next best thing. Everything is simple and down to terms that agree with an actor's mind and allow us to understand the delicate creature that is \\"the audition.\\" I only wish this was around when I was still in college. A Must!!!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"Actors, whether seasoned or new, who regularly audition for musicals and plays should not omit taking at least a peek at the advice in The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals And Plays: it's a 'must' for would-be pros and provides an edge over the competition in both musical theater and regular play auditions, from locating the right music or monologue to demonstrating unique talents in a mere 2 minutes. An added bonus: chapters which discuss the realities of a working actor's life beyond the audition, from union regulations and the roles of agents to further reference tips, including web sites. Simply invaluable."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"I have read a few books on auditioning and Darren Cohen's book is by far the most informative and gives you the most effective tools for great auditions. Since reading it my auditions have gotten so much better and I am much more comfortable in the audition room. This book is a must for any actor or musical theatre person!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"The Complete Proffessional Audition, by Darren Cohen and Michael Perilstein, is a terrific, fresh approach to an auditioning book. As a young actor myself I found the ideas and suggestions in this book to be most helpful. The exercises given in the monologue section has helped me find new life in my monologue, and has actually made me excited about performing it. The practical information section was equally beneficial it gave some great advice on a wide variety of subjects such as, representation, taxes and getting experience among others. For those of you who can carry a tune the musical theater audition section is filled with advice and suggestions for the perfect singing audition, and for those of us who are not (myself included) I recommend reading that section anyway, some of the suggestions given can also go towards non-singing auditions and are very useful. Darren and Michael have done an outstanding job of putting together a great book filled with wonderful tips that every actor should know and utilize in every audition. Commonsense starts with buying this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"I don't know how I auditioned before this book. For any high school or college student going through program or emphasis auditions, this book is essential. And even better, for professional auditions, this book is a handbook on how to do everything you will need to know.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to be enlightened."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"As a student of Music Theatre, this book is a fantastic guide to the well rounded audition. This book even landed me the audition! This book is well worth a read for ANYONE who is autioning in Acting, Singing and Musical Theatre."},{"Title":"The Complete Professional Audition: A Commonsense Guide To Auditioning For Musicals and Plays","review":"My son plans a career in musical theatre and this is the fourth book that I have read on the topic. The others included the book by Shurtleff and the one by Silver. They were all good but I liked this one best because it covered all of the practical aspects of performing songs and monologues for auditions. It guides one through all of the details. Since this is the most current of all the books the frames of reference are more appropriate."},{"Title":"The Language of Clothes","review":"I can't wait to go out and buy this book, which I read in hardcover from the library. It is very well researched and illustrated and discusses clothes and fashions from long ago up till today. And not just fashions and how they change, but what they MEAN. For example, did you know....in olden times, not just elegant clothing, but cloth itself was and admired and expensive commodity. The more cloth making up one's clothing meant that person was wealthy. Paintings of the period featured draperies in the background to indicate a person's wealth, and even today designer clothing uses more cloth and is cut fuller, carrying on the tradition. Anyone interested in not only fashion and clothing but symbols and history should read this book, it is just fascinating and delicious."},{"Title":"The Language of Clothes","review":"Well written, well argued history, not text book like at all, but like a long New Yorker article. A pleasure to read. It's not about silly petty fads but great social movements that underlie trends and revolutions. I think more photo illustrations would help."},{"Title":"The Language of Clothes","review":"Novelist Lurie here turns her attention to the history and social interpretation of clothing, linking politics, sexuality and social issues such as class to the evolution of clothing design and style. From Victorian to modern times, The Language of Clothes takes a sweeping look at the history of clothing's evolution and trends, making for an excellent guide."},{"Title":"The Language of Clothes","review":"This is an amusing essay on how Lurie interprets various clothing, outfits, and styles. The book is easy to read and is a way to pass the time pleasurably. Potential readers, however, should be aware that the \\"language\\" metaphor does not hold for long: in this book, clothes are like a language only inasmuch as they convey meaning. One could just as validly and convincingly write about, say, \\"the language of bookshelves\\" or \\"the language of bicycle riding styles.\\" Those interested in a history of clothing would do well to look elsewhere, and those interested in analyses of clothing would do well to look elsewhere as well (e.g.,The Fashion System). Potential readers are also warned that Lurie tends to make sweeping generalizations about persons not part of her social world (e.g., the poor or non-Anglo-Saxons) and some may find these generalizations (never backed by citations of evidence) offensive."},{"Title":"The Language of Clothes","review":"The best pick-up line is to tell a woman how her clothes communicate aspects of her personality. Women love to talk about what the colors, patterns, and styles of their clothes mean. \\"The Language of Clothes\\" is all you need to do this -- although I also recommend \\"Big Hair: A Journey into the Transformation of Self,\\" by Grant McCracken, to discuss what women's hair means. \\"The Language of Clothes\\" consists of chapters about how clothes express youth or age, a time or era, certain places, social status, etc. The best chapters are about how clothes communicate gender and sexual messages. This book is also one of the best birthday presents to give to a woman. (I shouldn't be sexist -- the book also discusses men's clothes.) The book has *lots* of clothes, and lots of photos. It's long and carefully researched. It makes you think. Women happily spend hours paging through it.--Review by Thomas David Kehoe..."},{"Title":"Kaplan AP Biology, 2004 Edition","review":"the information in this book is not bad, but the way in which it is presented is confusing and poorly edited. there are many mistakes, from the quiz answers assigned to the wrong questions to misspelled words. i would highly recommend cliffsap biology in place of this."},{"Title":"Kaplan AP Biology, 2004 Edition","review":"I read, highlighted, and wrote all over this book during the last month before AP exams. It is a great combination of text and diagrams.This is not a \\"Cliffnotes\\" book--- you will have to read some. However, what is written is NECESSARY information.Best of all, the text is straightforward.WARNING:+ If you had a really, really, really bad teacher, this is not the book for you--- it does make some assumptions about your knowledge.+ If you are trying to get a \\"night before the AP\\" preparation, this just won't work-- give yourself at least 1-2 weeks (if not more).Good luck!

Definitely the best book out there."},{"Title":"Murder For Revenge","review":"The first thing that I saw was the cover. Then I flipped through the book, looking at the table of contents. The reason I bought the book is somewhat hazy--but it had something to do with Shel Silverstein.Since I bought this book a few weeks before finals, I was trying so hard not to read it...I couldn't help it. I read it. All the way through. I thoroughly enjoyed it--I loved Shel Silverstein's poem, Mary Higgins Clark's story as well as many others.Though the cover made me feel embarassed to be holding the book, it is worth being teased for reading something that looks like pulp fiction. If you like this book, read &quot;Murder for Love&quot; as well. It's just as good, and some of the same writers write stories/poems for it."},{"Title":"Murder For Revenge","review":"Otto Penzler has invited twelve of the top selling writers of mysteries to contribute a short story to his MURDER BY REVENGE anthology. All of the stories feature someone pushed over the edge, seeking to get even with the pusher. The tales range from comical to venomous to angst-laden, but they all share the fact that they are all well done.Unlike most anthologies, this collection contains blockbuster stories authored by superstars and they all do a fabulous job. Fans of murderous short stories could not get a better selection than those in this anthology. Contributors are a who's who, who all succeed: Laurence Block, Mary Higgins Clark, Thomas Cooke, Vicki Hendricks, Joan Hess, Judith Kelman, Eric Lustlaber, Philip Margolin, David Morell, Joyce Carol Oates, Shel Silverstein, and Peter Straub.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder For Revenge","review":"When one picks up an anthology titled MURDER FOR REVENGE, you expect that all of the stories will have revenge murders as its theme. That is not the case with this collection.Some of the stories, such as Lawrence Block's A BONE IN THE THROAT and Judith Kelman's ERADICUM HOMO HORIBILUS, involve characters seeking retribution after events of many years have passed. Other stories such as Joan Hess's CAVEAT EMPTOR, involve a woman who is taken advantage of and decides to get even in a deadly manner.There are two stories that seemed misplaced in this book and they are Mary Higgins Clark's POWER PLAYS and Phillip Margolin's ANGIE'S DELIGHT. Granted they are two great authors but neither one of their stories could qualify as murder for revenge. The editor does treat us with a poem by Shel Silverstein titled THE ENEMY that talks about different ways of killing someone. Borrowing the title of Joan Hess's short story and buyer beware. The book's title is misleading and it might not be what you are looking for.

The war was about states rights, tariffs, congressional parity, constitutional interpretation--in short, just about everything but slavery.As scholars are increasingly discovering, however, that certainly wasn't the attitude of the majority of those who lived just before, during, and after the Civil War. (Chandra Manning's What This Cruel War Was Over, 2007, is an excellent example of recent scholarship that demonstrates this fact.) Everyone knew that slavery was the root cause of the conflict.John Richard Dennett's The South As It Is is yet another contemporaneous document that attests to this. Published in 1865-66, the book was originally a series of articles commissioned by the fledgling Nation magazine. Dennett, a New Englander, traveled through the defeated South, interviewing aristocrat, yeoman, and poor whites alike.What Dennett discovered was a land that was beaten almost to the ground. Infrastructure was destroyed, croplands uncultivated, forests decimated. Whites seemed almost paralyzed by indolence, which in hindsight seems to be at least in part generated by the shock and despair of defeat and the consequent collapse of the southern feudal system. The pervasive attitude seems to be one of either hopelessness or fatalism.Except when it comes to blacks. Regardless of their social class, the whites Dennett interviewed positively quiver with enraged hatred of blacks. Freed blacks are shiftless, lazy, dishonest, untrustworthy. They won't work unless forced to by threat of physical punishment. They're inherently inferior in intelligence, ambition, and conscientiousness. None of them will make it as freedmen. The blacks are suited to slavery, and will soon wish they were being taken care of by benevolent masters.In short, what Dennett discovered in his travels through the South is that the war had indeed been about slavery. For the typical southerner, a society in which blacks were free--much less equal to white people--was simply unthinkable. The possibility that such freedom might've been legislated in 1860, despite Lincoln's insistence that he had no such aims, was too much to bear--just as, in defeat, the thought of free blacks was still intolerable.Dennett's book deserves more attention than it's received, and I hope it will be reprinted. But Henry Christman's edition is sadly lacking (hence the four-star rating here). There are no footnotes, no index, and only a minimalistic introduction. Moreover, Dennett's text, written as it was as a series of articles, is a bit repetitious in places, and could use some redaction. Still, until a better edition comes along, this one will do."},{"Title":"Effective Communication Skills: Essential Skills for Success in Work and Life 2nd Edition","review":"I purchased this book for my staff to read as part of improving the communication in our group.

The older editions are much better."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"This review is for the hardcover, Illustrated Junior Library edition, ISBN 0448060019, translated by M. A. Murray and illustrated by Fritz Kredel, and published by Grosset and Dunlap. Since Amazon elects to combine the reviews of several different versions of 'Pinocchio' under each of the product pages, it is sometimes difficult to tell exactly which version goes with which review. To the best of my knowledge, this version is not abridged nor edited, and was first published in 1946.Well, here's another read-aloud-before-bedtime book, though truth be told, it didn't rise to the same level as some of our other attempts. I enjoyed reading it, with its variety of characters, which gives me an opportunity to indulge in some limited stagecraft, but I think my daughter was only semi-enthusiastic. She seemed to respond well to some passages, though some others were surely a little beyond her.(She's almost nine)'Pinocchio', as translated here, should not glibly be assumed to be suitable for all ages - some children may be bothered by its images, such as when Pinnocchio is hanged by the Fox and Cat, or when the puppets friend, Candlewick, after being transformed into a donkey, is literally worked to death. Other times, the writing is geared more toward an adult's understanding, and the humor is a trifle more complex than what I would assume most young children are capable of - several scenes were clearly over my daughter's head. I don't want to scare anyone away - I never thought there was anything inappropriate in the book for us, but everyone has different opinions on that matter. If you feel your children are especially sensitive, you may want to preview beforehand, and then make your own judgment.Still, 'Pinocchio' has many things going for it. The movie follows the high points of storyline fairly well - if you've seen it then you know the basic plot here as well - but the difference is how it reflects its times as opposed to the sanitized film sixty years later. Carlo Collodi's version may be a little too gritty for some parents - unless they are ready to explore more textured worlds with their kids - but it still toes a moral line. And I believe the exposure to the oddness of Pinocchio's world - which would have been fantastic, but not odd in Collodi's time - is enriching in our too-homogeneous world.Well worthwhile, but like many classics, it is a product of its time. Some respond better than others to that - for my daughter, it ended up as an 'I like it' rather than 'I love it'.A quick note on the edition: This is a very nice book for a youngster, sturdy, and with slightly larger print than usual. That last fact is also nice for an oldster like me. The illustrations by Kredel are mostly black-and-white, studded throughout the text, with a few full color plates taking up an entire page. Without other translations to compare it to, I can only say that I didn't notice anything that sounded too peculiar, other than a decision to translate the puppet theater owner's name from Mangiafuoco to the literal Fire Eater. Altogether an attractive addition for a child's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years. However, most people today are probably primarily familiar with the adaptation (and the depiction) of Pinocchio from Disney's movie. It is nonetheless always instructive and worthwhile to go to the original story because, in my opinion, most attempts to \\"improve\\" any given story inevitably end up subtracting rather than adding to its value.This is an inexpensive, short and very readable edition of the Pinocchio story. It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place. The original story is much more colorful, but also darker, than the more recent adaptations. Pinocchio, Geppetto and other characters often get into physical confrontations. For the most part these incidents are amusing, but they oftentimes quite literary result in a loss of life or limb. Reading the original story also brings forth the fact that \\"Adventures of Pinocchio\\" was very consciously written as a morality tale. Its aim is to teach children (and especially boys) some of the basic character-building lessons: it's important to obey your parents or other authority figures, it's important to study and work hard, chasing after easy life and cheap thrills inevitably ends in a disaster. The forcefulness of such admonitions may seem a bit quaint today, but I for one think that they have a place even in the modern world.Overall, this is a very fun little book that people of all ages will enjoy reading."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters.

This is the French fairytale that I read first, the book that was handed down to me from my Grandparents and given as a gift to them by a family friend; the illustrator Charles Mozley- who knew my Grandparents intimately. The personal description from (as my mother called him \`Uncle Charles') was touching, and the stunning hand drawn illustrations, add that real special element that makes this book so unique.*unlike the first edition that is listed on Amazon, the copy that I own is the first one made and hand-illustrated by the artist before being put into print*The tale is about love, friendship, loyalty and honesty and which certainly is memorable as to remain with you throughout childhood and into adulthood with its clear message. Heartwarming, affecting and so powerful this emotive narrative will have you in tears, as you experience such a rollercoaster of events within this compelling read. The love between flesh and blood, father and son is quite remarkable and like most family's it is something that can never be quite equaled to. Nor is the value of knowing right from wrong and understanding the importance of selflessness, thoughtfulness and how in life one should put others first. At times this book I found scary as a young child (around 5 yrs old when my mother first read it to me at bedtime), especially when the young boys who were corrupted were transformed into Donkey's! It is a journey of a lifetime, a character-driven tale with some distinctive characters (i.e. Cricket), dramatic and full of intensity that has you glued to the pages - this is something truly astonishing and heartwarming.Pinocchio is a young boy and whose egotistical mannerisms and lying, has the most severe consequences; such as being turned into wood and his nose growing longer and longer... His father loves his son so much and only wishes that he could become flesh and blood again, but for this to transpire Pinocchio must learn to be a good boy. As he leaves home and embarks on the most extraordinary, horrendous and unexpected of adventures where he almost looses his life this young boy takes note of the depths of his father's kind heart and the power of love.This particular edition, 1959, is so special and which is something that shall remain within my family for generations to come. Complete with such stunning illustrations by an artist who was a close friend of my Grandparents (who were also well-known artists themselves), this is something to treasure and which one cannot compare to the printed, contemporary editions of today. The story is something quite unforgettable and outstanding, that which is loved by generations both young and old and which reminds all of us the important things in life. I would recommend this as a first book to read to your children, to your nieces and nephews and for your own personal pleasure...For when you wish upon a star, dreams really DO come true!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"No other Pinocchio would do for my six year-old grandson, who hung on the conclusion of each chapter like his life depended on it. I bought him a paperback edition to take home with him until I could order this version, illustrated by Roberto Innocenti, so he could have his own copy of the one I was reading to him.My grandson agonized over Pinocchio's conflicts between his sincere desire to be good and his stray impulses. Whoknew the tale of a little woodenhead becoming a real boy could be such a cliffhanger! Innocenti's illustrations are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"Pinocchio is a classic story, and a very different one than the saccharine Disney version most Americans are familiar with. Carlo Collodi's 1882 book lays out the story of a wooden puppet come to awkward life, who proceeds to act out on every selfish, crude and obnoxious impulse ever known to childhood. Each bad decision brings sorrow to his \\"father\\" Gepetto and his \\"mother\\" the Blue Fairy, and brings a terrifying consequence to the puppet -- in the course of the book his feet are burned off, he nearly starves, he is attacked by robbers, he is sent to prison, he's nearly fried as a fish, and he's transformed into a donkey to be sold for money.With each consequence, his penitence for foolish behavior is more real. At the beginning of the book he's the kind of child who sells his schoolbook, purchased by his father's sacrifice of his winter coat, to go to a marionette show. By the end of the story, Pinocchio is the kind of boy who leaps into the sea, risking his life to save his father from a monstrous fish. This gradual transformation culminates in Pinocchio dreaming one night that the Blue Fairy comes to him saying,In return for your good heart, I forgive you all your past misdeeds. Children who love their parents, and help them when they are sick and poor, are worthy of praise and love, even if they are not models of obedience and good behavior. Be good in future, and you will be happy.He wakes in the morning to find that he has become a real boy, with the old wooden puppet limp in the corner.This wasn't originally a children's story, but it is a story about childhood and the taming of childish, reckless impulses. It's a deeply moral tale, often reiterating the importance of working hard, being responsible, and telling the truth. It may open up a discussion about what it means to be a slave to sinful impulses (Romans 6:16-18; Romans 7:21-24), and it confirms the Biblical teaching that \\"folly is bound up in the heart of a child\\" (Proverbs 22:15).It isn't, however, a Christian story, and it lacks the Christian quality of grace which transforms undeserving sinners. The moralism is sometimes quite heavy-handed, and penalties for disobedience are often gruesome. Pinocchio's redemption ultimately comes, not from a power outside himself, but from his own resolve to change when he sees the consequences of his behavior for himself and others. Because of this moral self-reliance, this story may not be a good match for children who are prone to self-righteousness.If you do decide to go with Pinocchio, please avoid the many uninteresting illustrated versions available, and check out Roberto Innocenti's rendition. His surreal, dramatic, and often funny pictures perfectly complement Collodi's vivid style."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"I had this same book as a child and am so happy to have my childhood memories back again. A few pages were damaged but I replaced them by finding a download of each page of this classic online. This is the real deal Pinocchio, not Walt Disney's version. It's worth every penny spent, to me. The illustrations are priceless!"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"Most everyone is generally familiar with the story of Pinocchio, although this familiarity is usually the result of the Walt Disney animated film. Actually, the movie does a reasonably good job of following the book, although it leaves a lot out and makes quite a few changes. A master carpenter named Anthony, whom everyone calls Maestro Cherry, comes across a piece of magic wood. He gives it to his friend Geppetto, a puppeteer who fashions a puppet whom he names Pinocchio. The puppet immediately runs off. Geppetto chases him and is put in jail when he tries to punish his wayward puppet. When Pinocchio returns home, the Talking Cricket tries to warn him about the error of his ways, but he kills it with a hammer, though it reappears two or three times later as a ghost.Geppetto gets out of jail, but instead of going to school Pinocchio wanders off again to see a puppet show and is taken by the puppeteer Swallowfire who eventually releases him and sends him back to Geppetto with five coins. However, Pinocchio meets the Fox and the Cat, who talk him into going to the Field of Miracles in the land of Boobies where they tell him he can plant his five coins and they will grow into thousands. The two swindle him out of one coin for dinner and then leave him at an inn. When Pinocchio goes out to find them, they disguise themselves, try to rob him, and eventually hang him. He is saved by a little girl who turns out to be \\"the fairy with the blue hair.\\" She invites him to live with her and even sends for Geppetto, but he follows the Fox and Cat again and loses his coins to them. Later, after several other adventures, he returns to find that the little girl has died and shortly after that learns that Geppetto went to sea in search of him and was lost, perhaps swallowed by the great shark (not Monstro the whale) swimming in that area. He even ends up with his friend Candle-Wick in \\"The Land of Toys\\" and turns into a donkey. Will Pinocchio ever make it home? Will he find his Papa? Will he see the Blue Fairy again?It appears that Collodi, penname for Carlo Lorenzini, originally had not intended the novel as children's literature. However, the first fifteen chapters, at the unhappy ending of which Pinocchio dies a gruesome death by hanging, were serialized in a children's magazine between 1881 and 1883. At the request of his editor, Collodi added chapters 16-36, in which the Fairy rescues Pinocchio and eventually transforms him into a real boy. The entire story then was published as a book for children in February, 1883. Thus, it allegorically deals with some serious themes but in the end Pinocchio acquires a deeper understanding of himself, making the story suitable for children. The original English translation was made in 1892 by Mary E. Murray and is used in the Penguin Classics edition (2002). The Puffin Classics edition (1996) uses a translation by E. Harden. New York Review Books published a new translation in 2008 by Geoffrey Brock. The Oxford University Press edition that I bought has \\"an authoritative new translation\\" by Ann Lawson Lucas. I suppose that Lucas's translation is all right, but instead of leaving Gepetto's name as it is, she translates it as \\"Old Joe.\\" Personally, I think that I would have rather read Murray's translation. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book. Though a little grim at times, it does teach some important lessons."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"This is a classic and deserves to be on everyone's book shelf, young and old.

His 300 color illustrations are wonderful depictions of Italy of that time. He goes beyond mere illustrations. It's art! The Adventures of Pinnochio was published in the U.S. in 1925.

This review refers to the 2005 hardcover from Creative Editions. This is a revised version, first published in 1998, this edition features a new translation of the full, unabridged text, more lyrical than some older translations, and quite faithful to the original Italian text. Also, this edition has several additional illustrations, and has been handsomely re-designed. Altogether, I find this to be my absolute favorite edition of Pinnocchio, and I even bought it again, to replace my much-loved earlier edition. I prefer the new translation to the older translation used before, and the addition of more illustrations and the re-design make this a superior edition.I first found this book in a thrift store, and the inscription indicated it was a misguided gift to a young child from his grand-parents... Don't make this mistake, this version of Pinocchio is definitely not intended for young children. Parents may want to look elsewhere if they are expecting a tame children's book. This is a sophisticated and somewhat graphically illustrated edition, and it is not the Disney-fied version of Pinocchio that many people expect. If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the original story, and the popular sanitized versions, you might be shocked at first. The story is actually very dark, brutal, & surreal, and the illustrations of, say, Pinocchio getting hung in a tree, are really too dark for very young children.That being said, I still whole-heartedly recommend this edition for older readers wanting an artistic and unexpurgated version of this incredible tale. This is one of the best modern translations of the text I've read, so I would recommend it to literature students and people interested in Italian folklore over most of the other versions available.The artwork is what drew me to this book when I first saw it. You simply must see these illustrations to appreciate them. The detailed, large-scale, and subtlely colored drawings are a moody and perfect accompaniment to this version of the text. I pick this book up often, just to look at the amazing pictures and re-read some of my favorite parts.Overall, I am thrilled with this revised edition of a book I already considered a classic among illustrated books. I recommend it to scholars of folklore, lovers of sophisticated illustrated books, and curious readers looking for a dark, surreal and wondrous book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"I grew up in Italy and this is the real Macoy. Every Italian grows up reading Collodi's masterpiece while looking at Attilio Mussino's illustrations. This is the Pinocchio we imagine. When I first saw Disney's Pinocchio, I was shocked! So cute and kind... there is nothing to learn from the Disney video. Collodi's Pinocchio, on the other hand, is a child who lacks every sense of altruism, who needs to be educated. Collodi wrote various children's books, always with a pedagogical intent.This is a book for parents to read with their children. It helps remind parents that an apple needn't be peeled, and it helps kids eat the apple with the peel. If you're having problems with your first grader, this is a pedagogical and fun book for all the family."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"I own several copies of Pinocchio both English and Italian texts, and this is one of my favorite translations as Ms. Lucas takes great care with conveying the original intent of Collodi's story and characters -- (even down to the translated names used for the characters).

Now a new edition of this magnificent and imaginative fairy tale has been superbly illustrated by Roberto Innocenti with intricate artwork of museum gallery quality. This is the original story that includes all of Pinocchio's travels including getting ambushed by vile assassins, strung up in a tree, drowned in the sea, nursed back to health by a beautiful blue-haired fairy, slaying a large serpent through laughter, chained up as a dog to catch thieving weasels, arrested for fighting with classmates, almost eaten by a ravenous fisherman, saving a great mastiff and being saved by the mastiff in return, morphing into a performing donkey, flying on the back of a pigeon, getting swallowed by a gigantic shark, saving Geppetto's life, and so much more that most readers will be completely unaware of if the only contact they've had with this sophisticated story is the Disney movie and the abbreviated children's picture book versions. This simply outstanding and enthusiastically recommended edition of The Adventures Of Pinocchio does full and complete justice to the wonder and storytelling skills that originally made the life and travails of a wooden puppet brought to life so universally beloved."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"My children and I have just completed this book, with beautiful illustrations by Innocenti, as a read-aloud. I have never been acquainted with any Pinocchio other than the anemic, sanitized Disney versions reflected also in the Little Golden Books. The cautions by others to be careful with young children are worthy of consideration, for this book has terrors aplenty, both in words and illustrations, but I find both words and illustrations to be marvelous.I am beginning to \\"open the door\\" to the difficult realities of the world for my children, and find beautiful allegorical literature to be just the ticket. The illustrations are beautifully rendered, but some are also quite scarey. Frequently, a following page will have a small cameo of a detail from the full illustration of a preceding page which draws the attention to that moral heart of a complex picture. I prefer this introduction to the reality of wickedness in the world (in words and illustrations) to the soul-numbing introductions to wickedness rampant in television and movies which give no time for concern for reflection.Some of my favorite themes are emphasized also - the redeeming power of love and forgiveness, the association of both forgiveness AND repentance prior to the resolution of relationship, the surpassing value of wisdom and the often difficult trials that must come before the heart is ready to embrace it.I am especially struck by Pinocchio's occasional recounting of his adventures as the tale unfolds. In the beginning of the tale, his recounting is filled with blaring examples of falsehood and complete lack of self-examination or evaluation. Everything that happens to him is someone else's fault and there is little association of cause and event. As the tale unfolds, however, Pinocchio's self-examination increases in accuracy, and his self-examination also becomes more accurate.I think this allegorical tale has much value for young children, as does Hinds' Feet on High Places and The Pilgrim's Progress."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"Collodi knew how mischievous children can be.He was one himself when he went to school in Flroence.In his later years,he was a school reforms official,and wrote many textbooks.He believed the best way to teach is by entertaining as well.This certainly shows in Pinocchio.The little Blockhead gets into all kinds of scrapes because he rushes into things with little consideration.Pinocchio is tricked by the Fox&amp;Cat, advised by the Talking-Cricket,helped by the Fairy with Blue Hair-and ultimately realizes that if he wants to become a real boy,his inner self must be transformed first.The final chapter is a true indication of how Pinocchio has fully become a son to Gepetto.Collodi's story has many film-television-stage versions,but the original is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"!!WOW!!

Later Pinnochio found out that the fairy was still alive.If you want to find out what else happened, and the end, you must read the book. It's a real page turner. You'll love it.Reviewed by: Zachary Robert Albertini"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"I understand that for people who only see the Disney's movie this book can seem dangerous, but this is the REAL STORY of Pinocchio.For me (I live in Italy) the story is familiar and I remember to have read it when I was 6 or 7, without any danger of my \\"child psicology\\".Unfortunately, English speaking people haven't seen the wonderful Italian film of Pinocchio of the 70s (directed for the Italian TV by Comencini with Nino Manfredi, Gina Lollobrigida, Franco Franchi, Ciccio Ingrassia and others), that could help people who haven'e read the original book to have another perspective of the story..."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"I read this book 20 years ago. I can still remember how convoluted the whole thing seemed to me when I was a child. This is the original Pinnochio story, upon which Disney based it's movie. In the book, Jimminy doesn't get past Chapter 3 as anything other than a ghost. The stories of Pinnochio turning into a donkey were very dark, and still leave me wondering about all the symbolism. If you think the story of Pinnochio can be summed up into a morality story about the perils of lying, you only know Disney. This is a book which is suitable for (my opinion) 12 through adult."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Pinocchio (World's Classics)","review":"This book is beautifully made . The art is wonderful. It is a good value for those who enjoy high quality illustrating."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","review":"The author has assembled a wonderfully accessible study of time series analysis from the point of view of spectral theory. This book really bridges the gap between Brockwell & Davis' elementary textIntroduction to Time Series and Forecastingand their advanced textTime Series: Theory and Methods.The book is logically partitioned into two volumes: Volume I (Chapters 1-8) considers spectral methods for time series, while Volume II (Chapters 9-11) extends the results to multivariate time series.Priestly tries to keep the prerequisites to a minimum, but the reader is well advised to do a little background preparation before jumping in to this book. For the required material in mathematical analysis of Fourier series, I recommend Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis. Although Priestly provide a brief introduction to probability theory, I'd recommend a more solid grounding, as can be found in Chung'sA Course in Probability Theory. The elementary text by Brockwell & DavisIntroduction to Time Series and Forecastingpresents the needed material on time series analysis.In Chapter 1, Priestly sets up the motivation for considering spectral analysis of stationary time series, and gives four practical reasons for the use of spectral methods.The reader will find a brief, 70 page overview of probability theory in Chapter 2. If the terms don't look familiar on a quick scan of this chapter, you'll want to get more detail from Chung's text before proceeding with Priestly.Chapter 3 introduces stochastic processes and time series. Stationary time series are defined, as is the auto-covariance and autocorrelation function. ARMA(p,q) models are introduced and some basic results are established about these models.The core results from spectral analysis are given in Chapter 4. The two main results are the Wiener-Khintchine Theorem (characterized those functions which can be the autocorrelation function of a stationary process), and the Spectral Representation Theorem for Stationary Processes.Chapter 5 gives a really nice treatment of ARMA(p,q) model specification and estimation. The author motivates the well-known conditional maximum likelihood techniques for estimating coefficients, and gives really insight into the development of methods of order estimation using the information criterion ala Akaike (i.e. AIC) and Schwartz.The next section consists discuss spectral estimation and consists of Chapters 6, 7, and 8. Chapter 6 tackles the theoretical issues surrounding estimated the spectral density of a stationary process. The author does a good job explaining the shortcomings of the periodogram as an estimator, as well as the need for tapering or 'windowing'. Chapter 7 continues along this theme by giving empirical guidance for selecting windowing schemes. Chapter 8 discusses the thorny problem of posed by processes containing both a continuous and a discrete spectrum.The last part of the book comprised Volume II and extends the results of the first volume to cover the case of multivariate time series. Applications considered in this volume include problems of filtering and prediction. In the last chapter of the book, Priestly presents some of his own research on \\"evolutionary spectra\\" which is an attempt to extend the analysis to non-stationary processes.The book is written in monograph style; as such there are no formal exercises. However, the author gives lots of examples using real-world datasets. Working through the examples serves to reinforce the reading. The author states several theorems, but usually prefers to justify these results with a heuristic argument. On occasion, a formal proof is given, but there are no end-of-proof markers (e.g. QED). The reader must take care to determine where the proof ends and the discussion resumes."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","review":"I thought James D. Hamiltons book Time Serives Aanlysis was better. It was easier to understand and covered more material, including VAR models and State Space. Still this was and is an excellent book, and it goes into details about multivariate statistics that are not contained in Hamilton's book. I have the same complaint about this book as Hamilton's. Not enough examples. I compare these two books to those of Hosmer and Lemeshow's Applied Logistic Regression where there were nurmerous examples and problems to solve based on data they had provided.Michael Quigley Director, Statistical Model and Data Mining Wells Fargo Bank"},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","review":"Great book for a great treatment of spectral analysis.Priestley gives nice explanations and provide lots of intuition !For people interested in time series, you should definitely buy it."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","review":"This book covers almost all possible aspects of spectral analysis of time series. The problem is that it is almost exclusively theoretical. It should not be used for learning spectral analysis but rather as a reference book. There are very few practical examples but when looking for a proof or an abstract presentation of a particular concept, this book should allow you to understand the theory that lies behind... However, a very good treatment of spectral analysis and very broad coverage of the subject..."},{"Title":"Spectral Analysis and Time Series, Two-Volume Set, Volume 1-2: Volumes I and II (Probability and Mathematical Statistics)","review":"The book covers a good deal of spectral analysis with all the details and results and applications. It starts with probability theory and random processes, definition of Fourier series, spectrums, estimation using spectral methods and more advanced topics. The book focuses on frequency domain methods, though in parts it discusses time-series models like AR, ARMA, ... but in a frequency domain context. The book is rather mathematical and urges the reader to have some math background or familiarity with system theory and filters. It discusses the results for both continuous and discrete time processes, though the emphasis is more on the continuous time. The discussions are done neatly but can be cumbersome or unnecessary for people who just want to use a method. It is more a book for those who want to get to the bottom of the methods with a deep understanding of concepts.I found this book useful and rather complete and I am using that in a lot of my own projects."},{"Title":"Under the Greenwood Tree (Penguin Classics)","review":"Under the Greenwood Tree is Thomas Hardy's first Wessex novel, a world that rivals that of Balzac and Dickens, but instead of focusing on life in the city, Hardy instead focuses on the happenings of rural life. Dick Dewy doesn't have many prospects in life except his good looks. That is, until he meets the new female schoolteacher, Fancy Day, whose father is rumored to have a small fortune saved up for his beloved daughter when she gets married. That's not to say that's why Dick is attracted to her. It's love at first sight, for him, at least. There's other men interested in Fancy too, particularly, the prosperous Mr. Shiner, and even the local vicar, Mr. Maybold! It's up to Dick to convince Fancy that he is the man for her, while overcoming both her and her father's reservations that he's not quite in the same social class. Not to mention his own doubts of self-worth.Under the Greenwood Tree is a pretty straightforward early work by Thomas Hardy, the greatest English novelist. I maybe found it a little too simple, and the characters did not seem to be fleshed out very well. I didn't care much for Fancy, a woman who seemed caught up in her own vanity and whose love seemed to waver back and forth according to who asked for her hand in marriage, even though this is human nature. The local dialogue, as written by Hardy was a little hard to get used to, but you don't notice it after a while. This novel was sunnier in disposition than a lot of Hardy novels and should be seen as a work to be read by his fans, while the casual reader would be better served by his more famous titles.Other titles I would recommend by Hardy are Jude the Obscure, A Pair of Blue Eyes, Mayor of Casterbridge. Other titles with a similar pastoral settings are Harvest by Jean Giono, and Dreamers by Knut Hamsun."},{"Title":"Under the Greenwood Tree (Penguin Classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's family had a long history as players of instrumental music in the local church, and here Hardy creates an entertaining novel involving a fictional church choir.The characterizations and dialogue of his &quot;Mellstock Quire&quot; are detailed and interesting. The plot includes some very funny scenes--with the scene involving the visit to the vicar being among the best.You'll also find something in this book that you'll never see again--a Hardy novel with a (relatively) happy ending!"},{"Title":"Under the Greenwood Tree (Penguin Classics)","review":"To any Hardy fan, Under the Greenwood Tree makes for a terrific read. Compared to his major novels, however, it most certainly ranks as one of his lesser efforts. Understandable, given the fact that it was also one of his first novels. The master was just getting his feet wet, so to speak. What Hardy achieved wonderfully within this novel is his ability to create a strong sense of place. The reader can't help but feel as if he is a part of the Mellstock choir, or enjoying the hospitality of the Dewy family as they celebrate the seasons. This book contains some of Hardy's most enjoyable and memorable characters, incorporating humorous and authentic dialogue exchanges. In certain sections, however, the dialogue is stilted and seemingly ungenuine, perhaps indicating Hardy's immaturity as a novelist.The novel's structure derives from the natural seasons, as well as the pace of a young man's courting of a newly-arrived schoolteacher within the Mellstock community. Although the plot line is terribly straightforward, the reader's enjoyment comes from the strong picture painted of rural British life during the mid 19th century."},{"Title":"Under the Greenwood Tree (Penguin Classics)","review":"I love this book.

There is alot of information on the lunar calendar, the various deities, holy places and objects, symbolism, the Menehune and other important aspects of Hawaiian spirituality. I strongly recommend that anyone with an interest in Hawaiian religion or Huna look at this book."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","review":"Scott Cunningham takes us on a mystical trip into paradise with &quot;Hawaiin myth and magic&quot;. His book is concise, clearly written, and categorized neatly into 3 sections; explaining the connections between the dieties, people, myth, religion, majic, land (one of the few books I've found that do so!)Also included is a convenient Hawaiian glossery, Hawaiian Lunar calender. I found this book a joy to read and quite an inspiration to visit the natural wonders of Hawaii."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","review":"Mr. Cunningham clearly did his research on this book. This book contains a fairly comprehensive list of deities.However; IMHO Mr. Cunningham allowed his Wiccan beliefs to shade his perceptions of the Huna faith. Both Huna and Wicca are Shamanic religions, but they are radicaly different."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","review":"I find some of the reviews of this book appalling, one in particular on the reprinted 2009 version. People seem to forget that Scott Cunningham was well into his final days when this book came out. That aside, as a Hawaiian woman I like what he's written here since he obviously did the best that he could with what information he was allowed.Another thing that bothers me to no end is other people's attempt to project how they see Hawaiian culture and beliefs onto what he's written here. Grouping all of Polynesia together when referencing Hawaiian culture is just plain ignorant. Saying that 'Huna' is our religion is also just plain ignorant. And blaming Mr.Cunningham for not filling the book with information you might have wanted, that I'll tell you right now--he might not have been *allowed* to give, is also just plain ignorant.Mr.Cunningham's book, in this Hawaiian woman's opinion, is as best as it could have been considering everything that was going on in Hawaii in the late 80's & early 90's."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","review":"Cunningham went through great lengths to give an in-depth look into the mystical, beautiful world of Hawaiian spirituality. He did it with the view of a deeper understanding of the people and places that make Hawaii such a unique paradise, and he presented the native Hawaiian's spiritual views with the respect they deserve. Some other books I have read seem to take it from the point of a \\"haole\\" that looks at this world as interesting, but not to be taken too seriously."},{"Title":"Hawaiian Magic & Spirituality","review":"Reading this book you will come to know the love that Scott Cunningham has for Hawaii: the land, its people, and its magick. Through his writing you not only learn about the spirituality and practices, but of the heart and beauty of Hawaii. Scott also speaks of his relations with the Goddess Pele, and his other experiences in the land. Another must for Cunningham fans, or those who wish wishing to explore the magick of the islands."},{"Title":"2004 North Korea and Kim Jong-il: DPRK Military, Nuclear and Missile Programs, with Material from the DOD, Military, Congress, White House, CIA ... and U.S. Policy on North Korea (CD-ROM)","review":"Unfortunately, the title of this publication is the only thing remotely impressive about it. The vast majority of the \\"information\\" contained on the CD-ROM (there is no accompanying book) is returns from searches for the keywords \\"North Korea\\" on government websites.

I know many people have said that about many different books, but this one deserves to be read. It establishes the foundation of the Christain faith and teaches things that should be taught in church (but are not currently). It is full of the Life of Jesus and how that Life is given to us.It compares the Old Covanent with the New and disspells many errors that are promanent these days. The english is a bit hard to read (written in 1898), but at the same time it makes you think (which is good).Considering how many shallow \\"Christian\\" books there are right now (i.e. Purpose Driven Life, Your Best Life Now), this one is deep with divine Truth and Life(the real life of Jesus) that will comfort and challenge you."},{"Title":"Two Covenants: Your Blessings in Christ Moving from Promise to Fulfillment","review":"Excellent presentation of what a covenant child of God should know about this sacred union.

The first covenant was about what we were to do for God. Sounds alot like the way alot of us are living now, doesn't it ? We often think in terms of what we should be doing better, or shouldn't be doing, or could be doing for God. That's the old covenant - as in the old testament living. It's also called legalism.Andrew Murray explains, from scripture, that the New Covenant is what God did for us, and still wants to do for us. It is God who works in us to will and to do. We have such a hard time believing this and understanding it. But Andrew Murray does an excellent job in explaining it all.Also, he explains what covenant is. It is like a binding contract between us and God. God never, ever breaks His covenant. It is us who break ours. Even still, in a world where contracts are broken, a persons word is no good, lawyers are paid well to get around laws, we find it hard to embrace the beauty of the covenant that God has made with us. Therefore we find it hard to understand the depth of God's love to make such a deep, and binding covenant with us. We also often don't understand our part of the covenant. Andrew Murray helps us to see the beauty of God's purpose and love in making a covenant with us.Most people have a bit of legalism in them. I challenge anyone who thinks they walk in grace to read this book. I challenge anyone who knows they struggle with law to read this book. It'll help both to see what they've been doing wrong, mostly in just not understanding God's plan and purposes through the New Covenant and the freedom we've received through the death of Jesus."},{"Title":"Two Covenants: Your Blessings in Christ Moving from Promise to Fulfillment","review":"You are probably like most American Christians. You are living with one foot in the Old Covenant and one foot in the New Covenant and are left wondering why your Christian experience is so much less than what scripture indicates, real life. Most American Christians are busy trying to appease a God who is already completely and totally satisfied.Andrew Murray reveals why we're so confused. In a very exhortive while yet scholarly way Murray takes the reader from modern day spiritual bondage under the Law(try to earn God's favor)to New Covenant freedom (God's unconditional love of the saint).I agree with the other opinions, a must read by every Christian. A small book packed full of very useful truth. Makes a great daily devotional.

The book is a concise and accurate guide to divorce law and procedures in Massachusetts. If both husband and wife are talking and anywhere near rational, the book can serve as a step by step guide to a self help divorce.-Items covered include: -What are each parties rights in most cases. -How would a judge rule. -Where to go for protection or assistance. -Templates and sample forms..how to fill them out..where to file them. -Formulas and worksheets for calculating child support that conforms with state guidelines.I used the book, and I'm a guy. When my ex-wife and I used this book with the assistance of a mediator, I took a draft of the separation/divorce agreement we put together to a lawyer for review. The lawyer was incredibly confrontational in his approach and I could see the dollar signs in his eyes. When I asked him up front what the letter of the law said about each issue he brought up, it turned out that Jancoutz (and the terms of our agreement)conformed with what a judge would probably have ruled. I consulted another, more rational lawyer and made only minor changes to our agreement. My impression is that if paid lawyers start butting heads its just the lawyers who come out ahead. Jancourtz gives a couple the tools they need to understand the law.If your using mediation, hiring a lawyer, or want to do it by yourselves, Jancourtz provides an excellent tool."},{"Title":"The Massachusetts woman's divorce handbook","review":"I worked for a Divorce Attorney who used to recommend this book to her clients - I give the book to my friends, both female &amp; male, to read before they act on Divorce and during their Divorce.

Part of my curiosity was to see whether I had, in any way, applied some of the \\"Kick Ass\\" approaches that Gunnar recommends. Turns out that I really could have saved myself some time and heartache had I read this book before embarking on 7 years of higher education. In fact, this book could also be highly useful for graduate or law studies--the principles are the same!Yes, there are other similar books on the market, but few will be as brutally honest, humorous and timely as \\"Kick Ass in College.\\" It's an investment well worth it and as the President of successful corporation I would highly recommend spending some time with it.

Gunnar Fox's Kick Ass In College was a surprising find.I can confirm what other reviewers have said: I graduated from university for some time now and yet I found myself quickly engrossed in the book's no-nonsense message on being a success in college (and life). I must have looked a bit crazy to those watching me read as I found myself saying \\"THANK YOU!\\" out loud when agreeing with a point and guffawing at Gunnar Fox's observations about the \\"care and feeding\\" of professors.This is not your dad's self-help book. Not with chapter titles like College: Get Over It, Making Them Eat Your Academic Dust and If You Don't Toot Your Own Horn, Ain't Nobody Gonna Toot it For You. Gunnar Fox somewhat reminds me of Tony Robbins for college students. He also reminds me of some of my best professors. Sometimes he also reminds me of Jay-Z. I know that sounds like a strange combination but that is the strength of this eclectic book. Again, this was not what we expected, despite the bold title.Gunnar Fox is alternately your best friend, an evangelist, a college roommate, your supportive dad, Jedi master and school counselor all rolled into one. He takes you down the rabbit hole of college preparation, getting into the university of your choice, through tunnels of useful tips and up pathways of practical strategies. You come out the other end as a successful college graduate.He doesn't stop there. He also hits students with advice about the importance of always being a decent person, how to handle conflict and how you should never step on people on the way up the success ladder.

I ended up reading it cover to cover in only 3 days (this was astonishing compared to my lame 20 page a day average for the rest of this summer).The book provides plenty of memorable directives in a straight forward manner. After the first hour of reading, I felt a great sense of motivation to pursue my studies and enjoy college. I'll be entering my second year at a great school, but Gunnar's advice couldn't have come at a better time. Although much of the information in the book is not new to me, the chapters unfold with urgency, frankness, and a tasteful humor.

But by the time they are seniors they have generally stopped listening to too much the adults around them are saying! This is where Kick Ass In College comes it. Gunnar Fox has found the way to write an invaluable, step by step guide to the whole process that will grab students' (and their parents') interest and keep them reading until the last page.In an easy to follow, engaging format Fox relates the success in college as the cornerstone for success in life. By addressing each aspect from why good grades really are important, to getting to know your professors to study habits and dealing with love, he covers all the nitty gritty of college life. Its emphasis on grades as a means to success in life after school give meaning and motivation to the structured study habits he describes in this book. The bold faced section headings and the Key Points as the chapter summaries give the readers the sign posts through out the book to follow and refer back to for information. The book manages to be extremely entertaining while giving seriously good suggestions and information.Kick Ass in College's excellent advice should be read by all college bound students and their parents. It will give our students the extra edge they need to be prepared both for life at college and a pathway to their future success. As college becomes an expectation for most students, schools are overwhelmed by No Child Left Behind requirements and parents themselves may never have a post secondary education, Gunnar Fox's book is a well needed dose of reality and information.This book should be the number one graduation gift for all graduating seniors. It is like giving each student a gift of his own personal, enjoyable academic coach with a great sense of humor to accompany him to college. What could be a better, more useful gift?Personal Note:I have never stepped outside of my role as a reviewer on line before but think I should now. As the mother of a high school senior and a junior, this book really struck a chord with me. I have given my copy to my senior who is finding it to be a fantastic view of her future with concrete, understandable advise she can follow. As a successful high school student it is very familiar to her. She is also enjoying the read!

But either way it was still an aspiring book! Not full of fluff like a lot of other help books, but actually filled with a lot of useful information and tips that not everyone's heard before.

Later, after he went to bed, I peaked in it because I was worried that maybe because of the tite (I'm a proper European lady of nearly 80) the contents may not have been appropriate.To my delight, I found out that I could not put it down either. I can truly say that I wished I had this kind of solid, useful, wonderfully-written advice in my days. I'm sure that students of any age and any educational background could greatly profit from its wisdom.I will certainly recommond it to my vast circle of friends and friends of friends. I was so inspired by this book that I nearly signed up for college courses again."},{"Title":"Kick Ass In College: A Guerrilla Guide To College Success","review":"I bought this book for my college-bound nephew based on the edgy sounding title.The advice covers topics I am fairly familiar with as a former graduate student (optimal study skills, goal setting, dealing with professors) and a person who has made it into my 40's in one piece (avoiding drug abuse, not drinking and driving, safe sex). But this book is so creative and convincing in discussing these topics that I actually read the whole book myself before giving it to my nephew. It is delivered in a witty and irreverent manner. The illustrations make the content extremely engaging. I also like the fact that the book emphasizes the right values - honesty, helpfulness and decency while not coming across as preachy. I actually found some of the sections (such as effective note taking, brain hacks to improve memory etc.) to be very relevant and useful in my day job.This book drives home the point that the kids who get straight A's in college are not necessarily more hard working or talented ... they are simply better organized and have a system. The author gives you what you need to have a realistic shot at being one of those college whiz kids. I would definitely read it if you are in college or thinking of going. Or gift it to someone at that stage in their life."},{"Title":"The Captain Must Die (Gold Medal 835)","review":"Having downloaded and read another book from Prologue Books, I am not surprised at the complaints regarding the OCR. The ridiculous thing is that a few minutes with a spellchecker would catch the worst errors.However, I do want to defend the book itself, which is quite good.I was fascinated to see that this book was in Ernest Hemingway's library--but of course, that doesn't mean he had read it. Who wants a library with nothing but books you've already read?I remember Colby mainly from his stories in the various Alfred Hitchcock anthologies, and years ago, I read his book \\"Murder Times Five\\", which I don't recall being as good as this one. This is a truly nasty tale of three ex-Servicemen who plan to rob and kill their Captain after 12 years. Why they have to wait 12 years, you'll have to read the book to find out, as I don't want to provide any spoilers. Colby effectively delivers the back story in segments as his focus shifts between the ex-Captain, now a wealthy businessman, his wife, and the three men who are out to get him. The focus of the story isn't on the plotting of the crimes, though these are detailed well enough, but on the thought processes of all the main characters. Colby delivers a lot of psychological explanations here - and many of them ring true, at least to someone of my stunted emotional development! This rather short book holds your attention throughout and delivers a hell of an ending. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Captain Must Die (Gold Medal 835)","review":"This is a much-ballyhooed pb original from the Golden Age. It's a smooth, professional job, as are most books from this era, but it doesn't match it's rep.It's plot is very similar to John D Macdonald's earlier THE EXECUTIONERS, though it's hard to say to what extent Macdonald influenced Colby. (They seem to have been published a year apart.) A \\"man in the Grey Flannel Suit\\" type, by all outward appearances very dull and normal, actually has a dangerous secret in his past, and this dangerous secret is now out to come and bite him.This is an interesting framework for a story, although neither book mentioned above really handles it that well. In both instances the bad guys are much more interesting than the good guy, and they don't shine any refracted light (ie, the good guy is not made more interesting by the fact that these bad guys want to kill him.) CAPTAIN also suffers from Colby's typical deaf-ear to psychology, with various characters turning around on a dime to act as the plot demands it. One might plead formula, but there were plenty of pb original writers who did much better with this.Worst of all, the bad guys have something of a point, and the \\"good guy\\" is somewhat at fault here. While his position is certainly defensible, it's not simply defensible. Yet Colby never really gets into the psychology of all this, never really complicates his case in interesting ways. Again, you can plead formula, or the times, but there were certainly writers out there who were unashamedly writing out rather aberrant psychology, so it's not a position I really buy. It feels to me instead rather like Wouk's THE CAINE MUTINY, ie Colby saw where his story was truly headed and got chicken about it.Not awful, and certain passages, particulary a sequence in which the bad guys are entertaining local whores, work very well. But a deeply overrated book, certainly second-tier."},{"Title":"The Captain Must Die (Gold Medal 835)","review":"I did enjoy the story, and was glad I only spent $.99 on the book, as the author did not proof read the story nor did he run a spell check to catch the many many misspelling and typographical errors.

The story line was interesting about revenge and even had a small subplot in which a man and wife are able to resolve their issues after several years. The story line itself was enjoyable, but the typos in this book detracted from the story. I found myself continuously fixing the typos in my mind as I was reading this book, and even had to re-read a section because the characters were confused (as to who was doing and saying what) at one point.

Maybe their copy was in Afrikaaner and it made more sense than it does in English. This book is an embarrassment and in some ways is nothing but a Marxist polemic against both the U.S. and various policies of the German government that the author does not like. I could forgive the weird phraseology, grammar, and word selection because obviously Mr. Niemeyer's English is still better than my German but why all of the commas in the middle of words and all the typos. This book is desperately in need of a translater and an editor. There is an incredible overuse of quotation marks just like my 10 year old does in his school reports, for example on page 70 - Nevertheless the \\"human rights warriors,\\" Schroder and Fischer, were doing everything to \\"help\\" the U.S. and \\"Blair petroleum\\" to bring \\"peace\\" to Afghanistan. If you like this sort of thing and compound words like Bush-Cheney-Rice-Laden-junta and neologisms like Bush's WoildWar you will love this book. I read the whole book and still don't know what the title has to do with the book contents. These contents are also an embarrassment. I at first found the sections on the current German political scene interesting but then realized if that part was as ludicrous as the discussion on the U.S. was, it was a waste of time to read it. In addition to the Bush-Cheney-Rice-Laden-junta conspiracy there are so many other conspiracies enumerated that it is surprising to me that the Rosicrucians and the Knights Templar were not invoked in the discussion. It is interesting that the reviewer below mentioned Michael Moore because while I was reading the book all I could think of was that much of the stuff in this book came right out of Fahrenheit 911. On further review I think that all the typos and lack of editing may have been an effort to rush the book into publication before all of the book's hypotheses were disproved by subsequent events such as bin Laden's claim to the 9/11 attacks in his videotape which disproves the book's claim that it was an entirely U.S. conspiracy. In summary if you like to sit and read Das Kapital while watching Fahrenheit 911 on a continuous loop than this book is for you. Otherwise run away as fast as you can."},{"Title":"Waiting for the New Fuhrer: The German Euro-Apartheied","review":"Having read this book by recommendation of a friend I was curious to know what was behind the title. At first, I thought the title was too provoking but when I finished reading &quot;Waiting for the new Fuehrer&quot; I was simply fascinated.

The flames that engulfed this prodigiously enclosed quadrangle on the night of January 22, 1959, gave rise to many and varied tales of legendary proportion on the parts of those having dwelled there.

In fact, I would argue that you would have to go back to Houseboat Days (1977), to find a comparable success in terms of Ashbery's ability to compress poetic experience into an accommodatingly resonant tension-field. With Ashbery's method there is always the danger that expansiveness contributes to fluctuating air-pockets in the poem's flight-path, and the reader's encounter with inconsistently sustained epics like Flow Chart is one of locating pivotal wobble in the stratosphere of Ashbery's poetics.Ashbery's lyric concerns are invariably with retrieving the moment from unrecorded notice. It's the transient nature of experience underscored by a deep sense of loss which fires Ashbery into attempting to arrest whatever proves meaningful to his impulsive plot. As he writes in 'The Improvement':\\"We never live long enough in our lives/ to know what today is like./ Shards, smiling beaches,/ abandon us somehow even as we converse with them./ And the leopard is transparent, like iced tea.\\"Ashbery's acute sense of being disinherited from the world of things, and the poem is an attempt to establish discourse with this aesthetic, has him incessantly preoccupied with chasing meaning out of assumed appearances. His way is to puzzle worry into potential existential crisis:\\"Nothing seems strong enough for/ this life to manage, that sees beyond/ into particles forming some kind of entity -/ So we get dressed kindly, crazy at the moment./ A life of afterwords begins.\\"('The Improvement')Ashbery's disorientated, upended approach to his subject matter imparts the feel of innovative modernism to his work. And while his poetry is personal by way of its predominantly quiet disclosures: 'I never get hangovers until late afternoon/ and then it's like a souvenir, an arrangement,' he is never confessional in the manner of Robert Lowell or Sylvia Plath. Ashbery's quiet presence permeates, but never crowds his lyrics. Some of the finest poems to be found in this collection, 'Works On Paper I,' 'Ghost Riders Of The Moon,' 'Free Nail Polish,' 'Local Time,' 'My Gold Chain' succeed by playing enigmatic narrative against specific visual imagery. In the best of Ashbery the abstract and the concrete unite to impart allusive mystery to the poem. The ending of 'Works On Paper I' perfectly demonstrates what Ashbery does best.\\"Those who wish to remain naked are coaxed out of laughter/ with tea and nobody's nose is to the grindstone/ anymore, I bet, and you can figure out these shivering trees./ But the owner of the bookstore know that the flea was blown/ out of all proportion,/ with September steps to go down in passing/ before the tremendous dogs are unleased.\\"Here the juxtaposition of the disarmingly casual and the lyrically authoritative combine to create Ashbery's inimitable tang of urbane poetry, a genre he orchestrates with consummate ease throughout this sparkling collection. If by comparison the long title poem suffers from a characteristic lack of focus, then the poem's obliqueness and obscurity are counterpointed by Ashbery's inexhaustibly pitched poetic eloquence.JEREMY REED"},{"Title":"And the Stars Were Shining.","review":"And the stars were shining seems to be a minor Ashberry's work, but don't be confused...a great poet is always great. This book is especially delightful. Ashberry plays with the dazed reader making a strange and confusing mixture of images and sounds (something like watching &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, by David Lynch), painting everything with his particular sense of humour and his vision of life. A bit flamboyant, but completely great. To miss it is a crime, as every vulgarity."},{"Title":"Lay sermons, addresses and reviews","review":"This collection is a very multifarious collection of essays by \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" Thomas Henry Huxley. Often, Huxley is wronly seen simply as one who simply defended Darwin and did not contribute much by way of originality. Such views are shown here to be mistaken, as we see Huxley the tireless champion of science education, Huxley the philosopher and, as the title suggests, Huxley the popularilzer.These essays were given to popular audiences, and are equal parts science, philosophy, and social argument.**The first five essays generally have to do with explainling how and why science is such a useful advance, and to arguing for science education as an integral part of a general educaiton in Britian. (Huxley was a great defender of science and a prime mover of getting science education into the British curriculum.)**The nex six essays were designed to give the public broad 'science lessons' (in the vein that Dawkins or other popular writers might today). Subjects range from zoology (essay VI) to geology (essays IX, X, and XI), and even to the sociological positivism of Auguste Compte (who you will find that Huxley was not at all fond of).** Essays XII and XIII are defences of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species.\\" Strangely, in reading these essays we find that the criticisms (and defenses) of 150 years ago are often the same as those today. Huxley defends Darwinian evolution from those who accuse him of teleological thinking, 'design theorists', and those who accuse evolution of being incapable of producing design if not by design (130 years before William Dembski!).The last essay (along with remarks made in several other essays) offers a good window into Huxley's view of materialism. Huxley was a materialist, but not in the way often described. On the one hand, Huxley certainly thought that the only way to find reliable knowledge was via science and sense-evidence. Huxley, though DID NOT believe that science could say, as anything better than faith, that nature was all there is. In this, the final essay (\\"On Descartes' 'Discourse Touching the Method of Using One's Reason Rightly and of Seeking Scientific Truth\\"), is a good segue into Huxley's \\"Agsnosticism\\" and \\"Evolution and Ethics.\\"All in all, this is a very good collection of essays that offer a sample of Huxley's wide variety of thoughts and opinions. Not only do we see Uuxley from many different angles (philosophical, scientific, political) but we also see his strangths as a writer; these popular essays are very well written and examples of clear expression.Good collection for any Huxley fan.(The only warning I have is that the table of contents at the beginning of this collection are not \\"hyperlinked,\\" so one must scoll through the entire book to get to any particluar essay.)"},{"Title":"Run For The Wall: Remembering Vietnam on a Motorcycle Pilgrimage","review":"Excellent book! If you are thinking about joining those who make the journey to the wall for the first time, I suggest you get the book and read it, besides the forums on the \\"RUN FOR THE WALL\\", this book gives a outsiders view of the ride, these authors did a great job by STICKING to the actual working of the ride, something that is very important for the reason of the mission every year."},{"Title":"Run For The Wall: Remembering Vietnam on a Motorcycle Pilgrimage","review":"The authors rode Run For The Wall 3 years in a row, the first year to participate, the 2nd for perspective, comparing 1st and 2nd Run, then the third with a book in mind, getting to know riders and leadership, interviewing and transparently documenting their experience.Whether you protested during the Vietnam War, served in the military or left the country, Run For The Wall, is a book to read. It was published in 2001, but reading it 10 years later is even more poignant, because the authors foresaw the future of the Run, and all things considered what they predicted, fell into place.Some features of the book are the day to day riding details. The children at the Rainelle Elementary School, the support at the Wall that riders show each other, the leadership techniques, snags, turmoils and the incredible ability to pull off the event one more time considering.

As before, Penman weaves more than one story line throughout the narrative. A delightful book; don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"Having read rave reviews of Penman's historical fiction, I picked up this book for a buck just to sample her work. I was disappointed and hoping that the two longer historical novels of hers that I've bought live up to their glowing reviews. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the wonderful medieval mysteries by Ariana Franklin, but I found this one a little lame. The main character, Justin de Quincy, seemed mildly charming and affable; maybe an Ashton Kutcher could play him in the movie. But I found it annoying that there were two separate story lines -- Justin's investigation of the murder of a poor Welsh girl and his mission as the Eleanor of Aquitane's \\"the Queen's man\\" -- with no real connection between the two. I'm no historian, but I did not get the feeling of authenticity of dialogue and speech patterns that I love in Franklin's novels. Maybe American writers just can't pull this off."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"From That's All She Read http://allsheread.blogspot.com .This is the sequel to The Queen's Man, reviewed here recently. This mystery has some great conceits but I am afraid it just did not grab me. As terrific a historical novelist as Penman is, I am just not impressed with her mysteries. I do, however, like what she says in the author's note of this one, that as long as she can write about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her tempestuous brood she is happy. I can dig it.It is a matter of days since the end of the last novel. Richard Lionheart has been found. Queen Eleanor is worrying over what Prince John is up to still, and part of this novel concerns the Queen's man, Justin de Quincy, having to infiltrate Windsor Castle where John is under siege to convince him his mommy really does care for him and won't he please make nice? The main story is either the afterthought or this is, as they are only related in slim thematic way. The real story is the murder of a fifteen year old Welsh girl in a churchyard. Two men are suspected, both sons of a mercer, one the golden boy and the other the sulky inept one... and you may have picked up on that thematic connection already... see below if not. One plus of these mysteries is that you see Justin coming to grips with and internalizing some of the dirty tricks bound to leak from dealings with John. For much of the mystery solving, Justin is sure the murderer is not who it actually turns out to be. This is another equivocal success for Justin, where the solution to the crime is not at all the satisfying conclusion he hopes for.. and you do too. I was surprised that one seeming major clue turned out to be unrelated to the crime.. was that a successful red herring or just a faux pas on the author's part? My only hint it is that it involves a rock and a slingshot.There are a couple neat little conceits in this one, as I mentioned above. There is a clear parallel between the two mercer's sons and Richard and John, the handsome elder son getting all the breaks and the younger simply misunderstood and mistreated. In addition, the unwanted pregnancy theme, which in Justin's case seems o0dd since he is so bent out of shape over his own being a bastard. The least he could do is give his dad the benefit of the doubt after joining the club.This is the novel I wrote the post on Nan Hawthorne's Booking the Middle Ages about concerning clever metaphors. Penman is quite adept at atmospheric metaphors, but the one that stopped me dead, the self-shredding cabbage that is, should have been picked up by an editor.I have already read The Prince of Darkness and reviewed it here. I will find out soon enough if there is a fourth in this series. I read pretty much any novel not about a Tudor.. and I read most of those too.. so I will no doubt read a fourth Justin if it comes in its little green box."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"\\"Cruel as the grave\\" as well as \\"the queen's man\\" are mysteries you find the answer before the end of the book. They are easy and fast reading historical mysteries.I highly recommend Dorothy Dunnett, \\"The house of Niccolo\\" and then (not before) the \\"Chronicle of Lymond\\".Of course, one shall also read \\"The name of the rose\\" (Umberto Ecco)."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"No this is not the same quality of novel as Penman's brilliant historical fiction. But this is also 200 pages and a mystery. I think the other reviewers are comparing apples and oranges and unfairly judging this book. This is remarkably better than The Queen's Man. I must admit I did not solve that mystery, but neither did the author. The ending of that book was a cheap way out of a knot into which the story had been wound. This book was much more logical. The clues where there and although I had early suspiscions of the ultimate culprit, it kept me intersted to the end. The mystery in this case evolves separately from the intrigue at court - so there are really two simultaneous situations for Justin to juggle. It is NOT 1000 pages of brilliant fiction - but it is a fun, quick-read mystery set in 1193. Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"The first novel I read of Sharon Kay Penman took me less than a week to complete. It was well over a thousand pages and I had finals in graduate school, but I couldn't put it down. Cruel of the Grave is not the same caliber of book. Penman's gift of developing characters and a storyline that readers feel intimately involved with is not established in this text. I have read all of her historical novels. After reading each novel I anxiously waited for the next to be published. Penman's talent clearly lies within her ability to write amazing medieval novels, not medieval mysteries."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"Although the Justin de Quincy series does not equal Penman's supurb historical novels (especially Here be Dragons, Falls the Shadow, and The Reckoning) and The Queen's Man is the better mystery of the two that have appeared so far, Cruel As the Grave is nevertheless enjoyable and Penman's gift for characterization is strongly evident here, as in all her novels."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"Penman's books are not the ones to appeal to those who look for the fantasy of the Middle Ages, with knights that rush to rescue fair maidens. Nary a dragon, either. But her historical research is deep and broad and her mysteries are true to the genre. In short, this is a good choice for people who are looking for historical mysteries, but not \\"historical fiction,\\" or romance."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"This is another wonderful novel by this author, if you really like historical novels then she is the one to read. All the details and description necessary to visually visit this period of time (medieval England) and become captive of the players as she spins one intrigue after another. Justin is the lead in this and is what every man should be, just, loyal, compassionate as he leads you through the mystery created. Completely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"Not sure why some of the reviews were so critical. These were not meant to be the epic,long novels that she has written previously. I think stretching herself into mystery writing while keeping it in the same time period was an admirable move. They are rich with detail and Justin de Quincy is completely out of her imagination. I personally adore the character and I like these books. More light reading when you need a break from the large volumes of historical fiction I usually read."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"Sharon Kay Penman is, I think, one of if not the best writer of historically based, honest, historical fiction living today. Her several series about the Plantagenets, all huge but engrossing, are all worth reading for those who love historical fiction and also want the truth.Her other, smaller series (smaller in both length of books and number of books) are the historical mystery series which Penman emphasizes ARE not as historically accurate as her others. The main characters: Eleanor of Aquitaine, John Count of Mortain, her youngest son, and Richard the LionHearted, King of England and many others, as well as the basic plot outline and setting are based truthfully and historically but for the first time her main character and some others are fictional. In her afterwards she clarifies \\"who is who and what is what\\" which not all authors (I'm thinking of some major best selling authors) do not.Not to give away any plots, but the main character is 21 year old Justin de Quincy, a young man with an interesting background, who is a fictional character, and who through a series of accidents and coincidences in the first De Quincy book, \\"The Queen's Man\\" becomes a spy or secret agent for Queen Eleanor. All the following books have that as the main focus, as Justin is sent on various dangerous trips or projects for the Queen of England. At this point in time King Richard the LionHearted IS in captivity, held by his enemies. His younger brother John is one of those, as he of course (and true to history) wants his brother's crown. Justin de Quincy's travels and the various mysteries have to do with his trying to help the Queen, as asked, to save her favorite son, Richard.No, these are not great books, and Penman is more a Historical Fiction than a true mystery author, but she is a good writer, and I enjoyed all the DeQuincy books so far.So far they are, in order (which is how they should be read):\\"The Queen's Man\\"The Queen's Man: A Medieval Mystery (Medieval Mysteries)\\"Cruel as the Grave\\"Cruel as the Grave\\"Dragon's Lair\\"Dragon's Lair (Ballantine Reader's Circle)\\"Prince of Darkness\\"Prince of Darkness (A Medieval Mystery)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Her historical fiction which is, indeed, very accurate (each book is given an afterward to clarify any concerns of the reader)-------See theAre (and again, need to be read in order)can be found on the Sharon Kay Penman \\"page\\" or may be easier to Google to get the right order. The order you should look for is the YEAR in which the book takes place; NOT the year Penman wrote it. She goes from the 1100's to the 1400's, so, obviously, there are changes in main characters, the major events, wars, and so on.....Essentially there are two or three trilogies in the \\"Historical Fiction\\" books, which are all quite lengthy, but really worth it. to those who love history and want to read well written, lively books."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"My son has finished the book and told me that it was a really great story! He enjoyed the story, did not have to be bugged to keep reading and loved the ending. I was suprised since this was a required book by his school for summer reading so read it!"},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"If you love Sharon Kay Penman from her great historical novels such as Sunne in Splendor (as I do), don't expect the same quality out of this shlock book of medieval mystery. Her characters are bland and uninteresting, the treatment of the real medieval world seems less real than even the best fantasy novels out there, and the plot is not grabbing at all. I think she is trying to capitalize on the Cadfael craze by cranking out (easy-to-write) mystery novels that don't take nearly the effort or research that her historical novels do. If you want to read a GREAT book, do yourself a favor and pass this one by in favor of Sunne in Splendor."},{"Title":"Cruel as the Grave","review":"To my mind being a voracious reader I love a good medieval mystery these stories come alive under Sharon Kay Penman to my mind the best of the best. This incredible author makes you feel you are there and that you know her characters. You can't go wrong with one of her books."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years' War","review":"This is a unique work as it doesn't focus on the complex political struggles of the time, or on the generals and battles. The focus here is on a social level. The life of the soldier and his day to day existence in the camp, the songs, poetry and literature that developed around the war, and interaction-usually violent-between peasant and soldier. Much of this book is quite sad as it reveals the harshness and cruelty of life in this time made more miserable by endless war. The book is filled with contemporary prints as well as museum photos of a artifacts from the period.Military history buffs might also find the section on the Tyrolean peasant rebellion of interest. I have come across no other English language source that gives as much info on this sub-conflict."},{"Title":"The Thirty Years' War","review":"Printed in Communist East Germany, this book has the required \\"bourgeois\\" terminology and lacks chronological organization. The German is translated into English awkwardly with the cumbersome Bismarckian style. But particularly frustrating is the failure to define which groups are Protestant and which Catholic. The composition of the \\"Estates\\" is unclear."},{"Title":"The Authentic Librettos of the French and German Operas","review":"Includes \\"music of the principal airs.\\" Libretto is in English and either German or French.

(and on another note, my mom wouldnt let me see this movie, but everytime the story of adam walsh came on i was forced to watch it until i became so paranoid as to step outside! this reasoning of my mothers continued; including not letting me see smashing pumpkins but letting me see nine inch nails with marilyn manson 3 months later!)anyhow, find this book. its worth it."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"will definetly be doing business again with this company. books arrived on time (before expected date) and in the promised condition. i recommend people tp do business with this company."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I had read \\"Alex The Life Of A Child\\" and at times could imagine where Alex may have been were she alive today, especially as of late I couldn't help but see her in my mind's eye as one who may have kept *very* abreast of current events and knowing the sort of dreams she had, she would be at anti- war protests carrying signs reading \\"FIGHT CYSTIC FIBROSIS NOT IRAQ,\\" for she would have wanted war on afflictions of that sort rather than on Middle Eastern countries.Had read the book and found Alexandra Deford seemed to show a lifetime of gutsiness and true grit in dealing with things such as her affliction in just 8 short years."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"AlexThe author, Frank Deford, writes about his daughter's life. A young innocent girl at the age of eight realizes she has a disease called Cystic Fibrosis. This disease is the number one child killer. Alex passes away in 1980 at eight years old. Reading this book made me more grateful towards life. What I like most about this book is the way Deford makes a picture clear in our minds as we read along. Frank Deford talks mostly about his relationship with Alex, although the brother \\"Chrish\\" (Chris) is mentioned often and her mother is not. Alex passes away early in the book; therefore the book is made up of mostly stories that happen to Alex and between her family. The stories that Deford writes are mostly sad, others boring, and even some funny. I thought it was kind of odd that he didn't refer to his wife or Alex's mother a lot, being the other parent. I would recommend this book to parents, but not to 18-year-old boys like myself who enjoy books that keep you at the edge of your seat.~ Nate"},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I thought this was a very sad and moving book-- but I found something that Frank Deford said toward the end to be a bit odd. When he and his wife discuss adopting another child after Alex dies, he says \\"we could probably never get one in the States.\\" That's probably not true-- though their reason for later adopting internationally is a very meaningful one, the Defords were a financially comfortable, seemingly stable family who would probably have had little trouble obtaining a child from an adoption agency (or privately, through an attorney) in 1980."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"You can read other reviews about this book. It's a very well-written, thoughtful, loving recount of the life and slow death of a beloved daughter.My comment is to let you know that if you buy this book for the Kindle, you are NOT allowed to resell it. Apparently 'Amazon Customer Support' says this 'violates' copyright law, but that is a blatant LIE.Once you buy a book in ANY form you OWN IT. If Amazon is not letting you resell it, they are STEALING YOUR RIGHT to sell what you OWN. You cannot transfer ownership of the e-book to another Kindle owner, only if that Kindle owner is in your family. In other words, Amazon is in fact telling you that you DO NOT own the book you BOUGHT. Can you see what will happen in the future?If you lose your kindle or it breaks, you will HAVE to buy another Kindle in order to read one of your e-books again. You cannot share your books with others as you do with your paper books.BTW, the KINDLE that I own is starting to BURN IN... that's right! Text is starting to show on the screen even when the kindle is turned OFF. You see what that means! I paid 360 bucks for the original kindle, and even though they dropped the price to US$299 for a new Kindle, here it is, less than a YEAR after I bought the original Kindle and the screen has shadow text on it. How long before I cannot read anything on the kindle? Wanna guess.DO NOT BUY A KINDLE!

It absolutely broke my heart. When I was in high school and I met my first husband, I found out that he had lost a stepbrother to cystic fibrosis, who made it to the age of 18 before he died. Years later, my first husband still had the things Scotty willed to him, a poster and all of his Weird Al tapes (the Make a Wish Foundation helped Scotty to meet Weird Al at a concert and got to go backstage, shortly before he died). His remaining stepbrother, shortly after we married, married a woman with three children. Her youngest, a daughter, had severe CF. We loved her dearly, and was devastated when she died, like Alex, at the age of 8.This is a heartbreaking book, but it's worth it. After you're done reading the book, donate money to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.Another heartbreaking story on their site explains why they use roses on a lot of their promotional materials. A mother on the Board of Directors who had several kids with cystic fibrosis, was overheard by her toddler son on a phone call. He was too young to understand what she was saying, and too young to know he had a fatal disease, so he asked his mother what \\"sixty-five roses\\" meant. Many children now call CF \\"sixty five roses\\" and that's why the CF Foundation uses rose imagery."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"After supporting Cystic Fibrosis as one of my personal charities for many years, I saw this book in a used book store and bought it. I didn't read it for some time. In fact, it was after I met a family who had a son with CF. I became friends with him - and only a few months later, close to his 21st birthday, he was gone. Then I read the book.. I must say, this is a heartbreaker - but Alex is such an amazing young girl! Written from the experiences of a father watching this terrible disease take his little girl. I strongly recommend reading - and then reaching out to your local Cystic Fibrosis Chapter."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"&quot;Alex&quot; is one of the most touching books ever written - the author's honesty force the reader to confront his own beliefs and perspective.

Alex was an extraordinary little girl, and she's a prime example of what real courage and pure love is. I've read the book several times, and I feel for the whole family. Not only did it make me realize how lucky I am to be healthy, but it also proved how heartless and sad our world is becoming. Alex, at the innocent age of 8, knowing she was dying from CF, still maintained the courage and hope few people in this world (even HEALTHY people) seem to possess. She was a remarkable little girl, and I look forward to meeting her in heaven. It is impossible to read this book and feel as if you haven't changed.

I still can't describe what I feel when I read it- the sense of loss mixes with my pride for Alex. When I look at her picture on the cover my throat closes up- and then I imagine what her family must feel like. Death is not the end, but sometimes it is just too much. The ironic thing is that once you are dead, the pain experienced doesn't seem to matter as much as the love that was lived and the growth that took place.I know this was long, but I just finished reading the book over again and I had the same intense feelings I have always gotten from it.

Deford somehow manages to show how devasting cystic fibrosis was to his daughter, how it sapped her energy and stole so much normalcy from her life. At the same time, he shows how Alex Deford's spirit remained shining so much of the time, serving as an inspiration to those who loved her and who were forced to bear witness as the disease invaded her body. This book pierced my heart and soul and showed me the power of Alex's spirit - and the enduring love of her father. Few writers are as riveting to read as Frank Deford."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I am perhaps overly sensitive, but there were very few chapters in this book that I managed to read without breaking down and sobbing. Being familiar with Deford's voice from his NPR commentaries makes it all the worse, because as I read it, I heard it narrated in his voice, which made it all the more personal.I had some vague conception of cystic fibrosis before reading this, but no idea just how horrible it really is. The book is written in a very conversational style. Mr. Deford is to be commended for his openness about the full range of emotions he experienced throughout the nine years of his daughter's life.The book is quite short, which turns out to be a mercy. It is one of the best books I have read, but I can't imagine having to read it again."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I can't read this book without crying. Even writing this, I'm using two Kleenexes and a free hand.Frank Deford has my utmost respect for having survived Alex's death. No parent who loses a child ever recovers; &quot;healing&quot; and &quot;closure&quot; are insipid terms that people who've never suffered that loss use to try to cope on behalf of friends or family. Truth is, more couples separate over the death of a child than stay together. Many parents withdraw into depression, or suicide, after the death of a child, especially a small one.But instead of just surviving, which God knows he and his family were entitled to do, Frank Deford wrote this beautiful tribute to Alex. It is marvelous. Alex lives in this book, and when she dies there is a grace to Deford's prose that evokes the presence that used to be. A sweet, stubborn, keenly intelligent and high-spirited little girl, Alex is a surprise on every page. How could anyone have lived with a child that alert to her fate, and so determined to face it on her terms, and not gained strength from her?I can't tell Alex's story better than her father did, so find the book and read it. If the death of a child saddens you, then remember: the book is not about her death, but her life and how she lived it."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I would like to thank Frank Deford for his bravery in sharing his beautiful daughter with the world. I cannot begin to say how much she has touched my life. They say there are angels masquerading as people here on earth. If this is true then Alexandra was definitely one of them. I first got to know her through the TV movie about her life. Her light was so bright it was nearly blinding. She grabbed my heart and never let go. Since then I have read her story several times. Because of her inspiration, I have, for the last 10 years, done charity walks for the disease. In hopes that some day children like her won't have to suffer. In hopes that someday her wish will come true. I feel blessed to have even a small piece of her and her inspiring, courageous life. She touched many in life and continues to do so even in death. I hope one day to have a daughter with a spirit as bright as the one within Alex. And in her memory, her beautiful name as well. Thank you Alex."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"Frank Deford lovingly recounts the brief life of his precious daughter, Alex as she battles Cystic Fibrosis. Not only is this a loving biography of a child, it gives a perspective of what it is like to have a child with special medical needs, who ultimately dies. It isn't just the patient who must deal with the disease, but the whole family. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who either know a family who has a special needs child or who works with children in any capacity."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I first learned about Alex Deford in the ABC made-for-tv movie, and was immediately touched. Having always been a fan of Frank Deford's sports writing, I knew this book could be nothing less than sensational. And I was correct.Alex Deford was a strong little girl that was stricken with a terrible disease, and eventually taken from this earth way too early. In this book, Deford recalls her inspiring story, as well as giving us a look into his own life. He is straightforward and ultimately candid about the trials and pains that young Alex had to endure. Through her remarkable story, we learn a great deal about her, and it forces us to look upon each of our own inner strengths.The book flows really well, and Deford does an incredible job of mingling his own story into Alex's. I really enjoyed the way he included other children's letters and personal thoughts, and not correcting their spelling was a great touch.This book was a joy to read. I thank Mr. Deford for opening my eyes to this horrible disease, and just allowing me to get to know Alex Deford and what she was all about. It was a true pleasure, and I urge all of you to please read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"This story touched my heart.

Frank DeFord does a beautiful job paying tribute to his late daughter and conveying the struggle that cystic fibrosis put his family through. Along with explaining all of the technical aspects of the disease, he really opens up and tells readers exactly what it is like to have and live with a dying child. Throughout his book, I almost felt as though I were right there next to him, sharing his grief and anguish over his charming daughter's illness. This book reaffirmed my belief that childhood diseases must be cured - Alex was a special child who would have grown and done marvelous things in her life had she not been born with a deadly genetic disease. In my opinion, Frank DeFord's book is the finest ever written on cystic fibrosis."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I was 12 or 13 when I first saw the movie &quot;Alex: the life of a child&quot; on T.V., but to this day...

Recently, Alex has popped into my head for more than a few reasons. My 4 year old daughter has had chronic bronchial infections since birth. Every doctor that she's seen has diagnosed something different. Today, we were told that she has all of the symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis. In an effort to research data on Cystic Fibrosis, the first title that popped up on my screen read &quot;Alex: The Life of a Child&quot;. Tears flooded my eyes as I, again, recalled what that little girl went through. I can only pray that my own daughter's results come back negative.

I am 15 and this book is probably the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"My daughter was diagnosed with CF 4 months ago at the age of 2.5 yrs. I was immediately drawn to books written from the parent perspective (it seems most are written by young adults who have it), and I first read \\"From a Taste of Salt\\" and then \\"Alex\\".I mostly loved this book; I love how well Deford delves into the psychological aspects (of ALL the family) of having a child in the house with this disease. I can easily picture in my dealings with my own daughter many of the conversations with Alex he relates.There are two things I disliked. One is that he really over-makes Alex to be a saint. Everyone says my daughter is so sweet and so good at taking her medicines and therapy and yadda yadda, but would you ever say the OPPOSITE to a parent with a sick child? My daughter is still a toddler and no saint, but Deford leaves out most of the day-to-day \\"normal\\" parts of her life that would show her regular humanity instead of her sainthood.Secondly, It became obvious at times that Deford was, unfortunately, projecting some of his own thoughts, feelings, and memories onto Alex's actions. I do not blame him for this one bit, considering the great devistation it is to lose a child and then try to write about it. But for some reason it really annoyed me.Overall an excellent book, and I recommend it to any parent with a newly diagnosed child struggling through the emotional and psychological steps of accepting CF. You find out that you are not alone in your many confusing thoughts. I only wish he had perhaps been a more religious man, and touched on the acceptance of this disease from God."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I was emotionally overwhelmed by this book. It is a heartbreaking story - I had no idea that Cystic Fibrosis was such a completely devastating disease.It was an honour to learn about Alex's life. Her selflessnes, courage and utter dignity and grace in the face of CF is truly inspiring. The fact that in all the photos in the book she is either laughing or smiling radiantly speaks to her powerful inner spirit.No book has ever had a stronger impact on me. I'd like to think I'm going to lead my life a little differently because of what this book taught me."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"excellent service. book received in excellent condition, just as described. would definitely order through bookrescue again."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I think every parent's nightmare is to lose a child, but Frank Deford points out what it would be like if Alex had never been a part of their lives. What a beautiful child with an ugly disease. This is not a tear-jerker you will actually grieve the Defords, as they watch Alex fade away painfully, but leave them with important joy, gifts and unshakable memories along the way. It is an important book to read."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I recently read this book for an assignment in a Special Education class. It tells the tragic, yet beautiful story of a true American family struggling with the effects of cystic fibrosis. I had a very limited knowledge of CF, but this book filled in the important details that many don't see-the all emcompassing effects-how the family feels as well as how the suffering child (Alex) feels. This is the 2nd of three books I have had to read as an educator taking advanced classes, and I am grateful for the opportunity I had to read it, learn from it, and experience the all too often forgotten \\"real life\\" of a beautiful child."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I just recently read the book. It was very touching and also made me cry often. If you can try to track down the made for t.v.movie that aired back in 1986; I was just 9 years old when I saw the movie and it touched me in a way I can not explain. I have NEVER forgotten the movie and is rare to find but well worth the search. Google the title and go to CF website they can send you a copy, some are only loned out. The movie probably shouldn't be viewed by kids as I did, it shows great detail of pain and suffering."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"This is sincerely the most memorable book I have ever read. I first read this book after seeing the television movie, 17 years ago! I was only eleven at the time, maybe that is why I was so touched. I wasn't much older than Alex had been and could relate to her at some level. Mr. Deford did an excellent job at presenting his daughters life, not just her illness. Alex was more full of joy and life than most adults are. She is truley an inspiration person who deserves to be immortalized, and this book does just that. Anyone who reads this will be deeply touched. Have a box of Kleenex handy!"},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I really love this book.I will give it totally 5 thumbs up,and above.This book is very great,I cant put ti better then that.

Alex will always be my hero. I feel for the family but I feel mostly sad for Chris. Like Alex understood he would be all alone without a brother or a sister. For the person who wrote a review on Feb.7 1999 you can get Alex's story from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation webpage under publications. For all of you out there read the book it will definitely change your life. Thank you Mr. Deford for writing about your courageous little girl. And theank you Alex for just being you."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"Alexandra Miller Deford was born on October 30, 1971. She died on January 19, 1980, sitting straight up and eyes wide open, with her parents, Carol and Frank at her side. Her life was taken by a genetic disorder, Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an incurable monster that ravaged her body and took everything from her except her amazing influence on others and the gut-wrenching story of her life.Alex: The Life of a Child was written by her father, and published in 1983. I have not read any other books or articles by Frank Deford; however, my guess is that this is the most poignant story he has every told.As a frail baby, when Alex was diagnosed with CF, she was not expected to live more than 5 months, but she was a fighter who struggled to be as normal as possible, never using her disorder as an excuse for not participating. Many of her childhood friends were influenced by Alex and are practicing the field of healthcare. Over the years this book has been used in schools to educate children as young as 10 years old. Having never met her, other people inspired by this book or the movie, visit her grave site and have joined the plight seeking a cure for CF.According to my research, CF is primarily a disease that is much more prevalent with Caucasians and \\"over 90% of the affected infants now survive beyond one year.\\"Studies show \\"the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has been increasing over the past 40 years. Life expectancy of individuals with adequate pancreatic function can be more than 50 years.\\"Alex lived, loved and set an example for the ages. She was a poster child for CF. She was an angel of a daughter. Her brother, Christopher was her idol. More than anything she wanted to live and be free of CF. She worried about the impact of her death upon her loved ones.She lives on in the hearts and minds of those who know her story. Alex would be 41 now, had she survived, yet she will forever be the brave little girl who lives in the pages of this unforgettable story told by her father in a manner that will squeeze your heartstrings and make your eyes moist and glisten with sadness, joy and awe.Celebrate and enjoy the life of an angel!"},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I first discovered this story in the December 1984 Reader's Digest in the featured book section. Even abbreviated, it was staggering. I saw the TV film later on, and still later, I found and bought the whole book. Since then, few January 19th's, the anniversary of her death, have passed that I have not thought of Alex and the family she left behind. I might do her memory more justice if I remembered her birthday instead, but her father did not write of her birth the way he did of her death.Frank Deford is an excellent and prolific writer of both fact and fiction and who makes personal to the reader every event he shares of Alex's life and death. Especially her death. Perhaps he didn't mean to make her death more poignant than her life, but it would be impossible to play it down. He paints nearly every hour of that last day of her life so vividly that I wondered if he was taking notes as it happened; he did, after all, keep a personal journal (no, I don't believe that he kept a notebook by the side of his dying baby's bed, only that he wrote it in such detail that it was as if he had done so.) These days, most people who die of lengthy, drawn-out illnesses die peacefully, only semi-conscious, doped up to the gills against unbearable pain. But though Alex might have been in pain, death did not take her peacefully. She didn't fight it, but neither did she go quietly. She was awake and aware to the very last second of her short life. As he said, she had spent so much of her little life dying that she wasn't about to miss the final act when it came. It was difficult enough to read when I wasn't yet a parent. It became even more meaningful after I became a parent. And then still more, when my daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumor.Alex's story made me aware of cystic fibrosis, to the point that I felt compelled, once I was gainfully employed, to begin contributing a few dimes a year to the CF Foundation. It's never been very much, but neither has the foundation ever returned an uncancelled check to me claiming it was too little to accept.Other parts of the story make strong impressions, such as her ability to act and mimic anything she saw on a TV or movie screen; she could have been an actress, or maybe a dancer, as she loved to twirl around with grace and energy, \\"imaginating\\" a world in which no one suffered pain or death or had to do therapy. The deep and serious discussions with people outside of her family circle regarding death, God and Heaven and her love of jokes and humor and silliness. Her obsession with beauty and jewelry, and the outrageous insensitivity with which she was treated several times by cold and heartless doctors. Fortunately, I can say that today, through my own experience with doctors and hospitals, the medical staff in the pediatric departments treat their young patients with great respect and compassion.We could wish that ALL types of childhood ailments were written about as beautifully. There are other illnesses and disabilities that are just as deadly. He states at one point that \\"some diseases, even some fatal ones, don't put too many demands on the family of the patient.\\" I felt like that wasn't quite a fair statement. If a loved one has a disease, particularly a potentially fatal disease to one's child, the demands of just living day to day with the knowledge that you will never be able to take for granted your child's good health is a pretty difficult burden to carry, not to mention the 'round-the-clock effort devoted to simply making the child comfortable. I do hope that I'm mistaken in his meaning of that statement. I can't imagine he would truly intend to dismiss other fatal illnesses children suffer as being easier to deal with.But then really, this story isn't really about sick children. It's not even about cystic fibrosis; it is about Alex, and there is only ONE Alex Deford. I know that there is, as he says, no value in losing your child. You don't gain anything meaningful from it. But because the rest of us have had the good fortune to stumble onto his story of Alex, many, many thousands of others have found meaning in their own lives as a result of Alex's life, however brief it was. The CF Foundation has also benefited. So, thank you Alex, for living, and thank you, Frank Deford, for sharing your daughter with the rest of us."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I read this book over 25 years ago, not long after it was released, and it has \\"stayed\\" with me ever since.

This book will teach you how to keep a more positive attuide by telling the courage Alex had up until the last day of her life. She died at a young age, but the inpact she had on others life will not soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"Alex the Life of a Child is a haeartwarming story of a little girl's battle against cystic fibrosis. Alex was loved and loved more than someone who lived to be a hundred. Her entire being was love. She never worried about herself, but for the people she loved. She was a treasure to her friends and family and to anyone who read her courageous story. Alex lived a life of inspiration and she was a gift from God who died to young, but she is with God and is watching over her parents and her &quot;Chrish,&quot; her little brother whom she always called by this name. She is their guardian angel. The most touching passage to me is that when she was ready for an opperation to help clear her lungs, her father layed her down on the operating table, a tear fell down his cheeks and she told them to wait and she wiped that tear off his cheek. She said, &quot;I am so sorry my little daddy.&quot; That was the little angel she was, one who could not stand to see her family suffer from her disease and for some time before she knew she was going to die, but she did not want to upset them. She tried with all her might to try to never uspet them, they meant everything to her and she was so terrified for them. She always tried to help them with their grief and at times give them the room when they needed to cry alone. Her father Frank tried to cry alone because he did not want to upset his little baby girl. If Alex saw him cry, he would always whisper something to make her feel better. Then, he would just hold her and cry, his heart was breaking, he had to watch his little daughter slowly die and suffer unthinkable pain. Sometimes she would cry too and she would just hold on to him and she would cry with him. She knew that she would die and it broke her heart and not for herself, but for them, always them. Frank Deford writes a heartwarming story about the love he felt for his daughter and the courage she had facing death. This book will make you smile, make you laugh, and make you cry, but it is more than worth reading it, it touches you unspeakably and gives you courage and faith. Alex was a heroic girl whose story you will never forget and woll touch you forever."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"I thought this book was beautiful. I found it at our church thrift shop, and I wanted to read it because I know a girl who has CF. I asked my mom to buy it for me and Im happy she did. I became so sad that one day, after being sad about Alex's death for the whole day, I jumped on my bed and started crying. I'm happy to know about Alex, who she was, how she dealt with her disease. And when you read it you read it from the father's point of view. It must have been very painful for him to recall all the pain he and his family and Alex went through. For a time I was angry and sad that she died at eight, but I'm happy she lived at all.During her short lifetime she touched the hearts of many and inspired many. I wished I could have known her. I'm a sixteen-year-old girl and in October of 1998 I was diagnosed with a rare case and an unusual form of ovarian cancer. Since then I've had surgery, chemotherapy, a stem-cell transplant, and I will be having radiation. I'm doing very well and we're all hopeful. We've been getting tons of prayers and I think I'm going to be alright in the end. And I'm going to fight this cancer every step of the way. When I learned I was sick I wanted to be like Alex. I wanted to deal with my illness the way she dealt with hers. She's an inspiration, not only to sick people but to anyone who has or has had to fight a serious battle in their lives. To anyone who wants to conquer something, to anyone who wants to be strong, to anyone who wants to overcome the odds, to anyone who wants to hold on to hope in times of great despair, to anyone who wants to turn their life around, to anyone who refuses to give up... this is the book for them. And for a parent with a sick child, they might want to read this book. I thank Mr. Deford for writing about his wonderful, beautiful little girl. It is a sad book, yet it a story about hope in a time of despair and about a family loving each other and staying with each other until the very end. I've wanted to know where the Deford family lives now and how they are. I've also wished I could have known Alex, because i love children and I just wanted to hug her and hold her and play with her. This wonderful little girl has been a gift from God and I think her purpose in life was to live her life and deal with her illness as she did so her father could write it down and share it with us and inspire and touch us all. And, by reading it, you do know Alex, and her family, in a way. I still kind of wish I could meet the Defords and tell them how I fell in love with their little girl. She was very brave and very mature for a girl of eight years. And very loving. It seemed to me she was an angel who could do no wrong. She must have been very close to God, and He must have been very close to her, too. And it had to have been hard for God to watch one of his children suffer like Alex did. God didnt want Alex to have CF, of course. But we've all been blessed by God for having Alex here on this Earth with us, even for a short time. I lent this book to a friend of mine, who also knows the girl whom I know who has CF. One of my sister's friends has read it, too. I'd like to see the movie. I'd like them to show it on television again or put it out on video. I might also like to write to the Defords and tell them how I was touched by their little girl. When I look at Alex's picture on the cover of the book, I think &quot;She was so beautiful,&quot; When I deal with my illness, or when I know someone whos very sick, I'll think about and remember Alex and tell them about her. And I'm glad I've finally found a place that knows about her besides me. I believe that Alex has a place in my heart, and she always will. And Alex would be happy to know they're making so many advances in treating CF. Perhaps someday they might just find a cure. I think the Defords would be very glad and proud to know their little girl has touched so many people's hearts. If you read this, you will love Alex and be amazed at how she dealt with her disease. You will probably never forget Alex nor reading this insirational, moving, truly beautiful story."},{"Title":"Alex, the Life of a Child","review":"This book has to be one of the best books ever written.

She wanted everyone to be happy, even though she was dying. Her compassion, wisdom, kindness, and optimism was attained at such a young age, it's amazing! No matter what happened she was always more concerned about the well being of others than the well being of herself.

Something of a youth exploitation or confessional novel, but nonetheless an excellent picture of the generation born in post-world war II England, the first (and possibly one of the last) to be better off than their parents, the children of Britain's baby boom, obsessed with Italian fashion and American Jazz and all night clubs and coffee houses-- this is a portrait of one such youth and his life... It's the best piece of this type to come out of this period and seen by many as MacInnes' best work. Of further note by MacInnes are the other &quot;London novels&quot;, Mr. Love and Justice and City of Spades. What a shame it is that no publisher has cared enough to keep these great books in print."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"MacInnes's novel, set in 1958, London, demonstrates the status of the teenager as a new economic class is demonstrated early on when the narrator tells us: &quot;This teenage ball had had a real splendour in the days when kids discovered that for the first time since centuries of kingdom-come, they'd money, which had always been denied to us at the best time in life to use it, namely, when you're young and strong. ... it had a real savage splendour in the days when we found that no one couldn't sit on our faces anymore because we'd loot to spend at last, and our world was to be our world...&quot;The narrator is a free lance photographer who takes pictures of the night life and of anything depicting the new London and its denizens, hoping for an exhibition. He loves jazz music, is integrationist, and against class. He lives in a slum named Napoli because he enjoys the low rent and how he is accepted, no matter what he does, and no one questions his background, educated or class. He wouldn't be treated that way in Belgravia, the fashionable, upscale district of London.He has a bunch of interesting friends, such as the very friendly Fabulous Hoplife, who swings the other way, and the Wiz, a huckster who wants to make it into the bigtime, realizing there's a goldmine with the economic prosperity and renewed London. He wants to get there via illegal means, much to the narrator's chagrin. There's Big Jill, a big and friendly les to whom the narrator confides to about Suze; she's kind of like an older sister to him.But he's really after his dreamgirl Crepe Suzette, or Suze, a pretty girl who's getting her kicks by sleeping around with every black she fancies. He's very upset when she tells him she's getting married to Henley, a fashion designer in his forties for whom she's a secretary. &quot;I'm marrying for distinction, and that's a thing that you could never give me,&quot; she tells him. Despite her importance, she's not one of the most interesting characters here.But when the narrator learns of the racial tensions going on and reads an anti-immigrant tirade in a news article condemning the Commonwealth Act, which allowed emigration from the former colonies to the UK, he sadly says &quot;I don't understand my country anymore. ...the English race has spread itself all over the world...No one invites us, and we didn't ask anyone's permission... Yet when a few hundred thousand come and settle among our fifty millions, we just can't take it.&quot;The generation gap between three groups are interesting. There are people like the narrator, growing up when the war was already over, and thus progressive, anti-Empire, and accepting blacks and Indians. People like his oafish stepbrother Verne and Ed the Ted, in their mid-twenties, lived through the war, were more patriotic, pro-Empire, and are spiteful of teenagers. And people like the narrator's father like the 1950's because they lived through the hell of the 1930's, unable to find good work, starving, and seeing the war as a godsend for the employment opportunities.MacInnes's historical novel is a look at a post-war Britain, defanged of its empire, and having experienced a political faux-pas in the Suez Crisis. It also examines race relations in Britain ten years after the Commonwealth Act, and how British commercialism got roaring with the newfound prosperity. The tensions between whites and coloureds came to a head in the Notting Hill race riot, which takes place in this book. The movie that was adapted from this cut out most of the thoughtful parts of the book, but it's one of my favourite movies, and I see this book in a new light."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"The thing to keep in mind about London in the late 1950s is that it wasn't cool. London wouldn't become one of the capitals of youth style until 1963 and later (brilliantly recounted in Shawn Levy's READY, STEADY, GO!). In this great novel, Colin MacInnes paints the portrait of an age that has received little attention, a time when England did not yet possess a full-fledged youth culture, a creature whose time was coming round at last, and was slouching towards Soho to be born. In the depiction of teens in search of self-authentication and self-realization, the novel is very much an English equivalent of Kerouac's ON THE ROAD.Like the Kerouac novel, ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS is brilliant not for its story, but for its characters and the almost sociological and anthropological quality of its chronicle. Above all, it chronicles the social upheaval that was already taking place in London, with the central place that drugs, jazz, sex, and alcohol was more openly playing in youth culture. There is also a new and heightened consciousness of race, as well as an absence of the values that had been the mainstay of the previous generation. Although it wasn't yet the sixties, you can feel it coming throughout the book.I don't want to mislead a prospective reading by promoting this as one of the great classics. It isn't. But like the central character, who is an aspiring photographer, the novel serves as a fictional photo essay on a neglected and under-romanticized period of English life. I can't imagine anyone not truly loving it.The novel was in the 1980s made into a fairly decent musical (with an absolutely astonishing opening sequence) starring Patsy Kensit and with a host of musical performers in minor roles, including David Bowie, Ray Davies, and Sade. But I would definitely recommend the book over the film."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"This is the second of Colin MacInnes' London novels, often referred to as the \\"London Trilogy\\" even though each novel is a self-contained story with no connection with, or characters in common with, the other two. Each deals with a separate aspect of London life during the late fifties and early sixties: \\"City of Spades\\" with the city's growing immigrant communities, \\"Absolute Beginners\\" with the growth of youth culture and \\"Mr Love and Justice\\" with the city's underworld.\\"Absolute Beginners\\", set in the summer of 1958 is written from the first person perspective of a teenaged freelance photographer. We never learn his name; when the novel was made into a film by Julien Temple in 1986 he was named Colin after his creator, rather oddly given that the book was never intended to be autobiographical. MacInnes would have been forty-four in 1958, a generation older than his character. The novel is divided into four chapters, entitled \\"In June\\", \\"In July\\", \\"In August\\" and \\"In September\\", of which the first, taking up half the book, is by far the longest. Each details a particular day in the narrator's life during the month in question.The main theme of the novel is the youth culture of the period. MacInnes saw that the growing material prosperity of the late fifties, especially among younger people, had led to the growth of a new, specifically teenage, culture. The teenagers of whom he writes do not want to be dismissed as kids, but neither do they want to be classed as young adults. They see themselves as the \\"absolute beginners\\" of the title, a phrase which on the one hand indicates their youth and inexperience and on the other their desire for a fresh start, for a world as different as possible from that of the \\"taxpayers\\", as they designate the older generation.MacInnes does not actually use the word \\"mod\\", possibly because it had not been coined in 1958, but the narrator's tastes- for jazz music, for sharply-tailored clothes, for motor-scooters and for coffee bars (he does not touch alcohol, despite being, at eighteen, old enough to drink legally)- and his disdain for the rival Teddy Boy movement betray him as belonging to what was to become known as the \\"mod\\" subculture. (Admittedly his cool pretensions take a bit of a knock when he confesses to a liking for Gilbert and Sullivan, the music of choice of middle-aged, middle-class, middlebrow Middle England). Mods tended to admire all things Italian, especially fashions, and this may be reflected in the fact that the narrator refers to the West London district where he lives (actually part of Notting Hill) as Napoli, after the Italian for Naples. One aspect of mod culture not dwelt on in any depth is drugs, although mods were known for their use of amphetamines.The youth culture described in this book is very different from the one I knew as a teenager, but then I was not even born in 1958 and did not enter my teens until after the great cultural shift of the sixties. Sharp suits were anathema to seventies teenagers who, taking their cue from the hippie movement, generally made it a point of honour to look as scruffy as possible. Those of my generation, who saw rock as the authentic music of youth and jazz as a niche speciality for middle-aged enthusiasts, might be surprised that MacInnes' hero prefers Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to Elvis or Buddy Holly, especially as we now look back at the late fifties as the birth of the rock-and-roll era. At that time, however, before the rise of the Beatles, jazz was still very much part of the British youth scene, being associated with the mods just as rock was associated with their rivals, the \\"rockers\\".Another difference between MacInnes' narrator and the teenagers of ten or twenty years later is that, although he is in rebellion against the adult world, his rebellion is not motivated by political concerns, apart from a hatred of racism. For him the main sin of adult society is that it is square and boring, and politics, of the left just as much as of the right, is one of the squarest and most boring aspects of that society.There is no sharply defined plot, unlike some of MacInnes novels. \\"Mr. Love and Justice\\", for instance, is much more traditional in terms of its narrative structure. Much of the first chapter, in particular, simply describes the narrator meeting friends and acquaintances and discussing his outlook on life. What plot there is concerns the narrator's hopes of getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, Crpe Suzette, who is about to enter a marriage of convenience with her boss, a gay middle-aged fashion designer. There is little in the way of physical action until the final chapter which takes place against the background of the Notting Hill race riots.This is not, in fact, a novel one reads for its plot. There are, however, three good reasons to read it. The first is MacInnes' wonderfully vivid prose style which, as one might expect in a novel narrated by a teenager, makes great use of slang and colloquialisms. The second is his equally vivid gallery of characters who often go by eccentric nicknames. (Besides Crpe Suzette there is the narrator's friend The Wizard, the gossip columnist Dido Lament and - best of all- a gay rentboy known as The Fabulous Hoplite).The third reason to read the book is for the author's skill in depicting a particular place and time. In the 1950s Notting Hill, today a fashionable part of London, was a depressed and rundown area. Many of the inhabitants were immigrants, especially Afro-Caribbeans, and people on the margins of society, such as prostitutes, homosexuals, lesbians and junkies, all of whom feature in the novel. Together with low rents, it is the area's diversity which, from the narrator's point of view, makes it such a desirable place to live. (He is originally from Pimlico, a more traditional white working-class area a few miles away). Black characters play an important part in the novel, if not quite as important as they do in \\"City Of Spades\\".\\"Absolute Beginners\\" is my favourite one of the London Trilogy. Reading it I was struck by the brilliance of the picture that MacInnes is able to conjure up. Reading it I realised that there was another side to the fifties besides the complacent, conformist, never-had-it-so-good period depicted in so many films and television programmes and that there was a vibrant, nonconformist side to London life a decade before the \\"swinging sixties\\" with which we are today more familiar."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"I first read Absolute Beginners whilst living in the next suburb in London in the 60's so could relate to the events in the book. I really enjoyed reading this novel again.And can recommend this author for a well written story."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"Like many young Americans, I read this book because David Bowie was involved with making it into a movie and because the British band The Jam had a record called \\"Absolute Beginners\\". I thought it would be an interesting peep into British mod culture. As others have pointed out, the culture in the book is a little bit \\"pre-Mod\\" in that it appears to be set a few years prior to \\"Quadrophenia.\\" Yet, the youthful narrator of the book, who is the \\"mod\\" type, is still definitely distinct in his style and political views from Teddy boys as personified by \\"Ed the Ted.\\" He is portrayed as just young enough to have missed most of the WWII hardships, unlike his father and some others in the book who have been worn down and scarred by that baggage.Unlike the majority of British movies and books that are set in the 50s, this book is remarkably optimistic. The nameless narrator has money to spend, colorful friends (including a stylish gay party boy and an ex-debutante) to have fun with, and an open mind towards new developments such as the influx of immigrants and people of color into his geographic space. In contrast to his hidebound elders he's pretty ebullient, and the only blot on his horizon has to do with his teenage girlfriend Suze, who cheats on him with blacks (which interestingly, doesn't turn the narrator's attitude negative towards them - he's truly primed for the upcoming free love generation) and then informs him she's marrying someone else. The book isn't much of a story, more a stream-of-consciousness narration of our hero hopping from a wild party, to a conversation with his father, to an attempt to patch things up with Suze, and so forth and so on. The story thus zips from place to place much like the narrator does on a scooter.Incidentally, the book isn't much like the movie, which cut out most of the racial and political elements. This doesn't surprise me since if you're an American reader who hasn't majored in modern British history, you're probably going to need to resort to Wikipedia every chapter or so, to have a clue what the heck the author is talking about. This is the main reason why I didn't give it five stars - it really needs a glossary since the narrator clearly is a busy guy who doesn't have time for lengthy 'splainin'. Also, the ending of the book was kind of weird and left me feeling like the narrator really needs to get a prescription for his ADD sometime soon. It's still a breezy fun read, full of colorful slang. I just don't recommend it for \\"absolute beginners\\" who have zero knowledge of 50s Britain - they may lose patience fast."},{"Title":"Absolute beginners","review":"MacInnes captures perfectly the atmosphere and energy of late 50s London.

What I found was a poorly written, poorly researched, poorly documented, poorly argued book that will satisfy only those who have already made up their mind about the Bible. It is not for the genuine truth seeker who seeks to weigh and evaluate evidence. THe author uses inflamatory language to degrade people who do believe in the Bible. Instead of consulting primary souce material that is readily available, the author quotes from secondary and tertiary sources, mostly from anti-Christian sources. The author claims that this work was his Doctor of Theology thesis. I can't quite understand how any reputable university could accept this work as scholarly research. The author and publishers comments are pure hype. Truth cannot be objectively evaluated by someone who has an ax to grind with whatever group he is evaluating. IF you are an honest truth seeker, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"One True Doctrine","review":"This book is a very good source of information regarding the origins of Christian belief. It exposes much of the error in believing that all the stories in the Bible were inspired by the Divine when they were really - borrowed? - from earlier religious and cultural sources - This is not to say that the Bible is not a great source of inspiration and insight but much has been, to quote the book &quot;lifted&quot; from other sources. I know that there will be those staunch believers in the absolute originality of the Biblical and Christian beliefs but I think they should do some research themselves. As we all know - Religion and Spirituality began a very long time ago. If you borrow something and it works - great! Just don't say you were the source... It can only invalidate your position ... This book is an easy read and a constant source of reference.

This sister led us, through the power of the Holy Spirit, straight to the Throne Room of God. I tell you that my life has not been the same since. I said to the Lord, I want what she has - \\"Your Presence.\\"So, I was so excited when I heard that she had written a book about worshipping God. I pre-ordered mine and received it two weeks ago.I \\"highly recommend\\" this book, written by a women of God who is a true worshipper - and by the fruit that I witnessed from her life - \\"walks with God.\\"In the book CeCe gives biblical insight on how worship is a lifestyle of walking with God - not just an one-time or once-a-week-experience. How worship is not about \\"me\\" but ALL about Him/God, Who He Is and what He wants to do thru me/us.Also, she shares part of her personal worship life-style. In the second part of the book she discusses the songs from the Throne Room, their meanings and how God led her to pick those songs....awesome.Finally, there is a section for personal/group reflection with questions concerning the content that can be used for personal or group study.I found the book extremely practical. The listing of some of God's names found in the Bible that I can use to express my love to Him and her example of praying on her knees with a worshipful heart that prompted me to do the same.Now, that I am fininshed reading the book - I have began to apply some of the things that I have learned and all I know is that the Lord has drawn me closer to Himself and I don't wannna ever let go!Read it and find out how you too can become protected, healed, peaceful, powerful, changed, receive direction, clarity and much more as a result of worshipping God and living in His presence.His,"},{"Title":"Throne Room: Ushered into the Presence of God","review":"I received my copy of this pre-release last week and read it much too quickly. It was great.When performing, CeCe has a way of making worship such a personal experience that I often feel as if I am intruding on the intimate relations she is having with the Father.After reading this book, I now know why I often feel that way...because she has an intense love relationship with God thru Christ and when she sings she is &quot;performing for an audience of One.&quot;The book is clear, concise and very easy-to-read. With a subject like worship, simplicity is key. I am glad that the message was not lost in a cloud of &quot;religious&quot; lingo or watered-down by neglecting to mention the personal responsibility that I have to surrender my will to God.In the book, she describes worship as a lifestyle, one in which you can daily walk in a close relationship with God by keeping your heart focused on God all throughout the day.She gives biblical insight on three vital elements of a true worshipper: confession, surrender and loving God with all of your heart.Although I have heard CeCe for more than twenty years now, last year God has used her relationship with Him (that is so evident in her spirit) to 'cause me to want to know Him that way - i.e. when you see me you see the Father in me.Reading this book and practicing the things that God has revealed to me, has encouraged me to desire to stay in The Throne Room - and for that, I thank Him!!***** Submitted by Nellie for www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com The GOOD GIRL Book Club"},{"Title":"Throne Room: Ushered into the Presence of God","review":"CeCe Winans is one of the best!!

This revisionist reinterpretation has helped revolutionize our understanding of who built America, challenging the very common \\"great man\\" theory of history that claims human progress is the result of a few great minds--always wealthy and usually white males. Class struggle and racial inequality are central to American history from the colonial era through to today, and Gary Nash is part of a great generation of scholars that seek to destroy the standard myths of this country's past that say otherwise.

As the globe warms and oil is burned up, we need innovative cars that push the envelope with new technologies, such as plug-in hybrids and electrics.Yet the carmakers struggle to stay afloat, with no money to spend on such a drastic model change. And no strategic plan to follow even if they had the money. So instead of innovation, we get a steady proliferation of the same old models, with minor variations, all of the carmakers putting out their \\"me too\\" offerings that drive up expenses, drive down sale prices, and drive the carmakers out of business.Time for a Model Change suggests a solution. Unbundle the production of cars. Let the carmakers build to their strengths. Italian carmakers, for example, should not try to compete with their own vertically integrated line of cars. Instead, focus on car bodies, doing the styling that they can do better than others. And so on.Reflecting their connection with The Economist magazine, the authors of Time for a Model Change make their case thoughtfully and carefully. The many graphs, diagrams, and pictures (black and white only) throughout the book add a great deal to a reader's understanding of the industry. This book, though quite sophisticated in its analysis, will not be too difficult for the general reader.My only complaint about the book, if I even call it that, is the feeling of doom and gloom that pervades it. Things are not that bad. But there is no question that the \\"industry of industries\\" will be changing, one way or another.

I was unsure where journalism was in evidence or memoir or just poetic license.

The title itself was also misleading as I thought the book would be about an individual who spent a year living with a community of nuns. Instead this was a frustrating combination of fiction, memory and (doctored?) interviews.Despite all that, I would have to admit: I'm glad I read the book. As a lapsed Catholic also searching for something greater than myself and our consumer culture, I identified with many of the author's feelings and was intrigued by the personal discussions of prayer, a calling and vocations, and the role of the church."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist). The anecdotal information about several Sisters in the earlier chapters seems a promise of real development later, but this promise remains unfulfilled.Half stories, some of which seem flavoured by stereotypes and prejudiced assumptions, are profoundly unsatisfying, particularly since the natural presumption to which the early chapters would lead was that depth, development, and understanding of the various Sisters' situations would follow. It did not happen. There is a sampling of moments from various Sisters' lives (not, as the sub-title implies, a chronicle of a year in the life of an Order), but no insight into anything."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The subtitle &quot;A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns&quot; leads one to expect a book similiar to The View from a Monastery or A Monastic Year - both of which are excellent books. The books is rather another of the &quot;sisters meet Vatican II' style written from the point of few of a Catholic-educated, nonpracticing Catholic.The focus of the book is on what it means to be called; initially the author works from the premise that &quot;called&quot; means primarily called to religious life. At the conclusion, her primary insight is that ones &quot;call&quot; may be to a particular aspect of secular life.She traces her slowing change view of nuns and call primarily through sisters she knew as a child or young adult - most of whom left the order. By not including some of those who joined the order after the substantial changes (for example, one who serves as a hospital chaplain), she fails to explore what a &quot;call to religious life&quot; means today. This results in an understanding of call that is primarily individualistic in a church that is fundamentally communal. The author is also sloppy in her Catholic terminology, sloppy in a way that reveals that her research assumed as a base the Church from which she was estranged rather than the Church of today. An example: she refers to the nun serving the King County Jail as &quot;saying Mass&quot; a role reserved for ordained priests rather than the more accurate &quot;presiding at a Eucharistic service&quot;.What the book truly is a memoir-exploration of a non-practicing Catholic sifting through her childhood with adult eyes, using the nuns who taught her in school as a catalyst for this exploration. In this exploration, we learn the stories of several young nuns who entered and left the order. We learn the stories of some who stayed, who redefined what it meant to be a nun (Dominican sister to be more precise). Those who stayed are presented rightly as remarkable people facing the world squarely in the face - assisting in jail, in urban social services, in hospitals, in rural Hispanic populations ...The writing is such that you get a sense of who each person is in a very short section which leaves you wanting more or leaves you chuckling about the description if you know the individual described in person or through books. For example, she briefly mentions Fr. Joseph as becoming charimatic - Fr. Joseph has written and self published a delightful biography.I recommend the book as a delight insight into a particular side of Catholic childhood and female religious orders. I am concerned that some readers may mistake the book for a more universal statement."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I find it hard to believe that the author was ever \\"almost\\" a nun.

This church dogma refers to Mary being born with without original--immaculate at HER conception. It does NOT mean \\"she was not defiled in the process\\" of conceiving Jesus!

I am a Protestant with a keen interest in what makes religions tick, and this book did not disappoint. I now know why my Catholic-school friends used to tell me that I would go to Hell because I was not Catholic - they were taught this in school. Ms. Whitney provides what seems to be a relatively complete history of the Rosary Heights Dominican order, illustrated with histories of the lives of different sisters in the order. Her own childhood as a Catholic school student provides a good backdrop for this history. She is a lapsed Catholic, and although she portrays her own history lovingly, one does not get the sense that after this year she embraces Catholicism. There is a bit of &quot;New Agey&quot; spirituality in here. Ms. Whitney does an excellent job of portraying the &quot;calling&quot; of the nuns as something mysterious that is reserved for a chosen few, but then she goes on to equate this &quot;calling&quot; with a selected vocation. This doesn't ring true - I don't think people are called to be nuns in the same sense that a person may attend college to become an accountant.

Vignettes of the Sisters are used to show the changes in the lives of the nuns after the Vatican 11 Council which called for renewal in all areas of the nuns lives. Despite being part fiction and part non-fiction, the author manages to capture the authentic spirit of the nuns today. Even after 2 reads, I am beginning to read the book again. There are so many pearls of description, vignettes of personalities, and witticisms that are not caught on a first read."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is a mishmash, and is poorly named, particularly the subtitle (maybe the publisher chose it?). It's interesting and heartfelt, and obviously the author cares a great deal for the subject. But it wanders back and forth.She makes some errors that would be astonishingly easy to have corrected.As someone else pointed out, the Immaculate Conception is Mary being born without the taint of original sin, not Jesus's birth. That's the Virgin Birth.The word \\"discalced\\" does not mean anything \\"literally\\" about poverty. It means \\"shoeless.\\"The correct name of the high school in Seattle is not \\"Blanchette\\" but \\"Blanchet.\\"She has no bibliography and cites no sources for her information.Interesting and heart-felt, but not a work of scholarship, which is a pity."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Catherine Whitney's The Calling was one of the biggest surprises I've had in a long time. If you read the acknowledgments, you discover that the author is a strong and reasoned critic of many of the restrictive and antique policies of the Church. Once in the body of the work, an astonishing transformation occurs, as Whitney sweeps us with her to another time and another place so completey that you begin leaning over in your chair to make room for your guardian angel. I could smell the chalk dust in the parochial school room of her past. And the book is funny as well as insightful. I became so absorbed the first time I read it I could hardly put it down. It's no crime thriller, but what a fun read!"},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Whitney's book is a real disappointment. Apart from factual errors about the history of the community she is writing about (who in the world edited this?), &quot;The Calling&quot; is less about &quot;a year in the life of an order of nuns&quot; than a self-absorbed, shallow &quot;journey&quot; toward....? Who knows? In any event, the account focuses more on the author than the sisters (not nuns)--most of whom are only superficially drawn, and many of whom get lost or forgotten in the course of the narrative. And the author's own &quot;journey&quot; is certainly not toward faith or anything deep but, it appears, toward some sort of ungrounded self-affirmation. As one who has spent a lot of time in convents and knows hundreds (thousands?) of sisters, this book leaves at best a limited, and at worst a misguidedly stereotyped, image of religious life in both the past and the present. If this is all you ever read about sisters, do not assume that you now &quot;know&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; anything--except, perhaps, about the author! Instead, read &quot;Building Sisterhood: A Feminist History of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of Monroe, Michigan,&quot; &quot;Poverty, Chastity, and Change,&quot; by Carole Garibaldi Rogers, &quot;Cloister Walk,&quot; by Kathleen Norris, &quot;Virgin Time,&quot; by Patricia Hampl, &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; by Helen Prejean, or almost anything by Joan Chittister.

She or her editor just didn't get it done. Little cries about a &quot;different&quot; sort of book - just go where it leads you, etc., can't defend jumping around from anecdote to anecdote and then measuring EVERYTHING by herself and her shutdown life. All that glory and all she can do is go over and over how she was &quot;rejected.&quot; I really enjoyed the stories of the nuns, though. Staying or leaving, they gave us glimpses of women of depth and wonder. I've never been a Roman Catholic but I'm a Christian. I'm glad I read this and in the words of people lots younger than old me, the author needs to &quot;get a life.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"If you are expecting to be drawn into the liturgical rhythm, discipline and complex beauty of religious life, this book will disappoint. It is not, as its subtitle implies, an ethographic description of life behind convent walls. It is, instead, a telling of the personal and spiritual journeys taken by a cross-section of women. Most of these women were at some point &quot;Called&quot; and spent at least part of their lives in the convent at Rosary Heights. But others, including the author, are more loosely connected to the religious life. The fascination of this book, and it is fascinating, lies in the diversity of the women themselves and in the author's ability to set their thoughts and actions firmly in the cultural milieu in which they take place.The author presents each woman's story with great respect and affection, and as you read, you too will come to appreciate those who have heard and responded to &quot;The Call.&quot; Many books of this genre leave us feeling that to succeed in the religious life one must be or become meek, subservient and narrow. They led us to believe that the convent is not a place for the stong, the independent and the courageous. This book provides a broader perspective. Perhaps many a true feminist finds her freedom and nutures her strength within the convent walls."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"When Whitney went to the Pacific Northwest to interview the Dominican sisters who had shaped her childhood, she met far more than old teachers in a community that was struggling to find its place in the modern world. She confronted her own loss of faith and began a personal quest for spiritual identity. The Calling is a penetrating analysis of the Dominican sisters who had been a significant part of the author's life from grade school through high school. It's also a journey inward. All this said, The Calling is not a ponderous, self-absorbed examination of conscience. With honesty, humor, and an obvious affection for the nuns, the author opens the doors to a modern religious community, and lets us inside. Through the personalities she remembers, she moves from past to present with ease, and with a style that reads like chapters in a novel. It's a great experience."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I got this book because as a post-Vatican II Catholic, I wanted to know what type of life nuns had. I never went to Catholic school and my parish really never had any nuns present. To date, I still don't know! This title is very misleading. The author did not chronicle a year in the life; she took anecdotes from various nuns of their personal experience with their vocation. Also, one should be warned that the author is a lapsed Catholic with some bitter feelings toward the male hierarchy of the Catholic church that she has not resolved. Most of the anecdotes in this book are by women who left their orders because they were dissatisfied. Overall, the book was well-written and kept me very interested, but I believe the title is completely misleading and will cause more people to buy the book than normally would have, myself included."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I found this book to be extremely readable and engaging but also frustrating and not quite believable. I was unsure where journalism was in evidence or memoir or just poetic license. The structure of the book was also confusing with several narratives and seemingly important events abandoned and never resolved. In the end, I found the book disappointing and rather simplistic. The title itself was also misleading as I thought the book would be about an individual who spent a year living with a community of nuns. Instead this was a frustrating combination of fiction, memory and (doctored?) interviews.Despite all that, I would have to admit: I'm glad I read the book. As a lapsed Catholic also searching for something greater than myself and our consumer culture, I identified with many of the author's feelings and was intrigued by the personal discussions of prayer, a calling and vocations, and the role of the church."},{"Title":"The Calling: A Year in the Life of an Order of Nuns (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As a former Sister, I found the book to be very accurate and descriptive of the life I once knew, particularly as it relates to the 60's and 70's.Catholics and non catholics alike will find the glimpses into the lives of Sisters de-mystifying.Not for those with extensive indepth knowledge or religious life.How any reviewer could possibly refer to this book as trash is beyond my comprehension.

Ms Whitney, however, portrays these Nuns as real, human women who are continually growing and rededicating themselves. Though their numbers are fewer at this time, they are reaching out to others in more diverse ways. Many of the women who left the Convent seem to still have a bond with the Nuns. This speaks well for Religious life! The author's own spiritual journey, woven throughout the story, was thought provoking and touching.

The material seems to genuinely engage the writer and her collaborating editors. They know that so-called inside stories about nuns make hot copy . One does not get a sense of serious archival research into the history of nuns; rather one catches echoes of snippets from journalistic sources. Better read Kathleen Norris' &quot;Dakota&quot; or Patricia Hampl's &quot;Virgin Time&quot; for realism with depth into what occurs in monasteries and convents. Instead of the pages in this book on prison minstry, take a look at Helen Prejean's &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; or even see the film.

Journalism After September 11th packs in a host of internationally respected journalists and academics who probe the face of modern journalism and its many challenges."},{"Title":"Journalism After September 11 (Communication and Society)","review":"Many Americans seem to have a peculiar sense of dualism about themselves, a feeling at once slightly elitist and fiercely victimized. The United States attempts to be the great savior of the world, but is cast off by many other nations, and it is from this so many Americans draw both superiority and resentment. While U.S. citizens have much to be proud of, so many seem to be neurotically opposed to admitting any shortcomings, and it is this arrogance--not, as is so often cited, hatred of American culture or freedom--that is a primary source of a bias against the United States from Sweden to Somalia. Two phrases plastered across American newspapers a year ago demonstrate this bipolar affliction: \\"Everything has changed\\" and \\"Why do they hate us?\\" Only Americans could claim that their indeed heart-wrenching loss of 3,000 lives had superseded every other such atrocity the world over, yet simultaneously sequester themselves with a flippant \\"us.\\"U.S. newspapers and their journalists were dramatically affected by Sept. 11. From the instant iconicity of \\"9/11\\" (a date so beautifully Ameri-centric) to the violent and sudden loss of any pretense of objectivity, American journalism is in not in the same state today as it has very recently been.Chronicling the myriad shifts over the past year, Journalism After September 11 takes a hard, academic look at nearly every aspect of journalism--structure, stereotypes, objectivity, conglomeration, globalization, patriotic journalism, risks to reporters' health, tabloids (both American and British), talk shows, online media, and photography. All of the writers included are from the world of academia, and it shows in a few of the chapters, which dive headlong into obscure sociology. The authors' distance from the world of news media, however, unquestionably enhances most of the work. There is also a range of opinions on American journalism--though all authors seem to agree that it is flawed, several believe that it can be saved. After being under the microscope its prognosis is cautiously--though barely--optimistic.In James W. Carey's essay, \\"American journalism on, before, and after September 11,\\" he argues that American journalists were in the midst of a \\"vacation from reality,\\" one that began sometime before the 1988 presidential election and peaked with the impeachment of Bill Clinton. During this time, Carey writes, news media did \\"serious damage\\" to democracy. They pulled expensive foreign affairs correspondents, integrated news and entertainment programs, and increasingly moved toward tabloid-style scandals in order to sell their papers. When the airplanes struck that morning, Carey says, journalists performed adroitly--but not for very long:\\"The calm and poise of the television networks during these fateful hours of ignorance represented an admirable professionalism. Perhaps it couldn't last. By the end of the day speculation was pouring forth from the political centers of the country. As the week progressed, television coverage degenerated. Banners were unfurled, inevitably in red, white, and blue, along the crawl space at the bottom of the television screen announcing 'America at War,' or 'America under Attack' as if the story were about a basketball or football tournament.\\"In the days that followed, Sylvio Waisbord argues, American news media \\"resorted to standard formulas and stock-in-trade themes.\\" The national news media served primarily to comfort and to warn, and to do little else. The centerpiece of the book is surely Waisbord's chapter, \\"Journalism, risk, and patriotism,\\" which builds on the other contributors' conclusions. With the news media's growing ignorance of foreign affairs, Waisbord writes, insecurity itself became \\"othered\\"--terrorism was simply something that occurred, however unfortunately, to other people in other places. This begins to account for why the American public did not react so viscerally (or, in some cases, at all) to either massive genocides or attacks on American holdings abroad. There was no general American revulsion following Rwanda. After massive atrocities were revealed in the former Yugoslavia, Hollywood stars did not proclaim how suddenly \\"meaningless\\" their work had become. This cultural sense of invincibility was truly what broke down last September, and Waisbord argues it may have taken the news media along with it. In addition, professional journalists felt that, in the wake of a violent message interpreted against American \\"freedoms\\" (and certainly after the death of reporter Daniel Pearl), they were being specifically targeted. Thus, Waisbord writes, they increasingly used patriotism to inoculate themselves against the threat. News had suddenly become legitimate in the eyes of the public, and journalists were more than willing to write what the public wanted to hear. Gone was the subtle elitism that Carey describes, which had pervaded the media since Watergate. Patriotism allowed journalists to be a visible part of what they interpreted as a united nation. With the combination of a supposed attack on the freedoms that supported their own enterprise and a newly-admiring public, the news media embraced patriotism as their rightful purpose.As Robert W. McChesney laments in \\"September 11 and the structural limitations of US journalism,\\" this deference to patriotism--or, more frequently, rabid nationalism--gave journalists an extremely limited framework in which to operate:\\"What is most striking in the US news coverage following the September 11 attacks is how that very debate over whether to go to war, or how best to respond, did not even EXIST. It was presumed, almost from the moment the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, that the United States was at war, world war. The picture conveyed by the media was as follows: a benevolent, democratic, and peace-loving nation was brutally attacked by insane evil terrorists who hated the United States for its freedoms and affluent way of life.\\"There is considerable reason to believe that the text selected by most media and politicians--of \\"evil\\" or \\"insane\\" terrorists--was not merely a gut reaction, but carefully selected vocabulary. If the terrorists were evil, then they had no motivations, and it was absurd to attempt to discover what led them to carry out such an act; their motivation was evil alone. But as another author points out elsewhere in Journalism, \\"There has emerged over the last three decades a set of journalistic narratives on 'Muslim terrorism,' whose construction is dependent on basic cultural perceptions about the global system of nation-states, violence, and the relationship between Western and Muslim societies.\\" Doubtless these tropes reinforced the predominant feelings of \\"having to do something\\" (\\"something\\" which inevitably translated into \\"war\\") to combat the evil marshaled against us.Not coincidentally, risk suddenly became real, not by a measurable increase in danger (virulent anti-Americanism had been flowing for quite some time), but primarily by the media's own increase in focus. They--meaning both the public and the journalists who were now, proudly, a part of it--had been attacked, and they would stand sentinel against any further threats. The anthrax attacks were a good example of this: perpetrators were almost immediately assumed to be foreign, working against a unified American public, and a relatively small number of deaths created a firestorm of articles for more than a month. Waisbord and several other authors lament modern journalism's reliance on official sources and \\"events\\" for their news. This policy precludes long-term explorations of structural violence, such as the building threat of terrorism against the United States in the previous decade. In the case of the anthrax attacks, the news promptly dropped off the front page shortly after the final death, despite the fact that no perpetrator had been identified.It is this combination of legitimizing patriotism, reliance only on official sources, and risk based on definable events that did the most harm to American journalism after Sept. 11. Carey places the blame for these policies primarily on the conglomeration that governs most news organizations, writing that \\"in recent years journalism has been sold, to a significant degree, to the entertainment and information industries which market commodities globally ... This condition cannot be allowed to persist.\\" With Sept. 11, however, Carey seems more hopeful. In their introduction to Carey's piece, the editors write that journalists \\"just might have realized that democratic institutions are not guaranteed; rather, they are fragile and can be destroyed by journalists as well as by politicians.\\"The remaining authors in Journalism After September 11 offer a wide panorama of the state of the news media today. Barbie Zelizer (an editor of the book) describes how the use of still photography in newspapers allowed the American public to \\"bear witness\\" in a similar way as following the Holocaust--yet this time, there were no bodies to be seen. Karim H. Karim notes that Islamic and Middle Eastern stereotypes are still in wide use when explaining notions such as \\"terrorism\\" or \\"violence.\\" Several authors tackle more specific areas of news--tabloids, talk shows, and newspaper commentaries--and there is an intriguing look by Ingrid Volkmer at how news media is increasingly defined not by national boundaries, but by sub- and supra-national organizations. Journalism gives one an in-depth look at how different facets of American news reporting operate, and how that may be affecting, for good or ill, the American democracy.The two, of course, have always been intertwined, with patriotism frequently substituted for democracy when threats arise. \\"Patriotism\\" is itself a nebulous term, and Waisbord questions why journalism opted so forcefully to embrace \\"hawkish patriotism,\\" parroting the official line and increasing the level of anxiety. A more traditional \\"constitutional patriotism\\" would have preserved civil rights and freedom of speech, while holding government accountable for its actions, he writes:\\"Journalism needs to resist the temptation to dance to the tune of deafening nationalism often found in public opinion. Instead, it could courageously show patriotic spirit by keeping criticism alive ... [it] could provide reassurance by lowering the fear volume and offer community by defending diversity and tolerance rather than foundational, ethnocentric patriotism. A choice for the latter not only excludes democratic dissent from patriotism, but it also minimizes the possibility that citizens of the nation imagine that they also belong to a world community of equals.\\"Journalism After September 11 raises many such questions about the choices of mainstream journalism, and answers few of them--yet those in the news media need to be having such debates. And in a nation in which reporters take their strength from an empowering democracy, the issue is one of importance beyond the news media. These are concerns everyone must attempt to resolve."},{"Title":"Better Business Writing: Third Edition (Fifty-Minute Series)","review":"If you want an exercise book to improve your writing, this is it.

In his cynical manner, he merely records his incredible encounters with seemingly all the renegades and twised characters of a scorched Europe and willing or not he witnesses the atrophies and deformities of human mind. Ironically, the author somehow manages to turn his characters into hillarious and amiable, even entertaining figures.Celine writes like no other writer you have read. His truncated sentences, in bits and pieces all over the place, remind of a rather maniac mind spinning thoughts at the speed of light in an incohomprensive, bordering to delirious babble. That's Celine all right throughout North.

It's hard to say why exactly, because his novels are mostly simlar in tone and style, except for \\"Journey\\", his first, which is his most accessible, ellipses-free novel...Bukowski (who turned me on to Celine in the first place) said that Celine went insane after his first book and didn't write much of consequence after that.I would have to respectfully disagree. \\"North\\" certainly does read like an ultra-cynical, off-the-cuff, unruly beast, the rantings of a madman...Celine opens complaining about society, his publisher, the reading public, and his fellow authors, and seems to careen between his present-tense problems and his flight from both the Allies and the Nazis during World War 2, twenty years before, with no rhyme or reason...but I think there IS a reason: the experience. Probably a multiple-degreed Literature Professor (if he read Celine at all) could point out all sorts of latent themes and ironic stylistic touches, but I don't go in for all that...I just love running along behind Celine, trying to keep up. \\"North\\" is a whirlwind, a blast of vituperation and self-pity, the missing link between Surrealism and Punk Rock, and possibly the highest expression of what it means to be French and why so many people hate the French: if YOU were a little country crowded on all sides by beasts and fops, and everyone loved your wines and cheeses but squawked with hatred whenever you gave your opinion on something, how do you think YOU'D behave?"},{"Title":"North","review":"Perpetually running from the perils of war, Destouches finds himself acting as collaborator in WWII.. a nazi doctor, routed around in confusion, &amp;, as always, trying simply to save his own skin.

Precisely Celine's recounting of the questionable wartime \`activities' that have turned him into one of the true black sheep of 20th century literature. What Celine has to say about the inferno of WW2 wasn't politically correct long before that term was invented to describe a particular form of lying. Is it possible that the seeds of political correctness were sown in the ashes of postwar Europe? Maybe. In any event, Celine stands firmly opposed to any form of lying or hypocrisy and he found plenty of both to rage against in the chaos of war. The problem is that Celine finds the hypocrisy, the lying, the betrayal and rot on *both* sides, in human nature itself, and this is an unacceptable position to take in the last--if not only--war that is still considered to have had a clear Good Guy and an indisputable Bad Guy.*North* chronicles a stage in Celine's flight \`north' during the last days of an imploding Third Reich. As Berlin is bombed into pebbles, and then re-bombed into dust, Celine, his wife Lili, a temperamental actor friend, and his cat, take refuge in a village along with other refugees--prisoners, traitors, SS officers, gypsies, German nobility, and assorted riff-raff on the move--and all of them scheming and jockeying for the best position to ensure their own survival. Hunger and fear bring out the worst in all of them, except, perhaps, the cat.What Celine has the effrontery to point out is that human evil is pervasive--the rottenness is at the core, and extends from the bottom up. The guys at the top are only the biggest stinkers, the Chief Thugs, different only in their capacity to commit atrocities of all sorts, but, otherwise, identical to the rest of us in the latent human potential for unbounded cruelty. Celine take on WW2 is one where principled stands were virtually without exception conditional on one's place in the raging chaos. Can the Nazis keep me fed, alive, relatively safe? Okay, then, \\"Heil Hitler!\\" Can the Russians? \\"Welcome Comrade!\\" Maybe the English? Then \\"God Save the Queen!\\" Celine fought with the \\"Good Guys\\" during WW1 and so the edge of his ultra-cynicism was somewhat blunted, his political amorality obscured, his misanthropy still a bit of a joke, fogged over and softened by the fact that, after all, he fought on the \`right' side. But his essential attitude is there even in *Journey to the End of Night.* Celine doesn't believe in *anything*--nothing, at least, larger than the survival of himself and his immediate friends. His is an ant's-eye view of the world and like all the rest of us little guys, he's just trying to keep from getting stamped on by the big boots from above. And if you think of the war itself as the shadow cast by a great big boot coming down, you can understand better the mindless, unprincipled scramble for survival that Celine dares to record in the pages of *North.* Are there no atheists in a foxhole? Well, Celine argues, there are no idealists there, either. When the bombs are screaming down, there's just a lot of desperate and terrified people looking for a rock to hide under. Justification comes later; survival is first. After all, there's nothing without survival. And wherever the Wheel of Fortune stops, that's where you stand, Nazi or Allied, collaborative or Resistance. You place your best bet: to survive is to win. Well, you might say, that Celine agrees wholeheartedly with Ecclesiastes: \\"A living dog is better than a dead lion.\\"It's this kind of radical moral complexity that I think makes *North* richer and ultimately superior to Celine's earlier work--it also fuels an even more virulent disgust with \\"humanity,\\" so called, and amps up his characteristic misanthropy to the max. Everyone gets it in the neck. The black comedy is here, the antic absurdity, this is Celine after all, cracking jokes even up to his eyeballs in blood and worms. That he can turn the experiences recounted in *North* into a picaresque romp through the Apocalypse is amazing in itself--in many another author's hand, the events of *North* would be the material for a gloomy tragedy of the epic sort well-known by now among chroniclers of the WW2 horror. That Celine is able to turn this uncompromising tale of war, famine, and exile into a loony brimstone romp is a backhand tribute to the human spirit. Well, a tribute to Celine's spirit, in any event--a spirit more fully and honestly \\"human\\" than most."},{"Title":"North","review":"Louis Ferdinand Celine was an anti-Semite and thoroughly unpleasant character (unless you were counted among his small, close circle of friends). He also happens to be one of the 20th Century's greatest writers, someone admired by the likes of Samuel Beckett (not a man known to offer unworthy praise). JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT, DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN and NORTH are ample evidence of Celine's enormous talent.

If you persist, you will be rewarded with a tragic story that rivals the bards of ancient greece in its beauty and chaotic symmetry.Celine never really bothers to make grand pronouncements about the future, about civilization, about humanity, about the future. If he makes them, they are predicated on madness and miscommunication, and often meant merely as a foil for his real ideas. Yet I'm convinced that behind the rants, raves, and scattered events in this novel is a grand metaphor for the fall of the Enlightenment ideas that defined the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century. Gone is any real perception of right or wrong, of good or bad, of the necessary past and the rational future...all we have left is the self and the other, struggling through a bombed-out landscape as Western Continental Europe finally crashes headlong into the ground. Humanity has returned to its irrational origins, and not even an 80 year old Prussian Junker in his underpants can get on his horse, draw his saber, and make everything all right again...A vital description of the effects of World War II on the ideas, formulations, and traditions of Western European society, and a fantastic read to boot.This one will stay with us for a long time."},{"Title":"North","review":"The only novels I've ever read that are better are &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and Celine's &quot;Death on the Installment Plan.&quot; This book is far better than &quot;Journey to the End of Night&quot; and slightly more endearing than &quot;Castle to Castle.&quot; A masterpiece of &quot;social criticism,&quot; set against the dying days of Nazi Germany, but applicable to anywhere, any time.

The prologue explains that the triplets, needing to be protected from their murderous uncle when their mother dies, are separated at birth. In this story, Greg Dumas has been hired to find his client, Kelly MacLeod's parents in Scotland and learns that she is one of the triplets. He tracks down Fiona Macdonald, the daughter of doctor who delivered the triplets, but by the time he finds her, he's just about collapsing with pneumonia. After he recovers, their attraction is obvious, but he returns to New York. This is a romance with a fairly good plot. The truth about Fiona is obvious fairly early in the book, but this doesn't detract from the story. It can be read as a stand-alone, but the last page leads into Kelly's story.

But this book offers an extremely unique analysis that I have not experienced in any other book.Books on negotiation are broadly split into two major categories: the &quot;normative&quot; approach to negotiation, which draws on mathematical game-theory, and the &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach, which builds on studies in psychology, management studies and real-life experience. On one hand, normative models based on game-theory are elegant and rigorous, but fail to capture and solve a vast amount of real-world negotiations, due to the oversimplification of the complex mental processes that drive negotiators. On the other hand, pragmatic approaches seem to be ad-hoc, lacking rigour in the analysis of issues, and largely consumer-oriented (Of course, there are exceptions, based on solid empirical studies, such as those coming out of the Harvard Program Negotiation).What this book offers, however, is the best attempt I have seen to achieve both rigorous normative validity as well as pragmatic prescriptive advice. Mark Young digs as deep as the most fundamental philosophical traditions that underlie the current common conception of rationality (that of utility maximisation), and builds, buttom-up, a new theory of &quot;considered&quot; economic rationality, which forms the basis of his theory of business negotiation. Hence, the book represents a very interesting and unique grounding of negotiation in philosophy, reaching a normatively valid account of negotiation, both descriptive and prescriptive, without falling into the trap of oversimplification that the elegance of mathematical game-theory leads people to.I recommend this book to any serious negotiator or researcher on negotiation, both normative and pragmatic. I recommend the book particularly to game-theorists, since it would give them very interesting insights about the limitations of game-theory that might eventually lead to a paradigm shift in the study of strategic interaction."},{"Title":"Rational Games: A Philosophy of Business Negotiation from Practical Reason","review":"Since there are a lot of books talking about negotiation skills, but &iexcl;Rational Game&iexcl; introduce the negotiation of business world with the exploration of classical theory that I think is quite unique.

This is space opera, plain and simple. But it is very very high quality and readable space opera, and Poul Anderson really does put some effort into speculating about what human society will evolve into, and what alien races will be like. These stories are entertainment. Flandry is extremely likable, and so are the Merseians, the alien bad guys. (They are more or less a cross between the Klingons (whom they predate) and an iguana.)These short stories are meant to be fun and are that. This is not deep meaningful literature. More like what you'll want to read while drinking beer and eating chips. Hey, nothing wrong with that! What's not to like? If you can find it, buy it!"},{"Title":"Agent of the Terran Empire","review":"Poul Anderson has only been gone a few years, but already most of his extremely long list of novels and story collections is out of print. iBooks deserves praise for reviving one of Anderson's best characters, Captain Sir Dominic Flandry. Anderson was a pillar of science fiction from the late 1950s into the 1990s, and the Flandry books--part of the larger Technic future history that includes the van Rijn/Falkayn series--were from his strongest period.I read these stories as a kid and later as an adult and was impressed by how they grew with me--lots of bold adventure, but some serious musings, as well. Flandry is a very modern character, in some respects, with sophisticted tastes and inner conflicts, but also very much a man of his corrupt and decadent time.If iBooks perseveres with this series, then the best Flandry book--and one of Anderson's best--should be out soon, \\"A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows.\\""},{"Title":"Agent of the Terran Empire","review":"Honestly, I'm not even sure I'm reading these in order. I had a handful of these, realized that Anderson wrote quite a bit more than I had and recently acquired the rest of the Flandry stories and the stories in the series that predate him. Hopefully reading it all as a piece will help me get some sense of the scope of it, which seems quite ambitious, the rise and decline of a human space empire from a ground level view. The Flandry stories seem to take place toward the tail-end of the empire, where everything is pretty swell and things are seemingly at their peak but there are signs that the rot is beginning to set in and the darkness is nibbling at the edges. And that alone makes these fairly distinct.We met Flandry in the first volume as a new ensign just figuring out how to be awesome, and more or less succeeding. By the time we reach him here he's basically flowered into full-on awesome, a captain and their go-to spy for when situations need one person to improvise wildly and somehow still save the day against all impossible odds. Except it doesn't quite work that way. The politics get messy, Flandry's boss is clearly trying to kill him by giving him the most impossible missions ever and even when he does succeed, Flandry is all too aware that he's barely holding back the tide of darkness that's about to fall upon the whole empire, probably after he's dead. Which could always be the next mission, the way it goes.There's four stories in this volume, all published at different times and probably not meant to be read in sequence. To that end they can be a bit disappointing, since there's really no character development of Flandry like we got in the sustained burst that was \\"Ensign Flandry\\" . . . here he's got his effectiveness down to a science and manages to make every situation work with a little pluck and elbow grease. Thus, a lot of the traits can seem like Anderson repeating himself, especially how Flandry always manages to find himself with a different girl in nearly every story, sometimes more than one if the mojo is working. There's no sense of him having to find himself or figure out skills that may become useful to him later, most of the time it's just a matter of him understanding the situation and figuring out which tools to use.Yet all four stories work mostly because Flandry is so likeable. Men want to be him and women want to be with him (heck, in two stories the people who started out trying to kill him admit that they kind of dig him too). Most of the stories have the same general structure, the Terran Empire is attempting to either acquire some leverage or prevent the Mersians from having some influence with said alien civilization, and thus Flandry and whoever the local commander is wind up jockeying in a weird chess game that involves fist fights and dames but comes across as more intelligent than that, like reading Doc Smith's Lensman stories with most of the optimism removed. Like \\"Ensign Flandry\\", but far more pronounced here, there's a very real and deliberate sense that Anderson is thinking through the consequences of these politics, where winning doesn't necessarily mean beating the bad guy but being the one who gets the trade agreement, or makes the other civilization like us more, where most of the problems can be won by not making the Terrans look bad or finding out stuff the other guy knows without letting him know you know it, something that comes across as twice as hard as merely blowing everything up in sight. It lends a sense of realism to the stories, which would otherwise be basic juvenile science-fiction with fairly straightforward plots. By avoiding some of the over-the-top tendencies of the genre (death-traps, hysterics) he dials down some of the pulse-pounding action but manages to create situations where the conflicts aren't as simple as they appear (in one neat sequence, Flandry and crew have to worry about if the Jovians are working with the Mersians or doing their own thing, either to screw the Terrans or get in good with the Mersians, or just for the sheer heck of it because who understands aliens anyway).But underneath it all is a surprisingly affecting melancholy. Unlike most of the other people alive, Flandry is all too aware that the darkest days of the empire are before them and it consumes most of his thoughts, giving him an extra drive beyond being generically good. He's working so that a future he probably won't see will last a little while longer, and in the interim distracts himself with food and drink and ladies, then rushes back in to try to avoid killing himself to make the light shine a little brighter. Or the light shines the same, it's the dark that recedes a tad. There's a brief speech in \\"Hunters of the Sky Cave\\" that accentuates this brilliantly, ending on a wonderfully evocative note that \\". . . we shiver a bit and swear a bit and go back to playing with a few bright dead leaves\\". It's not quite the same as that great grey British sense of impending slow collapse that pervades most of their work (in each story, at least, there's hope, doom is far in the future), but it gives these tales that would be simple on the surface a bit more edge and a bit more depth than the average SF of the time. Not experimental by any means but recommended for anyone who wants a little more thoughtfulness with their tales of spaceships and derring-do."},{"Title":"Agent of the Terran Empire","review":"Four stories that pits superagent Dominic Flandry against his Merseian nemesis/counterpart/duelling partner.

Yes, indeed:\\"It's been known a long time, even before space travel, that it's a... a mass of ariel pack ice. Lord, what a fantastic place to die! What happens is that at a certain height in the Jovian atmosphere, the pressure allows a red crystalline form of ice-- not the white stuff that we splash whisky onto, or the black alletrope down on the surface, or the super-dense variety in the mantle around the Jovian core. Here the pressure is right for red ice, and the air density is identical, so it floats... the Red Spot is a pack of flying glaciers, stretching broader than all Terra. And we've been crashed on one of them!\\" (106-107)Yes, we now know that the Red Spot is a perpetual hurricane. But I still have a fondness for Anderson's floating icebergs, as I do for Martian canals and Venusian seas. It's a great piece of imaginative detail that Anderson tosses off as almost a side adventure.For readers not familiar with this series, Sir Dominic Flandry is like the boy with his finger in the dike. He knows that the Terran Empire is weak and corrupt and that it will eventually fall. But he hopes to delay the fall so that the Long Night that follows will not be quite as long and dark.He is not a great undercover agent. He gets caught by the villains an awful lot, and many times his \\"cover\\" consists mainly of pretending to be a stupid, Colonel Blimp type of officer. Oddly enough, it seems to work fairly well for him.Most of the stories in this collection are early entries in Flandry's saga: \\"Tiger by the Tail\\" (_Planet_, 1951), \\"Warriers from Nowhere\\" (_Planet_, 1954 as \\"The Ambassadors of Flesh\\"), \\"Honorable Enemies\\" (_Future_ combined with _Science Fiction_, 1951), and \\"Hunters of the Sky Cave\\" (_Amazing_, 1959 as \\"A Handful of Stars\\"). They are not as smoothly written or as complex as some of the later stories in the series. But they have a certain amount of energy and zest.

Great space opera, perfect for a beer and chips afternoon at the beach or whatnot.Here, the Polesotechnic League has fallen (see Anderson's \\"Trader to the Stars,\\" \\"Mirkheim,\\" \\"Satan's World,\\" \\"The Trouble Twisters,\\" and several others) to be replaced by a decadent and corrupt Terran Empire, which rules millions of worlds in the Galaxy. It is opposed by all manner of villains, including the warlike Merseans. Everyone can see that the Terran Empire, like the Roman Empire before it, will oneday fall, and that this will be a bloody business costing billions of lives. This is the time in which Dominic Flandry, of the Imperial Terran Intelligence Service, finds himself. His purpose is to basically try to hold the Empire together, at least for his time. As he says, \\"what is the point of living in a decadent age if you don't know how to enjoy the decadence?\\" Great fun. Flandry is unforgettable, and these stories are enjoyable reads that are not in the least bit banal.

The only major caveat is that Ms. Romano has failed to grasp the concept of low fat - every recipe calls for way way too much fat, lard or combination of the two.

Here you have spelled out the rules and customs by which a duel is begun, when duelling is permissable, conditions for a duel, seconds, the actual conduct of the duel itself, and the finish of the duel. In addition to this, the author has admirably covered historical, cultural, and local variations. The variety of techniques and tools used in duelling are also described and illustrated.This book sets straight modern misconceptions about this ancient practice. The duel is an affair of honor, between two men of honor. It is not a matter of ego gratification, it is simply the ultimate statement of whether or not a gentleman is willing to stand behind his words and actions no matter the consequences. There is also an unstated faith in the knightly ideal that the right must prevail in acts of single combat under the eyes of God. There should be no intimidation involved, for no duel can be fought without mutual consent. No one can be forced into a duel. To attempt to force, or shame, another into an affair of honor is an affront to honor itself and a cause for complete censure from polite society.In the days when duelling was practiced, society tended to be much more civil. A gentlemen knew that he could be called to ultimate account for his words, therefore he did not speak carelessly. Moreover, unless proven otherwise, one knew that a gentleman's word was truly his bond. Gentlemen were also much more certain and thoughtful of their convictions, for they had to be sure if they truly believed in such convictions strongly enough to defend them if called upon to do so."},{"Title":"The Kabbalah","review":"I was interested in this book cause it kept being cited in the Golden Dawn and Kabbalah books I'd been reading.

Hermeticism gets barely a mention. Franck maps out what Kabbalah is, and where it came from. I found his discussion of the Supernals to be most enlightening, seeing stuff here I'd never come across anywhere else. His explanation of the other triads was excellent as well.His examination of where Kabbalah came from was less interesting to me, but might be most interesting for others. While he notes resemblances between Kabbalah and Platonism, Neoplatonism, Philo, and Christianity, he rejects the notion of any close connection between these and the formation Kabbalah. Instead he posits that Kabbalah was influenced by Zoroasterism during the Hebrews' sojourn in Babylon. I found his argument convincing."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Haven't read it yet, but I look forward to it.

Dickens' characters here are more cartoon than ever. The villains are, to a man, totally beyond redemption; the heroes are goodness beyond heaven's greatest ambitions. (In fact, the good people are so sickeningly good, you almost start cheering for the awful uncle Ralph!) Plot lines run off into empty corners. The travelling play actors take up a hundred pages, but contribute nothing to the plot. Mr Lillyvick, the water clerk, and his patient family (patiently waiting for him to die and leave them his money) pop up regularly but provide nothing more sthan ome mildly humourous diversions. People die conveniently. Everything seems to go the way of our hero. And Dickens' usual set of amazing coincidences are more amazing than ever. In no other Dickens novel is it so clear that he is writing for a periodical (and paid, I suspect, by the word.) Chapter introductions go on for pages, dead-end corners are written in everywhere. Still worth reading, but not to be considered among Dickens' best work"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This product is the best!

THe amazon KIndle is the very best invention ever made"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I read criticisms of this book that it is not one of Dickens' best. For me, it is up there with Great Expectations and David Copperfield as one of his most enjoyable novels (A Christmas Carol is a short story).The social axe that Dickens had to grind in this story is man's injustice to children. Modern readers my feel that his depiction of Dotheboys Academy is too melodramatic. Alas, unfortunately, it was all too real. Charles Dickens helped create a world where we can't believe that such things happen. Dickens even tell us in an introduction that several Yorkshire schoolmasters were sure that Wackford Squeers was based on them and threatened legal action.The plot of Nicholas Nickleby is a miracle of invention. It is nothing more than a series of adventures, in which Nicholas tries to make his way in the world, separate himself from his evil uncle, and try to provide for his mother and sister.There are no unintersting characters in Dickens. Each one is almost a charicature. This book contains some of his funniest characters.To say this is a melodrama is not an insult. This is melodrama at its best. Its a long book, but a fast read."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Dickens is as much a social critic as a storyteller in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby,&quot; which basically pits the noble young man who gives the novel its title against his wickedly scheming rich uncle Ralph in a grand canvas of London and English society. At the beginning of the novel, Nicholas's father has just died, leaving his family destitute, and Uncle Ralph, a moneylender (specifically, a usurer) and a venture capitalist of sorts, greedy and callous by the requirements of the story, reluctantly feels obligated to help them, and does so by securing for Nicholas a position as headmaster's assistant at a school for boys in Yorkshire, and for Nicholas's sister Kate a job as a dressmaker for a foppish clown named Mr. Mantalini, while Nicholas and Kate's scatterbrained mother is left in her room to mutter incoherent reminiscences about random events in her life.This Yorkshire school, called Dotheboys Hall, turns out to be little more than a prison in the way it is run by its headmaster, an improbably cruel cyclops named Wackford Squeers who badly mistreats and miseducates the students. Now, historical records indicate that while Squeers may be an exaggeration, his school is definitely not, Dickens intending to warn his readers of the day that some such places were indeed that bad. The duration at Dotheboys Hall constitutes only a small portion of the novel, but Squeers and his grotesque family reappear throughout the rest of the story like gremlins who are always causing bad things to happen to our hero.Nicholas's fortunes after escaping from Dotheboys Hall with Smike, a particularly abused older boy whom Squeers had worked like a slave, revolve largely around the circumstances of Kate and Uncle Ralph, who is starting to view the young man as a nuisance inclined to interfere in his machinations. Having been vilified by Squeers for his brash conduct at the Hall, Nicholas takes to the road with Smike in tow, where in Portsmouth they meet a thespian named Vincent Crummles who persuades the fugitives to become actors in his theatrical troupe; this episode, the strangest of Nicholas's adventures, seems more than anything else to reflect Dickens's own interest in the theater. Eventually Nicholas returns to London and gets a job as a clerk at a counting-house owned by a pair of merchants, the cheery Cheeryble brothers, where he encounters a beautiful girl in distress who will become a major factor in the final showdown between Nicholas and his uncle.The supporting characters are numerous and extremely colorful to the point of cartoonishness, such as Miss La Creevy, a talkative spinster and amateur painter; John Browdie, the gruff Yorkshireman whose dialect is so severe he needs a translator; Sir Mulberry Hawk, the arrogant suitor whom Kates tries to rebuff; Newman Noggs, Uncle Ralph's benevolent clerk who helps our hero when he can. In fact, the most curious thing about the characterization in this novel is that its main characters are almost completely devoid of personality; Nicholas and Kate, perhaps being by necessity innocuous paragons of virtue, are practically mere mannequins to whom people talk and things happen. Even the sickly and wretchedly humble Smike, the mystery of whose parentage becomes a part of the plot, does not induce as much pity as Dickens probably intended because he seems trapped in a story that doesn't really want him except as a device to expose even more of Uncle Ralph's villainy.There is much to like in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;: The prose is finely detailed, the satire of various types of characters is on target, the humor is sharp -- there is a particularly funny and suspenseful scene with an unexpected outcome in which Nicholas dispatches Newman to discover the identity of the mysterious beautiful girl. And there is much not to like: The plot coincidences are ridiculously contrived in typical Dickensian fashion; the drama is manipulative, designed to cheer the reader all the more when the author comes to rescue the heroes from their despair and hopelessness; the sentimentality is overwhelming -- by the end &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; becomes so saccharine it makes &quot;David Copperfield&quot; look like &quot;Blood Meridian.&quot; But Dickens remains eminently readable because of his flair for portraying and celebrating human oddity in all its varieties, his knowledge that life is all about taking the bad with the good, and his sense that fiction is all about maximizing the contrast."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Fresh from his success on \\"Oliver Twist\\" as a political satirist of note, Dickens turns his sights toward the abuse of Yorkshire schools - a national disgrace - in which children were effectively abandoned for a fee. Neglect, physical abuse, malnourishment, cold, and ill health were endemic. This political attack becomes the setting for an expansive tale of the Nickleby family and their ongoing struggle against the evil of their uncle Ralph. The usual collection of sub-plots, comedy and Dickensian characters rounds out a lengthy but fulfilling read that nobody will be sorry they started.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"My first taste of Dickens was the appalingly long David Copperfield as a freshman in high school. I detested it, swore I would never read Dickens again, only to find that my junior year held in store for me what would become one of my favorite novels, Great Expectations, a book heinously bastardized years later by a 'modernized' film adaptation, with Anne Bancroft being the only redeeming feature.Through the years since high school, I have begun to read Dickens of my own free will, and have greatly enjoyed his works.Nicholas Nickelby, one of my all time favorites, is a wonderful novel, typical Dickens, chock full of characters, plots, satire, and story. Nicholas and his immediate family are the 'black sheep' of the Nickelby name. Humble, gentle, and common in the eyes of their well-to-do relative, Uncle Ralph Nickelby, who denounces Nicholas as a boy, and man, who will never amount to anything.In typical Dickens fashion, Nicholas encounters adversity first at a boarding school, then in society, as he forges a name for himself. Along the way he befriends many, enrages some, and invokes the wrath of his Uncle Ralph, determined to prove himself right in bemoaning the shortcomings of his nephew.One point of interest in this novel for me is the major revelation that comes toward the end involving the character of Smike. Throughout the novel he is loveable, pitiable, and utterly realistic, and his significance to the life of Nicholas, as revealed in the final chapters, is a true plot twist, and a charming, if not bittersweet, realization.For anyone forced to read Dickens early in life, if you appreciate quality satire and an engaging look at the London society of more than 125 years ago, visit this novel sometime, it is one of Dicken's finest."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This is a good introduction to Dickens for those who haven't yet read any. The plot is interesting, the characters memorable, and the twists and turns are less convoluted than of some of his other works, such as Tale of Two Cities or Great Expectations. Nicholas is a bit too good to be true, but he does have a quick temper that gets the best of him at times. Descriptions of a Yorkshire boarding school are rather grim, but the author's comments indicate that it is a fairly accurate representation. This book has it all, good guys in tough circumstances, bad guys of various sorts, social and political commentary, and a love story or two."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This is a very funny novel in some sections. Imagine an older Oliver Twist, about 19 or 20 or so, but handsome, and with a temper, and with a strong outgoing personality, and one who can act and do all kinds of things. He has lots of self confidence and a beautiful sister, and throw in an obnoxious and rich uncle and a dotty mother. Yes, it is very, very entertaining.I bought the Wordsworth Classic version but would recommend the Penguin Classic version, and recommend that purchase highly. This is among Dickens's somewhat forgotten novel but still among his best. It is another masterpiece that brings together all of Dickens's writing skills with a great story. I would rate it slightly behind David Copperfield but it remains one of the most original and interesting of Dickens's novels somewhat on par with Oliver Twist.As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens's 22 novels and longer short stories, and set up a Listmania list. As a suggestion, avoid the Penguin Popular Classics with the plain green covers (I bought two). They fall apart and do not stand up to a read, especially books over 500 pages in length. The Regular Penguin Classics with the photo or painting on the front are excellent and some have maps and illustrations (drawings). The Wordsworth Classics are not as good, and some are illustrated.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system.All of Dickens's experiences come together in his novels. The Pickwick Papers, his first novel, is mostly humorous. But the next one, Oliver Twist, is a dark novel set in the crime plagued streets of early 19th century London. Next in novel number three, he changes back to a more humorous novel which is the present work. This is a big novel, about 750 pages or so - but the pages fly by. The protagonists are Nicholas, who is almost 20, his sister Kate, a few years younger, and his uncle Ralph Nickleby. Their father has died and Nicholas and Kate come to London with their mother to seek aid from the wealthy uncle. The uncle finds them minimum paying jobs, and that creates a good story. It is a novel with many common features that we expect from Dickens with things such as a school where the children are beaten, but it has many funny parts and it is complicated by the uncle's financial dealings.Having read many of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best as a work of literature and rate Oliver Twist as close behind and a must read. The latter book was read by Queen Victoria and Karl Marx, and both enjoyed the read. The novel had a far reaching social impact. Nicholas Nickleby is another gem and well worth the read, but lacks the social bite of Oliver Twist, and lacks the enthusiasm of David Copperfield, but it is hilarious."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I would say this is &quot;David Copperfield&quot;'s B-side. It is a typical Dickensian book: the life of the Nickleby family from the death of the father until they are rich and happy. One of the most important parts of the book is the study of the horrible boarding schools of Yorkshire, where Nicholas is sent. We can read the dirty intrigues of Uncle Ralph, the adventures of Nicholas and Smikes as travelling actors (a world Dickens came to know very well), the kindness of the brethren Cheeryble.Definitely, this is not one of Dickens's best novels, but nevertheless it is fun to read. The characters are good to sanctity or bad to abjection. The managing of the plot is masterful and the dramatic effects wonderful. It includes, as usual with Dickens, an acute criticism of social vices of his time (and ours): greed, corruption, the bad state of education. In spite of everything, this is a novel very much worth reading, since it leaves the reader a good aftertaste: to humanism, to goodness."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Dickens' ability to write outrageously hilarious scenes consistently leaves me floored (and fangirling!) and /Nicholas Nickleby/ is no exception in this respect. Dickens is also tremendously skilled at rendering poetic, heartbreakingly beautiful sentimental scenes, and those also find their place in the plot of /NN/.This is definitely earlier Dickens - he hasn't quite attained the writing maturity that characterizes what I consider his masterpieces (David Copperfield, Little Dorrit, Bleak House, Great Expectations) but it is nevertheless a wonderful read. Early Dickens is still masterful writing.My only qualm with the text is a qualm I have with Dickens in general, his female leads are so bland. Kate Nickleby is basically another Agnes -- too passive and good for me to like. The rest of the characters, however, are wonderfully rendered (Newman Noggs! Smike (sob)! and of course, the Squeers!).The Kindle edition was relatively free of typos (at least, I don't remember too many of them marring my reading)."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This book is best, out of all the Dickens books. If you should just read one of Dicken's, it should be this one.This captures all of the suspense that he creates in any of his books. I reccomend this boook to anyone who is looking for a long and satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby is a marvelous novel. It is the young Dickens at his best. I almost feel guilty for giving it four stars, but giving it five would be unfair, I think, because his later works, such as Great Expectations, are bettter. The novel is written enthusiastically and contains some of Dickens' best humor. I especially found funny the character Mr.Lillyvick, the revered and dignified water clerk. And I will never forget Ralph Nickleby. Mr.Squeers and Arthur Gride were detestable and colorful villains, but they pale before Ralph Nickleby. He is such a cold and heartless character that he steals nearly every scene he is in. He has a certain magnetism that most of Dickens' good characters lack. And his suicide at the novel's end is so perfectly written that I read over it several times before I finished the novel. My only problem with the book was Nicholas's lack of psychology, but let us remember that this was written by a young man, not the mature artist of Great Expectations and Our Mutual Friend. The novel's strengths easily make up for its weaknesses. Nicholas Nickleby will be enjoyed by fans of Dickens and all other readers for centuries to come."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses. The protagonist's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama, comic relief, political satire, class comedy, social criticism, and domestic farce, they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray, to the minutest nuance, an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics. The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate. Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses, and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world, to be separated from the people he loves, and to be proscribed like a criminal. The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life, the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice.When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father's death, he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor. But Ralph Nickleby, a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is, demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred, and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows. The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed. It's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains. He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred. He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers' Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, as an assistant master.The cruelty of Squeers, who's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper, Nicholas has been an unwilling witness. The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling. The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation. The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas, who interferes with the schoolmaster's flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school.Not only does Ralph persuade Nicholas' family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty, he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual, lecherous, ribald and vulgar terms. She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity. The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister. The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled.As the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains, Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous, memorable, and true to life. Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire, theatrical success, courtship, family farce, and chicanery. The most significant character is no doubt Smike, whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend. Nicholas' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel's hero, whose domestic virtues, affections, compassion, and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice.NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch. Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty, filthiness, and despotism in the boarding schools. Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy, whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self-respect. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one's remorse. Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients, he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do.In a sense, Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society. He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless. Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy. But in the effort to undertake the good deeds, he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes. In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him. But Ralph's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat, nourished on his interference with all his schemes.NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues. Woven in one man's aspiration to restore family's ancestral dignity is Dickens' own musing, monologues, teachings on the soul, the life, and the moral. The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency, sobriety and indignation."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Dickens' novels will spike and plummet emotions. In this book, characters were created that annoy, yet add a needed sense of humor (Mrs. Nickleby for example), and there are those which grate on you- boil your blood, really- but without them you wouldn't adore Mr. Nicholas Nickleby so much.I was caught by Great Expectations from page one. The opening was more entertaining and it kept up its momentum throughout. This book took me longer to get into, but once I did it was good.One failing was the close of Nicholas' love life. You read a thick, burly novel like this and grow very attached to the lead character. He falls in love with someone without knowing her at all (so YOU don't know her at all, except that she is pretty) and then in the very end, you do not get to see through Dickens' words how it plays out between the lovers- you get to imagine that yourself (which is fine, I have an imagination, but I like to see these things in ink and through the eyes of a master of the craft). Instead, the ending focuses on an unlikely romance between two somewhat present but not strong characters in the novel, and you get this \\"here you go\\" summary of the more prevalent characters' lives."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Long, but well written.

It's about the coming of age of young Nicholas who, through his many trials and adventures grows to manhood in an heroic way. As Dickens does so well, the book is shot through with a variety of characters, situations of greed, inequality, cruelty, suffering....and ultimately justice and redemption for those who deserve it.

You either love his work or critique it as simplistic plot lines. However, his novels embrace the period in Great Britian when, while its empire touched all 4 corners of the Globe, back home the Social Classes had much suffering at the lower levels. The way children were treated then would be called neglect and abuse in our current time.Yes Dickens is predictable and Yes his novels have common threads to each other, but he allows us a window into a time where the poor and children were exploited. He paints a picture of the landscape and surroundings of London and the countryside in such a way as you would want to be there, or avoid it all together. One of my all time favorite authors, this book shows why so many waited for the next installment back in his day. Todays Soap Operas, Paperbacks and Mini Series have nothing on a Good Dickens Novel - I highly reccomend the reader get back to Dickens and forget that you were foced to read his works back in Middle School.

The usual ingredients are present, however. There is an abundance of characters, all rather one-dimensional, perfectly good, perfectly evil or just unimportant and comical, such as Mrs. Nickleby and her mad neighbour. The plot is at once convoluted, completely unrealistic and thoroughly predictable. Somehow, unfortunately, things just don't gel. The result appears drawn out and simply not on a par with say Oliver Twist or Great Expectations.The narrator has unquestionable talent in coming up with different voices for the multitude of various characters. His tone however is overly solemn and he does not bring out the irony and humour which Dickens includes here as he does in other works. For some characters, such as those from Yorkshire, the narrator's accent and enunciation are such that the words are actually difficult to understand.There is certainly a degree of interest to this novel but to a contemporary audience an abridged version will certainly be preferable."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"When I decided to read Nicholas Nickleby I was told by others to read greater novels to enjoy the Charles Dickens experience such as David Copperfield, Bleak House, or Our Mutual Friend. While I was nearly convinced to read these (I haven't yet but I will) I stuck to my decision and I have to say I am glad I did. This novel was one of the greatest reading experiences I have ever had. I loved each and every page and I can see why people wrote that they did not want it to end. This novel was only my second Dickens book after The Pickwick Papers. I have sense enjoyed Great Expectations, A Christmas Carol, and Oliver Twist. For those who are loathe to read such a long novel I can assure you that once you really get into Nicholas Nickleby the pages will fly as you read. The same was true for the other Charles Dickens novels I read. I am a real fan now and I look forward to David Copperfield next!"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby isn't the best book Dickens ever wrote, but it is one of the most entertaining. Ostensibly, it's the story of how, after his father's death, Nicholas (and his sister and mother) rose in the world, achieved success in life in business, and had adventures on the way, but it's much, much more than that.It's the minor characters that make a lot of this book; from the Kenwigses to the Crummles, Henrietta Petowker to Madame Mantalini, the minor characters are by turn pathetic and eccentric, but always hilarious. Nicholas himself is a likable character, but it's the characters he interacts with, and his weird adventures, that make this book as funny and entertaining as it is.Overall, I'd say this was a good gateway book to Dickens; it's very melodramatic, but it never feels like a soap opera; Dickens puts a new spin on everything from government workers being courted by lobbyists to working conditions under incompetent bosses. It's long, but the pages fly by, and it's not as dark as David Copperfield or as formal as A Tale of Two Cities. If you haven't ever read Dickens, this might be a good book to start with- and if you have, this is a must-read book that will keep you chuckling for hours."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby might not be the best book ever written (certainly some other book wins that prize (and it is likely that that book is widely available)), but it is still worth reading. It is long, yes, but it has plenty of things to recommend it: interesting characters, comic interludes, and a touching (if a bit sentimental conclusion). Perhaps the book's main problem is that Nicholas Nickleby (the character, not the eponymous book) is a bit too good. His character doesn't change, and his probity can become annoying. One imagines that Dickens could have fixed this shortcoming quite easily: he could have had Nicholas drink a bit too much and stagger around; he could have had Nicholas pick the pocket of some Londoner (he needs money, after all); he could have given Nicholas a hook for a hand (a device he used to great effect in a later novel); he could have had Nicholas use a few bad words (which perhaps is unlikely given that Dickens wrote in the 19th century, though one might suggest that an editor could jazz up a new edition); or any other numerous things. As it stands, Nicholas is the least interesting character. It's a good thing that many other characters (e.g. Newman Noggs, Ralph Nickleby, Mulberry Hawk, Smike, Wakford Squeers (Jr. and Sr.), Mrs. Nickelby, Vincent Crummles, and pretty much every other character other than Nicholas himself) carry the book. Except for Nicholas' sister; she's too good as well. In fact, one of the more annoying aspects of Dickens work is his brother-sister pairs (see Dombey and Son, Hard Times). Still, you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"A lot of people think that \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" is a bit of disorganized confusion, but I think it's a pretty good effort. It is one of Dickens' earlier works, and he certainly did get better as time went on, but there is greatness here too. Dickens is noted for his social commentaries with his books, and with this one he took shots at an actual private school - Dotheby's Hall and it's master Wackford Squeer - and the book actually did cause reforms to be implemented in the infamous school. The hero Nicholas is the handsome, warm-hearted son of a widow whose husband's death left her and her two children impoverished. With the help of a shrewd, miserly uncle, Nicholas obtains a post at Dotheby's Hall. Nicholas finds conditions at the school impossible to tolerate, so he thrashes his employer and quits in disgust. The rest of the book outlines Nicholas' life in London. There are a lot of characters in this book, and it's difficult to keep them all straight, but Dickens' skill for characterization shows itself even in this early work, and the reader gets to know and love each one. The plot is a bit melodramatic and complicated, but the characters almost carry that failing through. Certainly worth a read."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Again and again I had the sense of a young writer reveling in his powers -- his creation of a teeming multitude of characters and their antics and adventures, his magical use of classic rhetorical tropes (such as metonymy, irony of various types, etc.), his ringing of many emotional notes. One feels that Dickens must have been amazed and delighted by his own profuse gifts. I'd hope that many people would read this book while they themselves are young!As has been said by someone before, I believe, one doesn't learn much that is new from Dickens, but one encounters a prodigious range of events and persons that relate to the universal experiences of human life -- of being bullied or being a bully, of being too trusting or not trusting enough, of having to resolve conflicting duties, and much more.I started reading Dickens about 25 years ago &amp; only recently got to this one, and found it even better than I expected it to be."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"The narrator does an admirable job of bringing this classic to life. The story is one of Dickens top 4 or 5. The characterization is amazing. To have created such distinct and complex characters and to draw such wonderful life lessons seem quite beyond modern authors. An adventure, a romp. I laughed, I cried. The foot-stomping, no holds-barred, thrill ride of the summer!"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"One of the most glorious books by Dickens, this is the story of Nicholas Nickleby and his struggles to find his rightful place in the helter-skelter of early Victorian England. Scenes of brilliantly theatrical melodrama and broad, attractive comedy jockey for position in this engaging novel, showing Dickens at his best : as both a social crusader and a sharp-eyed commentator on the foibles of the world he lived in. A marvelous, rewarding book"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Charles Dickens is my favorite author and this is another excellent story! I have all his books, and they are all well-written, entertaining and intellectual. I love how people are his subject and he is a master of words. Every person ought to read Dickens if only for the understanding of grammar you will receive."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"When I first met Dickens in some dark library in the halcyon days, back when I wasn't expected to earn my keep and act sensibly, I didn't give what it takes to appreciate Dickens. In school I read Great Expectation and Tale of Two Cities reluctantly, almost as if in reading them I was scaring off all of the patience I could muster in reading Steinbeck or Kesey or something more savory.When I picked this up, read it, and decided to review it, a roadblock loomed: Did I love this book because it was one of Dicken's earliest and seemed to nonethelss be his strongest and most entertaining book? Was it this and/or the fact that reading the two aforementioned books cover to cover, word for word, was a silent and unconscious expression of my secret love for Dickens? Or was it just the book itself that elicted this almost euphoric mild-enthusiasm?Whatever the reason for it, I enjoyed this book. The storyline is dynamic and diverting, but the pace of the prose is leisurely. It is, after all, close to 1000 pages long. The plot is that of a Dickens novel we've all either read or heard in abstract: Nicholas, the son of a poor relation in the family, sets out on some adventures, thrashes Wackford Squeers, befriends Yorkshiremen and joins an acting troupe and saves a helpless ward from abuse and misery, comes back and protects and saves his family from the evil usurer uncle Ralph, on and on until you wonder how a line of narrative so simplistic can encompass 900 pages. What kept me at this book, even at those rare moments at which the pat and summary triumph of good over evil being repeated over and over almost tried my patience, were the caricatures. Dicken's forte was always in disabling his enemies with words. There are the host of villains to be cut down here, both by humor and by scathing realism: Poor schools, the British welfare system, and moneylenders are given bitter portraits in Wackford Squeers and his squalid Yorkshire school, and in both Ralph and Arthur Gride, who vies with Nicholas for the hand of Madeline Bray. Squeers himself is a comic figure, despite his violent tendencies. He is a scathing example of what Dickens seemed to feel was the cancer of Victorian society: A stupid man with intellectual affectations, a man crual to children who nonetheless treats his own children more or less affectionately, bringing into critical light the common family man. Mr. Mantalini is an on-target depiction of an indiscreet loverboy, a man who abuses the trust of those who most love him and tolerate him. His downfall is both comic and morally justified. The story is leavened as well with many of Dickens' trademark \\"nice guys\\": Both the protagonist and his young, consumptive friend Smike are aided on their journeys by Dickens' idea of good hearted people: The wealthy but compassionate Cheeryble brothers and their jovial clerk Tim, Miss La Creevy, a wonderful soinster who shields Mrs. aNickleby and Nicholas' sister Kate from Ralph as much as she can, John Browdie, the Yorkshireman responsible for both Nicholas' and Smike's salvation (one with money, the other in an even more admirable way), and Mr. Newman Noggs, Ralph's lovable clerk who aids Nicholas in his every pursuit. Here a problem occurs to me: It's the broad brush syndrome. Think of this: Squeers, by his very nature, can't do good, is unadulterated evil, and gets comeuppance-The end. Same for Ralph, same for Arthur Gride. Nicholas, Smike, Noggs, La Creevy, etc., are all virtuous, models of probity and Christian ideals. They are lavishly rewarded.OK: Why, Charlie, is everything that clear cut? I agree that Squeers is a worthless human being, and deserves what he gets. But is that the only dimension to the man? The same can be said of his family, and of Arthus Gride the suspicious usurer, and of Mr. Snawley, who tries to bring Smike back to the abusive Squeers. Ralph is not so easy to pin: He is seen as both intelligent and somewhat compassionate, though it is only toward the end of the book that this is seen. The point: If this is the only dimension to evil people, namely their transgressions and wickedness, and if Nicholas and his friends are necessarily good and infallible, why does it take 900 pages for the malevolent to be thwarted and the good saluted? And why can't the old addage \\"Virtue is Its Own Reward\\" never explored and/or established? After all, if Dostoevsky taught me anything, it's that the good and bad both get knocks. Golyadkin or the Man From Underground or Raskolnikov may do terrible things or could be beautiful and pure, but they all take a fall sometime. Some fellow reviewers will probably condemn me for \\"impatience\\". It's simply not a matter of impatience: It's a matter of artistic and situational credibility. If the good guys always win, why are the formalities of plot and character development and rising and falling action and hyperbole even needed? Just call all the characters static, apportion each his deserved share, and don't spend 900 pages moralizing.I enjoyed this book, though. Pessimist that I am, I found my enthusiasm refreshed by the good-hearted machinations of Noggs against Ralph. I laughed heartily at Mr. Mantalini, pondering at the same time how Mrs. Mantalini could tolerate him so long even as he wrecked her business and drove her near bankruptcy. When Miss La Creevy and Tim Linkinwater married, I shed a tear, though I later snickered at my impressionability. Such characters as the basically good Lord Frederick Verisopht, who goes from villain to decent human, renewed my interest. I really did enjoy this book. I just didn't think that the black and white was as appealing as more colorful and well rounded characters and scenarios would have been."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"&quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is one of the best works of Charles Dickens overall. This novel is about the brave adventures of Nicholas, his sister Kate and their mother. The story begins at about the time Nicholas's father dies and the family has to encounter the struggle of life with no imminent prospects of fortune. At this time they make an appeal to the brother of Nicholas's father, Mr.Ralph Nickleby. From this point on, the parallel developments of the honest Nickleby family and their villanous uncle begin to unfold. With many twists and turns the story is as captivating as any of the author's best books. The tale is characteristically filled with the Dickinsian people such as Mr.Vincent Crummles and his family, in particular the &quot;phenomenon&quot;, Arthur Gride, Newman Noggs and others. Overall, this book is a pleasure to read and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in good story-telling."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This is not exactly &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; or &quot;David Copperfield.&quot; But remember, no matter how good any author is, not every single thing they write can be a masterpiece, and there are things that make this 3rd novel of Dickens an intriguing study. Strong drama and cynical humour is present. The villainous Squeers foreshadows fascinating villains like Carker and Murderstone. Ralph is a complex character. He is devious, but Dickens does not let us forget that he is human. Mrs Nickleby is overly emotional and naive, but she is heroic in her own way. Vincent Crummles and his group allow us to see Dickens' interest in theatre and performing (which he would eventually do some work in). Nicholas is a well drawn protagonist. He is steadfast and admirable, but at times we may feel his actions are severe and uncalled for. Kate is not Dickens' best character, but she certainly foreshadows later heroines like Florence Dombey, Louisa Gradgrind, and Lizzie Hexham. Noggs is fine as a good samaritan. Fanny and Matilda give us an interesting chapter of girly talk, and Fanny (Squeers' daughter) allows us to see the fury of a scorned woman. Even in this 3rd novel, Dickens shows his ability to create superb images, irony, and surprise events. The pace does get sluggish at times, but other than that, this creation gives little scope for complaint. So while &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is not a masterpiece, it certainly helps us to see the greatness that was to come."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I have read quite a lot of the classics; &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and so on.

However, I was not so impressed with &quot;...Expectations&quot;. I read this after I read &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and was dissapointed. I was simply not drawn into the &quot;...Expectations&quot; story as much as &quot;Nicholas...&quot;.

One million words would probably still be insufficient, for I would simply keep thinking of things I love about it. As the title says, this book is my very own transcendent experience. I don't know if one has very many of those during a lifetime. Probably not. But The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby has changed MY life (and adventures) forever. It's almost always hovering somewhere in my mind, whether in the back of at the very forefront. Every conversation incites some reference to it that no one else understands. I've fallen in love with Nicholas; yes, it's true. Something I never thought I'd do. The people (not characters, people) in this story are so close to me I feel that I know them. They're friends and so much more. Can I sound any cheesier? Or any more cliched? I don't really care. It's all true; every word. This book will stay with me for my entire life.

This review is about Robert Whitfield. Although I'm not an avid book listener (maybe 30 within my life so far) I found the reading of Dickens by Robert Whitfield to be absolutely fantastic! There are many good voice actors out there but Robert is the best I've ever heard. Every aspect of the reading is amazing... from the different voices to his clear narrative reading of the English language the way it was meant to be spoken.

Nicholas Nickleby is at the center of this pageant. Through this novel, Dickens creates a universe that is unfair, and yet maintains the purest workings of justice. Sure, the characters are a tad slip-shod (except for Miss La Creevy, who has to be one of Dickens' finest female creations), and yes, the plot is a boarder-line monstrosity of reality. Yet Dickens emotionally goads us into entertainment with a rush of creativity that perhaps remains unsurpassed throughout the Dickensian canon. In essence, we fall in love with the ridiculousness, even when we can't fully accept it."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Money versus virture, poverty set against wealth, hero against the ills of society, plus the combined forces of the duty to family and bond between sister and brother. Any Dickens novel will bring you the perfection of character, the ordinary individual through thought and deed becomes the extraordinaryThrow in a sarcasm still alive today, mainly through the use of superlatives which over emphasize the importance of \\"Lord somebody\\" and deftly turn these titled aristocrats from dieties of fortune into over inflated balloons. Dickens, in a time of Victorian sensibility, turned to an arsenal of adjectives for dealing with the long engrained antediluvian British nobility. Exquisite descriptions allowing the reader to visit each character as if you were in the literal sense, sitting in their living rooms observing their lives right down to the tea kettle whistle.All Dickens novels are loaded with the stuff of glory, but never too far fetched that he can't drive home the plight of the impoverished, the cycles of poverty and the deep suffering he witnesses daily in the streets of London. What better way to emphasize injustice than to contrast sick and orphaned children with rich old misers?Comparing his observations on injustice, you will find it relevant today, in a different guise perhaps, from Lord Somebody and his buffoons in parliament to our corporate welfare state and over saturated market economy.How does one survive a world as cruel as one directed by a corrupt guardian uncle in the money lending business? Only Nicholas Nickelby can answer that. With nothing but youth on his side and a good upbringing in the country, Nicholas learns his values will need to be tested at the risk of his own safety and reputation. As he defends his character and the honor of his family, not to mention saving a few lives of those much worse off than he, he gains enough good karma to last several lifetimes as he follows his heart to the wealth that awaits him like a holy grail. Like any hero, he sets off a chain reaction of good luck for his family and aquaintances, until the book exhausts itself in becoming one riotous, joyous celebration of life. As one last task,Nicholas with all his honor, attracts the only one thing he is missing, an equally flawless damsel to be rescued from a cruel, self centered father.Unlike his later works, this one is brimming with sweet hyperbolic idealism and exageration, like youthful optimism, it does not carry the same intimate character intropsection he develops later.It is worth it to settle into this novel to witness the sharp black and white juxtapose of the good character versus corrupt.Whereas Dickens balanced this with gray areas between rich and poor in other novels, this work is direct, simple and explicit in it's quest for moral ground. Wealth matches wealth of spirit and Dickens can make it infectious with his keen observations of human behavior and his absolute dedication to matching his words to his heart."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I usually love a Dickens novel. This one is so choppy and boring that I may not even finish reading it. As a reading teacher, that goes against everything I believe about literature."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"The important thing is to know that this is earlier Dickens- thus, not as good as some of the masterpieces that came later. I enjoyed this at times and found the comedy exceptional. However, sometimes the novel veers into outright sentimentality. The hero and Kate are overly perfect. I am not saying anything other critcs of Dickens haven't already said. What makes this book supremely fun is the assemblage of characters and the ridiculous situations. Mrs. Nickleby made me laugh out loud. Read it and see the beginnings of Dickensian greatness."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"&quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; was Dickens' third serialized novel and was complete by the time he was 27 years old. It is a spacious and interesting coming-of-age tale, but really tells the story of the Nickleby family as a whole rather than just the honorable young gentleman. Once his father dies of a &quot;broken heart&quot; after going bankrupt in the stock market, Nicholas must find a way to provide for his beautiful and virtuous sister Kate, and his kind-hearted, self-absorbed martyr of a mother (think a less outrageous version of Elizabeth Bennett's mother in Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;). Their lives could all be made comfortable instantly if the dead Mr. Nickleby's brother Ralph weren't such a bitter, pitiless and hatefully cruel creature, but then Nicholas wouldn't have such a strong nemesis.Nicholas takes jobs as an assistant schoolmaster, a traveling actor and a bookkeeper, all the while looking out for the honor of his family: biting his tongue when he has to and kicking some ungentlemanly derriere when he feels he absolutely must. The speeches Dickens gives his characters when they have to stick up for themselves are particularly moving, even gripping, even if the circumstances are sometimes too melodramatic for the modern taste. I didn't mind the melodrama myself, but rather enjoyed the way Dickens moves from sentence to long sentence as he was still developing his style which would reach greater heights in books like &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; one of only three other Dickens novels I have read. As long and relaxingly enjoyable as it is, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; becomes something of a living, breathing friend to the reader, guaranteeing it won't be the last of what Dickens called his &quot;children&quot; that I will come to know."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"A handsome young man who finds himself the sole support of his mother and sister after his father's death, Nicholas Nickleby is hopeful that his uncle, Ralph Nickleby, a weathy speculator in London, will assist the unfortunate family in its hour of need. Ralph's cruel response, however, is to make Nicholas the assistant headmaster at a notoriously abusive school in northern England and to make his beautiful sister a seamstress and part-time hostess at his own parties. There she is subjected to innuendo and to the drunken intentions of men whose accounts help keep Ralph a wealthy man.This early novel is pure melodrama, with the good characters being unbelievably good, and the evil being unbelievably bad. The multiple adventures of Nicholas through a variety of settings, both in the city and in the countryside, create a broad picture of life in England in the 1830s. Nicholas's job as assistant headmaster exposes him to the horrors of so-called boarding schools for young boys, which were essentially warehouses for young children where they were forced into physical labor, kept malnourished, and beaten regularly. These abuses, based on Dickens's personal observations, so horrified his readers that major reforms of these schools eventually resulted. When Nicholas, in frustration, finally beats headmaster Wackford Squeers for his abuse of the children, Nicholas and Smike, a crippled boy who has been the headmaster's slave, escape together.Their interlude with a traveling theatrical company, led by friendly Vincent Crummles, gives Nicholas much needed emotional support and provides Smike with a temporary home--until Nicholas is called to return to England to rescue his sister from unwanted attentions fostered by her uncle. Eventually Nicholas works in London for the saintly Cheeryble brothers and meets Madeline Bray, the love of his life.Long recognized as one of Dickens's best novels for its wide assortment of characters, the novel mixes delightful humor with the pathos. The complex plot employs coincidence and miraculous interventions to save the day for the good characters while well-deserved disasters befall the evil ones. Dickens's vibrant descriptions bring people, places, and scenes fully to life, and the realistically described social conditions provide a clear vision of life's travails.Despite its great length, the novel is a fast read--and fun--but it is soap opera-like in its ups and downs, and the main characters are not fully developed. One knows little about Nicholas except what one \\"sees\\"--that he has a kind heart and acts on it--but we know little about his inner life. (David Copperfield and Pip in Great Expectations are still ten and twenty years away.) Sentimental and occasionally bathetic, the novel involves the reader in the social abuses, some of which were improved as a direct result of this book's publication. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby was written in 1838-39 by Charles Dickens riding the crest of his monumental success from writing Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. The lengthy novel is filled with memorble characters, an exciting plot and the incredible genius of England's greatest novelists.The story concerns the adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (the least interesting character in the book!, his sister Kate and his fatuous and longwinded mother the widow Mrs. Nickleby.Nicholas works for a time in the infamous Dotheboys Hall for boys in Yorkshire. The schoolmaster is the evil Wackford Squeers, his odious wife and his ugly daughter Fanny who becomes infatuated with Nicholas. it is here that we meet the pathetic mentally challenged lad Smike who is assisted by Nicholas and along with him leaves the horrid school.One of the most hilarious parts of the book deals with the time NN spent with the Vincent Crummles theatrical company. Dickens loved the theatre and loved to act in amateur theatricals.Katle Nickleby is employed at the Madame Mantalini milliery shop and becomes a companion to a wealthy and ridiculous woman. She is pursued romantically by the scoundrel Sir Mulberry Hawk.Dickens draws a vivid portrait of corrupt evil in the wicked uncle Ralph Nickleby a usurer whose wiles and schemes for fortune pull the many threads of the plot into a well woven plot that has a crackerjack ending as secrets are revealed and all ends well for the Nickleby family.This is still in many ways an work of growth for the budding novelists.It resembles a picaresque novel of the eighteenth century in following Nicholas and Kate through many scenes and situations. The genius of the novel lies in Dickens peerless ability to draw memorable characters that will live in the reader's mind long after the complicated plot machinations are forgotten.The Penguin Edition is excellently edited with copious notes and a learned introduction. The original illustrations by Hablot K. Browneare also included (Phiz). This is a pageturner which will entertain you for hours. It is a good novel to begin with if you have not read Dickens.The Dickens world is filled with all those marvelous characters which shall live as long as literature. Great."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I had never read one of Dickens book before Nicholas Nickleby, though I had always wanted to. I particularly enjoyed this book because of Dicken's subtle sense of humor and colorful characters. It was easy to hate the villains such as Squeers or Ralph Nickleby, and laugh at the amusing chracters of Mr. Mantalini and John Brody(whom I found to be the funniest) Authenticity of personality and speech allows you to connect with the various chracters. Although he was probably the least complex, my favorite was Smike, the pitiful victim of the Yorkshire schools of the 1800s.The one drawback was the size of this book. Dickens spent much time giving detail of many places and people (and did a good job of it), but we must draw the line somewhere. Just when one thinks enough words have been spent on one topic, it diverges into yet another irrevelant matter.I'd recommend this book to almost anyone, unless you have a great fear of commitment. But the book has plenty of plot and satire to hold you to the end. I certainly was, but I don't think my librarian would believe me."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This is a very funny novel in some sections. Imagine an older Oliver Twist, about 19 or 20 or so, but handsome, and with a temper, and with a strong outgoing personality, and one who can act and do all kinds of things. He has lots of self confidence and a beautiful sister, and throw in an obnoxious and rich uncle and a dotty mother. Yes, it is very, very entertaining.I bought the Wordsworth Classic version but would recommend the Penguin Classic version, and recommend that purchase highly. This is among Dickens's somewhat forgotten novel but still among his best. It is another masterpiece that brings together all of Dickens's writing skills with a great story. I would rate it slightly behind David Copperfield but it remains one of the most original and interesting of Dickens's novels somewhat on par with Oliver Twist.As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens's 22 novels and longer short stories, and set up a Listmania list. As a suggestion, avoid the Penguin Popular Classics with the plain green covers (I bought two). They fall apart and do not stand up to a read, especially books over 500 pages in length. The Regular Penguin Classics with the photo or painting on the front are excellent and some have maps and illustrations (drawings). The Wordsworth Classics are not as good, and some are illustrated.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system.All of Dickens's experiences come together in his novels. The Pickwick Papers, his first novel, is mostly humorous. But the next one, Oliver Twist, is a dark novel set in the crime plagued streets of early 19th century London. Next in novel number three, he changes back to a more humorous novel which is the present work. This is a big novel, about 750 pages or so - but the pages fly by. The protagonists are Nicholas, who is almost 20, his sister Kate, a few years younger, and his uncle Ralph Nickleby. Their father has died and Nicholas and Kate come to London with their mother to seek aid from the wealthy uncle. The uncle finds them minimum paying jobs, and that creates a good story. It is a novel with many common features that we expect from Dickens with things such as a school where the children are beaten, but it has many funny parts and it is complicated by the uncle's financial dealings.Having read many of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best as a work of literature and rate Oliver Twist as close behind and a must read. The latter book was read by Queen Victoria and Karl Marx, and both enjoyed the read. The novel had a far reaching social impact. Nicholas Nickleby is another gem and well worth the read, but lacks the social bite of Oliver Twist, and lacks the enthusiasm of David Copperfield, but it is hilarious."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I am so pleased that this publisher is reprinting this series.

Indeed Dickens creates these wonderful caricatures of the human soul in the different characters of the story. Each is like an individual portrait. But the portraits are part of a narrative. There is the battle between good and evil. And I feared that evil would have the upper hand. Dickens is good."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"From an historical perspective this book might have some merit, but judging by contemporary standards it is not to be recommended: The characters are simple, either unconditionably good or bad, and the title character is just dull. The latter is depicted as a hero, but really does nothing heroic, ie: beats up two considerably older men and gets away scot free; gets bailed out of a hopeless situation by the lynch pin inexpicably suddenly dying; and his love for a woman is based entirely on her looks. His poverty and misery occupies maybe only a quarter of the book as he again gets luckily saved by these two do-gooder brothers. Finally, this book is satirical and I hate satire.This is 950 pages of tedium."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"It suspenses the readers page by page and I would recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby is a story of a young man and his family dealing with the hardships in their life. When Nicholas father died the family was left with little money. It was because of this that they turned to Ralph Nickleby (Nicholas's uncle), who got Nicholas and his sister Kate jobs. Ralph only did this because he did not want them to rely on his money, he reminded me of Scrooge from the Christmas Carol, he is a business man with no heart at the beginning. Ralph Nickleby is a complex character that unfolds completely by the end of the novel. Ralph's assistant, Newman Noggs, parallels Bob Cratchit in many ways. He works for Ralph and puts up with many harsh words and actions. Noggs becomes Nicholas best friend. Dickens paints a picture of every character. By the end of the novel you have visual imagine in your head of every detail. You never just meet a person; you get to know their character. As much as I loved this description of everything, it does tend to be a bit much. At certain points throughout the story you remember that Dickens got paid by the word and that attributed to his (sometimes) excessive detail.The very beginning was a bit slow and it took a bit of effort to get through. Around the fourth or fifth chapter the book became very interesting. In the next few chapters the plot of the novel started to evolve. I enjoyed the balance of humor and seriousness that was in the book. Wackford Squeers was perhaps one of the crudest characters however he was one of the funnies as well. The Squeers owned Dotheboys Hall, for a small fortune you may send you child there to be educated, however the as a reader you soon learned about the horrible treatment of the boys. For example, the boys are occasionally given a \\"medicine\\", this made the boys so ill that they didn't want to eat and therefore the Squeers save money on food. You are introduced to a very important character by the name of Smike; he is a boy who was left in the care of the Squeers years ago. After his first six years there this parents stopped paying and he became a servant and he is treated horribly. At one point in the book Nicholas can no longer witness this treatment and saved poor Smike from a beating. After this the book takes a dramatic turn. Nicholas sets out on his own and soon finds that Smike has followed him.Eventually the interest starts to die down and the plot seems boring and over played. I must admit that as much as I loved the book the middle was not very enjoyable to read. In the middle you are introduced to many new characters and you learn the detail surrounding the life that Kate and Nicholas now lead. Kate is employed in a dress shop, which soon becomes bankrupt because of bad investments. Nicholas joins Mr. Crummles entertainment \\"business\\", in which he puts on plays. Just when you start to lose hope in the book, an exciting series of twist and turns unravels. You start to learn that Ralph has a few secrets that may lead to his destruction. Newmen Noggs starts to play a very important role in the story. He learns that Ralph has a friend (Mr. Gride) who plans to marry Madeline (the woman Nicholas is in love with) and give the deed her father promised him to Ralph. Madeline's father is in prison for not repaying is debt; the deed is worth 12,000 pounds and will replace what he borrowed from Ralph. The end of the book is the greatest part of all; you learn very important things about Ralph and his life before money. The theme of how money can ruin a person is really displayed in the last few chapters.Overall this book had its highs and lows. I am very glad that I read it because it is so mind blowing, you really get involved in this world that Dickens creates for his characters. There are so many different aspect of this book that almost anyone can find something that they enjoy about it. The best part is that you can see what everything is leading up to but there is still an element of surprise until the end."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"I don't want to say much about the quality of the novel itself. I find it the most two-dimensional of all his novels (and I've read the Old Curiousity Shop, which is full of grotesqueries!). But I do want to provide some perspective as to the background of this novel.Before Dickens wrote this novel, some friends of his brought to his notice of horrid boarding schools in the Yorkshire area. Dickens traveled the countryside incognito, visiting the schools and some people in the area. He found that these schools were being run under the principle of being storehouses for unwanted boys. &quot;Natural&quot; children, inconvenient children from a first marriage, children of widowers who didn't have time to bring up their boys were shipped off to these schools, never to come home for the holidays, and under most circumstances the boy wouldn't make it to the age of 18 at which time he would be ejected from the school with no useful learning.Part of the motivation of this novel was to bring this practice to light -- many of the people in Yorkshire did not know what was going on the schools and those who did know did not see what they could do about it.Then Nicholas Nickleby started to be published. Like all of his novels, this book came out in 3-chapter installments. Well before the book was halfway over, people spontaneously gathered around some of these schools, ejected children and masters alike, and set the buildings to torch. By the end of publication, the infamous Yorkshire schools were totally gone.So keep this in mind while reading this book, which seems juvenile and flat compared even his previous two novels, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby. This is the only of Dickens' novels to have an immediate and profound impact in his society. When was the last time you heard of a novel creating effective activism in a community?"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby tells the story of Nicholas Nickleby, a young man who is a man of his word, attempting to live an honorable and upright life in a world dominated by scheming, grasping men. His greatest opponent is his uncle, Ralph Nickleby, a man who lives for money, and will let nothing stand in the way of his acquiring more of it. As Nicholas tries to live an up-right life, he finds himself more and more locked in a struggle against his uncle.This is another great work of social commentary by Charles Dickens. The characters are all very memorable, including the brave Kate Nickleby, the foolish Mrs. Nickleby, the up-right but sadly fallen Newman Noggs, the foolish and dishonorable Lord Frederick Verisopht, the cruel Wackford Squeers, and the fun-loving actor Vincent Crummles - just to name a few. I really enjoyed my time spent with this book, and am very glad that I read it!Mark Twain once quipped that, \\"a classic is a book which people praise and don't read.\\" Well, let that not be said of you and Nicholas Nickleby. It's a great book, one well worth your time reading."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Nicholas Nickleby was serialised between 1838 and 1839. It is almost 900 pages long and comprises 65 chapters. Charles Dickens was 26 years old when it was released - his third novel, following on from The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. One further statistic of note is that the bus ride from Tollesbury to Maldon that I undertake each day for work lasts almost exactly a Nicholas Nickleby chapter. As such, given that it was originally published as a long running serial, I feel that little bus journey contributed greatly to me finishing only my second Charles Dickens novel.Anyway - on with the review!The novel, as you would expect, follows the eponymous hero in various encounters that shape both his own future and that of those he comes to love and befriend. He is opposed all the way by his dastardly money-lending Uncle Ralph who enlists the help of various unbecoming fellows, including the wicked schoolmaster Wackford Squeers and the old lecher Arthur Gride, in his attempts to thwart the young upstart in his quest to see goodness triumph. If you throw into the mix the vaudevillian Crummles family, a mad old man with very small clothes who throws vegetables over the fence in order to woo Nicholas' mother and two angelic old twins called the Cheerybles - oh and not to mention the foppish Lord Verisopht and the drunken hidden hero of the novel, Newman Noggs - then it is quite clear that this is no tedious novel.Nicholas Nickleby is pure entertainment from start to finish.Ironically the character that I did not really take to was Nicholas himself. He is rather one dimensional in his unstinting goodness and somewhat irritating in the way he imposes his morality on others. His actions though are wonderful, particularly the way he cares for young Smike, that tragic young boy whom he extricates from the clutches of the villainous Wackford Squeers. It is the characters of lesser morals, such as Ralph Nickleby, Arthur Gride and the aforementioned Wackford Squeers, who really do make the novel throb. Wonderful as the Cheeryble Twins are, it is the dark deeds of the villainous that really shows the author at his best. He rails against the rich and the powerful, those who take advantage of their status, their gender and their profession. The descriptions of the school where Nicholas encounters Smike is one of the most harrowing I have read in any novel. The small episode towards the end where Nicholas cares for his ailing young friend is touching beyond words.Interspersed with the blistering social commentary is a story of love and devotion, of people struggling to the point where all they have to rely on is each other and a fundamental belief that all will come good in the end.Finally, I will repeat some of the statistics from earlier. Nicholas Nickleby was written by a 26 year old man 175 years ago and it is almost 900 pages long - impressive at every turn. It is certainly as relevant today as ever it was and has served over the last few months to make my little bus journeys entirely wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Charles Dickens \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" develops many of the characters found in \\"The Christmas Story\\".

You can tell how much Dickens loved the freedom with which he could pursue any story line or digression into characterization he fancied. There is no tight, coherent plot to Nicholas Nickelby; it wanders where it pleases, and is guaranteed to please you in the process. Some parts are fraught with great tragedy and anger - Dickens wrote the portion in which Nicholas works as a teacher at the brutal Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire as a means of helping eradicate the horrific educational institutions that actually existed there at the time. (Allegedly several headmasters threatened to sue Dickens, thinking that he had chosen their school specifically to portray as Dotheboys Hall!) His powerful and passionate descriptions of these deplorable schools helped get rid of them for good. In the process we are drawn into the heart-rending story of the irreparable damage done by the cruelty of these institutions. Other parts of the book are romantic and unabashedly sentimental - if I remember correctly, the book ends with three marriages! Nicholas is decidedly a romantic hero, and his search for love is one of the main ideas the book explores. Some parts are creepy - the Nickelbys as a family unit are benign and good, but they are surrounded by and pursued by some real monsters, for instance Sir Mulberry Hawk and Arthur Gride. Those are some legitimately sleazy guys. Some parts are heartwarming - especially those with the Cheerybles and Tim Linkinwater - and some parts are truly hilarious. I will never get over how astonishingly funny Dickens is!! Nicholas Nickelby is rambling and disorganized, and it follows its own zigzaggy course with a sweet will through the perils and delights, the high points and the low points of Dickensian England. Be patient and enjoy the ride- you'll never enjoy this book if you can't sit back and savor the details."},{"Title":"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"Perfect nightstand sized book.

Started with The Pickwick Papers, then Oliver Twist, then a reread of David Copperfield(out of order I know). I have purchased all 14 novels, so this will take a while. Nicholas Nickleby was excellent. After reading 3 of Dickens' novels in the last month, I am really accustomed to his language and style. As an English major years ago, being forced to read Dickens, I was never a big fan. But now I know why he has always been considered the greatest writer of his generation. His books are wonderful. I wouldn't have liked this book back in school, but now 30 years later, I love Dickens. And so far, NN is my favorite of my now favorite author. It is great to rediscover an author, and realize what I was missing. Only 10 more novels to go, and I am looking forward to the journey into this classic author.I even bought several of the DVD versions of his books, and the NN version I just watched with Anne Hathaway was not nearly as good as the book. A lot left out of the movie understandably. The Polanski version of Oliver Twist was really good though. Really fun to find a whole new series of books, and their movie versions.

The reader's interest is sustained throughout the story (though I was almost bored with the bits about the Kenwigses; i mean that in general, curiosity never flags to read what happens next), the suspense builds up quite nicely and everything turns out well. This IS a Dickens novel, so happy endings were in order (at least in \\"Oliver Twist, Or The Parish Boy's Progress,\\" here and in \\"David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)\\").My only complaint is that the love interest, Madeleine Bray, doesn't show up until the final two-thirds of the novel and when she does appear, Dickens barely gives her more than 10 or 15 lines to say in total. A real let-down, considering that there was a prolonged and interesting love scene in \\"Oliver Twist, Or The Parish Boy's Progress\\" and Rose was a main character in the story, so she had plenty to say (albeit she appears in the second half of the novel, after Oliver is shot).

Plenty. And this book is proof.\\"Pellegrino takes the reader through the Titanic expeditions since his previous book, &quot;Her Name, Titanic,&quot; including the 1996 RMS Titanic expedition the author participated in as biopaleontologist and marine archaeologist. He also introduces readers to more never before published survivor accounts, including Chief Baker Charles Joughin (whose survival despite more time spent in the water than any other survivor is still a mystery), Michel Navatril (&quot;The Titanic Waif&quot;) and stoker Jim Mulolland (who reports on the fate of the ship's cat).The reader is also treated to detailed pencil sketches of the wreck as he saw it, an archaeological map of the Stern debris field, the diagrams of the new consortial life form dubbed &quot;Rusticalus Titanics&quot; by Pellegrino and Cullimore on the '96 expedition, and for the first time anywhere, annotated drawings of the actual deck plans of the Titanic drawn in India ink (one of the many Titanic myths debunked by Pellegrino in this book is that the plans went down with Andrews - at the advice of their lawyers the White Star Line led authorities to believe that in order to shut down the design defect argument).Among the forensic reconstructions in the book are a complete reconstruction on the sequence of events on the the Titanic and the Californian from eyewitness accounts, showing at each stage how the Californian was viewing the lights and distress rockets of the Titanic, and likewise the lifeboats on the Titanic were viewing the lights of the Californian. Pellegrino notes that even Captain Stanley Lord of The Californian finally admitted during his libel law suit against the account of his ship in &quot;A Night To Remember,&quot; that it was the lights of the Titanic his crew saw that night of April 12th (its amazing that some authors *still* refer to the &quot;mystery ship&quot;). But Pellegrino further damns Captain Lord by showing that under the atmospheric conditions and due to the immutable laws of curvature of the earth, the lights observed on both sides bracket the distance between the ships as between 5 and 7.5 miles (instead of the 20 miles the captain claimed to american investigators or the 30 miles he later claimed to british investigators or the 40 miles he claimed to reporters after that), which meant the Californian could have reached the titanic, allowing for caution, less than one hour after seeing the first distress rockets, a time when lifeboats were still lowering, well in time to save hundreds at least from freezing to death in the cold waters, possibly all 1500! Pellegrino even adds a new indictment from Third Officer Groves of the Californian, during the brief search the Californian did that morning, Groves saw moving figures on the ice which he believed to be human beings, only to have this dismissed by the Captain as Seals as he ordered the ship to turn around and head for Boston!Pellegrio also describes the scientific discoveries Pellegrino participated in on the '96 RMS Titanic expedition. He and microbiologist Roy Cullimore discovered that Bob Ballard's &quot;Rusticles&quot; are a new consortial life form, Rusticalus Titanicus, a 3.5 billion year evolutionary throwback that could provide new antibiotics and other medicines. Pellegrino and Cullimore also noted a tremendous increase in deep-ocean &quot;sea snow&quot; between Titanic expeditions which is evidence of &quot;The Zooplankton Crisis,&quot; a massive bloom of animal plankton caused by reductions in the North Atlantic fish population, which threatens the phytoplankton population in the top few inches of the ocean, which are responsible for converting more far carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than rain forests. The reader is reminded of the warning Titanic survivor Eva Hart gives to Pellegrino in this book, \\"...if you scientists, engineers and industrial geniuses don't learn to temper arrogance with wisdom, and to pay very close attention, then I'm afraid there will be an even bigger Titanic in your future - for the whole world, maybe. And next time there may be no lifeboats - for anybody.\\"I'd rate this book as a great read for any reader interested in history or science, and a must-have for any true Titanic enthusiast, no matter how many books you own!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I've read many books on the Titanic but never one quite like &quot;Ghosts of the Titanic&quot;. Dr Charles Pellegrini's magnificent book had me spellbound from the very first chapter as the author presents the events of the night of April 14th/15th 1912 in a totally fresh and compelling manner.Be warned: This book grips the reader like a steel trap!In &quot;Ghosts of the Titanic&quot; you will learn of:The very first victims of the Titanic's collision with the iceberg.The steward who set a new world record for the high dive.How Major Peuchen's wallet came to be lying where it was in Titanic's debris field and the importance of finding the wallet.Why Thomas Andrews, Titanic's designer, stayed on board the stricken liner and made no attempt to leave the ship.What damage the iceberg inflicted on the Titanic and then what Titanic did to the iceberg.The words whispered by Captain Smith when he saw the flooded mail room.How close the iceberg was to Titanic when it was first sighted.Where the California really was in relation to the Titanic.The meaning of the very last message transmitted from Titanic's radio room.This list is only a portion of the startling revelations to be found in this book.There have been many fine books written on the Titanic distaster. In this writers humble opinion &quot;Ghosts of the Titanic&quot; is the best, the winner in a photo-finish from the excellent works of Walter Lord.

Never having heard of him before, I am - as of now - an avid fan.This author is unflinchingly honest, too honest for comfort, but authentic. This version of what happened is not for kids, but this is a book like no other, and WELL worth the price. This is the best book on Titanic, ever, for anyone who can deal with humanity on its own level."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Did the N.Y. Times give a scientist a raw deal? I think so. First off, Pellegrino really does his homework, and that is a fact, not a fantasy. In the Discovery Channel Expeditions he is listed, aboard the Research Vessels at the wreck site, as &quot;Underwater Archaeologist&quot; and &quot;Scientist at large.&quot; Simply go to Robert D. Ballard's book, &quot;Discovery of the Titanic,&quot; and you will see that Dr. Ballard himself credits Pellegrino with the archaeological analysis that produced the &quot;downblast theory.&quot; This analysis (still on-going) was begun during the winter 1985 expedition to the hydrothermal vents on the Galapagos Rift (A famous Ballard expedition in its own right! See Pellegrino's &quot;Her Name, Titanic.&quot;) As for the reality of survivor's quotes, just a random flip-through reveals: Page 220, &quot;Excerpt from a letter to Walter Lord... March 29, 1956...&quot; Page 196: &quot;Leading fireman Charles Hendrickson testified...Oiler Fred Scott told... Examiner Hharbinson [at the British Inquiry]...&quot; Throughout the book, the author specifically cites who said what to whom and when - (eg: Captain Smith's and Mr. Strauss' last words to Mrs Henry Harris, as recorded in Mrs. Harris' diary) - hardly worthy of an accusation of &quot;circus barking and fantasy.&quot; See also for example, Pellegrino's careful, point-by-point analysis of the evidence supporting James Cameron's theory that the entire five story, solid oak structure of the Titanic's grand stairway developed many tons of positive buoyancy and broke free of its mountings as the bow went underwater (which the NY Times calls a &quot;flimsy idea&quot; - as if the notion that wood floats is a &quot;wild assertion&quot;). Anyone who assumes that the N.Y. Times actually put Mr. Parfit's &quot;book review&quot; through a legal review prior to publication needs to be enlightened: Book reviews are allowed, by the law, almost total freedom to get the facts wrong because strict deadlines are automatically assumed. Moreover, a reading of the N.Y. Times review will reveal from the very first paragraph that the author, Parfit, was writing at an almost hysterical, vengeful pitch. You cannot read this without finding the thrashing itself entertaining, and wondering, &quot;What did Pelligrino do to get the Times so mad at him?&quot; A reading of the recently published decision by the N.Y. State Supreme Court. Appellate Division (June 27, 2000, Index No. 100423/99) might - just might - shed some light on this. A writer for the N.Y. Times had, in 1998, accused Pellegrino, in his book &quot;Unearthing Atlantis&quot; of falsely associating himself with the family of the famous Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos, and even stealing credit for Marinatos's &quot;Thera theory.&quot; (Sound familiar?) All the way up through the appellate court, the accusation was ruled unanimously as &quot;patently false and susceptible to defamatory meaning.&quot; People who win libel cases can often be heard to complain about the original lie, the original accusation, being literally shouted by the media while the vindication, coming years later, gets a barely whispered &quot;only kidding&quot; somewhere behind page 74 of the classifieds in the times. Pellegrino's deal seems a little more raw than that. In his case, only days or weeks after the matter was settled, the Times came out with a &quot;book review&quot; reiterating similar charges (we read that Pellegrino falsely associated himself with the famed oceanographer Robert Ballard, and now even tries to steal some credit for Ballard's discovery of the Titanic). Book reviews, as I have indicated above and as any lawyer can tell you, are virtually sue-proof. Translation? Legally, anyone who wants to couch character assassination in a book review can get away with it. Coincidence? Maybe. But does it not have the disturbing stench of pay-back?"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"This is one of the most chilling true stories I have ever read. While at least half of this &quot;new&quot; material has been reported elsewhere (chiefly in the British Inquiry, May 2 - July 1, 1912), Pellegrino's synthesis feels so fresh and is so vivid that one is tempted to believe he must actually have been there, not just on the expeditions to Titanic as archaeological ruin, but actually there on the slanting decks in a past life. He illustrates the ship's evolution (or devolution) from something strong and beautiful to mounds of twisted steel with such loving detail that for the first time, we can understand the strange sights and sounds reported by Colonel Gracie, Jack Thayer, Charles Joughin, and Alfred White - even though the witnesses themselves eventually died without ever knowing what happened to them, or why.One more strange thing: In &quot;Her Name, Titanic&quot; Pellegrino morphed back and forth in time from the Ballard expeditions, to the night of the sinking, to the expeditions again... and again... and not always effectively. (Unless the intended effect was to make the reader dizzy. But James Cameron did pick up on this, and ran with it, and managed to transcend Pellegrino's flaws.) This time out, in keeping with the realities of an archaeological dig, wherein one begins by peeling away the most recent events buried in the topmost layer, Pellegrino plays an even stranger game with time. But this time he is much more effective. This book is so engrossing that you can get all the way to the last chapter without noticing that he has been telling the story backwards!By the way, the drawings were amazingly creepy yet beautiful."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Author Charles Pellegrino provides a very gripping and insightful update on the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; and its current condition based on the numerous undersea explorations performed in the last 16 years. His explanations of the actual events taking place from hitting the iceberg through the ship's impace with the bottom of the ocean are very enlightening. He has personally conversed with Walter Lord (previous Titanic historian) and several survivors of the disaster. He was also present &quot;topside&quot; during some of the most recent American/French joint explorations.Where the author diminishes the value of this book is his attempts to explain the &quot;rusticles&quot; and other deterioration of the ship due to its being in the deep ocean for nine decades. Some of his metaphysical musings on these formations and &quot;the origin of all life form&quot; are really fodder for some other article or book, not this one.The book is recommended but it's not nearly as well written and informative as it could have been given Mr. Pellegrino's first-hand observations and experiences with the remains of the Titanic."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"The first book concerned with archeology that ever caught my interest was the classic \`The Source\\" by James A. Mitchener. What drew me to this book was a potentially dry subject such as archeology was tempered with a touch of humanity. The same holds true for Charles Pelligrino's latest work on the Titanic, Ghosts of the Titanic. Dr. Pelligrino brings out not only the most recent scientific discoveries concerning this tragedy but also reveals the human toll the events surrounding this massive ship had upon the survivors and families of the ship's compliment. Much of Pelligrino's work on the subject of the Titanic is surrounded by controversy. Just go to any of the computer news groups concerned with the Titanic and you cannot help but to notice the huge among of space devoted to debates of Dr. Pelligrino's work. One thing that is difficult to deny is Charles Pelligrino is first and foremost a scientist. Sure he can write an excellent story but this does not detract from the facts, Dr. Pelligrino knows what he is doing. While the conclusions may inspire discussion his techniques are impeccable. He has journeyed to the resting-place of the Titanic, interviewed the few remaining survivors and the families of the unfortunate passengers no longer alive. This research is the basis for his conclusions but what sets this book apart form so many others on the topic is Pelligrino's care in factoring in the human side of the equations.As Pelligrino points out in the book it is far easier for an archeologist to dissociate himself when the events took place hundreds or thousands of years ago. It is altogether another matter when you actually had an opportunity to speak with first hand witnesses to the events. Some of the official records made during the inquest of the sinking where biased, sometimes to cover up actions and promises of the White Star line. For example some accounts where discounted because survivors stated the ship broke in two. This is now known to be fact. The legend of the Titanic is steeped in erroneous conclusions that this work helps to shed new light. Pelligrino details his trips to the Titanic with the care of a scientific journal while preserving the dignity deserved by its victims. One case is the emotional toll in finding a small piece of cloth had upon Pelligrino. When he realized that this was part of a tiny tee shirt that most likely belonged to one of the youngest victims of the sinking he was moved in a way that any of us would be. This work treads the line between scientific detachment with human concern.One of the most exciting discoveries that Pelligrino was part of was a new type of life, the rustlicle. This is basically a group of single cell organisms that form various layers that serve the colony almost as organs do in higher forms of life. They digest iron and are slowing eating away at the remains of this once great ship. A side note to this is these rusticles appear to posses a means to fight infections that affect those of us on the surface. This book heralds a new avenue for genetic, zoological and microbiologic research.Much of Ghosts is told through accounts based upon the known records and personal interviews with the survivors. Each story helps to weave a tapestry that helps the reader gain a very personal perspective of this tragic night. The stories help the reader to understand the motives and consequences of incredible acts of bravery and cowardice displayed by the passengers and crew. Such events as a boat full of society matrons refusal to allow a man on board due to his race. The separation of extremely young fraternal twins, permitting only the girl to survive. Men placing their wives and children in the relative safety of a life boat knowing that they were soon to face a cold and dark fate. Each story will burn itself into your consciousness and forever change what you imagined occurred that fateful night.Ghosts of the Titanic is a work that will appeal to both those interested in a scientific work detailing the events of this ship and those interested in a humanized view of those same events. Pelligrino moves backward in time as he tells what happened. This reverse chronology comes across as the way many people talk about a horrible event they have lived through, remembering first the most recent events and moving steadily back to the causes. Without a doubt this work will and has inspired controversy but it should rapidly become one of the must read volumes on the subject."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I hate to disagree with the New York Times, but I found this book to be utterly fascinating. It is a remarkable mix of history, archeology, and even biology. Pellegrino brings the night of the sinking to life in a remarkable way."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Charles Pellegrino's earlier book about the Titanic, &quot;Her Name, Titanic,&quot; remains one of the better books on the subject. Instead of rewriting that book, Pellegrino chose to write what he suspects will be the second book of a Titanic trilogy (with a third volume planned for 10 to 12 years hence). Pellegrino has the advantage of knowing almost everyone involved in the discovery of and expeditions to the Titanic, including Robert Ballard and George Tulloch, formerly of Titanic International, and he actually accompanied the 1996 expedition. He also is close to Walter Lord and has interviewed a number of Titanic survivors. This puts Pellegrino in a particularly useful position to portray the Titanic disaster in 3 dimensions while banging no particular drum. Pellegrino is also something of a polymath. He's interested in everything, as readers of his previous books can attest. He's probably the closest thing going to Isaac Asimov since the late Dr. A passed away. Given this, there are some real irritants here. I'd like to see all of Pellegrino's quotations and information cited. At the very least I'd like his assurance that none of the dialogue, particularly dialogue supposed to have taken place aboard the Titanic, is invented. It's also startling to see him consistently misspelling the name of Lord Mersey, the jurist in charge of the British inquiry, and of the Leyland Line, owners of the Californian, throughout the book. I find it a little difficult to believe that Pellegrino apparently buys into James Cameron's line that the ship would have been even more badly damaged had it hit the iceberg headon. Frankly, I can't think of a case in which the rammer came off worse than the rammee. Also, Pellegrino's interest in everything occasionally detracts as he flits from subject to subject without, sometimes, completing his original thought. But these are minor irritants, and I only mention them with the hope that Pellegrino will see them and make corrections in future editions. This book is extremely valuable and brings absolutely new information to the public attention. Especially useful is Pellegrino's careful forensic analysis of the Californian controversy, and his similar treatment of the iceberg sighting. According to this new information, the iceberg was sighted when so close to the Titanic that the ship actually collided with it almost as soon as the officers began to react, rendering unimportant earlier arguments about the size of the ship's rudder. Also very interesting are the results of studies into the rusticle formations that are speedily consuming the ship. It's fascinating to learn that new insights into biology are coming from these studies. There's a lot of really good new data here, and I recommend this book with only the minor reservations noted above. Needless to say, I'll be waiting eagerly, in ten or so years, for Pellegrino's next book on this seemingly inexhaustable topic."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Let's be frank. I am the publisher of another excellent Titanic book, &quot;1912 Facts About Titanic,&quot; by Lee Merideth, and have read about everything that is readily available on the subject. So I know a little something about it. Pellegrino has penned what is in my opinion the most compelling, fresh, and thought-provoking account of the great liner I have ever read. His careful analysis and reasoned speculation opens new doors for serious study; his gleaning of the various inquiry records and other firsthand accounts that have surfaced recently, when utilized with archaeological and scientific discoveries, damn near definitively solves many of the mysteries that have lingered since 1912. Pellegrino's treatment of the role played by the Californian and Captain Lord is the best I have ever seen in print. His use of witness accounts of the ship's lights, the curvature of the earth, and other factors resolves conclusively that Lord's command was within a seven-mile radius when Titanic sank. There is also evidence that a handful of survivors may have been sighted on an ice flow by officers of the Californian--and left there by Lord.The author also has raised enough significant doubt to revitalize (perhaps &quot;rehabilitate&quot; is not too strong of a description) Captain Smith's reputation. Like the fiasco of a movie &quot;Gettysburg,&quot; which depicted Martin Sheen as a General Lee on valium, previous authors and movie directors have portrayed the Titanic's Captain Smith as a confused and benumbed fool once the ship's designer, Andrews, told him Titanic was doomed. In fact, every one of Smith's critical decisions--including sending out half empty lifeboats--were the correct ones. (My hat is off to you Captain, and I apologize for the unkind words I have spread about you. tps)Other compelling issues include learned speculation that the Grand Staircase broke loose and shot to the surface (the evidence for this is very strong); Officer Murdoch did indeed shoot himself (there were several witnesses who did not know each other who wrote the same thing); and Bruce Ismay and his company worked overtime to slander many survivors who did tow the company line (the Duff Gordons were among this select group). Even more interesting is the fact that the &quot;rusticles&quot; adorning the deteriorating ship are actually ALIVE. Yes, they are bacterial colonies in a life form previously unknown. And they are being utilized for medical research that might, ultimately, save more people than Titanic took to the bottom.The only section of the book that caused me to roll my eyes and audibly groan was the very end of the main narrative, where Pellegrino makes a silly over-the-top reference to the political baloney we know today as &quot;Global Warming,&quot; accented with a metaphor that the earth is the Titanic and we are steaming toward our own ice field. Sorry, Charlie, but hundreds of qualified scientists think the evidence for Global Warming (and a human connection) is tenuous or nonexistent at best. Politicians anxious to weaken the U.S. at the expense of Third World countries, however, in the name of global Socialism, see it as a terrific opportunity to achieve their goals. These are the same yahoos who argued 25 years ago that TODAY we would be all covered with ice, so our lifestyles had to change radically--or else. (How many of your are now skiing in July? Hmmm?)I borrowed this book, read it, and then bought it. Everyone who enjoys reading about Titanic must own this book. Ignore the silly review that appeared in Kirkus and the hatchet job that was penned in the New York Times. Buy Ghosts of the Titanic, enjoy it, and then share it with another buff."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"This is the best modern inquiry into the causes of the Titanic sinking.I had to ask myself a question after reading this insightful book.Was the disaster planned by European communists? People may scoff at the notion of a socialist-labour conspiracy here.Yet,if you read between the lines,it has some credible possibilties that may be true.One name that i read over was that of 'Winterstorm' on the cruise passenger list.It turns out that that name is also that of a Swedish communist spy for the fledgling Bolsheviks.Is this a coincedence or a real spy for the growing communist movement in Europe?The idea of the Titanic being an enclosed floating rat trap containing robber barons and mega-capitalists,is not that absurd.Was Winterstrom passing encoded messages via the ship's new experimental Marconi radio system? Was Winterstrom a secret agent who knew the doomed ship's impending encounter with the iceberg.Was Winterstrom,et al,distractors of the ship's officiers? How could experienced sailing men be so bold and reckless,in such icy troubled waters of early Spring.If Captain Smith was gambling on a safe voyage,how could he not monitor every berg movement ,on the ship's westward course.Why were the spy-glasses missing from the crow's nest? Leaving the next look-out man helpless,until a replacement pair was located.The possible scenerios of sabotage are many and still will fascinate maritime readers forever.Awesome reading!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I was interested in the author's perspective of the individuals and their accounts on the Titanic. The relevance of the discoveries at the wreck site were timely when the book was written but somewhat dated to a Titanic history student. I found his interpretation of the development of life as troublesome. It really spoiled my enjoyment of an otherwise good read. The quality of the book itself was excellent."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Well, I caught a few errors when I wsa reading it, but some of the other commentary here has made me even more cautious of Dr. Pellegrino's scholarship. (That thing about Pellegrino claiming Lord interviewed Lightoller after Lightoller had died is particularly disturbing.) This book is a lot of fun to read, in spite of (and at times because of) the fact that it's totally all over the place; information is scattered randomly throughout and there's no apparently logical order to it. Yes, he does also go off on some tangets--some of which are interesting, and some of which are maudlin, overly personal and just embarrassing. The best parts are those where Pellegrino's voice does not dominate, but where we get to hear extensively from other, very well-informed people like Ballard, Lord and yes, even Jim Cameron.Be warned, though: Pellegrino fabricates dialog for conversations that have never been supported with documentary evidence, and is a much better oceanographer than a historian."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"\\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\" is the second book in what Charles Pellegrino promises will be a trilogy about the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. It is primarily a much-needed thorough forensic analysis of the ship's sinking, based on data from recent expeditions to the site, never before published or analyzed journals, letters and interviews with witnesses, and information from the original investigations of the disaster. What physically happened to the ship at every moment from just before its impact with the iceberg until it hit the ocean floor is spelled out in detail. Some helpful diagrams are included as well. I was amazed and fascinated by how much of the activities on board the Titanic during its final hours could be reconstructed when all eyewitness accounts are considered. Among other things, new information may exonerate Captain Smith of much of the blame for the tragedy, while thrusting Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line and Captain Lord of the Californian into even harsher light than previously imagined. As is typical of Charles Pellegrino's books, \\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\" is written in the order in which the information came to light instead of being organized by topic. This creates a sense of anticipation and allows the reader to understand the Titanic in ever-increasing depth, little by little, just as Dr. Pellegrino and his colleagues did. But the lack of conventional organization may frustrate some readers, and it means you don't find out about some crucial details until the end of the book. All in all, a fascinating account of what people did to sink a ship in 1912 and what goes on at the bottom of the ocean today as a result."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"&quot;Ghosts of the Titanic&quot; might be one of the best, if not the best book ever written about archaeological adventure on (and under) the high seas. There is nothing in the world quite so eerie as the ancient, antibiotic-spewing lifeform (Rusticalus titanicus) that is turning the metal hull of the Titanic into its own tissues. No wonder that Pellegrino's colleague in rusticle exploration, when he looked up from the microscope, remarked, \\"Welcome to Mars.\\""},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I felt it was well-written, and it appeared that Pellegrino did his homework. I was most fascinated by the survivor accounts. I've read several books on the Titanic, and this book - above all the others - kept me rapt for days."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Pellegrino's endnotes get a bit long, becoming whole chapters even after the book itself is supposed to have ended. But these little stories behind the story, including the fates of various Titanic survivors, explorers, and survivors of the exploration are worth trudging through (like Paul Harvey's &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;) and had the author started the story itself with thank-yous to the teachers who helped a child wo could not read at all to the extent that he would eventually WRITE books and be doing science for a living, I would have thought it a little self-indulgent in a Titanic book and best left for what must be another fascinating book all by itself. There must be a life lesson in it. Same with the story of his sorrow after his wife left, which is also in his acknowledgements section and which also seems to be given as a life lesson. Anyone would understand the devastation: &quot;How could the night get any darker? I had asked, never guessing, during my pity party for one, that what served for the moment as the defining tragedy of my life was in fact saving me from a rather broader definition of tragedy.&quot; The point he makes is that the worst news he thought he could ever receive was causing him to change his plans to be on an airplane crash which no one survived. Those few sentences saved my son from watching a bitter divorse continue to get worse when I realized that the message of the missed plane, and the message of the Titanic, was that by a quirk of fate my boy might never know his daddy at all, so I made peace with my ex and I guess that message has never been made more clear than by all those orphans created by the New York and Washington bombings of September 11. I do have to say that the most boring parts of the book taught me more about rust and rusticles than I ever wanted to know, but while an article about that stuff would have been interesting in Discover magazine all by itself, it was boring in this book only by comparison to all the information about how the drunken cook became the only man on the stern to keep his balance, how the grand stairway floated up through the crystal dome, and how the Californian just stood seven miles away and watched the Titanic sink, how (with detailed drawings)minute by minute the ship filled and broke apart and how its parts slammed inti the bottom of the ocean at close to 40 miles an hour, and through it all you really feel like you are there. You feel it because you really get to know the people who were there and to feel it through them. No one writes like that. Or maybe not anymore. After Pelligrino missed the plane crash he moved to New York and he is still missing there since September 11, so it's all quirks of chance, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I have been fascinated by the Titanic disaster for many years, and although this book is very interesting and informative, he seems to have completely neglected to do a bit of historical research on the subject. My first example is how much stock he puts into Morgan Robertson's \\"Futility\\", which is supposed to have predicted the Titanic disaster a full fourteen years before it happened. The way he tells it, Morgan Robertson was right in every single respect about the death of Titanic. However, if he had read the first edition of the book, published in 1898, he would see that the ship described in \\"Futility\\" actually bears very little resemblance to the Titanic. First of all, the Titan was on her third voyage going BACK to England from New York. Second, only 13 people survived the sinking of the Titan. Third, the Titan did not hit the iceberg a glancing blow, but instead plowed into it and actually rolled up over it, sinking in less than a half hour. Also, absolutely no mention of a sister ship is made in either version of Morgan Robertson's \\"Futility\\". The true story of this bizarre book is that Robertson and a publisher rewrote it immediately after the disaster with the intention of cashing in on it. Unfortunately, copies of the first edition are incredibly rare, so it is extremely easy to mistake Robertson's work of fiction for a prediction of disaster. In the first edition, a person couldn't tell the Titan from the Mauretania or even the Great Eastern. Mr. Pellegrino also seems to spend a great deal of time praising RMS Titanic, Inc for it's efforts to \\"keep the spirit of the great ship alive\\". I'd say that the Titanic Historical Society does a much better job of this than any two-bit treasure hunter's association. All in all, however, I could find few faults with his book. He seems to spend very little time on research in relation to the Titanic's sister ships, but his theories are interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"This book was terrific. I read it all in one day. I really liked the way the author(s) wove in stories of the people on the Titanic with the scientific analysis. And the science was fascinating. Not so technical that non-scientists couldn't understand or enjoy it, but detailed and supported with enough evidence so that it explains very well much of what happened that night. This book touches on biology, microbiology, physics, mathematics, psychology, politics, and more. A very engrossing read."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Charles Pellegrino's follow-up to the wonderful Her Name, Titanic is Ghosts of the Titanic, an enjoyable and informative look at little-known and new facts concerning the Titanic. The lure of this downed ship is undeniable and this book is a must-have for all those devoted to seizing and squeezing out as much information about the glorious ship and the wreck it became. The book goes a little astray at times, though, as the author moves, far too often, from the Titanic's story to his own as we learn such tidbits as his wife left because she fell in love with another man and that the author was considered by some to be autistic as a child. When he is on topic, he is quite good. This book has much to recommend it to the Titanic reader. For the beginner, Her Name, Titanic and Walter Lord's The Night to Remember are the places to begin and then, if still not satisfied, they can move on to this book."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I found this book extremely fascinatng in that it combined personal accounts of Titanic survivors with scientific explinations of what happened in the last hours of the voyage.

I had to read a book for my book club, and I usally don't like long books, but something about this book made me want to read it!! I got so much information about all of the things that went on in those last few hours on the TITANIC that I mad me sad to relize that more than half of the people were not rescude!!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I've been interested in the story of the people on the ship for 40 years and have watched all the shows and read the books, but this is what I'd been looking for and not finding. I knew there were more third-class children who died than first-class men, but here are direct quotes and examples that show how the class system worked and how little value was placed on the lives of the great mass of people in the early 1900's, the non-wealthy. I'd never heard of the thefts, opinion on the head injuries of the people trying to get into collapsible A, what happened to the the a la carte workers, the rusticles (how great is this?) or the exact way/speed the bow and stern went down that I could plow through. I vaguely heard that the band members' families were billed, but didn't realize how callous the White Star Line really was. The book also confirmed my feeling that Captain Smith didn't make any effort at coordination and seemed to be in shock - no sending the stewards to shut the portholes, maintaining contact with Anderson or his own staff, etc. Maybe there are disagreements over the scientific facts, but I found them credible and explained pretty clearly to a layman. Theories have been frequently overturned in my lifetime and minor errors in facts of names or dates occur in every book. I liked this book much more than I thought I would and if you're interested in the human story, you can skip the technical one altogether."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"As years rolled on by since the Titanic set sail from Southampton, and Sank five days into her maiden voyage, technology as well as the human understanding of the elements of science began to evolve. So much, that the fabled liner was located 2 1/2 miles below the ocean's surface, 74 years after she foundered. Yet, a certain fog seems to surround the ship, rendering her tale perplexing, and when considering facts, figures and information, nearly incomplete. Accordingly, Dr. Pellegrino began to decipher the Titanic's, say, hieroglyphics laying on the bed of the Atlantic, in three sections, blown into a mile wide radius of debris. Through his book \\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\", he took the steps required to better understand the RMS Titanic. He took steps forward into our advanced civilization, into the future, and out to space. He also took steps back to a time or a world rather, seemingly so distant from our own today. A time when quite possibly, the Titanic may have existed, and then ceased to exist suddenly, altering the lives of many and shocking the minds of many more.In any event, the sinking of the Titanic has carried on a certain legacy among people. A grievous, sorrowful aspect of history, perhaps, handed down through first-hand accounts from survivors, and remarkable new evidence utilizing the latest technology. Yet there still remains a chapter of words unspoken, and I like to believe Dr. Pellegrino has embarked on this hidden scroll, of things those claimed by the Titanic would have liked to say. He mentioned such things in \\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\". His exceptional analysis of the ship's history contributed. In fact, one of the grandest characteristics of Dr. Pellergino's writing style in \\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\" is that he allowed the tragic aspects of the Titanic speak for themselves. Much like he stated \\"the Titanic is a Greek tragedy written by God, with Shakespeare as his muse\\". Dr. Pellegrino did an exceptional job of allowing God's story to take it's own course, and present itself to the reader. Possibly, living every moment of that story, alongside the ghosts of the Titanic themselves, awoken from their lingering slumber amongst the Titanic's wreckage. Often times, he uses your mind to take you into the minds of the people involved. And he never lets you forget, that the Titanic is a story about people. Just when everything reaches it's climax and it becomes difficult to grasp the idea that all the horrors of April 15th 1912 may seem so unrealistic, or maybe even so deeply imbedded into history that they appear to be near impossible. Yet, that very detail of human pride and arrogance is the key focus of what we all can learn from the Titanic's story, from the actions and mistakes of those that \\"lived and breathed that history\\". (James Cameron).Ghosts of the Titanic remains a collection of thoughts, quotes, actions and the length of the altered lives involved in the disaster. Pellegrino's experiences with the Titanic are shared and so eloquently described that they truly effect the reader. The Titanic is composed of so many intertwining stories of damaged lives that it becomes difficult not to completely connect with the fellow humans, and their agony - The Navratil brothers, Edith Russell, Thomas Andrews of even Officer Murdoch. Their lives are portrayed like the immortalized texts on the stone tablets they really are due to the Titanic - Helen Churchill Candee, or Major Peuchen, and their lives aboard the vessel ,and after it. Many people like to place themselves in their positions, and imagine how they would react. Reading Ghosts of the Titanic, it's your turn to witness the pandemonium, or standby and watch the lives of 2,200 people, on different ends of a social spectrum, share that one dramatic night.It's Pellegrino's unique expressed ability to take such subjects and allow them to branch off into so many, that truly defines the significance of science. The ability to unmask the overlapping characteristics of history inevitably repeating themselves like an endless complex cycle with humans at it's center. The logic is phenominal. And often times, it's amazing to learn we have control over this phenomenon, by learning how it effected others before us, others in that time long ago when 1500 people lost their lives to a sinking vessel. One traveling 21 knots into an ice field known to lie ahead, out of greed and arrogance. One that carried an insufficient amount of lifeboats, or one that left a scar on the hearts of so many, and inspired so much more in it's wake. More than any individual could possibly imagine.Dr. Pellegrino honestly knows how enthrall his reader. By explaining the functions of rusticle organisms that inhabit the empty corridors of the RMS Titanic. The pattern or chain reaction of events that took place then and do now is hard to miss. He introduces a new world where sea snow disturbs the liners deterioration and the deterioration of our own ozone layer. Global warming and increasing CO2 levels in our atmosphere holds it's own tragic tune. This web of events, and experiences takes it's toll on the venerable heart, it allows the brain to wander, and leaves the soul enough warmth to regret ever attempting to leave the icy night RMS Titanic disappeared beneath the ocean's surface, only to resurface again. He weaves together the finest silk both history and science have to offer.I've encountered a world, I will carry on with me forever. The books is fast paced, and quite detailed. Pellegrino is clever, and his use of events from his own life and how the books subject - Titanic and science - have effected him proves to be an effective way to draw in the reader. I highly recommend it to any reader, willing to take the adventure."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I was glued to every word! I am currently doing my own research for an article for the Titanic Historical Society. I have been reading and visiting museums, and searching the web for everything I can find on the subject. Charles Pellegrino knows how to weave perfectly, the threads of scientific, archiological, historical, and humanistic truth of this puzzling and sad event. He tells of his intuitive thoughts, his experiences, his personal research, cross referenced with facts from Walter Lord, eyewhitness accounts, data from his many dives to the wreck site, and analysis of the debris field. He gives you every layer possible to this complex story. Many very interesting tidbits, and staggering revelations! Truely and enthralling read!!! Thank you Mr. Pellegrino!"},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"The author of this book is actually a scientist who has personally visited the Titianic wreck. As such the book is a very interesting work that attempts to cover the last few hours of the ship, and his own theories on how it sunk.The science part of the book is very good. He argues well that it was a series of small punctures that sunk the ship, and uses a set of illustraions of the ship at various sinking times to prove this. There are some figures in this book, such as the terminal velocity of the ship as it sank, and the PSI (pressure) exherted on the wreck. These are presented simply- I am not a scientist, but I found his explainations easy to understand.Alongside the scientific narrative he also tells the story of the last hours before the ship sank, from the points of view of various passengers. This is a rather exciting read and does indeed feel more like a movie or action novel. It is well mixed with the scientific explainations, but perhaps a little too mixed- he jumps from science to history very randomly. One moment he will be discussing sea bed bacteria, the next he will be discussing a first class passenger's last words to his wife!My only real criticism is that as a historian he is far to judgemenal- he is attmepting to create heros and villains much in the same way as in the movie &quot;Titanic.&quot; Furthermore he seems rather critical of the English, whom he sees as stupid and arrogant and ineffiecient- again something clearly influenced by the movie. This leads to a bias that makes the historical part seem rather too fictional. Occasionally he is wrong on certain details- Lino wasn't a new invention in 1912, for example. He is far too keen to place modern American values (such as attitudes towards class) on an event that took place nearly 100 years ago.Novice readers be aware that he does talk in naval jargon, such as Port/Starbord to Steerage (third class) and smokestack (funnel).Overall this is a good book, well written and easy to read- and it also tells a powerful and compelling story. His scientific arguements are excellent and well put, but his history is amateur and shouldn't be taken as fact."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"I got this book for a gift after it came out, and found it to be very helpful in my own research regarding some of the people involved in the tragedy.

I would recommend this book to anyone that would want to know what it was really like that night the liner sank.

She was the second ship sent out. The cable ship &quot;Mackay-Bennett&quot; was the first ship sent out and she recovered most of the bodies that were retrieved.The good doctor also writes of Walter Lord interviewing or talking to Second Officer Lightoller in 1956. Then Walter Lord must have known a good medium as Lightoller died in 1952."},{"Title":"Ghosts of the Titanic","review":"Pellegrino does have a busy mind and he takes interest in so many angles. Many reviewers complain this book gets boring, but for me (no scientist) the rusticles and their importance were the most fascinating aspect of this Titanic story, one of innumerable accounts of that tragic night.The \\"rusticles\\" are a new life form, rust and bacteria symbiotically eating the carcass of the ship. Medical research on rusticles may someday save more lives than Titanic lost. They deserve all the attention Pellegrino gives them.A fresh angle Pellegrino offers on this old story: the dangerous \\"don't challenge authority\\" syndrome. Capt. Smith knew better than to speed through ice-laden waters on a moonless night. His higher-ups, however, kept pressuring him to increase speed, and he obeyed. How hard it is for us to challenge authority, risk our jobs, dare to defy orders. But if only Capt. Smith had...\\"If only\\" is the litany of all tragedies, such as Romeo and Juliet and the endless little details which might have made all the difference.The market is glutted with Titanic books, but this one is one of the most creative and thought provoking.

Though I wasn't as interested in some of the over-dramatized reactions to seeing clothing and shoes, I did love his reconstructions of events familiar to most Titanic junkies. Ever since reading Lord's book, I've been a bit of a Titanic junkie -- this book fueled my interest and corrected many false or exaggerated accounts from earlier books. A must-read for Titanic fans -- those not interested in other scientific matters can easily skip the techie sections and concentrate on the purely Titanic stuff.

I first read it when it was included in one of the sixth grade readers back in the 1960's.The story of an American boy, Chad Powell, whose father, an ornithologist seeking a rare species of the bird of paradise family, has gone missing in the jungles of Papua New Guinea. Chad joins in on an expedition to find his father. Along the way he meets and befriends a native Papuan boy, Natua, the son of a native officer in the Armed Constabulary. The expedition encounters native peoples and the wonders and dangers of the rain forest, including an elusive and dangerous tribe living deep in the jungle.I've thought this book would make for a great family adventure movie in the tradition of the classic Disney productions of the past, like The Swiss Family Robinson and Treasure Island.The official Armstrong Sperry website says, \\"Here is an adventure story with a strange and colorful jungle background, but more than that, it is the tale of two boys who find race and language difficulties no barriers to a fast friendship and an exciting adventure.\\" See more at [...]"},{"Title":"T.

He instructs his protegee the use of peyote to meet spirit guides such as mescalita almost as enigmatic an entity as don juan haha. It is hard to really describe what this book has to offer, because although it can be it is not written as a casual read.The style is accessible, yet filled with metaphysical insights making it definitely NOT a skimmer, this book can be reread many times and leave one with fresh ideas.The Teachings of don Juan is an important book in the mold that Huxley's The Doors of Perception is important not advocating mind altering drugs but with the clear message that there is truth revealed through hallicenigens administered with caution.I enjoyed it, yet still trying to wrap my head around several of the ideas written within."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"This book is an amazing journey a must read!!!

I am very interested in esoteric knowledge (I will not demeen the book or esotericism with the term New Age) and was hoping to get a fresh perspective on it; and one that was more local (as in my neck of the woods) to boot. I, as an American, have a shamefully low amount of knowledge of Native American tribes and their beliefs. I must be frank about that so as to not imply that I have read other books on Native American spiritually and can judge it on that level. This is for all intents and purposes my introduction to this field. I also have read none of the author's later works so I do not know how they add to or complement this book. I can however say that I doubt this is that place to start if one is seriously interested in this specific subject, nor does this book contain any spiritual insights that cannot be found elsewhere and in far more intellectual contexts (here I would suggest that any searchers of such wisdom turn to the Vedas, Buddhist scripture, the New Testament, the Edda...all written by far more advanced people and containing universal knowledge that Castaneda's book, by definition, cannot as it deals mostly with altered states of consciousness through use of local flora...and fauna, in a rather repulsive scene that seems highly unlikely to endeer the practioner to the animal community he is trying to befriend).As a story it is rather interesting and hard to put down. Don Juan is certainly an interesting character although I suspect that Castaneda does not do him justice as Castaneda seems to me to be of average intelligence only, although blessed with a quest for adventure and knowledge. I use the incredibly useless attempt through the second half of the book as an example to give a \\"scientific\\" explanation of Don Juan's theology, for lack of a better term. Anyone with half a brain can skip all of this as it contains information that, if not grasped by the reader in the first section, will certainly not be made more comprehensible to said reader by adding a college-freshman level anthropological analysis.To sum up, there is no harm in reading this book and since it clearly has changed a number of lives for the better and opened up the minds of many others I would certainly recommend reading it if you are interested. To others with a more serious desire of attaining spiritual wisdom and are intellectually up for a much more demanding quest I think you will find this to be nothing more than a fun story of a Yaqui and his American apprentice (whether real or not).

Although I would never recommend the usage of any of these plants (there are much safer but equally powerful alternatives), it gives a very valuable insight and a glimpse into the realm of multiple realities, which can actually be experienced while dreaming or meditating.

Lets say your really smart with a 4.50 gpa at an Ivy league school. Surely at first you ll laugh at this simple book. Either you totally buy in to this book or you think its a joke.Also use caution. Without a teacher like Don Juan, most of this information is useless. If you like it read it and study it. You will learn a thing or two. My recommendation don't buy into the mescaline aspect of the book. This book was written decades ago (in the last century)when you could buy real mescaline. The drugs that are available now are very dangerous, so if your a young person do not attempt to do anything related to using mescaline or tripping.To imagine what Don Juans' world is like, try becoming a dog for a few minutes. Dogs have no concept of time, or the internet, or the earth as a planet. To them the earth is a never ending universe a place as big as their territory. Imagine youre a dog under a full moon in the desert out hunting, you can sense and smell everything, you are the master of this place over all creatures of nature.When Carlos starts out he learns like a puppy, and then over the years becomes a master hunter-dog. He no longer experiences time. Under the full moon in the desert one night can go on indefinitely. The experience can last a long time, until the dog realizes it transcends death. I have learned from this book along time ago, and it helped me deal with complex problems.

It is also part of (and a prime influence on) a larger and long-standing trend of misrepresenting the cultural traditions of peoples ranging from the Lakota to the pre-Christian Celts, misrepresentations that always conveniently march with the author's own yearnings for peace, brotherhood, inner harmony, harmony with nature, or mind-blowing drug trips, as the case may be.There are many who support such lying, although they may call it tricksterism. Their motives vary: contempt for rational inquiry as a disease of the Western mind, or a personal preference for imaginative possibility over too-much-work realilty, or a tricksterish joy in pulling the noses of scientists and scholars, or (perhaps) admiration of someone who managed to parlay THEIR tricksterism into fame, fortune, and a Ph.D. from UCLA. I've read at least one \\"why-should-we-care\\" review in which the reviewer's attitude seems founded in the idea that only an unsophisticated, uptight person would care if Castaneda was a liar.I prefer to believe that an enlighted Westerner truly respectful of indigenous shamanic traditions should care if such a tradition is being misrepresented and exploited for money. (If indigenous peoples have not always fared well at the hands of conventional anthropology, it is merely adding injury to injury to go all postmodern on them and start treating them as fictional characters subject to infinite regressions of irresponsible description.) Castaneda's lies aren't a critique of conventional fieldwork (as David Silverman absurdly claimed); they are merely an awful warning reminding us of the necessity for rigor in research and analysis--and some rigor on the part of the junior scholar's mentors, as well. The conventional fieldworker who fronts himself in his writing invites the critic to evaluate his experience and discount as much of it as seems appropriate. Castaneda, sitting in the UCLA library reading about peyote trips at times he was supposedly in the desert having them, is just lying.One reason many of his admirers don't care if he's lying is that they see him as playing Don Juan to us, putting the reader through hoops as Don Juan put him through hoops in the books. They want there to be an imaginative truth in \\"Don Juan\\" that justifies the place of honor it held in their youthful reading. But Castaneda's books aren't skillful koans begging to be deciphered in order to trigger mystical insights. They are just clumsy and rather obvious fictional descriptions of mystical experiences that are commonplaces in fiction (including fictional encounters with shamans). The only difference with Castaneda is that his experiences were presented as fact, and a generation of hippies invested themselves in finding significance in this claptrap when they might have found greater spiritual benefits in reading some good poetry. Strip away the claims of literal truth from Castaneda's books, and there is no deeper or higher or more spiritual or more poetic truth. He isn't reaching for the stars; he is lying for profit.It is perhaps useful to compare \\"The Teachings of Don Juan\\" to Aldous Huxley's \\"The Doors of Perception,\\" a sincere and well-written book that really is reaching for something. Or Robert Graves' \\"The White Goddess,\\" a work often taken as descriptive history, but freely admitted by its author to be a speculative, poetic meditation on the divine sources of inspiration in Western mythic tradition. Or Robert Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" an attempt at original philosophy told (sort of) through first-person experience whose genesis was transparent and mundane. Or the genuine self-fronted fieldwork in African Diaspora religions done by James Wafer in \\"A Taste of Blood\\" and Karen Brown in \\"Mama Lola.\\" By contrast, Castaneda is a tawdry sideshow shill.Or, to take a different sort of example, a ghost story in a collection of supposedly true ghost encounters is almost always short and matter-of-fact in writing style, with nothing like the chilling effect of a literary ghost story such as \\"The Haunting of Hill House.\\" There's no reason it should be well-told, because its perceived value is as an accurate account of true experience. If it isn't a true experience, then it had damned well better be well told. With Castaneda, even though doubts about the veracity of his experiences began to be expressed quite early, the \\"true story\\" assertion carried all before it, and created a nimbus of apparent value around not very much. (The same thing is the case with the appalling success of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which was so popular because so many people believed it be a true--or at least plausible--account of history, employing sound methods of research and interpretation.)Most of us can look back on our youth to find infatuations that don't really stand the test of time. (I'm looking at you, \\"Collected Poems of Dorothy Parker\\"!) We can appreciate in retrospect what was of value in whatever it was, and why it spoke to us, without having to prove that it really did contain the wisdom of the ages. Let go, Don Juan worshippers!But the main point can't be made too often: Castaneda presented lies as spiritual truth, hoaxing a generation of seekers for his own profit."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"From a literary perspective I think this is a well-written book, especially compared with things like The Celestine Prophecy which is a kind of pale echo. But there is no way this is an anthropological record. To me Don Juan seemed transparently a projection of Castaneda's own hallucinogen-inspired reflections and conclusions about consciousness and being. Putting the teachings into the mouth of a wise but unverifiable native sage gave him a credibility he would lack as merely a philosophical young drug abuser. Castaneda's insights aren't necessarily invalid, and maybe some readers feel less discomfort about accepting a liar as a guru than I would, but when he makes miraculous claims I hope most would take it with a big grain of salt. And when he describes his patently dangerous drug experiences, I fervently hope no reader will be tempted to munch peyote like M&Ms.;Personally I'm grateful that as a teenager craving the transcendent experience of reality, I discovered and fell in love with Henry David Thoreau rather than Carlos Castaneda. The luminosity Thoreau discovers within reality, Castaneda chases through hallucinations with a butterfly net."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"another one star review because this book's rating NEEDS to come down (too bad they did not have half a star available). Before you buy and / or read this book please take into consideration a few things:in anthropological circles this book, as well as it's author, is not taken seriously (for further reference you can check out Marvin Harris' critique in the last chap. of &quot;Cows, Pigs, witches...&quot; ). This is not because of some snobbish attitude towards alternative points of view or towards people practicing anthropology even though they don't have an &quot;prestigious&quot; background.First off, the author had no athropoligical training to begin with, AT ALL. To make things worse, he never travelled to/through Mexico. This is were the real problem begins. If you want to read it, take it like regular fiction, since it all came from the imagination of the author (or maybe from a very bad trip). But do not take it as representative of anthropological studies, or memoirs of a true investigation. This is where the greatest misconception arrises: even though he became famous due to this book (he even got an honorary degree i beleive), the book was only lucky enough to come out while the interest in the drug culture, as well as in indigenous culture, was starting to peak.When choosing what to read, who to read, it's always good to find out a little about the author and his/her background, the fact that he has become popular does not mean that he should be taken as seriouly as he is (it would be kind of like reading Illusions by R. Bach and thinking that bach actually met a traveling messiah who used to be a mechanic :D )."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Thanks to conscientious reviewers here speaking out about this book (and its sequels) for what it is: a wholesale literary con job. I post this review in order to lend my voice to others raised in concern about this. If \\"Teachings of Don Juan\\" had been offered honestly, as a novel, would it have been reviewed as a good one? I doubt it, but we'll never know. For it captured attention by claiming to be anthropology, nonfiction. The circumstances and events recounted in its pages were supposedly true, and actually happened. Or so we were told by its author and publisher. For readers, THAT was the primary basis of interest in it.Back in the 1970's I read the first couple Don Juan books in a spirit of trust. I accepted them as presented: ethnography, true or at least honest reports of anthropological field work. Later I learned there was nothing truthful or honest in Castaneda's writing about \\"Don Juan's teachings\\" despite the misimpression perpetrated -- deliberately -- by the book's claim to nonfiction status.I was not pleased to find out my trust had been abused, that as a reader I'd been played like a violin as a reward for my interest. \\"It's your fault for having been interested, don't blame Castaneda\\" -- is that the deal? Doesn't life strip us of our innocence quickly enough in its own way, without being aided and abetted by con artists and their handiwork? But looking around at comments here, seems there are other ways of looking at this \\"sadder but wiser\\" dilemma -- from all the glowing 5 star reviews and incoherent praise still heaped upon this book by some readers.Back when \\"Teachings ...\\" came out -- and still nowadays, to some extent -- the wilderness of mind had been dramatically revealed, for the first time in the history of our civilization, by personal experiences of many inquiring people with peyote, LSD, etc. Consciousness-expansion opened upon a vast, compelling inner realm, hitherto unfamiliar and unexplored in Western culture (though long familiar in the East, where yoga and various forms of meditation have been intensively practiced for several millennia). With their provocative intensity and vivid intimations of profound meaning, psychedelic experiences impelled many to seek out guidance, food for thought, answers to questions ages-old but newly realized; and difficult to even word clearly, much less discover answers to. This was the atmosphere in which the Don Juan books were presented, and their effectiveness as bait to hook the unwary metaphysical seeker seems pretty clear.The search for some kind of spiritual, metaphysical or transcendent knowledge, truth or understanding -- sparked in many by direct personal psychedelic experiences -- expresses something acutely real and essential in the human equation. It deserves to be treated with honesty and respect. But obviously, it can also be exploited in a crass, reprehensible manner as a vulnerabilty or weakness by clever manipulators; whether they are the Elmer Gantry type (using old time religion) -- or psychedelic pied pipers surfing the waves of the new age. It's unacceptable, and there can be no excuses, contrary to the unpersuasive, presumptuous attempts at justification offered by many.Thinly masked beneath a beguiling surface, the Don Juan books express values antithetical to personal growth or self-realization, authenticity, pursuit of truth, and humane regard for ourselves and others. Castaneda's great contribution is a morally toxic perspective that we're all fools, and nothing matters, so there's no point in caring about anyone or anything except one's own self. To heck with whoever or whatever, and yippee for each of us at everybody else's expense. His writings are a Trojan horse, trickery disguised as a gift.The message is masked with a lot of verbal gobbledy-goop, Rorschach ink-blot nonsense readers are put upon to ascribe meaning to -- about being \\"impeccable\\" and \\"a warrior's predilection\\" and ... etc. It goes on and on in a dense fog machinery. He even makes up new nonsense meanings for words (like tonal, and nagual) he ripped from anthropo literature (where they actually have definitions referring to realities of Mexican lore and teachings). But boiled down, his gist is we can be predators or prey, that's the choice we have. Honesty, trying to relate, or seeking connection, that's for losers -- alienation and lies are what makes the world go around. And it's exhilarating, liberating, because it means we don't have to worry about anything, because we're all just gonna die sooner or later so -- whatever. Yippee.As a con artist who got rich selling this snake oil medicine, Castaneda has become a towering inspiration of the worst kind to others. A new generation has \\"gotten it\\" and followed suit, leading to a whole raft of similarly phony exploitative works pretending to be something else less despicable and more worthy or our interest and attention.For anyone interested, there is DeMille's book \\"Don Juan Papers.\\" Also, visit sustainedaction dot org -- an excellent website exploring the legacy and fallout of the Castaneda phenomenon. It proves much darker and more disturbing than one might imagine; even if you already know the Don Juan books -- to this day still classified as nonfiction, presented as real life accounts -- were sheer fabrication, cleverly geared to deceive readers."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Carlos Castaneda creates an interesting scenario and has appealing characters in this, his first book, yet the title is deceptive. Castaneda meets Don Juan, a Yaqui sorceror, and is in some mysterious way drawn to him. Don Juan agrees to allow Castaneda to be his apprentice, and learn the ancient ways to become \\"A Man of Knowledge.\\" Oddly, the way that Don Juan sees the path to becoming \\"a man of Knowledge\\" is through hallucinogenic drugs including Peyote, Datura and Mushrooms. Castaneda uses these drugs in order to \\"gain knowledge\\", and through these experiences, according to Don Juan, they assist him on this path. As the book progresses the author has more and more drug experiences but it is difficult to observe that he has gained knowledge about anything other than the effects of these drugs. No special insight into human nature is revealed by Castaneda or Don Juan, who reveals himself to be a devious misogynist. It is well known among shamanic cultures that plant drugs can induce visions and insight, but unfortunately, nothing of the sort is revealed in this book."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"This is the first item i've ever given one star to and I know i'm going to get slated as so many other reviewers here rave about it. I'm sorry to say it has many faults. I feel it is poorly written and has little to keep you engaged. You get no real feel for the main people in the book and the constant questioning of Don Juan that is refused an answer, or that receives some pseudo spiritual response, is extremely tedious. The hallucinogenic visions are uninspiring to read and the interpretations are spurious. The second half that attempts to analyse the 'lessons' from the experiences is jargon laden and tries to be too clever. As a text explaining various Yaqui rituals it has some merit, and it's explanations of drug preparation is fairly clear, but you can get this information online without trawling through such uninspiring dross. I have read many, many books of a spiritual nature, as well as many books on a variety of topics, as my varied and extensive reviews will illustrate, and I'm really sad to have given a book so highly praised by others such a low review, but I really disliked this book and felt it has very little to offer in terms of spiritual message. Easier reads, with clearer messages are out there (The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, or Way of the Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman to name two mainstream books and a whole host of more in-depth and meaningful books) and this book only serves to muddy what should be ones clear path to deeper spiritual growth.

What makes this so interesting is the simplicity of a primitive culture that contains hidden variables of deep meanings which are beyond our modern superficial Western culture that brags of it's technology and materialisms. We may have the sciences to manipulate raw materials but we are seriously lacking.In this book, there are pre-agreements made directly and alluded to before experimentation using three separate hallucinatory plants; Jimpson Weed, Peyote and Mushrooms, each plant representing a very different perception of non-ordinary reality, from power and ally to helper. The ideas agreed on are done with the skill of Don Juan, where one expects a particular paradigm prior to ingestion, truly psychology at work. If such teachings were not given special prior consensus than interpretations would be entirely different. The whole process of teaching takes much time - years- and there are serious ritual preparations involved.The majority of the book contains diary entries, while the later is a structural analysis of the events. It is all written very well and surprising when reading the second portion how intense all the ideas really are. Now this book is the first of a series of 15 books that further these teachings. While to some the idea of speaking to a Mescalito to show one the right way, to turning into a crow or fighting off an enemy trying to take your soul may see absurd or insignificant superstition but the deeper implications of the mind here are assessed and there is a psychology that ventures in deeper plains than mere doctrinal formulations and surface meanings."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Carlos Castaneda is a magical writer. He is a masterat drawing you into a mystical new environment andcaptures your interest to the extent that you end upquestioning major cultural assumptions you make inyour own belief system. Very few people question basicexistential questions anymore. It is pity. The drugissue in this book is very overblown. They are but avehicle to awareness, never an end in and of itself.Different cultures use different vehicles. I myself wouldsuggest a long walk on a foggy San Francisco evening,but that's probably because I live in San Francisco. Readthis book, it is one of those that could change your life."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Castaneda does not limit his account to conclusions on anthropology - he is also concerned with capturing the \\"teacher's\\" philosophy and preserving the thought system of the shaman. His study began with the goal of gathering information on medicinal plants used in the Southwest by Indian witch doctors. He then discovered the teacher don Juan, who is a \\"man of knowledge\\" determined to convey this same status to the author. The study concluded thirty years later as he embraced the shaman's world-view whole-heartedly.The title of this book reveals a summary of the thesis: that don Juan's teachings were a \\"way of knowledge\\", that is, they are a coherent system of thought and philosophy, and a code of conduct through which truth and reality could be discovered.The author's first task in proving his thesis is to organize the shaman's teachings into a system with structure and cohesion. This was a massive task, because the data was gathered exclusively from conversations and experiences with the shaman over several years, and often under the personal influence of hallucinogenic substances. In approaching this, he used a guiding paradigm that assumed \\"practical actions of everyday life were a bona fide subject for philosophical discourse\\" (intro p.12) and that the subject being researched should be examined according to its own set of rules. Castaneda works to establish the \\"system\\" of his thesis by arranging the pertinent elements of the shaman's teachings into an \\"operative\\" structure, which links all the elements of being a \\"man of knowledge\\" into an understandable sequence.The second thread of his thesis is to show that there is special \\"knowledge\\" or reality, which can be discovered through the teachings. Castaneda calls the knowledge attained by the shaman \\"non-ordinary\\" reality. Examples of this knowledge are events seen from afar, the discovery of ordinary facts previously unobtainable, and metaphysical knowledge. He uses an extended narrative of his hallucinogenic experiences to support this element of the thesis. Knowing that this evidence will not stand on its' own, he defines a process of validating \\"special consensus\\", which is basically an exposition of don Juan's method of confirming, guiding, and possibly manipulating the experiences of the apprentice. Still, the author acknowledges that to accept this part of the thesis required \\"the adoption of a certain point of view validated by the totality of don Juan's teachings\\" (p. 189), which is another way of saying there is no external consensus to validate this \\"non-ordinary reality\\".Readers will be convinced that the shaman is not just a simple magician - he has an overall goal in mind for his apprentice. However, the author is faced with the problem that the specifics of the shaman's ritual practice bear a distinctive sense of being very ad-hoc. It is very difficult to establish any relationship or reason behind the shaman's rituals and the sought after discovery of \\"non-ordinary\\" realities, at least within a world view that values empirical consensus. Finally, the author undermines his own structural analysis by stating, \\"Conclusions, therefore, are only mnemonic devices...(intro, p.19)\\" If that is the case, the reader may wonder why he should accept the author's conclusions to be true.Did the author support the teachings as a means to special knowledge? A major difficulty in this area is the very requirement that hallucinogenic substances be used to grasp this non-ordinary reality. Since the shaman, who was not hallucinating, exclusively corroborated the experiences of the apprentice, they bear a striking resemblance to hypnosis. So, the while he was successful in showing that the teachings had a cumulative effect in his own experience, it appears that the philosophical underpinnings to attain this knowledge were baked in by the author.Castaneda's description of don Juan's philosophy closely resemble the pantheism practiced widely by Native Americans of centuries past. For example, a device used by the shaman was to assign anthropomorphic qualities to each of the drugs. Western philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries had discounted pantheism for its' failure to adequately deal with the problem of evil and other inherent difficulties. To his credit, however, Castaneda provides valuable detail of the shaman's concept of reality (which is sorely needed by those of us who have a such a monolithic view of native religions!)The strength of Castaneda's work is his ability coalesce the broad range of thoughts, ideas, and behaviors of his subject into a systematic world-view. His ability to do this could be classified into an academic discipline in it's own right. The weakest element of his book is his attempt to show that \\"non-ordinary reality\\" is something real. While he rightly alerts us to the existence of non-material reality, he does not adequately demonstrate that his experiences as the shaman's apprentice were anything more than hypnotic hallucinations.While this book focuses on a culture that is more Mexican than Californian, it does inform our understanding of the diversity of thought among indigenous people on the western side of the continent. Also, understanding the comparative beliefs of native religions is vital to understanding the history of the Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries in California. Both early and modern missionaries are concerned with contextualizing their message while at the same time avoiding syncretism. Some early missionaries did a lot of things right in contextualizing their message by adapting it to the native culture. However, that sometimes led to syncretism when the native religions were mixed with the Christian beliefs. The missionaries distinguished between \\"superstitions\\" and \\"idolatries\\", tolerating the former but reacting with a heavy hand against the latter . A detailed understanding of a particular native groups belief system, such as Castaneda has provided, is a critical element to a study of how the Spanish missionaries may have been motivated in their evangelistic endeavors."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I read this book when I was 13 years old. I was fascinated by what Castaneda wrote in this book and his other titles. However, what mystified me about this book is the authors reference to certain secrets that a yaqi shaman named don juan knew. For instance in the teachings of don juan, Castaneda claimed that don juan knew certain secrets of plants that would give all kinds of secret knowledge to the one who knew how to use these plants. The jimpson weed for example was claimed by don juan to give infinite power. However, I found out in my twenties, that don juan was nothing more than an indian magician. That is, he used mind altering drugs to blow open the mind of Castaneda. The secrets don juan claimed to possess are not in the plants, but in ones own mind. As such don juans teachings are nothing more than an indian method of gaining enlightenment. Something hindus try to achieve through yoga, ritual magicians through magick, and buddhists and taoists through meditation. The whole book is devoted to the use of natural drugs. Peyote, jimpson weed, magic mushrooms that are detailed in the book, gives one the impression to go out and try these drugs to gain the power and knowledge that is detailed in Castanedas book. Or to go and look for a teacher of shamanism. These drugs are dangerous and there are far safer and saner ways to gain enlightenment such as meditation or ritual magick. But even these can be dangerous, if you dont know what you are doing. Good books and teachers are highly recommended. The mind of a human being contains the godhead, with all the infinite knowledge and power that goes with it. Castaneda should write disclaimers in his books, not only because of the drugs he describes, but because of ignorant people who might try what he describes."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"great fiction or reality! spellbinding and captivating. Castaneda takes you away into a world of fantastic imagination.certainly worth reading again."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"The book recounts the author's alleged experiences as apprentice of Juan Matus, a Yaqui native American shaman he met while conducting research on medicinal plants as an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles, during the summer of 1960.Castaneda's apprenticeship was based on the ceremonial ingestion of the psychedelic cactus peyote, whose principal agent is mescaline, the same substance that Aldous Huxley used for writing his book \\"The Doors of Perception.\\"Like Huxley's Doors, Castaneda's Don Juan can be seen as consistent with the hypothesis put forward by Bernard Haisch in his book \\"The God Theory\\" of an infinite consciousness that brings about the creation of physical reality with the ultimate goal of realizing its infinite potential.THE DARK SEA OF AWARENESSCastaneda learned that sorcerers of Don Juan's lineage were able to perceive human beings as \\"conglomerates of energy fields that have the appearance of luminous balls,\\" each one individually connected to an energetic mass of inconceivable proportions that exists in the universe:\\"...a mass which they called the dark sea of awareness. They observed that each individual ball is attached to the dark sea of awareness at a point that is even more brilliant than the luminous ball itself. Those shamans called that point of juncture the assemblage point, because they observed that it is at that spot that perception takes place. The flux of energy at large is turned, on that point, into sensorial data, and those data are then interpreted as the world that surrounds us.\\"Moreover, they also saw the universe a purposeful, infinitely conscious, \\"intelligent\\" entity:\\"Another of such masses of filaments, besides the dark sea of awareness which the shamans observed and liked because of its vibration, was something they called intent, and the act of individual shamans focusing their attention on such a mass, they called intending. They saw that the entire universe was a universe of intent, and intent, for them, was the equivalent of intelligence. The universe, therefore, was, for them, a universe of supreme intelligence. Their conclusion, which became part of their cognitive world, was that vibratory energy, aware of itself, was intelligent in the extreme. They saw that the mass of intent in the cosmos was responsible for all the possible mutations, all the possible variations which happened in the universe, not because of arbitrary, blind circumstances, but because of the intending done by the vibratory energy, at the level of the flux of energy itself.\\"The idea of the mind as a kind of filter that intelligently subtracts from infinite consciousness in order to allow us to structure the perception of everyday reality that proposed by both Haisch and Huxley, is also present here:\\" When the sorcerers of ancient Mexico saw the assemblage point, they discovered the energetic fact that the impact of the energy fields going through the assemblage point was transformed into sensory data; data which were then interpreted into the cognition of the world of everyday life. Those shamans accounted for the homogeneity of cognition among human beings by the fact that the assemblage point for the entire human race is located at the same place on the energetic luminous spheres that we are: at the height of the shoulder blades, an arm's length behind them, against the boundary of the luminous ball.Their seeing-observations of the assemblage point led the sorcerers of ancient Mexico to discover that the assemblage point shifted position under conditions of normal sleep, or extreme fatigue, or disease, or the ingestion of psychotropic plants. Those sorcerers saw that when the assemblage point was at a new position, a different bundle of energy fields went through it, forcing the assemblage point to turn those energy fields into sensory data, and interpret them, giving as a result a veritable new world to perceive. Those shamans maintained that each new world that comes about in such a fashion is an all-inclusive world, different from the world of everyday life, but utterly similar to it in the fact that one could live and die in it.For shamans like don Juan Matus, the most important exercise of intending entails the volitional movement of the assemblage point to reach predetermined spots in the total conglomerate of fields of energy that make up a human being, meaning that through thousands of years of probing, the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage found out that there are key positions within the total luminous ball that a human being is where the assemblage point can be located and where the resulting bombardment of energy fields on it can produce a totally veritable new world. Don Juan assured me that it was an energetic fact that the possibility of journeying to any of those worlds, or to all of them, is the heritage of every human being. He said that those worlds were there for the asking, as questions are sometimes begging to be asked, and that all that a sorcerer or a human being needed to reach them was to intend the movement of the assemblage point.\\"A PATH WITH HEARTThe genius of Don Juan is perhaps best expressed in one passage that has become a mantra of personal growth movements and spiritual seekers of the most diverse tendencies:\\"A path is only a path, and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you . . . Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself alone, one question . . . Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't it is of no use.\\""},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledgeby Carlos Castaneda is a complete hoax.

The second half of this book would be good for anyone interested in a more scientific view of his experiences. While personally I found it unimportant I'm sure I'll be rereading this wonderfully book with that part included.The first section of this book is deeply moving and well described. I felt great connection to many of the things Don Juan described. I related many of my own experiences of transformation to some of those that the author experienced on his journey. The Teachings (...) was almost a romantic read that seemed to pull me down in deeper with intense tales of soul journeys. Rightly so, I was shocked at the end of the book when the author described a dual with a Diablero(s) for his soul. While he gave into his fear, his first trial, I don't blame him.Also, I found the description of crows perticularly fasinating since I my-self identify with them greatly.Read, Learn, Grow, Change"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"From Reading all The reviews on this book ive noticed this was a highly intense subject. Note to the readers! Before you judge the book before buying have this in mind &quot;Carlos Castaneda&quot; Disapeared as of Last year... there was no funeral , no body and his family did not mourn his &quot;death&quot; or &quot;disapearence&quot; ... before i analyze this book let me say that in a book of the series he recalls that &quot;one day he will go to where he belongs and never come back&quot; reffering to jumping off a mountain the very same that his mentor &quot;Don Juan&quot; did and don juans body has never been found either. Jumping into an Abyss...Carlos jumped the mountain too along with them but survived Trying to convince himself that he didnt jump the mountain and survive cause it was IMPOSSIBLE, but he did and had to realize the power. So BAsically Carlos VAnished into a Abyss..For the skeptics, Forget Modern Science! because Modern Science only tells you &quot;fact&quot; not truth, Fact is very different from truth. Fact is what's Correct at that paticular moment, Which means with any discovery that fact can be turned into False within the wink of an eye. So you cannot Rely on Science as a legit Answer for life, Questions on Religion because science is not entirely true. Now no one knows how Advance The human Psychic Is! From Paranormal to Mystical... Somethings just can't be explained... Like voodoo, WitchCraft, Aliens. Personally I was a MAJOR skeptic about subjects of these, but in age , you start to see things... How our goverment Covers Up Many things to &quot;Protect us&quot; Deja Vu's. How in some households you see glasses of water on the floor a clear distinction in witchcraft. Voodoo in haiti. Paranormal activities such as Body possession. Some would say that humans are just animals we have no spirit just a slab of meat... One theory breaks this and science can not prove it false. The brain holds the essence of the spirit. what makes the brain work? the spirit. Like a robot that feeds on electricity to work.Think! the essence of electricty The essence of Spirit!

Everyone wants to believe, no matter how logical or sensable that person may be, that there are magnificent forces lurking about. Though most are not convinced by Castaneda's recorded experience, that fascination makes the pages fly-by.

He was essentially tricked into that way of life by a warrior-sage named Juan Matus who over a period of nearly 20 years, allegedly drafted him into service of becoming a sorcerer, a warrior, a seer, and a man of knowledge. The book lays out a description of a world of heightened awareness and perception which is both all around us and yet nowhere in particular.carlos castaneda, in his work The TEachings of Don Juan, a Yaqui way of knowledge&quot; did a very interesting field work study for UCLA it was widely criticized too, but a must read too. I think the essence of what he said was true, however, his work is certainly not the only source of information to corroborate the subject. He was criticized for not revealing sources, a fact that is inadmissable in the realm of academia and science, however, there is no way he made all that stuff up either. I think Juan Matus is a composite of many benefactors in Castaneda's life, and this should not detract from what he has to reveal about the paths in question. I would assume that he had to gain their trust in order to write that. If that's the case then he could never of revealed such info. This world is so messed up..

As a studier of religion for many years (although not as knowledgeable as some scholars) I find these books to be utterly unique in their scope and subject matter. They are not like other New Age books. The journey that Castaneda takes his readers is mind-boggling, and his experiences are simply beyond what most people have even remotely encountered.Castaneda first met Don Juan in the early 60's, before the hippy movement, before psychodelic drugs became popular. He was studying anthropology in Los Angeles, and Don Juan served as a field source for some fading knowledge of tribal and shamanistic rituals in Northern Mexico. Castaneda was specifically interested in peyote, a plant that gives its users hallicinations and mixes the senses in strange ways, and which LSD was meant to be a chemical reproduction of. Castaneda's first book presents a very detailed scholastic interpretation of his experiences. All books after the first simply focus on Castaneda's experiences with Don Juan.Castaneda's drug experiences are different from other accounts I have read, because they are intimately tied with the Yaqui philosophy and mythology. The drugs only serve as a means to an end, not as the end in themselves. The first 2 books in the series describe Castaneda's drugs experiences with Don Juan, but from the 3rd book on, the drugs disappear forever and Carlos' experiences are actually more fantastic, more amazing, more unbelieveable as he slowly becomes a practicing sorceror, traveling to alternate dimensions and battling other sorcerors. Many of the books seem to reach a definitive conclusion, only to have Castaneda's perceived understanding of Don Juan's teachings completely destroyed in the next volume. Again these experiences do not in any way compare to magic and sorcery you might find in pagan, christian, or celtic mythology, nor does the \\"world-philosophy\\" of Don Juan resemble in any way the wholistic ideals of Eastern religions like Hinduism or Buddhism. How can you describe things most people have never seen before? Castaneda does a good job, considering the fantastic nature of some of his journeys. However, while the visions and magical feats are mesmerizing to read, I often found that Don Juan gave his most profound knowledge while simply talking to Castaneda.Do to its subject matter, most Christians will find these books offensive, but I promise you that nothing in any of these volumes will turn you onto the path of Satan :) There is a certain participation required from the reader - Castaneda repeatedly affirms that everything he has ever written is absolutely true, but intelligent readers will be constantly wondering if such fantastic things could possibly exist. By turning off this little nagging \\"naysayer\\" in my own head and allowing myself to simply sink into the mood of the work and believe, I found that I was better able to intuitively understand the very abstract concepts that overwhelm you. However, because these accounts are SO unbelieveable, SO fantastic, SO unlike our everyday life here in the US, I found that I never confused my world with Castaneda's. It's like reading a book about walking on the Moon - you can understand and appreciate what it must have been like, but you don't start wearing a spacesuit to work!"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I enjoy Carlos Castaneda's books because they always offer an escape from reality -- in this case, I mean that quite literally.Castaneda's books involve an age-old technique of storytelling, the teaching of a body of knowledge from a master to a pupil. In this case, the master, a Yaqui Indian known as Don Juan, teaches the ancient Toltec art of sorcery to a young, first-person narrator, Carlos Castaneda. This narrator is dubious and incredulous as Don Juan shows him things about the nature of reality and our perceptions of it, but increasingly he has to conclude that the world of Don Juan is an accurate description of the may facets of reality, and our modern world is merely one narrow view.There is controversy over whether Castaneda's books are &quot;real&quot; --Castaneda was granted a PhD for his &quot;field&quot; work; but other scholars have found a lot of Castaneda's research to have no anthropological authenticity. Supporters of Castaneda dispute this.That there is even an argument over whether the books are &quot;real&quot; or not indicates how good the stories are -- like the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, people really, desperately want to visit Castaneda's world. His books are riveting, fascinating, beautiful, and also very scary.Although later books in the series (Tales of Power, for instance) are better than this introductory work; I think it is important to read the books in their order of writing, in order to get the &quot;lessons&quot; that Castaneda learns in the correct order.I am a great fan of the books, even if they are 100% fiction. But one is really just never sure if they are. . ."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"That might not come from reading this book alone, as it is the most believable of the series. When I was a student, I like many others I know who will confess to having read a Castaneda book or two when pressed, went through a couple of years of Castanedism, reading the 8 classics 2 - 3 times each, and even the later four, quite different books a couple of times. Being someone who likes to give the benefit of the doubt until conclusive evidence proves otherwise, I must admit to only getting suspicious by Journey To Ixtlan, the third book. The second book, A Separate Reality, picks up on the supernormal happenings, but these are still within the realms of possibility when one considers Spiritualist literature. By Tales of Power, when at the end Carlos throws himself off a cliff and only survives by becoming pure perception, bouncing elastically back and forth 17 times between the two inherent realms of all creation, the tonal and the nagual, the game was up. In Carlos' terms, my assemblage point had just experienced a considerable shift into the realms of disbelief. The cocoon had burst. I read the remaining books still interested, but with the growing realization that I'd been had. Bizarre ideas not found in any other spiritual traditions, such as the necessity for people on the path of knowledge to kill their children to reclaim the power they'd lost to them, plus fill in the holes in their cocoons the children had caused, made me wary. This was surely not a philosophy the whole world should turn to, or else we'd be living in a fearful, lonely world with every man for himself.However, this would be fine if the books weren't made out to be non-fiction. While I have seen these books placed with science fiction books in many libraries, in most European bookshops they're still sold with real, non-fiction 'Mind, Body, Spirit' books. The reason I give this book such a low rating is that an intensive study of his works, the books by his various colleagues, plus Richard De Mille's intelligent criticisms, can only lead to the conclusion that Castaneda, the writer, used Don Juan and Carlos, two fantasy characters, to verbalize his own beliefs, which were culled from his own spiritual and academic experience. That there are some useful nuggets of wisdom, or advice in these books I do not deny. That is their very attraction, plus the belief that it all really happened, and is a new spiritual revelation. But as these are mixed up with increasingly bizarre assertions and beliefs (by the Art of Dreaming it seems all pretence at non-fiction had been given up), it is doubtful whether a lifetime devoted to these practices (as opposed to say, real shamanic practices) would lead to spiritual improvement. If you must have a Castaneda book in your library, rather get The Wheel of Time, a selection of the spiritual highlights of the first eight books, but consider it rather 'The best of the personal philosophy of Carlos Castaneda' than anything to do with Don Juan or Shamanism. This understanding may not have the romantic mix of wild Mexican deserts, ancient wisdom, wise old men and naive westerners which captures the hearts of so many, but it is a lot closer to the truth.The anonymous ghost-writer at Simon and Schuster who corrected Peruvian immigrant Castaneda's English for at least all of his earlier works (a sample of his writing from 1969 reveals it was still far from perfect, not like what is in books), giving the books their special character, certainly deserves more credit than he or she gets. But they are not written well enough to succeed as fiction, hence their continued classification as non-fiction, besides the intense academic embarrassment it would cause copyright holders UCLA to have to admit such a dramatic change in classification, from fact to fantasy, after having previously given the author a doctorate for his work! I give this book one star on the basis that any book claiming to represent the truth which is later found to be fraudulent deserves no stars by definition, so I must give the minimum rating allowed. The day this book is reclassified as Fiction, I will up my rating to 3 stars though, as it is a quite entertaining and authentic piece of fiction-posing-as-non-fiction.At this point many a true believer will try play the only card they have left - the allegory or metaphor card, with the implication that the critic is not deep enough to have gathered that by now. However, there is a vital difference between a Castaneda book and an allegory - the latter always make it perfectly clear at the start that what follows is not to be taken as fact. A misunderstanding would mean losing the effect of the allegory. The Castaneda books, on the contrary, always start out with the reassurance that what follows is definitely fact. As UCLA Library stack request records prove that Castaneda was sitting in the library on the exact dates when he was supposed to be hanging out with Don Juan, it is thus fair to say that these books are neither factual nor allegorical.If you have bought the book already, I might as well warn you not to waste any time on the Structural Analysis at the end. That was only placed there to make a point for Castaneda. Coming after the gripping narrative of the Teachings, the impossibly dry and intentionally unreadable analysis in pseudo-academic jargon is merely meant to score points for Castaneda's one-time anthropological field of phenomenology, which is basically scientific reporting of the first-hand, direct experience type. Hopefully no true believers have fallen for Castaneda's joke and wasted time actually wading through it - I doubt it'll have done you more spiritual good than throwing yourself off a cliff."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"This Book allow you to connect to an ancient Indian Shaman collection of 'extreme knowledge into nature'a captivating and enthraling reading.

Carlos takes us on an entertaining journey to become a man of knowledge. As Don Juan advises you have no need to visit with Mescalito, Humito or other allies if you have the experience, or can imagine the experience. Carlos' clear narration makes it so that one has no need to visit the allies personally. I suspect if your imagination remains challenged or your adventurous side gets the best of you..... yet you won't have a guide for the journey! Here again you experience Don Juan through Carlos' descriptive narration.Don Juan teaches that to become a true man of knowledge one must overcome:1. Fear, then2. Clarity, that then gives them3. Power, and finally4. ageIf you wonder about Mescalito or Humito and other allies, the narrative of Carlos' journey should suffice without having to find your own man of knowledge and guide.As you read Carlos' narratives you may find yourself wondering about the veracity of what you read. As you discover the more you dive into his books he explains a reality distinct from our own. The arguments used to disprove his narratives seem unconvincing. If he were merely to have made these up then I can only stand back and marvel at his unique imagination. Yet it all seems very plausible for those that have undertaken deep spiritual meditative journeys or from talking with others who has experimented with mescaline and 'shrooms.Discussing this book with Gen X and Y folks leaves them staring at you slack-jawed as insects fly in their mouth to nibble on lunch remnants. Carlos' narrative, so widely read by Baby Boomers a long time ago and far away, has no resonation among the younger folks. So far, it seems that this partially explains their conviction that by just showing up they are ideally qualified to lead and decide. There is little questioning or wondering about the meaning of, or their perception of, reality.I bet you can't read just one of these books.Happy Travels![...]"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I always love when I find out about a new man of wisdom...

However, as the series progresses there is more of a narrative approach based on observation and feelings that make them much more readable. I have no knowledge of who Carlos really is or of his qualifications or lack of them. This doesn't matter to me. Even if it is complete fantasy made up by a mind warped by drugs, as some reviewers have claimed, there is still enough in there to marvel at it's originality. One thing I have found in the books that is worth it alone for the effort expended on reading them is the listing of the &quot;five enemies&quot; of the man of knowledge. This is not a chronological sequence but an iteration that occurs throughout ones' life. It takes more than a fleeting thought to understand this but is worth the effort. It may not be anthropology, it may not be non-fiction, it may not be scientific truth, but, it is 'something' and, I believe that it is worth the time of anyone who wants to explore to do just that. On a final note; if you only want to dip your toes in the water then I recommend you read &quot;Tales of Power&quot; in which Don Juan summerises to Carlos what has happened it the years leading up until then. If you have read the previous books then this is like a composer bringing together all the previous themes into a final movement. Charlatan? Maybe, but still a tremendous feat of writing and imagination anyhow. Things may not be just limited to the way that 'you' experience them. Rejoice in the diversity. If you have to be a scientist then have a look at quantum physics and still maintain that your view is the [right] [only] one!

The first book, &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan...&quot; was around twenty-five years before when mysticism and psychedelics where in fashion. Those same fashion trends have sprung up again which prompted a new book to be published and feed off the interest in the unproven and mysterious. The reason Carlos Casteneda has never been photographed is for the same reason all charlatans are never allowed to be examined by scientists. Of course, fans of Casteneda will reply by saying that western scientists are not of Castenda's culture and therefore their methods irrelevant to the Sorcerer's way. None-the -less, I abhore who ever Casteneda is and his publishers for printing such crap, which encourages the use of dangerous drugs and the belief in the unreal. I do not recommend these books."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Carlos Castaneda was an anthropologist who became a major figure in Shamanism and the sort of out-of-brain, out-of-body experiences that come with many of the ancient rituals practiced by various peoples and tribes. He learned much of what he came to know about sorcery, as he called it himself, from a man named Don Juan Matus. It was with Don Juan that he began experimenting with peyote to achieve altered states and have the experiences that have fascinated people for years.This is the first book in a long series where Castaneda chronicles his experiences, which grow more and more fascinating and bizarre. The fact that the wild stories are told by someone who sounds so absolutely grounded and serious gives them the weight that many other people talking about the same subjects often lack.That Castaneda later wrote about his own sorcery shouldn't lead anyone to think of figures like Merlin or even Harry Potter. The type of amazing magic and visions described in all of Castaneda's books veer off from the traditional ideas most people have of magic, as well as most people's ideas of religion. In fact, a large number of people in the scientific community say this book and the others are nothing but imaginative fiction. Castaneda claims everything he says it true.Whether you believe that or not, this book is the first fascinating volume of a series that's entertaining, surprising and gives quite a bit of insight into both Castaneda and Don Juan.Naked Spirit: The Supernatural Odyssey"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"People seem to think that this story is terrible only because it is fictional.

But in the Gita we have Arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud, but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at Krisna's encouragement to go through with the pasage. Arjuna keeps telling Krishna he doesn't understand a word Krishna said and Krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for Krishna to fully express the wisdom, spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos, it is necessary for Arjuna to NOT get him and to be continually the baffled coward, hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity, and always planted at square one while Krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - \\"Karma for the Complete Idiot\\".Castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the Don Juanisms to the reader. And they ARE truly profound - they're too heavy to be something Castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth!Castaneda did his research and it's the power of the Don Juan \\"nuggets\\" that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader! That said, however, I got the feeling that Castaneda was, by the 4th or 5th volume, really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level. Castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite and material trappings.

For instance, to take another writer, Nietzsche's naming of one of his works as Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None is very much within the shamanistic tradition, which appeals to a heightened subjectivity. If the book appeals to you, it is \\"for\\" you, but otherwise it isn't.In contradistinction to this are the quintessentially patriarchal texts of the Christian God and Allah. All foundationalist texts seem to fall from the sky already formed but in actual fact are the products of much prevarication and revision. Given that none of the patriarchal texts lie on a firm foundation, despite the vigorous promotion of the opposite idea, monotheistic religion does not have a better leg to stand on than shamanistic texts. The idea, \\"these texts are true because they have an authoritative source\\", does not seem to hold up where patriarchal authority is shown to be multiple, historically variable, subject to the political climate and ultimately devoid of an actual God to assure the authenticity of all interpretations.Herein lies the advantage of shamanistic writing, in that it does not require one to first believe in anything in order to gain benefits from it. One can read Carlos Castandena's Don Juan without any concern as to whether it is a reliable text. If Castaneda was in a sense Don Juan himself, having made up all the information and advice, the value of the text remains unaltered. Psychological trickery is fundamental to shamanism, just as it is a means by which its wisdom can be communicated. Nietzsche adoption of the tone of an old-testament prophet, despite being nothing of the sort and indeed inimical to the aims of religiously inspired persons, is a concession to the shamanistic spirit of mockery as a means for communicating wisdom. So if you come to the ultimate conclusion that you have been \\"had\\" by a shamanistic text, perhaps this is the principle lesson of life you needed learn all along: the meaning and value of skepticism.According to the principles of shamanism, what one says doesn't have to be True, but it has to work. By contrast, patriarchal reasoning demands that something has to be true when it is based on authority. However, it can neither show that its principles work, nor produce its authority. One may not be better off with shamanistic texts, but at least one is not worse off."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"If tomorrow historians discover that the Galilee did not exist, and from that you take that Jesus' message is worthless, do not read Castaneda.If you are looking for spiritual power, do not read Castaneda.But if as Pilate you have once asked: \\"What is Truth?\\" and you -unlike Pilate- are ready to put your life on the search, you will discover a world of beauty in Castaneda's books.And you will be grateful.Sorry for my poor EnglishI was born in Spain.

In what way are their lives, relationships and spirituality improved? Can they honestly say they're better people? Or that they have power over their lives? Where are the tangible results?Has reading Castaneda stopped their bad moods, protected them from despair at the ups and downs of life? Of course it hasn't. If a mugger robbed a Castaneda Warrior, could they control their response? No. If they had an accident that left them incapacitated, would they hold the same world view? No. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying. Has Castaneda stopped them from experiencing grief at, for example, sickness or bereavement of a close friend. Well, if he has I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist.Castaneda's claims are based on belief in the supernatural \\"nagual\\". So, it's only fair to ask what miracles have Castaneda followers witnessed as a result of reading the books or attending Cleargreen workshops? What \\"benefactors\\" or Toltec shamans have they met? Have they successfully assumed the \\"gait of power\\": for example, run blindfold through a busy market? Have they \\"stopped the world\\"? Have they seen luminous beings shaped like tombstones? Have they met a \\"death defier\\"? Have they jumped from a cliff edge and disintegrated, only to return to life? As for dreaming, anyone can have lucid dreams and \\"find their hands\\": I've done it myself. But is that the same as entering non-ordinary dimensions? No it is not.How can you be a Warrior unless you are in the military? Or a play-actor? The answer is that you can't. How can you be a Sorceror simply by believing in narration and dialogue? By pretending that you are one? The answer is that you can't. How can you be a shaman or \\"nagual\\" unless you are born into an appropriate indigenous culture and it is in your blood? The answer again is that you can't. But Castaneda fantasy role-players want to feel special.Part of the problem is that we are reliant on language. But our words are slippery and subjective. Outside of precise scientific definition, our words are hopelessly vague when we stop talking about practical matters and stray into the abstract. Castaneda relies on this sleight of hand. An example: \\"a path with heart\\". Taken as read, these words are meaningless. What kind of path do we mean? How can a footpath or a track, for example, have a \\"heart\\"? If we take this phrase to mean a direction we are (or think we are) taking in our lives, how can we distinguish which direction is better than another? Does \\"heart\\" mean emotional content? In which case, what kind of emotion? Essentially, \\"a path with heart\\" is a sound-bite and has as much validity.Castaneda is not simply anti-science, he is anti-knowledge and he is anti-humanity. How is it possible to shape-shift into a crow or an inorganic object outside of a drug trip? We barely understand the outlines of human psychology. But we know nothing at all about how animals experience the world. We barely understand the pets we own. And therefore we cannot comprehend animal psychology. In cognitive psychology, an animal psyche is what is called a \\"black box\\". In other words, we can only observe the results of stimuli, but never experience the psyche. For us, reason means human reason. As Wittgenstein appreciated, this means that we could never communicate with \\"aliens\\" unless they were blessed with human psychology: \\"if a lion could speak, we would not be able to understand him.\\"The irony is that, rather than being \\"men of knowledge\\", Don Juan, Don Genaro, the witches and the rest implicitly deny the need for knowledge because they want you to accept a simplified and unverifiable world view:\\"But the whole problem with that is that the average man - the one you have in mind when you talk about \\"us\\" and \\"not us\\" - very easily manages to overcome this need for knowledge. I don't believe that need even exists. There is a need to understand, and you don't need knowledge for that. The hypothesis of God, for instance, gives an incomparably absolute opportunity to understand everything and know absolutely nothing. Give man an extremely simplified system of the world and explain every phenomenon away on the basis of that system. An approach like that doesn't require any knowledge. Just a few memorised formulas plus so-called intuition and so-called common sense\\".Castaneda feeds the ego, blinds the eyes from reality."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Please remember that these books are fiction and are not based on a real Yaqui."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I must admit that I read &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan&quot; many, many years after his succeeding books. While it was informative and his adventure interesting, there were times however, when it appeared rather &quot;astral&quot;, although this is not a judgement. The astral element comes from his perceptions which are only natural on the path of enlightenment. It is merely a stage of transition from being restricted by mass beliefs, and the confronting of (because there is no way around it as we learn to create our reality) &quot;in-organic beings&quot;. In-organic beings are no more than &quot;thought constructions&quot; or &quot;thought forms&quot;, given life by those who fuel their existance by emotion... (please see &quot;Seth Speaks - The Eternal Validity of the Soul&quot; and note also, the emotional effects which such &quot;beings&quot; had on Carlos Castaneda, particularly in The Art of Dreaming or The Active Side of Infinity). But even Seth states that trips on drugs *could* be useful under supervision, although what often is in the subconscious can be frightening due to &quot;thought-forms&quot; of our own and the mass making. This is called &quot;the dark side of the soul&quot;, and is a natrual phenomenon and a learning tool used by various teachers of many cultures (the great masters included), as we learn about objectification and the many identities that cover the essential spirit. It is a necessary step that one must experience as one is being liberated from mere concrete knoweledge into the higher intuitional knoweldge of the soul. Mr. Castaneda was no doubt being given this opportunity with his mentor,who suspended his first attention long enough to experience other (the second attention) perceptual realities. Having done it with drugs initially was not necessarily &quot;necessary&quot; though and this is where we part roads. Not because I judge such measures but because ultimately, drugs are not necessary to have experiences if we in fact do have a soul (which is multi-dimensional). The illuminative properties of the soul enhances perception and expands consciousness. This is often to the dismay of the neophyte however because they wonder how to have such experiences. That is a question noone can truly answer and the timing has to do the intent of the soul itself and it's purposes. Mr. C's books are insightful however because they propose certain disciplines having to do with how one uses their intent and how one perceives the world. His learning and the verbage used to explain such phenomenon are though unfamiliar to most and one must put two and two together which is difficult if new to the path of spiritual studies (it literally takes years). It is simply a different bent put on an old topic that is as ancient as time. One might be better off reading the fundementals of perception and how one creates their experience by studying books by Seth or the great Masters (although the Masters keep certain teachings obscured to the uninitiated and talk in symbols a great part of the time). Never the less, that Mr. C may have dissappeared upon his departing from the world instead of dying in the manner we are accustomed to in this reality, would mean of course that he had transmuted his physical body completely in order to dissappear (or ascend). We won't know the answer to that and meanwhile, I found the need to jump off a cliff in order to &quot;die&quot; or find &quot;life after death&quot;, a most cumbersome proposition, unless it was not merely physical but a psychological process which in fact, all spirituality is deduced to. That Don Juan speaks of the light of the soul as some idealistic chimera that is merely there to appease human kind, (I forget which book and his words were quite different), I can assure those who read his books that the universe is not in fact, &quot;out to get you&quot; as it would seem due to his explanations, and we are not &quot;on the way to dying&quot; unless put in the context of the soul and a certain process in which our identity is &quot;cruxified&quot;, meaning, expanded and wrent asunder due to the incredible pressure of the soul itself and a greater identity that longs to be housed in a body, thus illuminating it. While reading &quot;A Fire From Within&quot;, Mr. C. no doubt has those illuminative moments that were given by the property of the soul. The drug part is inconsequential, but if one can get past the intricate and academic manner in which his message is presented, then one might have a chance to get beyond that to what is basically simple, because all truth, in the end, is always simple. Any complications are egoistic in source but necessary in the telling of a story in which others can relate."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Here's what I imagine Mr. Casteneda said to his academic advisor after, say, a week and a half of school: \\"Hey, man, I couldn't do my homework this weekend [because I was stoned out of my gourd the entire time] but would you believe I met a real sorcerer? You would? Cool!\\"Now don't get me wrong--I happen to believe wholeheartedly in shamans. Just not this one. Yeah, right, getting [wet] on by a dog is most surely a sign from above that you are chosen. By the dog, at any rate. I also noticed that while Mr. C had many problems with the concept that he should stay on Don Juan's porch until he found \\"his spot\\" (he got tired, he got scared, it wasn't easy, he was physically uncomfortable, it made no sense to him), he had no problem whatsoever ingeting any and all concoctions, whether they made him retch for hours, gave him tunnel vision, or simply knocked him unconscious for days. Actually, now that I think about it, except for the coma, I had pretty much the same reactions the last time I visited Mexico. Although I think mine was from a quesadilla I got from a street vendor."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I received my book very quickly (2days) and it was in like new condition, just as advertised.

The captivating point is the use of special herbs and plants for this purpose. Some spritualist may refer to this process as the dark side, however, the use of spiritual desciplines to tap and nurture your inner self cannot be underrated."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first. But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda. The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"However I just wanted to point out that this publication from the California University looks like a slapped up job. There are quite a few typos, most of which look like they occurred during scanning of the pages. It's really irritating while reading."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"My original review of this book was this:....a sad day in anthropology when such outlandish claims are taken for some kind of highly evolved truth.I have nothing against writing about mystical, magical experiences so long as the author makes plain that they are offered in a spirit of \\"take it or leave it.\\" But to lay them out as objective, empirical, SCIENTIFIC fieldwork without providing some kind of corroboration is scientifically dishonest.Maybe the miracles in Castaneda's books really happened. But he should not be in the position of expecting us to believe them without proof.It doesn't surprise me that he hid from the public. He'd have been asked embarrassing questions like: why all the inconsistencies throughout your books, some of them really rather flagrant? Are your writings scholarship or fiction? Why have you not informed the reader of the genre in which you believe you work? Why did you play such a dumb Watson to don Juan's Sherlock Holmes of the spirit? Where is your field documentation?When seers in good faith offer descriptions of their unusual journeyings, we all benefit. But when authors so conceal themselves that we aren't even sure when they were born, then proceed to pass off supposedly nonordinary happenings as scientifically objective, we're obliged to suspect salesmanship.A more recent addition:A friend just told me that one of Castaneda's lovers has outed him in print as the perpetrator of a fraud.I haven't read what she wrote, but what angers me about books like Castaneda's is that their secrecy and shoddy scholarship make all \\"alternative\\" accounts of reality suspect. Another outstanding example is Gurdjief, who after bragging at length about his ability to flummox people turns around and asks for belief in the mystical brotherhood he supposedly encountered in the mountains. Selling cars that stop working in a week would be more honest--and less damaging to those voices from the margins trying to tell us about \\"the farther reaches of human nature\\" and nature itself as a mysterious spiritual realm we have scarcely begun to explore.If, as an author, you've been abducted by aliens or shown the glowing outlines of God's divine plan for the universe, then at least have the goodness to keep it all tentative: \\"Something happened to me that I cannot explain in the usual language. I'm not asking for belief, but only for a little space to discuss my account of what it was--which you don't have to believe....\\" would do just fine for most of us. Better yet, tell us exactly what you did--which means: tell us honestly without convenient gaps--so we can experiment with it ourselves and see if the same doors open for us. Anything else, and you're just adding to the list of unscrupulous opportunists fattening your bank account on stolen bits and pieces of genuine revelation."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"In our times when darwinism and so-called science is pushed down the throats of toddlers who never have a chance to acquaint themselves with different ways of looking at the world than the PC version, this book, along with many others, should be compulsory reading - or rather, is compulsory reading, morally, for any thinking individual who wants to make up his own world-view instead of adapting to one served to him so as to make him a servant for the system.i won't argue whether or not Castaneda was a conman or not, that is entirely beside the point of whether or not the philosophy and worldview of don Juan are true and realizable.This book is of course only an introduction to don Juan's path, and the teachings of almost pure shamanism have little to do with the direxion it is shown to take later on. However, this serves as a plaform upon which one must step before venturing further, introducing a way of life more in connexion and in tune with nature and natural surroundings.What sets this, and Castaneda in general, apart from the plethora of New Age is the obvious lack of pandering to the audience, by way of talking about \\"love\\" and \\"we are all one.\\" Neither are there any religious aspects to the Yaqui Way of Knowledge. This is not for middle-aged women craving for something exciting in want of a love affair. This does not offer a social pastime to replace cocktail parties with. This book, just like Castaneda in general, offers nothing easy to occupy oneself with, but forces a ruthless and relentless re-evaluation of the self and one's relationship with his/her axions and surroundings alike, if one at all wants to follow the spirit of the teachings.To put it succinctly, many many years ago this book changed the way i looked at the world - or rather, offered me for the first time a way to look at it that made any intuitive sense to me, as the \\"concrete reality status quo\\" never ever satisfied me."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Although not one of Castaneda's best books, its a good idea to start this his first and then read the rest in order as it gives a glimpse into the changes these teachings appear to affect on Castenda's personality. Since Castenda was an anthropologist you will find this first book to be written in a scientific and critical style which may be frustrating to some. In the following books, Castaneda develops and looses the underlying egotistical and arrogant tone of this first book.I feel that the critics miss the point in these books, whether the stories are true or not is irrelevant. These stories provide insightful teachings into a better way to live and ways to improve one's psyche. After all, most of us want to be better people. To believe that he is a conman is very nearsighted and sceptical...his aim to better mankind holds no bad intentions. No one is forced to do anything against their will, let alone buy or read his books.Something to note, these books contain many references to the use of stimulants such as peyote to achieve different levels of awareness. This is not the only path to heightened awareness, there are many other techniques such as meditation that can be equally as effective.One of the many great lesson I learnt from reading Castenda's books is that no one is an island, we all affect each other in our own ways, good or bad. If we can all be better, more aware people....the world would definitely be a better place."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"... I didn't.Maybe I just wasn't 'ready' for it or maybe my taste in writing and expectations of this book were at odds. Whatever the reason, I found the writing style difficult and the story quite boring (sorry, but I did). It is so very dry. At times, it read like a recipe list on the rituals and effects of taking mind altering drugs and never really gets anywhere.Maybe I missed it, but I didn't find any revelations or insights into spirituality nor pearls of wisdom nor did I find the story interesting in its own merits. I really had high hopes for this and wanted to like it but in fact found it a struggle to read and nearly gave up several times.The 5 star reviews that this has received, as well as some personal recommendations suggest that there is a very real fan base and merit in the writings. However, its not for everyone."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"When I first read this book, I completely swallowed it and became obsessed with the idea of this separate reality and way of knowledge described by Castaneda.However, a modicum of skeptical thinking marks this and the rest of Castaneda's books as shameless hoaxes. And not very good ones, even... Comparing his different books it's easy to find lots of inconsistencies. They, of course, can be rationalized by the true believer by saying that Castaneda's own perception of this reality was evolving, but I'd rather use Occam's Razor and say that they signal a sloppily-constructed hoax by Castaneda. Unfortunately, even a sloppy hoax is enough to fool lots of people and make lots of money.If you are thinking about buying this book, please do yourself a favor and read Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; instead. After that, reconsider."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Anyone who's familiar with the process of writing knows that Castaneda fabricated Don Juan. I'm not going to argue that was the reason why Castaneda shunned media since his thesis was based on a fictional and/or composite character named Don Juan. Nevertheless this book provides an important account of ancient trance rituals and drugs that enhance hallucination BUT it totally misses the point that one does not need magic mushrooms to be drunk spiritually. I recommend this book. It is far superior to Celestine Prophecy and most New Age books."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Are these going to be your dreams?

I read the first 4 of his books and loved them all. However, this is 20 years ago and i have studied many more paths of mysticism in the meantime. I can only warn anybody thinking in following the footsteps described in the book, as without a true spiritual master you will only succeed in screwing up your brain using hallucinogenics. There is also serious doubt that he ever actually experienced some/much of what he claims to have done.Furthermore, Carlos turned out to be NOT the guru he claimed to be in his later years. In spite of his statements that he would not die a normal death and leave the earth as a unit of energy and take his disciples with him he died a very ordinary death due to liver failure.A very interested BBC report on his life can be viewed on Youtube.

It is particularly useful to those who would eat mushrooms"},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"There are more than enough reviews here of this book and all the Castaneda books, so I'll try to make this short. I've read all of Castaneda's books, and although this is the first, the one that 'started it all', I would advise skipping it. That's because by Carlos' own admission, when he wrote this one he was still under the impression that the hallucinogenic peyote/mescaline given to him was the focal point for the 'sorcerer' training he was receiving. By the third book,Journey to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan, he knew better, was also a better writer, and was better able to lay out spiritual teachings that would be of value to almost any reader.For what it's worth, I think the three best books to read overall, the three with the most value for almost any reader areJourney to Ixtlan: The Lessons of Don Juan,Tales of Power, andThe Power of Silence: Further Lessons of don Juan. These really cover the true teachings the best, interspersed with Carlos' signature dramatic stories. I think the themes of these books have the most spiritual value, and steer clear of some of the darker, occult themes and battles, as well as drug-use, that characterize some of the other books.As for the debate about what's 'real' and what's 'fiction' in these books, my own view is, 'what does it matter?' Try one and see if it resonates. Our perception of reality, including our ideas about 'truth' and 'fiction', are the central theme these books explore. Allow yourself to be taken in, and then make of it what you will."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"This book is the single most important book I ever read in my life. This book affects almost everyone who reads it. Some people have set off looking for brujos in Mexico.Other people have given up their entire ways of life.Some thought of it as fantastical fiction and still had to read the rest.Others set off on life missions to prove Carlos Castaneda wrong, to show him to be a liar.A small number of people find this book hard to take, demanding more science from the anthropologist Carlos Castaneda. These people are those who have to be able to meticulously explain everything. Maybe they don't realise that Carlos Castaneda was himself one of these people until meeting Don Juan.What about me? Well after reading this book I was left with a profound sense of having drifted nowhere, my whole life. The most important thing I had missed were &quot;paths with heart&quot; - failing to even recognise them let alone follow them.

Whether you believe it to be fact or fiction it truly opens up a new way of thinking about the world in which we live and provides hope of a far more meaningful and powerful existence of the magnificent creation that is the human being. - let's face it I hardly think we were created to sit behind desks and shovel bits of paper!Many of the ideas will resonate with the gnostic texts as written by Gurdjieff and Mouravieff. - The truth-seeking philosophy of hidden knowledge that enables Man to live with greater meaning.Personally I find the narrative very convincing and have since read many of Castenada's works. - 'The fire from within' comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"If you have a field of devilweed (datura) growing behind your house, don't get down on all fours and start grazing. Don Juan is not about teaching US this &quot;Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot;, but rather the unique story between a sorcerer-teacher and an eager student.Ladies and gentlemen, I for one know with a preternatural certainty that Don Juan is not fiction. Let me say the shamanic experiences described herein ring true to me in recollection of my own visions and travels, and let's leave it at that.Carlos Castaneda was a brilliant man. This is most obvious in his writing. After all, this is not the simplest topic in the world to write about, and yet Castaneda did so with wit, verve, and style. I especially appreciate how Don Juan is divided into two parts, experiential and academic (Castaneda was a graduate student at the time).Someone said to me that Castaneda was &quot;trite&quot; compared to authors like Depak Chopra (cough cough). I'd believe that this person simply was unable to &quot;get&quot; Castaneda--maybe Don Juan was too intense and too earthy. Draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Having read several of Castanedas books and been strongly influenced by them as a youth, it was with great sadness that I subsequently found them to be almost completely imaginary. If you care to research Castaneda you will find that most of his experiences of flying through the air, encountering supernatural Mexican wisemen, receiving transcendental illumination etc etc happened while he was sitting in the library at UCLA. Many of the dates in the books are contradictory, much of the alleged herbal knowledge is potentially dangerous and essentially the bottom line is that you would be well advised to take all these books with a very large grain of salt. However that being said, they are fairly well written, quite entertaining and do contain some measure of truth after all. So go figure..."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"This book is by turns fascinating, tedious, disturbing, and disorienting. In short, all the things that accompany an expansion of one's model of the world. Castenada bravely submits as a complete novice to another order of reality, under the guidance only of an eccentric and whimsical old shaman.What is also interesting is the dismissal by some reviewers of Castenada's books as hoaxes. Strident denunciation, of anything, seems to me always to mask a great amount of underlying fear. Too, technocratic, orthodox science is very jealous of its position as arbiter of reality.I can't prove that Castenada's accounts are not fabricated. But the plants and substances he describes DO exist, as surely as any other scientific fact. How much denouncing of his work has been done &quot;from the inside&quot;, i.e., from the basis of having had personal experiences with those same substances?So typical of human beings, and especially of &quot;skeptics&quot; and &quot;critical thinkers&quot;, is judging something through the filters of one's own reality system, from a non-involved, safe, detached, intellectual perspective. Bottom line: roll up your sleeves, involve yourself in personal experience with something, then consider yourself qualified to assess its validity."},{"Title":"The teachings of Don Juan: a yaqui Way of Knowledge","review":"Castenada has opened up a Pandora's box.

Maybe we need to include these books in a special subcategory: \\"Nonfiction, bull****ting\\" . . . or some such. Really, these are best enjoyed as works of fantasy. I could give a higher rating if the author had been more honest in his presentation, but as they were presented to us they are potentially harmful to gullible readers.
