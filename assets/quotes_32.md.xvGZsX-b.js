Bill gives an exremely useful overview of the Vedic system of astrology that includes one of the best explanations of Yogas I have seen in a Vedic text. The inclusion of a CD is also helpful to the person who may be interested in the discipline but who does not want to invest a lot of money to see what their Vedic chart looks like-- a thoughtful gesture, characteristic of Bill's personality. The presentation style is particularly useful and comfortable for those who have been taught astrology in the Western tradition--it does not possess the fatalistic feel that some Vedic texts have and which can often frighten away those not used to this type of presentation. This book is a necessary addition to the literature, particularly if a Western audience is to get more interested in this fascinating system of karmic patterning.. Gary Gomes"},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This is, as many reviewers have correctly noted, a well written and very clear book (which already puts it well ahead of most books on jyotish). It is extremely user-friendly. The book lays out the fundamentals of the planets, the constellations and all the major concepts required for someone unfamiliar with jyotish to make sense out of a chart. If there is a problem here, I think it's because the book is not really very reflective at all concerning the depth of meaning associated with the various aspects of jyotish--but that's hardly a fair criticism given that it is designed as a very general introduction. I think it makes a useful reference for a beginning student to look up general concepts, broad associations with rashis, planet placement, etc., but it's very broadness makes it relatively hard to use for more detailed analysis of charts. \\"Light on Life\\" remains my favorite introductory book, but, in all honesty, I wish I had read this one first: it would have made reading \\"Light on Life\\" a lot easier. Beware of the CD, however; it will not run, at least on my computer, with Vista."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This book is very clear and concise. I always wanted to learn vedic astrology and tried to read a couple of books on the subject some years ago, but lost interest as I found the treatment of the subject very dry in those books.I happened to stumble upon this book in a book store and it revived my latent interest in Vedic Astrology and I ordered it from amazon.com.This book keeps the reader's interest alive and very clearly explains the principles and rules of Vedic astrology even to a novice like me.It is a very good book to start on Vedic Astrology even if you have absolutely no background on the subject. It touches the advanced concepts too and encourages you to read further.A careful sudy of this book should enable one to:1. Understand the basic principles of Vedic Astrology2. Interpret a birth chart to determine a person's personality, talents, skills, orientation, luck and other aspects of life3.Forecast major events in one's lifeThis book comes with an accompanying software to compute a person's vedic birth chart. This book does not explain how to calculate one's chart, rather focuses more on how to interpret a given chart.I find this a reasonable approach as claculation, though involved, is a standard mathematical method and same for every one, given the birth data. Moreover, computers can do it for you.The real skill is about interpreting a chart, which this book teaches very well. For serious students of astrology, however, learning to manually cast a horroscope is equally important for a deeper insight.The only thing, I found lacking in this book are example charts to illustrate how to apply the principles of vedic astrology to interpret a chart."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This is one time when you are better off reading the back cover of the book than the front cover. The front cover says that the book is a &quot;beginner's guide.&quot; The back cover indicates, correctly, that the book is a beginner's guide for those *already* familiar with Western astrology. This book is not an appropriate choice for an absolute novice, no matter how wonderful the book may be otherwise."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"Levacy has provided us with a very practical and accessible introduction to jyotish and the vedic sciences. Beneath a Vedic Sky is clear and to the point and provides the reader with the basics of Vedic astrology. A must for all newcomers to jyotish."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"I own a library of some two dozen jyotish books, perhaps six at the Intro level, and this is the poorest of the lot. There are three problems here:1) he tries to cover too much material in 350 pages of large type. The result is that nothing gets fully explained. And without sufficient detail a beginning student has no means to synthesize so many competing ideas. His explanations of the basics, including how to read a chart, planetary aspects and &quot;precession&quot;--the difference between western astrology and jyotish--is poor.2) his analysis of planets in the houses (what does Moon in 5th indicate? Moon in 6th?) and planets in signs (what does Jupiter in Aries indicate?) is general to the point of useless. For example, Rahu in the 3rd house often indicates &quot;no brothers&quot;. THAT would be useful for a new student even though, yes, you can find exceptions due to other factors. What does he write for Rahu in 3rd? &quot;Makes their own way in life, interested in unique forms of communication and self-expression.&quot; Who would claim that these traits do not apply to them? This is why people go into jyotish in the first place--to get away from western astrology's vague babble. Worse, each of the indicators for planets in houses and signs is grouped under the headings &quot;favorable&quot; and &quot;unfavorable.&quot; But with so much chart information touched on briefly here--the new student will have no way from this book to know which category applies (ie, when is Moon in 5th favorable?)3) some of this material is inaccurate when compared to other jytoish authors. He repeats a common mistake in suggesting that Exalted planets are the most benefic. Hart deFouw and others would argue that Exhalted planets are strongest, but this can be for benefic or malefic influence. He refers to Maharishi as one of three modern jyotish sages early in the book, but apparently doesn't know of Maharishi's statement that &quot;Exalted Saturn brings exhalted problems&quot; (ie, not benefic). Show me a woman with Exhalted Jupiter in the 11th, and I'll show you a woman who has had many husbands. It is this sort of uncomplicated analysis--while not correct in all cases--that helps beginners get a handle on things. His analysis of combustion differs from others I have read, as does his analysis of retrograde planets. His &quot;Determining the Value of the Dasa Period&quot; is so incomplete as to be wrong as is his chart for determining planetary analysis.There are some bright spots. He singles out 35 common yogas in a manner that makes them easy to learn. Many of his explanations are clearly written and to the point.As for that &quot;CD,&quot; he includes, turns out it is a demo (read: advertising) for a jyotish program that you would need to buy to obtain any use. Any company will send you a demo copy of their jyotish program for free.For a great intro book on jyotish, I would recommend Hart deFouw's &quot;Light on Life.&quot; For a beginners guide to planets in houses, there are a number of good books available, but this isn't one."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This book is really helpful in getting startet with Vedic Astrology.Especially the description of the nakshatras is very well made, Mr. Levacy knows how to use special words in different cases and makes distinctions where it\`s useful for the students to look beneath. Second the Rulerships of planets (e.g.Ruler of fifth house occupies the tenth!) is explained in a way of cause-and-effect mechanism, so you will be able to use this book for checking out the rulerships as well as you will understand the exchanging effects of energies between the signs and the ruling planets. Planets and Retrograde Movements included (very understandable and clear!!!)Third, Planetary Yogas are touched as well Ayurveda and Vastu, a good intro into these matters(so you won\`t forget that there\`s sth. more coming from the Veda, which might lead to further studies?).CD-rom for computations included? ........

I now feel I have a much more comprehensive understanding of &quot;Jyotish&quot; and how it relates to my own life and experiences. I was also delighted by Mr. Levacy's brief descriptions regarding the topics of Ayurveda and Vastu, and how these different branches of knowledge tie together.

My father was the one who introduced me to his program many years back.But here is what's important.I am writing to you because this Thanksgiving weekend, I had the opportunity to visit Das and Sonia. I stayed with Sonia which lives next door to Das. I have known them by phone and email for quite few months. But in the past 5 days I had the chance to live with them and experience them quite intensely. Their love and hospitality is just heartwarming and exquisite. However, I was able to experience something beautiful with them. And after I came back home I felt the urge of sharing this.Just like you, I have gotten tons of emails from Das about issues, problems that he was dealing with, and what not. You probably know what I am talking about. We have seen his intense writings about many general topics, even about his own private life, which is probably not so private anymore.Did you ever think, or did it ever come to your mind: \\"What's with this guy? Who cares about what he thinks about the IRA, or the war in whatever place or his own private issues?\\" Or, \\"Why is he writing to me about what's going on with him or asking for my help when I don't even know him, met him, or talked to him? All what I wanted is his program, make some money out of it and that's it!!!\\".Well, you are not alone. I've seen many react the same way as I followed his journey recently.I want you to know that I never thought like that. I always thought that there is always a reason for someone to do what they do.I will confess that since I knew about him, I always wanted to meet or talk or communicate to him in some way. I have this admiration for him because of what he has given the world. His materials, his services, etc. really caught my attention and I wanted to be in touch with this person who I thought knew so much about so many things.Warning: I am not here to advocate him. I am writing to you to describe what I have seen.You may not believe me, but all I have seen is this man with the most pure heart, good and harmless soul with one aim only: Spread the knowledge and wisdom about spirituality, God.He is obsessed, yes, I agree. But this obsession is for a true cause that you might benefit from. I know I did.He is not a preacher, nor does he want leadership of any kind. He does not want to start a revolution or a war against anything. He wants us to be aware of things that he is that will make our living in this world better.Now think that if you have knowledge of something that will help others in some way or another, wouldn't you want to say it away? Well, he does too. In his way. In the way that he thinks that will catch our attention. Sometime aggressive, sometime docile. In whatever way he finds effective.People, he has Asperger's. You don't know Asperger's until you see it with your own eyes. It's HEAVY!!! He also has ADHD which only makes it worse. However, Asperger's makes him the genius that he is.I cannot even begin to describe the storm of emotions that he goes through. I wanted to help him at that moment and I couldn't because I was not familiar with how this condition reacts on him. His body becomes so weak! He curls up in a corner and is engulfed in this monster fear of an unsafe world as if he is in the middle of a F5 tornado and you see the world being sucked up in this vacuum with nothing to hold on to. Picture yourself into it. It freaks you out!!! And in that moment it's totally real!!! I've seen it with my own eyes.Oh my God, I have to tell you that Sonia Manzo is this angel that holds him together. Sonia was at the market when this panic attacked him and I didn't know how to help him. Suddenly, Sonia arrives and sits next to him and start saying things that he starts to listen. They are common words for us, but when they come from the mouth of someone who you feel safe with, they mean the world to you.She holds his hands and speaks to him, and boy, you have to be there to see it. Sonia lights this glow that shine around her like an angel shining his way out of this dark place and pulls him out from this scary hole and brings him back to LIFE!!!!!She has no training in Asperger's. Just like any of us, but you know what she has? LOVE!!! She has the ability to show a special kind of love that anchors us back to reality. Oh my God, I was amazed to see how this strong, stable, confident person was able to throw this rope of hope at this dark, scary place where he was and pull him out of it. This energy of light that she brings to him is so strong that is almost visible to the common eye. And I am not exaggerating. What I've seen is Love, compassion, and spirituality. She showed me that you don't have to be related with family ties to someone to give what she gives. And she had the same love for me. If I was in the same place that Das was at that moment, she would do the same for me. She will go out of her way to help. She is a special kind of person that I learned to admire more in this visit.But, do you know what he kept saying while in this storm of emotions? \\"I've tried so hard to spread knowledge, wisdom, God, in this world and no one gives a crap about it!!!\\".Can you imagine a person, who is emotionally, mentally, in the verge of an abysm, ready to fall because no one listen to him and he is just trying to bring clarity about spirituality to us?If a person dies for a cause, starves to death, sacrifices or do any other extreme action for some cause for the HUMANITY, it makes the news. But why, when a person tries to be less extreme, calls for your attention, asks for some response we turn our backs!!! Just because he didn't jump off a bridge holding a sign: STOP EATING MEAT, or YOU ARE PART OF GOD, or some other thing that he tries to reach us to listen to him, doesn't mean what he has to say is meaningless or not worth paying some attention.And even if he caught our attention, why can't we just react to it. Respond in agreement or disagreement, giving him feedback, an honest one. Why can't we open our hearts, be a little more human and pay attention on what he says, because he just wants to help us reach a better level of spirituality.If you know him is because in some point in your life you wanted to elevate your spirituality. You probably know him either through his program or in an event or meet or family/friend relation. That means that we all have something in common. So why can't we try to help him with a small act of response. Get a slight bit involved in what he is saying and if you agree, pay it forward and spread his writings. If we have time to check our facebook newsfeed, can't we copy and paste his writings on our page and spread it out? If we are getting together somewhere, where all the people are involved in some spiritual work, can't we invite him to add his wisdom to our party? Don't you think that people can only be benefited by his knowledge? What harm can it do? If we don't agree with him in one thing, there's got to have something else which we agree and can share words with him.His exact words: \\".... so that the messages of determinism, jyotish's proper vision and function, proper dealing with all people's based on their god given innate natures, care for all equally as siblings, like some big kids help the little kids, etc., everyone, everywhere, cuzz, that's how we should think, for full life and happiness, the inevitable heaven is like thiswe who are going home, direct others thereit is in gita jesus common sense etcthat they the devotees of god will speak about himi have nothing elsefor i see through all elsei have this mission, am fading.....\\"Somehow, I got my priorities straight and this visit definitely touched me in a manner that I feel I can do more to become a better person. He taught me that in this trip.I truly appreciate his life and what he brought us to this world.I truly appreciate Sonia more for her strength and love towards any of us. She doesn't choose who to help. She just does it. And does it with perfection, with God in her heart.These both souls are not to take advantage, are not to be leached out and throw them out in the world. These two souls can bring true meaning of God in our lives and help us become better souls. I know I have. I am blessed for having such true loving souls as part of my life now.Thank you for reading this. I truly appreciate it. I hope you can help Das by only connecting with him. He doesn't ask for much. He doesn't want your money or any other material thing. He just wants to be connected with people who want to learn more and became spiritually better.God has put Das Goravani on this Earth for a reason. Use him, take him as a tool from God. You will only benefit you and those around you.Respectfully,Shakti"},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"I am an intermediate jyotish student with a very good grasp of the basics. This book does not provide sufficient explanation to make clear how to read a chart. Important, central jyotish concepts are treated equally with advanced concepts that many experts do not need. The book does not give you a feeling for what is most important and how you can reconcile completing chart significations.There are other well-recognized books that are much better. You will get a lot more book for your money-he uses big print for 350 pages. Try:&quot;Predictive Astrology of the Hindus,&quot; Pandit Gopesh Kumar Ojha.&quot;Light on Life,&quot; Hart deFouw.&quot;Astrology of the Seers,&quot; David Frawley.(Also James Brahas book, &quot;Ancient Hindu Astrology for the Modern Western Astrologer&quot; oversimplifies, but it is a fun beginner book that gives accurate descriptions of the planets in the houses that lets you get started).The heart of jyotish is prediction based on planetary periods that control an individual life one after another, adding up to 120 years. During a Venus period of 20 years, Venus is the major influence in how your life will progress. Perhaps during this period you are wealthy, but during the Sun period of 7 years that follows, you may be poor. Then there are sub-periods of influence within each major period. Understanding how these periods and sub-periods influence a chart is essential, yet he covers this in one page. His description of how to read these periods differs in some ways from those in other books.He offers a confusing array of possibilities making difficult problems, such as transits, more difficult. He gives several ways to take transits. (I've learned to take them from the Moon). It is difficult enough to learn one way for an Intermediate; he offers several choices for the beginner.I am not comfortable with his descriptions of planets in the houses, signs and the influence of conjunctions and transits. I do not have the experience to say he is wrong, but the flavor here differs from other books, and reading for my own chart and that of friends gave me doubts."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive book on Vedic Astrology for Beginners and it's written in an easy to understand language.The book covers much more material than other books for beginners in Vedic Astrology.You'll learn about different formats of charts, the attributes of planets (grahas), signs (rasis), houses (bhavas), then you learn to combine them and see what happens with planets when they find themselves in different signs and in different houses and when rules of houses find themselves in other houses.You will learn the basics of different planetary comabinations (yogas) and the attributes of 27 Nakshatras - moon signs. There is a brief chapter on one of the sub-charts - Navamsa. You will also learn few ways of rectifying the time of birth.At this point you are guided through a step-by-step process for analyzing the chart as a whole - looking at the strength of planets, signs, and aspects, which ones seem favorable, etc.Then, you can have fun learning how to work with transits and predict events, as well as find out what may be the best timing to start or end specific projects (e.g. business, marriage, etc.)You will find a chapter on remedies you can use to strengthen desirable planetary influences or reduce those which are unfavorable. Several remedies are listed such as performing yagyas, chanting mantras (no specific mantras are mentioned in this book, though), doing charitable work, chanting vedic hymns, using gems. I would recommend Linda Johnsen's \\"A Thousand Suns\\" book for beginners in Vedic Astrology for those who are interested in learning much more about \\"remedies\\".The book ends with few very brief chapter on chart comparisons, ayurveda and vastu.Of course, to have fun with this book, you'll have to have your astrology chart done. The book contains a CD with a demo of Goravani Jyotish program, which may or may not work on your computer, and which may not let you save the chart on your computer.

This I feel is being achieved with reading Mr Levacy's book. He explains things directly and with normal everyday language that differs greatly from the more cold and scietific books that I found many of the Indian authors produced. I was skeptical (having no background at all in either Western or Vedic Astrology) that I would find myself way over my head, but the text is very easy to understand and as I have now had a chance to look at books by other western authors, I know now that Mr. Levacy is not only proficient in his knowledge, but also possesses the teaching skills necessary to communicate it to others with little or no knowledge of the subject. The only thing I would suggest is that the back cover section that reads that the book is geared towards those with an &quot;understanding of astrology&quot;...be eliminated. It is true, that to the reader new to astrology, the terminology may be at first a challenge...but Mr. Levacy gives good definitions of terms in the text and in addition, the glossary of terms in the back of the book is extensive and well written.

I myself think it's a good idea to learn how to calculate a chart because you learn a lot about what's going on &quot;up there&quot;, but Levacy realises that we are living in a computer age so he includes a calculation program and don't tell very much about calculations at all. That's his point of view and that's ok. A good book."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"Searching for a friendly book about Vedic Astrology, I bumped into this one and I decided to buy it because it looked well done.I wasn't mistaken. The book is clearly written and covers all the most important topics about this subject. It doesn't linger in prolix and technical explanations but goes immediately to the point. It is not an easy task since the Vedic Astrology is not a common subject to deal with.The book provides a clear explanation of planets, signs, houses, planetary combinations, rulerships and constellations and gives helpful information about each possible combination of these elements.The second part is really useful as it teaches how to manage the collected data to obtain a coherent analysis by listing all the actions to take in a clear way.The book also casts light on Muhurta (namely the art of predicting events), on mundane astrology and gives hints about how to compare two charts together.Moreover, the last chapter introduces Ayurveda and Vastu (that's the Indian equivalent of Chinese Feng-Shui).The book is also complete with a rich appendix containing many interesting and useful tables and a glossary of terms.As for the CD, I can't say that it is of great help. It certainly makes the life easier because it allows to avoid performing certain calculations but the data and the options are very limited.Anyway, this is a very good book that is worth to be considered as a reference point for everyone beginning an adventure in Vedic Astrology."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"Clear and concise, this textbook organizes the morass of Vedic concepts in such a way that I can understand it.

The problem with Vedic astrology, in my modest opinion, is that the \\"basics\\" are so wide and profound that it requires many years of continuous studies before it can be functionally grasped by the mind, specially for Westerners without the cultural and spiritual background. William Levacy put together a book of such proportions in a format that will facilitate initial studies in Vedic astrology."},{"Title":"Beneath A Vedic Sky","review":"This book is the very basic that Western Vedic astrologers have to offer, IMHO. To be fair there will be some who will benefit from it because that is far as they are prepared to go. But if you want to learn Vedic astrology at a level that will allow you to not only understand but read your chart and the charts of others, with the clarity and accuracy only possible with vedic astrology, then do not waste your time with this book. The effort is noble but it basically fumbles around with generalizations that most western tropical astrologers are capable of. Light on Life is a bit overwhelming for the beginner so I say get that only after you have read Ascendant by Sam Geppi. Those two books as well as Bepin Behari's stuff,(sparingly because it is very metaphysical) and finally a visit to yournetastrologer.com will give a much more profound and deep beginning in vedic than this book. Bear in mind, the website mentioned is the Systems' approach, but it will give sound foundation. After that you can supplement as you see fit based on reading lots of charts.

There are literally dozens upon dozens of mind boggling examples of lunacy derived from blindly-written laws, but unfortunately no clear answers given. This is probably the best book I have ever read that explains in detail and with excellent citation the reason one should want a smaller, less active, and less powerful central federal government. It does not fall into the ranting trap of some conservative books, with much on vague generalism with scant unproved anecdotes, but rather is cool, calm, reasoned, and very well researched. However, the writer's keen intellect and sharp eye when turned from deconstructing the government of laws, and turned to the solution falls into a morass of generalisms and bad analogies.

I found the book to be a fantastic and thought provoking read. I've experienced many similar instances of absurdity while threading my way through a frustrating gauntlet of regulatory hurdles in pursuit of the most mundane activities. What I never questioned until now was the basic philosophy of regulation. Human judgment has been removed from the equation. The rules are no longer a few well understood guidelines, they are an incomprehensible morass of instructions with which everyone must comply whether they apply or not. Solving the problem is no longer the goal, the process and its regulations are an end unto themselves. So we have EPA regulations that not only don't make the environment any cleaner, they needlessly make compliance hugely expensive. It's as if the government mandated a multi-billion program for holes to be dug then filled back in. I always knew I was frustrated, but at least I thought all the trouble and expense was necessary.

Years later, DCS was pulped (01/05/11)."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This was one of the most thought-provoking and thought-changing books that I've ever read. Although the book I read had a copyright date of 1995, much of what was written in it is just as true today. The premise of the book is that our society's legal system has become crippled by over-regulation and the well-intentioned but disastrous results of \\"rights\\" (more on that later). The author (Phillip Howard) gave great examples of this and really articulated himself well. Below are some of the main points I got out of this book:* Howard compares too much regulation to the central government planning of the old Soviet Union. To be sure, regulation is needed. I don't trust businesses to self-regulate completely, and I feel a lot better about eating food because of regulation. However, Howard's first point that hit me was by trying to make law so precise, it weakens the law and takes power away from knowledgeable professionals and authority figures. One example he gave is the length of the Constitution compared to tax law. While the Constitution is a short document with general principles and no loopholes, the tax law on the other hand, is full of loopholes, even though it's 36,000 pages long. The more precise we try to make law and regulation, the more loopholes we create.* Some regulations cost over $100 million per statistical life saved, which implies we would dedicate the entire GNP to prolonging the lives of 1 out of 5,000 citizens. This weakens a country's financial health and limits its options in other important areas like infrastructure, education, research and development, etc.* Howard gave the example of how in the 1980's, Mother Theresa's attempt to convert an abandoned building into a homeless shelter in New York City was eventually dropped because of the layers of process, delay and bureaucratic hoops. (Mother Theresa and her sisters would have had to pay $100,000 for a handicap-accessible elevator. She decided the money would have been better spent giving food to the homeless instead. What should have been a win-win situation for the city was a terrible missed opportunity).* The key in giving government officials more discretion is the only way for them to do anything, and the only way for us to know who to blame. Right now, the buck just keeps getting passed and inaction is the name of the game. Too many procedural layers do away with individual responsibility.Howard also talks about how the establishment of \\"rights\\" has thrown our legal system and society out of balance. Some examples:* For teachers, exercising judgment as to the right thing to do was replaced by a preoccupation with how any decision might affect students' rights. Law tries to plan for every finite circumstance when in reality circumstances are infinite.o A court ruled that a school in rural Georgia had to pay for a local student with severe special needs to attend a special school out of district. This school was in Tokyo, and cost the district $200,000 a year.o Creating open-ended rights invites a free-for-all as different groups' entitlements begin to collide with each other and the rest of society. Rights for the disabled are paradoxical: what benefits a person with one disability may harm someone with a different one. Low drinking fountains and telephones and high toilets are great for the disabled but harder to use for the elderly and those with bad backs. Curb cuts are more dangerous for the blind. Ramps are essential for wheelchairs but are sometimes slippery and dangerous for the frail. Warning bumps at the edge of a train platform are good for the blind but bad for those in wheelchairs.* The Americans for Disabilities Act has had some unintended consequences. Howard is not saying that this is a bad thing at all. However, consider: 2 percent of disabled people are in wheelchairs, while \\"billions are being spent to make every nook and cranny of every facility in America wheelchair-accessible (for example, by tearing down and rebuilding showers).\\" Lest you think Howard is a Scrooge who has no compassion for the disabled, consider his call for common sense and compromises: \\"I would favor...significant funding for wheelchair access. But I would also have an easy mechanism for waivers: The hockey scorer's box in Minnetonka can manage without it. I would certainly want to provide decent and loving care for disabled children, including those who are unlikely to be productive members of society. But I would not send them to Tokyo.\\"This was a really informative, thought-provoking book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"\\"Government cannot accomplish anything when multiple procedures are required for almost every decision,\\" and, \\"We demand an activist government while also demanding elaborate procedural protections against government. We have our foot heavy on the accelerator, seeking government's help in areas like guarding the environment. Simultaneously, we have stomped hard on the brake, refusing to allow any action except after nearly endless layers of procedure.\\" It's a system that in many cases is counterproductive to the very issues it was designed to protect.This is the living paradox Philip Howard describes in his book with story after story of government inefficiencies and absurdities, where \\"we have constructed a system of regulatory law that basically outlaws common sense.\\" We have a regulatory process that abandons \\"the one indispensable ingredient of any successful human endeavor;\\" human judgment. The more regulatory laws we create, the more loopholes are attendant with them, and then more regulation to nullify the loopholes; a Catch 22 scenario; to say nothing of the Congressional lawmakers who are on the take in return for favorable legislation.Our laws are the equivalent of a corporation making inconvenient, burdensome, and ineffective rules for all of their employees to follow because 2% of them are violators. Howard offers a solution that revolves around principles; principles toward a beneficial goal that permits judgment, and allows people to think, rather than create stringent laws that make little sense for most who are impacted by them.Joe ArrigoAuthor of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"R.I.P. Common SensePhilip Howard's book is well-written and entertaining. His central insight -- that you can't regulate or run things well enough without human judgment and negotiation - is really important. It's Godel's Incompleteness Theorem applied to human relations. Godel proved that no mathematical system could answer every math question: there would always be things you couldn't decide. Well, if you can't find all the answers about numbers, you'll never find them with people, because people go out of their way to create exceptions to the rules.So we can't do with inflexible rules. We need to restore the human element to our systems of social control. But Howard seems to lose contact with reality by not realizing that there have been valid reasons for setting up all these legalistic systems. Take Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for example. Howard rightly attacks its rigidity and nit-picking, but it was set up because employers didn't care as much for workers' safety as for their profit margins, and they still don't.OSHA goes way overboard with petty and inflexible rules, but the alternative would be to have inspectors responsible for only one or two plants, who could form relationships with both management and workers, who actually cared about workers' well-being and had the power to enforce changes. This would require a much bigger and better-trained OSHA, and there would still be the problem of inspectors' being bought off over time. I think most big corporations would rather have the system the way it is than to cede inspectors any real power. (Of course, most of those factories are gone by now, to places where there is no OSHA.)It's the same thing with the ridiculously complicated contracting procedures governments use, explored in Chapter 1 of Howard's book. They were put in place because of real and rife corruption. Were they the best solution? Obviously not, but what's the alternative? You would need a system where the bureaucrats were free to act, but somehow restrained from corruption. In other words, you would need a system where people actually knew each other and had to answer to each other.I think that's the real problem Howard has discovered. The systems are just too big and too impersonal. You can't run them by face-to-face human interaction, because there are too many people involved. What we need is smaller, more human-scale systems. E.F. Schumacher explained this pretty well in Small is Beautiful. We really need to break things up here; everything's too big.There's also the problem that our federal and state legislatures are filled with lawyers. Too many lawyers hold legislative office, so naturally their answer to every problem is going to be a law, and the more complicated the law, the more they like it. At the same time, powerful special interests push for these unwieldy regulations that government is happy to produce. Each round of legislating just sets up another round of lobbying by the representatives of the rich and powerful, trying to change the system in their favor.Bottom line - it's a mess, and there's no easy fix. IMO, you would have to break the country and many of the largest institutions (e.g. banks, military) up into much smaller pieces, before you could even start to re-animate the corpse of common sense.Diabetes: Sugar-Coated Crisis: Who Gets it, Who Profits and How to Stop it"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This book says the things we all have thought when we have heard of nonsensical law suits and the lack of common sense in our society. An easy read, this book intends to put a fire under people."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Philip Howard's insights help us understand why government appears arbitrary, almost never able to deal with real-life problems in a way which reflects an understanding of the situation. Peppered with pointed anecdotes about absurd regulatory inflexibility and the lack of the use of judgement, Howard's book reveals that we have concocted a system of regulation that \\"goes too far while it does too little.\\"In the decades since WWII, specific legal mandates designed to keep government in check have proliferated. The result is not better government, but more and poorer government. In a free society, we are supposed to be free to do what we want unless it is prohibited. But highly detailed regulations proscribing exactly what to do turn us toward centralized uniformity, Howard says, where law has replaced humanity. Detailed rules and uniform procedures have nonuniform effects when applied to specific situations.Our old system of common law recognized the particular situation and invited the application of common sense. Common law evolved with the changing times and its truth was relative, Howard tells us, not absolute. But in this century statutes have largely replaced common law, and in recent decades regulations have come to dominate the legal landscape. Howard observes that the Interstate Highway System (still the nation's largest public works program) was authorized in 1956 with a 28-page statute. Now, we attempt to cover every situation explicitly. He cites one contract lawyer who received a proposed definition of the words and/or that was over three hundred words in length. (Let alone the more recent and prominent lawyer who parsed carefully over the definition of what the word &quot;is&quot; is.)Howard traces the growth of this regulatory \\"rationalism\\" from Max Weber - the German sociologist at the turn of the century who said that \\"Bureaucracy develops the more perfectly, the more it is \`dehumanized'\\" - to Theodore Lowi - who in The End of Liberalism in 1979 saw greater regulatory specificity to be the antidote to special interest groups. But in truth, Howard shows us, the more precise we try to make the law, the more loopholes are created.Centralized rules have caused us to cast away our common sense. Furthermore, \\"Coercion by government, the main fear of our founding fathers, is now its common attribute. But it was not imposed to advance some group's selfish purpose; we just thought it would work better this way. The idea of a rule detailing everything has had the effect of reversing the rule of law. We now have a government of laws against men.\\"The second section of Howard's book explains how the ritualization of bureaucratic process has brought us to the point where people argue, not about right and wrong, but about whether something was done the right way. He sees the agency as mainly a referee to the process, not a decision maker. He beautifully describes how the bureaucracy surges and falls, en masse, onto a decision. Even Sherlock Holmes wouldn't be able to identify an actual decision maker! The process decided.In this maze of centralized, detailed regulation - a system designed to discourage individual responsibility - many have lost sight of what government is supposed to be doing. Howard argues that process is a defensive device; the more procedures, the less government can do. The paradox is that we demand an activist government while also demanding elaborate procedural protections against government. \\"The route to a public goal cannot be diverted through endless switchbacks of other public goals, for example, without losing sight of the original destination.\\" He tells us that responsibility, not process, is the key ingredient to action. If responsibility is shared widely, then like the extreme where property is shared widely, it is like there being no responsibility at all.Effective government, Howard suggests, is one which attracts the best people and gives them leadership responsibility. But we have created the opposite system, based on defensive formalisms, driving away good people who cannot abide the negativity of the process.The last section of Howard's book explores the \\"rights revolution,\\" where government has become \\"like your rich uncle under your personal control\\" and everyone now gets to be a part of a legally-mandated, discriminated-against minority. As rights weaken the lines of authority in our society, the walls of responsibility - such as how a teacher manages a classroom - have begun to crumble. We want government to solve social ills, but distrust it to do so. Congress has resolved this dilemma by using rights to transfer governmental powers to special interest groups. The result has not been bringing excluded groups into society, but rather has become the means of getting ahead in society. Howard makes the distinction that, \\"The rights that are the foundation of this country are rights against law. In James Madison's words, the Constitution provides for \`protection of individual rights against all government encroachments, particularly by the legislature.' Rights - freedom of speech, property rights, freedom of association - were to be the antidote against any new law that impinged on those freedoms.\\"In this way, Howard finds that we have confused power with freedom. These new legislative rights aren't rights at all, no matter how righteous they sound. \\"They are blunt powers masquerading under the name of rights.\\" He says we need to consider how these new rights impinge on what others consider to be their own freedoms. The flip side of the coinage of the new rights regime is called coercion.Howard suggests that our loathing of government is not caused by its goals, but by its techniques. \\"How law works, not what it aims to do, is what is driving us crazy.\\" Decision making must be transferred \\"from words on a page to people on the spot.\\"His book brings us closer to a place where what is right and reasonable, not the parsing of legal language, dominates the discussion. His thoughts shine needed light on the path to common sense and responsibility in government."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"New York City laws forbidding Mother Theresa from opening a two-story homeless shelter unless she installs an elevator. A 33 page manual describing the qualifications and uses of a hammer. Contract bidding procedures that unintentionally but blatantly encourage corruption.These snippets sound like lines from a Letterman or Leno monologue, but discouragingly they are all actual government dictates documented in this chilling expose. Phillip Howard does an admirable job of identifying the consequences when good-hearted bureaucrats create well-intentioned regulations, and government services get caught in a stranglehold.Perhaps even more bilious than these splenetic monuments to red tape, are the huge work forces of administrators who are imprisoned by this uncontrollable system. Howard employs some macabre humor in redacting the plight of one troublesome government employee who purchased a lawn mower with his own money rather than navigate the labyrinth of paperwork necessary to order a replacement. For this breech of procedure, he earned a formal demerit.Although the subject matter is serious and in deed frequently depressing, Howard often utilizes jocular techniques to make his point. His step by step specifications of NYC's contract bidding ritual would be the envy of any stand-up comic. Unfortunately, the laughing stops upon the realization that this vapid inefficiency is pandemic throughout all levels of our government. It's scary to see just how big Big Brother has become."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"I wouldn't agree with the categorization of this book as an \\"explosive manifesto\\" (back cover), nor would I call this \\"incendiary ... stimulating\\" (front cover). As an American who too often cringes when our country's regulatory red tape strangles expediency and constructive decision making, I'd say \\"The Death of Common Sense\\" offers some poignant anecdotes in describing today's bureaucratic morass. Beyond this, author Philip K. Howard documents well the mentality which has spawned our dependency and passivity, and how we can refocus on how democracy is supposed to function.Mr. Howard's messages, evident throughout, are very obvious: we have substituted innovation with process, created enemies instead of cooperative societies, and squashed case-by-case reasoning under mountains of procedural law. There are so many \\"rights\\" covering every interest group that very little gets done for the benefit of the majority. \\"Trusting in the law\\" now means being wary of nearly everyone. Although sounding a bit rant-stricken at times, Mr. Howard offers up lots of food for thought ... some amazing stories. It's all pretty interesting and easy to read.In my opinion, the last (and shortest) of the book's four parts, entitled \\"Releasing Ourselves,\\" falls short of hitting on a way to get out from under suffocating law. I agree that initiative and responsibility are admirable attributes for executives in both the public and private arenas, and further, that universally applied policies that regulate the most minute procedural detail should instead have flexibility for more real-world applications. However, what happens when the most innovative of directives winds up injuring or killing someone? Will Joe Citizen give up his right (there's that word) to sue? I doubt it. And, as long as legal recourse remains the ultimate equalizer, the happy medium between \\"buried in the fine print\\" and \\"total judgment call\\" will be awfully hard to come by. Mr. Howard doesn't address this issue.This is a very good read; however, a better balance between problem and solution would have made this book outstanding."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This is a quick, easy read and I can relate to this book.

After you read this book, you realize how much of a strain this puts on everyone."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"I agree with the reviewer who concluded that this book is much too long; Howard would have more compelling if he had prepared this as a (long) magazine article. In terms of style, the book is uneven and distracting. Howard overloads the book with anecdote after anecdote of bureaucratic bungling; between the anecdotes are interspersed quotations and the author's somewhat ponderous narrative. Despite the style problems and the excessive length, Howard makes some highly compelling points. He has broken down his subject into to three discrete governmental problems, nicely separated into distinct chapters. The first main chapter is about the 'bureaucrat as bull in a china shop' and government employees' inability to use common sense. This is the weakest chapter- even if all of the author's anecdotes are true, he gives no indication whether bureacrats act like this all the time, half the time, or 1% of the time. One suspects that there are some dedicated government employees out there who occasionally (maybe frequently) display common sense, but Howard gives no inkling that such an employee exists. The second and third main chapters are more compelling, because these chapters deal with systemic problems with the USA government and the legal system. The second chapter concerns the mindless fascination the government has with process and procedure, a truely fascinating commentary on our sclerotic government. The root problem, as the author notes, is that, except at the highest levels of a government, no one is authorized to make a decision. Inevitably, government gets staffed with hacks and drones who are comfortable with that role. Clearly, government will not be 'reformed' until it can operate more like a business enterprise. The third main chapter concerns the proliferation of 'rights' in America. This chapter is likewise compelling; his discussion of the hundreds of billions that America has spent to accomodate the 'rights' of every perceived disadvantaged group in America is less shrill than other tracts on the topic, but still compelling. In general, a worthwhile and educational read."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This is food for thought, not only for law students, lawyers and practitioners but also for the common citizen. In particular, for all those that get lost in the ill conceived red tape of mother bureaucracy, get stuck in fragmentary and nonsensical regulations. Not only the author provides enough examples of organizational lunacy, due to excess of formalism or elaborate distorsions of clear legal texts and principles, but also gives some insights about possible solutions to the problem of the excessive weight of rules and procedures so precise that no one has the chance to think for himself or find a solution to a problem applying common principles.As Howard points out: &quot;The sunlight of common sense shines high above us whenever principles control: What is right and reasonable, not the parsing of the legal language, dominates the discussion.With the goal shining always before us, the need for lawyers fades along with the receding legal shadows. People understand what is expected from them.&quot;This is a provocative book written by somebody that has been a practicing lawyer as well as a teacher.

A brisk read, the 200 or so pages here are filled with examples of government gone awry, absurd legal maneuvers, and public policies that defy common sense.Silly lawsuits and wholly unnecessary laws are central to Howard's rants on over-aggressive government. The book is filled with specific examples, usually followed by pretty sound reasoning as to WHY we, too, should be irritated. All that is missing are solutions. The author offers some, but they are few and far between.One thing is certainly welcome: Politics rarely intrude here. Well-written and to the point, Howard doesn't appear to be walking far to the right or the left. The political neutrality is welcome. There is probably a libertarian bent present, but it's hardly intrusive; this is not a political book.

It's reassuring to know you're not alone in being bewildered by a system that has gone so awry."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This book provides a devastating critique of the blizzard of rules &amp; regulations that government has promulgated in the past century and the damage they have caused to our society &amp; our economy.Howard provides numerous examples of nonsensical regulations (New York City refusing to allow Mother Teresa to build a homeless shelter unless a $100,000 elevator is installed, the EPA ruling that bricks are poisonous because if they are sawn in pieces there may be some silicate particles, etc.), but these are easy targets.The most graphic illustration of the insanity of government regulation comes in his discussion of the Americans with Disabilies Act &amp; the mayhem it has caused: kneeling buses spend a half hour during people's work commute, loading &amp; unloading a wheelchair rider; public transportation vehicles end up with far less seats than before in order to accomodate the chairs; street curbs are ramped for the wheelchairs, but now the blind have trouble telling where the curb ends, etc. It's time to ask whether all this is a worthwhile price to pay to benefit a minute proportion of the population.Equally disturbing, is the discussion of Special Education. What is the sense of an educational system that devotes a huge proportion of it's resources to nearly ineducable students?The most interesting part of the book may be his examination of the motivation behind the regulatory scheme we now face. He points out that the original motivation for regulation was fairness. Social policy planners believed that only be having an elaborate &amp; inflexible pattern of regulation that covered every eventuality, could you guarantee that bureaucrats would be freed from outside influences. However, the result has been to require that everyone follow the same scheme of rules, regardless of whether they make any sense.As Howard argues, this has brought us to a crisis point in American life. We are increasingly frustrated by the intrusion of these rules into our lives, increasingly distrustful of government &amp; increasingly willing to find ways around these regulations.However, and this is a significant weakness of the book, Howard does not offer a real prescription for these problems. His critique is powerful enough that it's hard to believe that we wouldn't be better off if we scrapped all government regulation &amp; started over, but Howard understandably shies away from any such radical solution.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Compelled to read this book by the author's appearance at aconference I attended, and having worked for state governmentfor eight years, I heartily recommend it as an eye opener toflawed bureaucracy and the lack of judgment and responsibilitywhich impedes &quot;common sense governing.&quot; Wishing to avoidthe criticism everpresent in the political environment,bureacrats refer citizens to the text of laws and rulesregardless of exceptional circumstances and with an instinctualshoulder shrug, &quot;it's the law...&quot; The examples Philip Howarduses will leave the reader slack-jawed in amazement and insome cases simply outraged (...sure we want Mother Theresato build a homeless shelter here, but if she can't do it bythe book...).

This book is told from a liberal point of view. The idea that the mass amounts of laws and rules are undermining our own judgment is an idea that most people, like me, take lightly. When you add up all the rules and regulations that a company has to follow, you will see that most of the rules are rules that do not effect and work for all situations.This book definitely helps you see a perspective that you most likely have not ever seen. Seeing how this book was published to tell people about the laws over powering ability, it does only tell you one side of the story."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This book takes a disturbing look into The Law as the suffocater of progress and the enemy of common sense.

It's kind of like watching a &quot;Real Cops&quot; or &quot;Amazing Videos&quot; show on TV. If this is what you enjoy, buy this book and indulge yourself.This book also appeals to government bashers. If you enjoy reading about how stupid laws can be, you don't mind ignoring all the good laws can do, and you like reading people slam the government, this is a good choice.But, if you really care, you won't want to waste your time with this book. Howard offers no practical solutions. I can summarize his proposed remedies with two words: Benevolent Dictator. Howard calls for laws as general principles with justice metted out by wise &quot;judges&quot;. This type of system, rife with corruption since man first walked the earth, concentrates power in the hands of a few and leaves the common man without recourse.Sure, our legal system is too big. Yes, we have too many laws. But the solution should be reform, not a backward revolution."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"I got this book based on the recommendation found in Jaques Barzun's, From Dawn to Decadence. Barzun referred to it in the context of the stifling and dehumanizing effect of bureacractic society on people.While I enjoyed the book I felt the author too often relied upon annecdotes that roused the readers indignation. I was hoping for a more developed exploration of the psychology and philosophy behind the bureaucratic impulse and of the effect it has on culture. Both concepts were addressed upon but never fully developed to my satisfaction.Still, if there is no such exploration available in print this book could start you on your own thoughtful journey...The book is made up of four parts:Legalism -- The idea that we can create a perfect society through perfect laws. This reminded me of the Pharisees of the bible and their desire to achieve righteousness through laws. It didn't work. In fact it annoyed the God they were trying to impress.Process -- The idea that a correct set of procedures and unswerving adherance to them can eliminate human error (or corrupt behavior). This reminds me of the Priest of the bible who thought they were O.K. as long as they stuck with the ritual forms of worship regardless of their internal motivations.Rights -- The idea that personal wants and needs should be elevated to the level of rights. We accept the desire not to made fun of because we are fat as a right which when violated is discrimination. In doing so we undermine the importance of essential human rights -- the right to self determination, freedom etc.Personal Responsibility -- Offered as the antidote (along with a necessary willingness to accept error, risk etc.)I have found the concepts in the book also apply to the corporate workplace. However, that could be simply the reacton of American business to the legal environment.

Government gridlock explained. How it all got started and how it all got out of hand. He gives many examples that will have you shaking your head in disgust. What got my goat was the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). What a bunch of ruthless selfish people involved in that. The idea is right but in practice it is abused. To think that gifted children (the future brains of our country/world), in comparison to disabled children (kids who don't even know they are alive etc.), receive virtually NO support or attention from America's school system. These disabled kids, who will never fully function in the world, now take precedence over the normal and gifted kids. And who's paying for all this costly extra attention, programs, teachers, classrooms for these autistic/severly retarded/catatonic kids? YOU with your taxes. What happened to Perspective. Priorities. Majority rules. Reason. Statistics. Compromise. Common sense is right! I had no idea this was going on. It's absurd. Wrong.I live in a town of 7,500 out in the boonies and have seen only ONE (1) wheelchaired person, yet our town is wheelchair fitted thru out. Even on the steep hillside streets where no wheelchair could possible go. In fact that one wheelchaired person is forcing our little library to put in all new restroom facilities that are wheelchair friendly. The librarian told me it has taken most all of her budget. Which she says means no new computers or books till next year. As it is now they can only afford to open for 4 days (6hr. days) outta 7. I never thought too much about it until now after having read this book. But now, Mr. Howard, how do we change it? Your next project is to lay out a step by step guide we the voters can follow to correct this mess. I'd like to see Mr. Howard on TV.

On the contrary, I was convinced it was a well-deserved bashing. Unlike the many self-proclaimed political critics who decry the era of big government without providing a single concrete example of what it is they're spouting off about, Howard illustrates just how ludicrous laws can be, and how those with power manage to hide behind them."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This is a panoramic review of government regulation run amok, with many arresting examples. The material seems somewhat dated, e.g., references to the Bush era refer to Bush 41, but still relevant. There has been little progress in solving any of the issues that are discussed, if memory serves, aside from occasional suspension of burdensome, time-consuming rules during emergencies. (Thus, as related on p. 172, the Santa Monica freeway was rebuilt in 66 days after the 1994 earthquake in Los Angeles.)\\"The Death of Common Sense\\" consists of four long chapters, presented without an introduction or conclusion. They deal with (1) the impossibility of devising laws and regulations that will sensibly address every variation and permutation of a given problem without the need for human judgment; (2) the pitfalls of elevating legal process over objectives; (3) the destructive consequences of creating \\"rights\\" for more and more disadvantaged groups without much heed to the burdens imposed on the rest of the population; and (4) the author's proposed solution to the problems discussed, which is for all concerned to stop looking to the law as a source for \\"final answers.\\"Howard is not averse to government regulation as such; indeed he lauds the accomplishments of the New Deal (pp. 77-78) when administrators could act with lightning speed because their brand new agencies were writing on a blank slate. The passage of the Administrative Procedure Act shortly after World War II (p. 78) started things on a downward track, in his telling, from which it has never recovered.It is refreshing that an attorney would write a book so critical of his own profession, and most of the specifics ring true. However, Howard gives insufficient attention to the possibility that the government has spread itself too thin. Empowering unelected bureaucrats to exercise seat of the pants judgment in addressing all of the issues in which the government is involved might be more efficient than the present arrangement, but would the country like the results?"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"If you want to know read it, and then remember that it was written over a decade ago.

Howard's well documented commentary on everything that's so wrong in America; thanks in large part to everything that's so wrong with the legal system; is even more compelling 13 years after its initial publication. With the current state of affairs in ObamaNation, a resurrection of common sense doesn't seem to be forthcoming any time soon; and that's definitely cause for concern.Clearly, we have the legal system to blame for much of the ill-advised behavior we see throughout the great abyss known as corporate America. To the typical corporate CEO, \\"lawsuit avoidance\\" drives much of the decision making process throughout their dysfunctional & paranoid organizations. This type of mentality creates a fear-based culture of management; with everyone trying to stay out of trouble, micro-management & backstabbing proliferate. In this type of environment, employee morale is typically low, as is productivity.Certainly, the legal system's failure to embrace \\"common sense\\" as a foundation in their recent judgments has created much of the mess; from wrongful termination & discrimination claims to miscellaneous negligence claims; there seems to be no end to the madness.Sooner or later, the pendulum has to swing back in the direction of common sense; let's hope it happens sooner, rather than later."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This slim volume confirms the old axion that \\"good, if brief, twice as good\\".The graphic examples of how irrational government can be when applying nonsensical regulations lead us to the conclusion that we better avoid if at all possible to deal with governmental authorities."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"I first read this book 5 years ago. Since then I've purchased and given away over a dozen copies. When I give the book away, I challenge the reader to \\"don't get mad, do something about it\\".

To find our way again we need to return to simpler a implementation our legal system. Much of our legal system could be boiled down to the Golden Rule. The founding fathers understood this principle when they wrote the U.S. Constitution. The next time you or someone near you says, &quot;There oughta be a law&quot;, read or re-read this book.

The law gives power to those regaurdles of who it tramples. His points of interst include those about how &quot;rights&quot; is now just a term for people abusing power. In the end, Howard suggests that although it might seem scary, America would be &quot;smarter&quot; in its regulation if the laws gave people more responsibility and room for interpretation. Regulations do not work for every instance, and the founding fathers were ambiguoius with the constitution for a reason.The book contained many examples and statistics that were organized and shocking.

It can barely fire an employee. . .\\"Mr. Howard's book focuses primarily on the irrational rules of government agencies---for example, OSHA, EPA, USDA, DEA and so forth---which are awash in thousands of rules that hamper and destroy businesses. OSHA alone has 10,000 pages of regulation. Other agencies have more.An instance of the irrationality of these agencies is exemplified by the case of a small businessman, a cheese maker, whose product was so good it was in demand by the finest restaurants in the nation. He had four employees. OSHA posted 2 permanent inspectors in his business \\"to evaluate that the cheese was properly made.\\"The inspectors were bureaucrats who knew nothing about cheese-making but were employed to force businessmen to follow rules that were written by other bureaucrats who know nothing about cheese-making, on the bizarre notion that everyone must follow the same rules and the rules must be uniform.The value of Mr. Howard's book is the many case studies he relates. He also shows that the thousands of rules of government agencies do not take into consideration the important matters of context and varying circumstance that is characteristic of any business enterprise. He concludes that to force businesses to follow uniform laws is not good law and that their proliferation is destructive. All very true.Unfortunately, Mr. Howard falls short of the mark. He does not advocate the one solution that would completely end irrational laws. He does not appear to recognize the horrendous violations of individual rights these agencies are guilty of. He does not call for a return to limited government and a complete repeal of all government agencies, which is the only long-lasting solution to government's ever-growing invasion of our lives."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"The atmosphere in America has changed. \\"Americans feel on a daily basis that their society is falling apart, that things aren't working right.\\" Mr. Howard is exactly right.Although Mr. Trafficant who was...expelled from Congress may actually be guilty of the charges alleged of him. His comments about how the American people view and fear their government, the judicial system and the various organizations that solidify the awesome and terrifying power of the political machines in American, are in large part true.This is not because all those entities could not work if filled with virtuous men and women as the Federalist Papers charge. But because they have been bogged down in 200 plus years of misdirection, partisanship and political corruption, the kind of corruption that seeps into any long running program, party, powerful entity or political machine.We could fix this degradation in our national political process by moving back onto a better path. But influential people today have, as Mr. Richard Maybury says in his excellent \\"Uncle Eric\\" series of books, on government and finances, lost their mental, emotional and political view of the true and best \\"American model\\" for our nation politically, socially, morally and judiciously.All it would take to fix this would be the will of the people united in a common cause to once again \\"create that more perfect union,\\" or MODEL spoken of in the Preamble to our Constitution. It could be done, it should be done, but the question is do we have the will to make it come to pass? One draw back to excessive diversity is a lack of cohesiveness on the important issues that face our nation and the world.It is astounding that the summation of all the laws ever written since it's creation are already contained in the precepts, principles, and guidance given and envisioned within the Preamble to the Constitution, and the Articles and the Amendments that go with it. It is such a shame that nations tend to legislate and opinionate themselves into nonexistence. Even when they have it right, they seem to need to interfere and make things worse.Mr. Howard has done all of us a great service by producing this book and it is unfortunate that it has not received the prominence and accolades it is due, a great read..."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"loved it it is tru"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"The audacity of this character, attacking the United States of America.

However, over and again, Howard says, \\"Anyone can accuse anyone of anything,\\" which is true, but he acts like the ability to accuse someone is the same as rendering judgment, and therefore our right to call someone to task in a court of law should be abridged. He neglects the fact that, once in the court of law, it is up to the lawyers and judges, and juries when appropriate, to dismiss cases that have no merit. If that is not being done, it is not the problem of us American citizens \\"having too many rights\\" but that his slimy profession is without any moral compass. And his book, while thought-provoking and entertaining, is at heart a call for less oversight of those in power, because those without power are slowing them down.

Yes, some of the information was interesting. However, there were no realistic suggestions for improvement. As far as the homeless shelter in NYC(I didn't know mother theresa made NYC her stomping grounds), it may seem frivolous to put an elevator in a homeless shelter. But hey guess what?! Big surprise, some people that are handicapped are homeless too. So I suppose they can just wait outside while a friend runs in and gets them a cup of soup and a roll. It seems to me that Phillip K Howardis not familiar with people with disabilities or he would be singing an entirely different tune. Physical and mental handicaps are a fact of life, and instead of putting them in institutions, hiding them away, or perhaps even enforcing mandatory sterilization(ok I may be exaggerating a bit there). It is a fact of life, all \\"men\\" are created equal in the eyes of the law, and all of us are given the chance for the persuit of happiness. If Phillip K Howard had his way, we would be without laws protecting the handicapped, mentally ill, and indigent members of society. And yes, they need protection under the Law. Because if they are Not protected, people take advantage of or ignore the rights, needs and wants of an important group in our society. We all deserve the right to have a chance to contribute to society. So lets not have another wheelchair bound person drag themselves up the steps of a courthouse so he could appear for a trial.

Howard's \\"The Death of Common Sense\\".This short book details how America has deviated from being a bastion of freedom to being a nation subjugated by laws.Mr. Howard presents a wonderful case against government-induced regulation---laws so far removed from reality, so unworkable in practice and so disastrous for productivity.It would not be difficult countering some of his arguments, however I would deem it unlikely to rebut his central thesis which is that until Americans retain responsibility for their decisions instead of looking to arcane rulebooks, we should not expect the buck to stop anywhere.Hence the reason this book is more important now. As we look at the Sarbanes-Oakley act, a reaction to the Enron scandal, and the McCain-Feingold bill for campaign finance reform, we have to ask ourselves if the pill is not worse than the pain. Inherent in finely written law is the ability to subvert them, as was seen during the 2004 elections. Why should we citizens take the risk?The chapter \\"A Nation of Enemies\\" was illuminating. Quoting Isaiah Berlin, \\"Liberty for the wolves is death for the lambs,\\" he advances the claim, which some deem legimitate, that enumerated rights can be antithetical to each other. Others definitely would argue to the contrary.Therein lies its beauty: the ability to teach without hectoring, to dispute without hurling invectives.Read this highly educative book and discover why \\"Relying on ourselves is...commonsense.\\""},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"I use Howard's book as a textbook in several of my introductory Law and Political science courses.Readers from all walks of life can easily relate to his writing style and his essential ideas.Government bureaucrats at all levels of our federal system should read and be questioned about this book as a condition of maintaining their employment."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Part I &quot;The Death of Common Sense&quot;Using several cases (see other reviews) details the harm of rationalist philosophy applied to law -- the misguided notion that laws can be made &quot;self-executing&quot;.Part II &quot;The Buck Never Stops&quot;The abstractly laudable desire to maintain absolute impartiality creates an absolute nightmare of red tape -- the focus in this section is on Process spawned by mistrust and the bureaucratic reflex to avoid responsibility for decisions.Part III &quot;A Nation of Enemies&quot;Vocal, assertive minorities are able to control government policy-making.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the prime example here (see other reviews for details).Part IV &quot;Releasing Ourselves&quot;We must have law that allows thinking. Modern law wants to legislate away uncertainty with ever-thicker rulebooks, but uncertainty, risk, is exactly what drives various parties to work together, in the real world. Don't fear gov't authority. Don't think in extremes. Bureaucracy is the enemy of real democracy. Legislation cannot save us from ourselves. In the end, we must rely, as always, on common sense.Note: rating lost a star because author kept using one example (Glen-Gery Brick Company) again and again, when fresh examples would have been more compelling. Also, as other reviewers have noted, the last section, on what we as citizens can concretely do to help change the situation, was vague and thin.If this book interests you, you might also be interested in the political writings of Noam Chomsky.

This gets especially bad in the final chapters of the book -- where he devotes exactly one chapter discussing how he would structure law so that bureaucrats can perform their jobs effectively.The problem with his approach is that extensive oversight would be required and corrupt individuals would still be able to do what they want.

But just in case you need a quick refresher course on how Washington is helping the abusers do their thing and giving the rest of us the middle finger, Howard's book stands as a fine testimony to what doesn't work, why it doesn't work, and the bleedingly simple solution to the whole stupid mess.In three long, painful chapters, Howard takes critical looks at the Congressional love of process and how that love has led us to the conclusion that process is more important than result. Looked at as a simple sentence, it's a pretty absurd belief, isn't it? Look around. Process rules. Howard points out, in multiple places, two of the recent high-profile projects that circumvented process (the rebuilding of the freeways after the California Earthquake of 1992, and the refurbshing of a major new York bridge in time for its centennial ceremony), and compares and contrasts them to numerous examples of process in action, highlighting the idiocy of process while taking a hard look at the overly liberal viewpoints that spawn it. There won't be too many people who like Howard's easy and obvious solution-- if too many laws are the problem, then get rid of as many of them as necessary to fix it. But logic leads us back to that conclusion time and again.As important a book, and as deserving of a place on the shelf reserved for sacred writings, as Stanton Peele's &lt;i>The Diseasing of America&lt;/i>. **** 1/2"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Finally, someone that i agree with, on the ways the law hurts more than does help the citizens in america. Phillip K. Howard illustrates the way the American law is creating more enemies with-in the country than agreeing with what democracy is really about. This book is food for thought, and he makes the evidence more obious. By really getting a point out that &quot;The people's right&quot; is more of a fine print in the constitution. I agree with him how, if people are trying to help other or, themselves, you have to go through a major process in order to do so. How Nuns tried to build a shelter for Homelesss people on a abandoned burned building, but yet couldn't due to new renovation laws that required elevators for any new or renovated building. Homeless don't care for elevators, but warm place to sleep. How in 1993 kids couldn't display artwork on the walls of there school, due to fire hazards, and it is against the law to do so. Where it came up in a holloween presentation. Whatr's worse is how our taxes are paying for a mojor part of cost that the government shouldn't spend on.What is more interesting in this book is how the government can make situations worse, like the father of eight who turned for the government for help when his kids came out positive for lead poisoning, they told him to paint over it. Yet The city inspectors came in and red tag the house, fined him $1700, and if he didn't strip the house and repaint it, he would be fine more than $8,000. This book is really great for those who know, or have a feeling that the laws here in the USA, are far worse than actually read. Also it is a great book who think that the Law here is the best amd that there is no corruption with the government, or anything wrong with the Government."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Philip Howard's book the The Death of Common Sense is both an enlightening and disturbing look at the inner workings of American government. Less than half of Americans vote because politicians never come through on their promises. Howard tells us why politicians seem impotent. The laws of the land are smuthering us all. Their is a &quot;How to&quot; guide for the right way of everything. Even though the &quot;right way&quot; may be flawed or lengthy, it must be followed.For example, OSHA labeled sand as a hazardous material. The same sand as we see at the beach is hazardous. Not beacause it produces cancer or anything, but becuase sand contains trace amounts of silica. Silica is a dangerous element on its own. OSHA also found the very brick that built your house to be hazardous. If a brick is broken, it kicks up dust. We breathe this dust into our lungs. Long term damage could be caused. This is absurd! All because the government wants to head off lawsuits before they start.How about construction on the highway. Bidding often takes foru years. Bidding has to be opened to everybody. And the bureaucrats have to take their time to make sure the process is fair. This &quot;how to&quot; maanual is in both houses of congress too. All the steps have to be followed to make everybody happy or the process will be blocked.The bottom line is Howard has exposed bureaucrats to be a cancer in the American government. How do we start Americans in motion to reverse this tide?"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This book provides an excellent illustration as to the maddening processes of bureaucracy in government. Intentions are often well founded but the measures to which it tries to accomplish or block given tasks are horrific at best. The deep rooted fears of lawsuits and other forms of legal action often prevent what would be simple and straightforward.For example dignitaries that take out foreign ambassadors often have to be taken out to eat at restaurants. Why? Because if they were fed food that was prepared by the government in a dining hall each piece has to have paperwork around it. By going to a restaurant it costs several times more but the liability is covered.Another example was with NYC inwhich there was a great demand for public bathrooms. A company in France makes these self cleaning bathrooms so there's no additional labor required for maintenance (I have been to Paris and seen them myself). Sounds like a win right? Well the NYC government asked if there was one that was ADA compliant and there was...then asked if the units could be combined. They couldn't. Why was this important? Well NYC feared that they would get used under allegations of segregation!The FDA actually holds back approval of drugs because it is in a catch 22. If they approve something with side affects or death they'll get blamed, if they don't approve a drug that is found to perform well in other countries it is punishing a whole nation due to a lack of tests.Separate rules for separate agencies only compound the lack of efficiency of government (and companies for that matter but I would assume that it is mostly in the largest ones).By having sustained sets of rules, policies and procedures it might seem to following the letter of the law but there are issues. If government is reduced to a mere reaction and the performance of instruction then it it restricts actual thinking. In some regards much of this was written during a shift to new public management which has its benefits and drawbacks.Policies should be on the basis of the actual results that are created. Incomes, outcomes, outputs :-)"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"This book was exteremely well written.

Howard does achieve his goal of describing how law is suffocating America, the subtitle of the book. But, as I have already said, this is a rant: one-sided, with few suggestions about how to change government for the better (other than to quit the big bureaucracy and endless litigation).Mr. Howard continually (and rightly) raises the point that our government, while striving to be fair in its actions to everyone, achieves this by accomplishing very little. A fine example provided by the author is the case of a group of nuns that wanted to buy and restore an unoccupied building in New York to serve as a shelter for the homeless. However, a city ordinance requiring that new, multi-story buildings be equipped with elevators pushed the charitable project beyond the practical budget of the nuns. On the one had, it makes sense to plan new buildings with those people that can not easily climb stairs in mind. On the other hand, inflexibly requiring such expensive accommodations puts affordable housing out of the reach of many Americans. It is impossible to please everyone, but the law should allow us to try and please someone!Philip K. Howard makes a strong case, but he does not suggest much in the way of a fix. I found, also, that his views were quite one-sided. If you are someone in favor of big, meddle-some, liberal government, then you probably won't find Howard's arguments that convincing-he'll just sound like some guy with a beef against how his government spends so much time and money to make sure that everyone has the same opportunities. If you are more of a libertarian, then you will probably agree with Mr. Howard and feel more outrage than you already do after reading his numerous anti-overregulation anecdotes. I would have found the book to be much stronger if Howard had tried to build an argument rather than list his complaints from a soap-box."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Who has such a high opinion of themselves that they would do a video review."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"The only common sense that is dead is the failure of Mr. Howard to support his conclusions. It is not necessary, for purposes of this review, to set forth the conclusions of Mr. Howard. It is necessary, however, to comment on the method by which Mr. Howard arrived at his conclusions.Mr. Howard cites several examples of stupidity. No one could seriously dispute that. From those examples, Mr. Howard makes several quantum leaps to arrive at conclusions that are not validly logical.I didn't say they defy logic. They may, in fact, be correct. But Mr. Howard's conclusions do not meet the test of logic and reason. They leave much to be desired. Mr. Howard's conclusions are based upon a few anecdotes. The sparcity of these anecdotes make Mr. Howard's ideas conclusory and illusory.One can support just about any conclusion if the basis of the conclusion are a few anecdotes. The book may not be nonsense. The ideas may be correct. This book does not, though, lay a proper foundation for its ideas and, therefore, is a waste of time to read."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"The utter inanity of Howard's explosive expose would, in the word's of Mark Twain, make a dead man laugh. Then you consider the reality and one must weep. There are in fact many authors who have looked to the future and relayed the good news of an imminent utopia about to erupt in our midst, arriving at light speed on the winged feet of technology.Hold on Horatio. You forgot the Lawyers, the Media, and the Government. All three have a different plan. Virginia Postrel, Reg Whittaker, et al, are apparently blind to the visceral stupidity and craven corruption of the three amigos just mentioned.One author has not succumbed to the conventional idiocy that ignores Howard's reality. Jerry Furland. the author of &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot;, stands in the vanguard of those who gladly shoulder the burden of scorn of the &quot;progressive and oh so hip&quot; crowd who despite every known attribute of Mankind, continue to insist that we can handle it. Well, I see little hope of that. People, to include me, generally suck. The Founding Fathers recognised that. Result: the U.S. Constitution. Howard shows us that despite the advantages of birth, Americans are intent on self-destruction and will pursue that goal amid general applause and approbation.Oh, Furland is not an intellectual per se. That is his strength. To be an intellectual, widely recognized as such, is to abandone all pretense of intellect. This Furland will hopefully never do. Great book Mr. Howard!"},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Howard should have borrowed from Dennis Miller and started the book with &quot;I don't mean to go on a rant here, but...&quot; and then proceeded with his 187 pages of endless whining about how horrible the law is in America.The examples given (about how law is suffocating America) are sometimes right on the mark and at other times not as well defined. Less would have been more. His ideas of how to fix this dilemma are also good...if we lived in a perfect world. Unfortunately, we don't. With no practical solutions and a message lost amongst a myriad of words, I woudn't recommend this book to anyone but Ted Kazinski."},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"Once upon a time, a wise king ruled a wondrous land called NewDeal. He wielded power with efficiency and cut through wasteful red tape by giving all of his workers the discretion to make decisions without fearing for their jobs. Then along came a bad man with a black moustache who said that people in wheel-chairs deserve access to public buildings. The evil lawyer filed a lawsuit, and the Supreme Court ruled that legal process was as important as efficiency, and King Roosevelt's NewDeal turned to brass, all of its buildings and all its people forever frozen in legal limbo. Nothing could be built; nothing accomplished; and government employees feared for their jobs and refused to make decisions and the trains no longer ran on time.Howard, a lawyer himself and a government employee in charge of assisting New York City's development projects, blames the loss of his Camelot on a modern obsession with \\"absolutist reason\\" chiefly implemented by the chief culprit of his tale--the federal Administrative Procedure Act. His book is a long screed against what he calls \\"process,\\" which he insists undermined or halted many superior construction projects in New York. Howard makes many good points. He legitimately observes that \\"the law is perfectly clear, but impossible to know,\\" due to its complexity and the fact that no one is empowered to act without being second-guessed and approved. He correctly repudiates the \\"illusion of perfectibility,\\" which he accuses tort lawyers of seeking to enforce. Our legal system has in many ways become \\"regulatory incarceration.\\" And the law does enforce conformity and \\"the norm,\\" suppressing diversity and innovation. But that is its nature. The obsession with personal legal rights that he blames for this predicament did not begin in the 1950's and 1960's, as Howard believes, transforming a pursuit of strict equality into \\"a government subsidy with a blank check.\\" Rather these rights are implicit in the ideas of the Enlightenment and flow naturally from the initial concepts of equality of opportunity to the modern notion of equality of result for the simple reason that people are not born equal and therefore equal opportunity is an illusion.Howard may as well have titled his book \\"Attack of the Wheel-chairs.\\" For, like many doctrinaire conservatives, his exemplars of evil are the disabled, and especially disabled children, who are \\"lording it over\\" the rest of us, no doubt to the surprise of the average reader. \\"The disabled lobby is waging warfare against every other citizen,\\" he wails. It is they who bring building projects to a halt. Mothers of disabled children are bankrupting schools with their unreasonable demands, he continues, implying that it is a waste of space to allow a crippled child into a class-room. What Howard omits to mention, however, is that the parents of crippled children are not only required by law to bring their kids to school, but pay the same taxes as everyone else to support those schools. In Howard's world, however, the unreasonable mother is to blame. And, amazingly, there is no recognition of the fact that a few parking spaces and elevators is all that most disabled have in this life, bread crumbs tossed at them to relieve society's guilt, while they continue to be stone-walled in terms of employment, education, and social acceptance.Similarly, although he repeats the common canard that medical doctors are on the verge of abandoning their profession due to tort lawsuits, he cannot cite a single instance of this having actually occurred. This reviewer has met dozens of ex-teachers, ex-accountants, ex-professionals of all stripes, even ex-lawyers - but never an ex-doctor. Or even a poor one. Until then, Mr. Howard, please dispense with the tired \\"lawyers are driving doctors out of business\\" myth, which is somehow always dragged out as the second installment of \\"the disabled are ruining the country\\" argument. He calls the disabled lobby \\"potent\\" for passing the ADA, but the ADA was mere window-dressing, quickly gutted by the Supreme Court and rendered meaningless and largely unenforceable. When the majority of Congress is in wheel-chairs, that will be time when the disabled are \\"lording it over the rest of us.\\" Not before.In line with these views, Howard condemns wide streets, elevator regulations, and anti-single-room occupancy codes. But wide streets are safe streets; elevators are not merely convenient but essential to allowing the elderly and the disabled to live independently; and no one wants a return to crowded tenements that formerly acted as magnets for crime and disease in every city in the U.S. Do these drive up the cost of housing? Certainly. But the alternative is more crime, hospitals, and prisons, which drive up the cost of everything. Just as the alternative to legal process, which, after all, derives not from the APA but from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, may not be greater efficiency, but greater poverty, disease, and gulags.Why is it that extremists of both Left and Right, even while unable to agree on anything else, always seem to agree that the guy in the wheel-chair is to blame for all of society's woes? From the Right: the disabled are an inconvenience, disrupting society and unjustly forcing \\"normal\\" people to change to selfishly suit themselves, instead of dying for having lost the struggle for existence. From the Left: the inability to engage in \\"honest labor\\" makes the guy in the wheel-chair lazy and evil and by definition a parasite and capitalist.Finally, as for government employees being \\"risk-averse\\" and fearing lawsuits--what could be more laughable? Years of this reviewer's experience have shown the typical government employee to be abusive, capricious, contemptuous, arbitrary, and utterly unconcerned with whether they are overstepping legal bounds or whether they may get sued, secure in the knowledge that they cannot be fired, no matter what. They break the law with joyful impunity and laughingly defy the public to do anything about it. With the most powerful and influential law firms defending government agencies, their confidence is well-placed. I've seen teachers force left-handed students to write with their right-hands, shout at them and give them F's, then receive a raise for doing such a fine job. If the APA did not exist, it would have to be invented to halt such abuse. If government burocrats had unbridled discretion, nothing at all would be built, for anyone. Instead of \\"The Death of Common Sense,\\" perhaps this book should be called \\"The Triumph of Common Prejudice.\\""},{"Title":"The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America","review":"You must read this book especially in this post 9/11 time.

When I first read the book as a teenaged martial artist in the early \`60's, I was blown away by it and believed every word. It's underlying philosophy more than anything else about it influenced my early martial arts development. Then in about 1976-77, a Tai Chi friend of mine by the name of John Panter told me he thought that \\"John F. Gilbey\\" was probably a pen name for Robert W. Smith, Don Draeger, and some of the crowd Smith and Draeger hung out with in Asia. He guessed this based on the writing style and content that was similar to their other writings.Years later, Robert Smith came out and explained exactly how he and a group of friends (all senior martial artists including Draeger who were Westerners trained in Japan and China) got the idea of writing a spoof about the martial arts. They made up the name, \\"John F. Gilbey,\\" and invented a personal history for the name that combined their actual martial arts credentials. The book turned out to be a great success, but not as they had planned. Unfortunately for them, so many people believed that \\"John F. Gilbey\\" was a real person and the book a completely true book, that it took on a life of it's own and only added to the wild tales about martial arts that became popularized in the West. This happened because Smith was so skilled at interweaving fact with fiction that he unwittingly produced a satire that many found believable as complete \\"fact.\\" Robert Smith later wrote an even more wild sequel to the book thinking that would finally enlighten people, but once again, he was wrong. Finally, he just came out in the martial arts magazine, \\"Journal Of Asian Martial Arts,\\" and told the true story. He later repeated it in his book, \\"Martial Musings.\\"Here's a bit of what Robert Smith said: \\"Gilbey was a joke, an exaggeration, a fantasy. He had money, time, and amazing skill in everything. We were sure that readers would be smart enough to realize this. We were wrong....'Secret Fighting Arts of the World' contained some truth, plus many whoppers.\\" If you want a longer explanation of what was truth and what was whoppers, I highly recommend reading \\"Martial Musings,\\" which I think is Smith's best work.But my tale of this book doesn't end there. I recently learned that back in the \`70's my old friend, John Panter, actually used a technique from the book in a real situation! When I quizzed him on it, here's what Panter said: \\"It was the Macedonian Buttock! I was coming home from work on the Subway in Toronto. It was my last day on that job and I was carrying my work clothes in a bag along with my lunch kit and some other stuff, all under my arms. I had to get off at the Bay St. Station to see if something I had lost was at the Lost and Found there. Of course, since construction jobs let out at 4:30, I hit Bay Street just in time for all the office workers who get out at 5:00 to be heading home. Well, when I had to get out, I was faced with a wall of people trying to get in, and I realized that if I got jostled at all, I would lose all my stuff and it would get trampled before I could pick it up. Now the etiquette is supposed to be that people getting off have right of way, but that wasn't working this time, and there was this great big meat head coming straight toward me. I quickly turned sideways to him, and rotated my shoulders further so that the things I had under my arm weren't in line with my hips, and when he ran into me I let him have the buttock thrust. I purposefully waited \`til he was against me so that it was a push, not an impact. I wanted to move him, not hurt him. In any event, he went flying backward, and fell spread-eagled on top of two or three rows of other people that were behind him. I can still remember the look of total astonishment on his face as I stepped past him.\\" One final note here. John Panter went on to become the head of the Taoist Tai Chi Society's entire Atlantic Region in Canada. I remain just another average Black Belt level martial artist...In conclusion, this book is a fun read for entertainment, cut-to-the-core insight, and deadpan satire. Smith has a sense of amused perspective on oneself, history, and the fighting arts. The writing style is great, and I highly recommend it. Just remember that the author intended this as a spoof!"},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"I wrote a previous review of this book before I had ascertained John F. Gilbey's likely identity. This book (and Gilbey's other two books) purport to be written by a wealthy textile scion who holds an 8th degree black belt in judo and a 5th dan in karate.It seems likely that John Gilbey is really Robert W. Smith, a well-known authority in several arts who most readers here will no doubt recognize. I hadn't made the connection until recently, but I'm pretty sure about it, for two reasons.In \\"Secret Fighting Arts of the World,\\" Gilbey has a habit of peppering the text with various literary quotes. In Smith's recent book, \\"Martial Musings,\\" he does the same thing. Moreover, the overall somewhat choppy writing styles are very much the same. He does this to a lesser degree in \\"Chinese Boxing, Masters and Methods.\\"Not sure why I didn't put this together earlier, but I'm sure other people have already figured this out.

Be sure to take many of the more fantastic claims in this book with a grain of salt. To mention just one of these (which actually occurs in the next book, \\"The Way of a Warrior,\\" but anyway, it's the best example) Gilbey meets a young exponent of an Icelandic art who claims to use the energy of black holes to put a significant dent in a metal beam in a train station in Rejkyavik.Well, there are no train stations in Iceland and never were.

I recommend this book to the layman and curious, as well as students of martial arts."},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"It doesn't show you 20 secret moves! Some of them are just people, and one isn't even a fighting method at all! Another one is about an incident that he witnessed, and that he wants to find a certain person! You won't become the ultimate fighter with this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"Some of the techniques used by practisioners would be difficult to use on a daily basis, if you wanted to remain a part of society. For example, the Parisian Halitotic Attack, would only work your society deems punishingly bad breath OK.Overall, a good read."},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"While most may not have any use for the techniques described in the book, I'm sure Bruce Lee read it. The Savate kicking sequence is the same form Lee used in 'Bruce Lee's Fighting Method' series (1977). And the sketch in Lee's 'Tao of Jeet Kune Do'(1975) of what he calls, &quot;savate's purring kick,&quot; is remarkably similar to the sketch in Gilbey's book of the Patagonian Purr-Kick. Moreover, Gilbey's Peking Man talking about &quot;being trapped&quot; by one's technique and the notion of &quot;seem[ing] to have no method&quot; sure sounds like stuff Lee used to say. But whether Lee read it or not, one can certainly cull a philosophy of fighting from the book: 1) anything goes, and 2) keep it simple. Bye the way, the copy I have is the 14th printing from 1976."},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"this book was simply a waste of paper.the only good thing about this book is that it addressed some obscure fighting arts.I think that this book was actually written by D.Draeger.I can understand why he decided to go with a different name........"},{"Title":"Secret Fighting Arts of the World","review":"This book is a total waste of paper. I feel sorry for anyone who reads it, and am shocked that people actually found this book useful. It is the worst piece of literature I have ever read in my life. The styles and techniques profiled border on the absurd. I am indeed dumber for having read this piece of garbage. I would reccomend that anyone who thinks about buying this book should just watch Samuri Jack on cartoon network as his style is probably more believable than the laughable techniques &quot;revealed&quot; in this waste of ink."},{"Title":"The Portal to Chalicu","review":"The author guides you through a magical land with adventure and suspense.

The book is well researched and well designed, so it is a pleasure simply to read. The recipes I have tried have also turned out quite well. If you have an ice cream maker, try the cinnamon ice cream.The recipes are largely Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian. The text follows the dishes from the dairy to the table, providing an illuminating glimpse into period drinking, dining and entertaining as well.The book is beautiful, as well. The text is handsomely laid out, the photographs and line illustrations complement the text very well.This is a cookbook for the avocational cook. If you are looking for a few simple recipes to expand your family cooking, this book is probably not what you are looking for (unless your kids have an unusual taste for anchovies and cheese). But if you enjoy exploring history through food, this is an especially rewarding volume."},{"Title":"Do legislators vote their constituents' wallets?: And how would we know if they did? (Discussion paper)","review":"I bought this book because of my fascination with the Romanovs, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one!The book is riddled with errors; one example occurs on the first page that contains the Romanov Family tree.The author claims that Grand Duchess Xenia was married to Alexander Alexandrovich...she was actually married to Alexander Mikhailovich (&quot;Sandro&quot;)Then in the first few pages he maintains that the Russians celebrated 300 years of Romanov rule in 1912..it was actually 1913! If the author can't get his basic facts straight, I am not inclined to believe his far fetched theory that Grand Duchess Tatiana was airlifted to England! He bases this outlandish claim on an interview with 2 women, ages 87 and 91,who reportedly witnessed the execution of the Romanovs. His story gets even more bizarre when he tells us that Tatiana worked in Turkey as a belly dancer! I would have given this book no stars if I had that option. For people who want an accurate account of Romanov history, I would start with Robert Massie's excellent &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; plus &quot;A Fatal Passion&quot; by Michael John Sullivan and Mironenko's &quot;A Lifelong Passion&quot; However, if you enjoy spotting inaccuracies or are in need of a good laugh, this is your book!!"},{"Title":"Do legislators vote their constituents' wallets?: And how would we know if they did?

Perhaps prejudiced by an intention to mislead readers to a pre-designed theory. Better reference is the excellent author Robert K.Massie!"},{"Title":"Do legislators vote their constituents' wallets?: And how would we know if they did? (Discussion paper)","review":"I don't totally buy the theory,but the book was well researched and made me think so I will give it three stars.As for previous reviewers, he does base some of his theory on the accounts of an 87 year old and a 91 year old, their brother-in-law/husband was the British Consul,in Ekaterinburg at the time of the murders, and this information was combined with other sources the book is not based entirely on their story.And he never claims she was a belly-dancer, in fact he debunks this (on several occasions) as a fabrication made up by someone around her to cover her real past.As I said I am not totally convinced in his theory but if you want to be critical you could at least get the story straight."},{"Title":"Do legislators vote their constituents' wallets?: And how would we know if they did? (Discussion paper)","review":"I was engrossed in this book from the moment I opened it. I had half expected to find it to be wildly speculative and mostly imaginary. I was surprised. This book did not promote the conspiracies, but rather looked at each \\"possibility\\" with more of a researcher's approach. Obviously not written by someone with their own agenda, but rather a curiosity. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Romanovs."},{"Title":"Do legislators vote their constituents' wallets?: And how would we know if they did? (Discussion paper)","review":"I certainly don't agree with the other reviews here. This book is one of the best written about the disappearance and unsolved questions of the last tsar and his family and I have read many! Michael Occleshaw is a brittish historian and he apparently has researched a lot for this book. He speculates a great deal about which of the missing daughters who might have survived and believes this to be Tatiana who possibly was saved by the English eccentric and adventurer Richard Meinertzhagen. I found a lot of information in this book that I haven't seen anywhere else including the best known like Massie's books. It was first published in 1993 so a lot of the events of the recent years in this field are not included but still it's one of the most fascinating and informative I\`ve read. I recommend it to anyone who has a geat interest in the Romanov mystery."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"The Daleks, possibly one of the most evil, vile, and dangerous creatures to ever emerge in the world of science fiction. In their first appearance one might almost laugh at their appearance, until soon realizing just how deadly they truly are. In this incredible 13 part epic story (I include Mission to the Unknown as part of the whole story) the good Doctor (William Hartnell) once more does battle against his arch-enemies the Daleks, as he is chased once more through time and space, attempting to prevent the Daleks from completing activation of the Time Destructor, a terrible device which harnesses the very forces of time itself into a weapon. Although the visuals are currently missing, with the exception of two episodes, it is still very effective as an audio drama, with linking narration by Peter Purves. the performances are top notch, including William Hartnell as the Doctor, Peter Purves as Steven Taylor, Nicholas Courtney as Bret Vyon (the future Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart) and Kevin Stoney as Mavic Chen. in addition the wonderfully joyful Christmas episode 'Feast of Steven' is definitely a nice break from the dark and impending doom of the main story plot. this is definitely a must have for any Doctor Who fan."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"As you probably are already aware, this is one of the most sought after stories in Doctor Who's long history. The fact that both the teaser episode &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; and the further 12 episodes for the most part are now missing (with the exception of some wonderful clips from Eps 1-4 and Eps 5 &amp; 10 in their entirety). Further appeal may be the added bonus that the Doctor's greatest enemies, the Daleks are on hand to again chase our hero through time and space.I won't bore you with story details, as I'm sure you know it well. And if not, you can certainly hear all about it in other reviews. I will however instead, tell you that the real appeal of the story is not in its length, nor in it's covetted return of the Daleks yet again. But, is in the regular cast, and the guest cast. William Hartnell is superb as always as the First Doctor. And with him at the beginning of the story is Steven and Katarina.The latter dies early on in Ep 4 to basically move the plot. I think the producers and writers really did not know what to do with the simple minded Katarina, thus her quick departure from the series here. In comes Sara Kingdom, played to perfection by the lovely Jean Marsh. This story also boasts the first appearance of Nicholas Courtney (of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart fame) as Sara's brother Bret Vyon.Most of the performances are good, if not spot on. But, the story is greatly weighed down by being so very long. And thus, much padding can be found within, slowing the plot way, way down at times. The best bits are early on, and then later it all picks back up when the wonderful Meddling Monk reappears to dog the Doctor's path. The Monk is again as superb as he was in &quot;The Time Meddler&quot; the previous year, played here again by the great, late Peter Butterworth, who, for me, absolutely steals the show!I won't spoil any endings for anyone who hasn't yet seen, read or heard this adventure. But, unlike most Doctor Who stories, things don't necessarily turn out all rosey in the end. All and all this is a terrific story, if perhaps about 4 episodes too long. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"The Daleks\` Master Plan is a true classic. The story is absorbing and is a great addition to any Doctor Who collection. The strong narration by Peter Purves helps to bridge the gap between audio and video. Viewing any of the (now) three episodes on video would also be worthwhile for anyone who did not see the original airing back in 1966.Master Plan borrows some ideas from the previous Dalek story \\"The Chase\\", these being the Dalek time machine, the ensuing pursuit through time and the alternative episode (\\"Journey into Terror\\" and the comic relief \\"Feast of Steven\\" respectively, for the Chase and Master Plan stories). Master Plan also sees the return of the time travelling monk. All of these ingredients work well.Master Plan has many varied and interesting situations. Clearly, a lot of effort was put into this story. I like the idea of the lead-in episode \\"Mission to the Unknown\\", although this idea loses something without having the \\"Myth Makers\\" story that followed it. It is a pity also that the identity of the main protagonists was revealed so early on. Keeping us guessing until the end of this first episode would have made it more exciting and still served its purpose.The Master Plan story progresses through a series of separate situations, each with their respective characters. This works well and adds interest, but the demise of so many companions along the way is a negative. As with The Chase, there is also an improbable sequence of short stays on Earth.The worst part of the story for me is the ending. Although the climax is exciting enough all we know at the end is that the patrol of four Daleks was destroyed. It may well have been that the main Dalek force deep in the mountains survived. The story ending would have definitely benefited from a final scene depicting the fate of the Daleks in their underground control center."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"I listened to this just yesterday. I spent 3 days listening to it. I listened to the Mission to the Unknown on Friday, The first half of the Daleks Master Plan on Saturday and then the other half on Sunday.I've been skeptical for a long time of audio dramas and how they'd match-up compared with the original TV serials -- this one matches up pretty well! Peter Purves does a fine job of narrating this 12 episode epic and makes it really enjoyable.We are taken from planet to planet and to different time zones on earth. When listening to this story, the companions get lifted to a more major role and are very critical in their fight against the daleks. In fact in the prequel, Mission to the Unknown, there is no Doctor or companion in it!As the basic plot goes they travel through time and all over the galaxy to stop Mavic Chen (and the others on the supreme council from other planets) as well as the daleks from using the time destructor, as part of their plan, to take over the universe!It's nice to experience the pre-Brigadier role of Nicholas Courtney (Bret Vyon.) William Hartnell at his best! He shouts so much his voice gets rather \\"croaky\\" after a while! I was terrified all the way through and in the midst of listening to it, you feel apart of the action and it seems like it's the end of everything Doctor Who! A lot of shouting in fear is heard from Steve, disagreeing with the doctor on many occasions on how to defeat the daleks and his role as a companion, who saves Tensions are stretched out you wonder if Steven is kicked out as a companion -- does he?Things I miss from the TV Footage:*The firey, volcanic planet the monk (from 1066) follows the doctor to; and see them shout from one side of the mountain to the other!*It would have been brought about a good end of year, Christmas feeling to have the doctor tell his viewers at home \\"and incidentally a very merry Christmas to all of you at home.\\"*Going from scene-to-scene in the early days of cinema! This is hard to get a picture in your mind -- Maybe because it felt like I was caught up in the mayhem myself!*The extremely dramatic ending of the epic! I won't go into details but you have a great sense of satisfaction that it's all over and of course by the fact that it's a great epic!In retrospect, whatever film footage is lost, is kept in the magnificent cast and crew who kept the acting so real you think you were there yourself and you put aside the negatives of the missing TV episodes.I was surprised of how difficult it is to listen to something rather than having the privilege of watching it. I took regular breaks inbetween the episodes and kept coming back for more epic style terror. I am glad there is a narrator, unlike episode 2 and 4 with the video release of The Crusade. You need a narrator to guide you through the story. Peter Purves does a wonderful part and because he was a major part of this story, it's like as if he is telling a story of his own experiences!There are many destinations involved from planets (including a prison planet,) earth and many enemies and spaceships involved also! See Episode 10: Escape Switch in the Lost In Time DVD, which shows ancient Egypt! How remarkable is that! Now I am happy to learn that the first doctor (with his many historical stories) went to Egypt as well! Bravo!As having the MP3 version released in 2003, I didn't get the accompanying scripts, but was happy receiving it on 1 CD; and discovering web sites which has the scripts.Even if you are not keen on audio, to make your Doctor Who collection complete, do what I did and at least purchase 1 adventure on CD -- The Daleks' Master Plan!"},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"The Dalek's Master Plan is one of the most amazing stories in Doctor Who history. But most of it was lost to time and idiots who let the episodes rot away. But the audio track HAS survived! We get to hear William Hartnell as the First Doctor, Peter Purves, who helps narrate the story, as Steven, Kevin Stoney as Mavic Chen, Jean Marsh as Sara Kingdom and so much more. We get toe hear the Daleks, hear they talk, hear they attack, hear them roll around the set. 5 hours and 20 minutes on 5 audio CDs. The tiny booklet lists cast and credits and gives some information about the episodes. If you already love Doctor Who and the Daleks you know the story, you know the background and how the story came about. The only reason to buy these CDs is to turn on the player, close your eyes and listen to the story unfold in the theater of your mind!Enjoy the rich, almost gleeful plotting of William Hartnell, the exhausted, almost whining of Steven, and the harsh, commanding voices of the DALEKS!

The CD set includes \\"Mission to the Unknown\\", the teaser episode that was broadcast two stories before \\"The Daleks' Master Plan\\", on a separate CD, along with narration-free MP3s and notes.I found \\"Mission to the Unknown\\" to be a bit dry, but there were a few moments that definitely set up the anticipation for the Master Plan (just imagine being there when it first broadcast, then finding out that the next story was the four-part Myth Makers and it would be five weeks before the TARDIS arrived on Kembel!).Once into the epic twelve-parter itself, the story proceeds nicely up until the end of Episode 6, where one would almost think that the story was over. Episode 7 is a significant detour from the main storyline, being the Christmas episode; it serves as a bit of amusement (unfortunately not too clear as to what happens during the Hollywood scene), but otherwise doesn't add to the ongoing epic (so feel free to skip it if you wish - I can now understand why the story was only offered as an eleven-parter to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation back in the 1960s). Back into the main story with Episode 8 and the story recovers its momentum as it heads for the final and inevitable confrontation between the Doctor and the Daleks.Regarding the quality of the sound - for the most part, it's clear and the narration helps explain exactly what is going on. If you have \\"Lost in Time\\", then it's even better, as you can watch the existing clips from Episodes 1-4 and Episodes 2, 5 and 10 in sequence with the audio recordings and then have a clear picture of what's going on.Definitely recommend purchasing this and \\"Lost in Time\\" to any Hartnell or Classic Who fan."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"This epic story is gripping drama that ranges from the far future to the present to ancient Egypt. The Monk and of course, Daleks have returned. The ending is weighty and presents the best of Doctor Who as a cautionary tale of betrayal and destruction.Of all Doctor Who adventures, this one is in my top 5."},{"Title":"Doctor Who: The Daleks' Master Plan (Audio)","review":"...This CD has it all! 13 Doctor Who episodes. 5 discs... almost 5 hours of material, all with linking narration so you know what's going on. Disc 1 has the extra Mission to the Unknown teaser story which is the only Dr. Who episode to not have the Doctor in in it. Disc 1 also contains pictures and extras that you can view on your computer! The Daleks' Mastreplan is the true Dalek Epic. It starts when the Doctor, Steven and Katarina land on the planet Kembell in the future and stumble onto a Dalek-Alien conference for invading the Universe. Aided by space agent Bret Vyon (Played by Nicholas Courntney who later would go on to play the Brigadear in Dr. Who) they manage to steal the Taranium core which is the linchpin of the Daleks' Plan. Unable to escape in the TARDIS, they flee in a spaceship and bounce around the galaxy until finally ending up back on Kembel. Katarina and Brent are killed in the process and they pick up another space agent companion, Sara Kingdom (played by Jean Marsh who is in several Doctor Whos and is most famous for playing there evil witch in the movie Willow 20 years later). The story dosn't end there, The Doctor, Steven, and Sara manage to escape again, this time in the TARDIS. Now the Daleks must pile into there own time machine and hunt down our heroes through time and space (as they did in \\"The Chase\\"). The Doctor and companions run into fellow renegade timelord/liar/bad guy/bumbling idiot The Meddling Monk during this chase (very faint shades of the Master) and the Daleks end up getting back the taranium. Using the directional unit of the Monk's TARDIS the Doctor manages to get back to Kembell and destroy the Dalek's Time Destructor machine. Sara unfortunately is killed in the process. This Doctor Who has it all... an epic that spans 5 planets and 3 time zones with death, danger and destruction along the way. Not only a great story but they went the extra mile and put telesnaps and other media on the first disc. A true masterpiece and one hell of a CD release!"},{"Title":"The Dead Sea Scrolls: Rule of the Community","review":"The Rule of the Community was one of the first four of the Dead Sea Scrolls to be discovered in 1947. It gives us precious information about the beliefs, worship, community life, and initiatory practices of the Qumran sect. The Rule closes with a beautiful hymn celebrating God's grace and mercy as the foundation for righteousness, breaking all stereotypes of Judaism as a religion in which grace and works are opposed rather than going hand-in-hand.This gorgeous edition of the Rule opens with an accessible and lucid introduction by James Charlesworth beautifully illustrated with full-page photographs of the Qumran site and the caves where the scrolls were found. Charlesworth discusses the discovery and content of the scrolls, the community that wrote and preserved them, and their significance for our understanding of early Judaism and the birth of the church, closing with an outline of the Rule itself. Following this are clearly legible photographic plates of each of the eleven columns of the scroll, with facing page transcriptions with critical apparatus comparing the text of 1QS with the six copies (and fragments) of the Rule found in cave 4. These plates are the chief selling-point of the volume, for it is as close to the scroll itself as most students will ever come. Following the plates are translations by leading scholars: English (James Charlesworth), Modern Hebrew (Elisha Qimron), French (J. Duhaime), Italian (Paulo Sacchi), German (Hermann Lichtenberger), and Spanish (Florentino Garcia-Martinez). A centerfold of the complete Rule of the Community completes this ultimate coffee table edition of an ancient text."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Inorganic Chemistry","review":"I have used this book in the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry course I tought.This book has the best explained chapter on Molecular Orbital Theory that I have seen so far in inorganic chem. textbooks.

And fair to most other subjects.However the treatment of Symmetry is minimal (has been reduced to a couple of pages in an appendix) which is a serious deficiency.

Jones is the only fiction writer I know of now who is truly driven to poetry, that is necessary poetry, not vague lyricism. Every line matters. I live in Saint Louis, MO, and Jones is here at a university to be a visiting writer and just gave a reading of his newest work, about Alaska in 1970, and it heads off in a totally different direction. There's no one writng today with his sincerity and poetry."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"A gifted, stylish writer with something new and original to say. Even though the time (1973) and place (Marin County California) and subject (family of a deceased late Beat/early hippie writer) are far removed from my own experience, Jones has the gift of taking you there, spinning you around, getting you interested in the characters and leaving you delighted and enlightened."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"As I could relate with the age, time and place of the main character's life, I took a ride on the depth given to her by Jones. What a trip! I'm still sitting at the table with them over cioppino wishing everyone would come home again. Well, things surely change as California's Over reveals. I'll have to accept this and jump into another ferment of this writer's cast of characters."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"Louis B. Jones's California's Over is much more than a satire of the West Coast's Sixties legacy, though like all good satire it does have a deeply realized base of moral bedrock to put the clearly-observed human excesses and deviations in perspective, and like all good satire it is very funny without being cruel. But the book's real strength and beauty is in its tenderness, the sweet music of human peculiarity lucidly seen, and in its evocations of the loveliness of the sirens' songs that have drawn its characters toward their particular, poignant ruin on their particular rocks of reality. And the novel, like all of Jones's work, is ultimately a song of praise for the embattled decency, for the redemptive power in the feeble human longing for the simple human truth, for the humble beauty of the real, in the face of everything the world can bring of tragedy and temptation. Jones's language is astonishing, rich and lush and ever-inventive, a kind of sustained poetry. By all means check out his other novels--Ordinary Money, and Particles and Luck, which are also terrific. A beautiful writer, with hopefully a long and productive career ahead of him--a joy to read."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"My real rating is 11 stars, not five. Most rating systems go to ten, but \\"this is 11.\\"After reading Louis B. Jones' other hilarious novels, I tried to read this novel in the late 90s when it was new, but at the time was still choking on Bay area counterculture and got annoyed by the characters, even beyond where satire could provide sufficient intubation. I knew then that these characters were too identifiable. This year I tried again and found that I could not put it down. Mr. Jones is one of the best living writers and this novel joins the ranks of not only the best California fiction (think Cannery Row or Saroyan), but with brilliant prose lays out the troubled American family with the feeling of a John Irving while maintaining a spareness of prose and satire as brilliant and sharp as Vonnegut or Pynchon. Wow, I dropped a lot of names there, huh? Here's another: Louis B. Jones is a contemporary Kafka who can make me laugh out loud with every work. It's a rare combination indeed.These names are really not necessary; Louis B. Jones is in a class by himself (or if there are others, please e-mail me immediately!). California's Over is probably the best relatively undiscovered novel focused on the post post-modern era of malaise. The dark and sulfurous broth of James Farmican, while life sustaining, creates a kind of toxic imprisonment and a great metaphor of the American family, whatever that absurd beast may be. On another level, we keep eating the ash-laden soup of memory, reliving and recreating those hazy seventies as we wake up one morning having become the middleaged wine soaked Baelthon. Or we find ourselves like Wendy wondering what is missing (childhood perhaps?) and gorging on the junkfood our culture of exploitation has become. Absurd times and absurd situations. All great potential is spent shouting into the wind, collapsing into rot in the cold fog. The greatest minds of my generation wasted. This is what a family (and every other institution in our great pretend land of actor killers) is and finding a way out of this toxic soup is something we spend our youth doing and yet we keep coming back to the table, realizing it was the best soup we ever had. And when the house is emptied out and torn down, we go back to the images we create. The characters and scene are so brilliantly penned, that I found myself rereading entire sections and looking for every hidden edge in the prose. I've already ordered the new novel-- hey, it's ABOUT TIME, Mr. Jones!--and will probably reread the other two. Ordinary Money has had a the delightful lifelong effect on me of bringing an incipient smile and sometimes chuckle when I encounter a human using vague legalese. Mr. Jones, you make me laugh outloud in those moments when we all become K standing outside the castle. What a wonderful gift. Thank you, Mr. Jones, for so brilliantly keeping the gray matter engaged and reminding us about the signifying of nothing as we strut about the stage."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"The wonderful thing about Louis Jones (I've read everything there is of his work) is the sentences observing everyday life. The lawn mower in &quot;Ordinary Money&quot; or the charcoal briquettes in &quot;Particles and Luck.&quot; The really rewarding part about his writing isn't plot but love of everything. Can't think of a better way to phrase it: I finish his books more in love with everything."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"Louis B. Jones seems to be our greatest living writer. No kidding. This is the third book of his I've read. His language is as deep as Shakespeare's, his people (i.e., characters) are Shakespearean in their complexity, but reading it is almost like reading porn, it's so sensuous and humorous. His other books are &quot;Ordinary Money&quot; and &quot;Particles and Luck.&quot; But &quot;California's Over&quot; reaches whole new heights. Judging by the book jacket photo, Jones is young, so hopefully there's plenty more to come. &quot;California's Over&quot; is much more than a nostalgia trip about California bohemians -- that's just the cliched way the reviewers (above) seem to prefer thinking of it. It's a story about family forgiveness and cruelty, and about the American celebrity machine and its destructive influence on our culture, about the war between the sexes and the possibility of innocence. It's about a lot. The plot of the book is &quot;gothic&quot;: it involves a dark rotten house in the fog, a house where a suicide has occurred. It's about the surviving children of a great bohemian poet who shot himself in the sixties. The plot involves the discovery and unravelling of mysteries within the house. It's too complicated to describe here, but absolutely delicious.Also highly recommended: his first novel &quot;Ordinary Money,&quot; about counterfeit money -- but also about American values, counterfeit and very genuine. &quot;Particles and Luck,&quot; his second novel, is about a physicist whose thoughts are mostly religious and adulterous.But my favorite is &quot;California's Over.&quot; Louis Jones is a light in the world."},{"Title":"California's Over","review":"This is not Jones' best, but it's definitely his most ambitious. He's trying to mark out territory as an important writer here, bidding to be a Big Gun. Commentary on society, etc. People in the throes of crucial emotions in their lives, etc. He's more at ease with the metaphysical, as in &quot;Particles and Luck.&quot; &quot;Particles and Luck&quot; is a truly beautiful little book. A classic. However, I must say, the looser structure in &quot;Californias Over&quot; (the wandering over three decades in several characters' lives, the multiple point-of view, the flash-forwards to warn reader of future developments) all allow a new complexity here. And Jones' poetry is present. I just happen to prefer the tighter structure. His earlier books are more like DeLillo -- seem to have been directly influenced by DeLillo -- whereas this is more touchie-feelie."},{"Title":"Java Head","review":"This is a slice of life in the 1849 shipping port of Salem. The narrative centers on the families of two seafaring captains, highlighting the difference in fortune, caused both by choices and by chance. The title of the book, Java Head, is the name that Jeremy Ammidon gave to the house he built in Salem when he retired from sailing to found a shipping company. Java Head is the name of a rock that was the first sight of land after a blue-water voyage to the Orient. Sighting of the Java Head rock always gave Jeremy the good feeling of having arrived safely. Unfortunately, in life as in sea voyages, not every ship arrives safely."},{"Title":"Java Head","review":"Set in Salem in the early 1800s, Gerrit Ammidon returns home from the Orient with a Chinese bride, Taou Yuen. She is not accepted into Salem society. A degenerate seaman, Edward Dunsock, becomes infatuated with Gerrit's bride; out of a mixture of pride and disgust she commits suicide. Hergesheimer is unable to make Yaou Yuen a real person, and after her suicide Gerrit is not affected by it. This dampens the effect of the tragedy."},{"Title":"Counting of the Omer","review":"The &quot;Omer&quot; is the 49-day (seven week) period between Passover and Shavuot (the Feast of Weeks, a Jewish holy day which commemorates receiving the Torah at Mt. Sinai.) According to kabbalah, each of the seven weeks in the Omer period corresponds to one of God's holy attributes on the Kabbalistic Tree diagram. In turn, each of the seven days within that week also corresponds to one of those same attributes. 7 x 7 = 49, resulting in 49 permutations of God's attributes which we, in turn, are supposed to reflect in our daily lives.What Rabbi Jacobson has done is create 49 lessons for &quot;chesbon ha-nefesh&quot; (literally, &quot;reckoning of the soul&quot;, i.e., taking personal inventory) to be used as a daily practice during the omer period. There's one lesson for each day of the omer, based on that day's combination of attibutes. In short, it's very similar to my own &quot;49 GATES OF LIGHT&quot; omer counting program that I wrote back in the 1980s (now out of print as a physical book but still available as an interactive ebook.)Where Rabbi Jacobson's book differs from mine is that, while mine uses a lot of storytelling, his lessons are more like pop psychology, focusing on personal behaviors and attitudes toward myself and others (&quot;Do I love enough?&quot; &quot;Do I practice self-discipline?&quot; , etc.) Mine is also somewhat &quot;new age&quot; in style (although still kosher), while his is written in a more mainstream format that can be used by very traditional Jews (the person who gave me my copy is a Satmar Hasidic rabbi) as well as those who may be counting the omer for the first time, and everyone in between.The one big complaint I have about Rabbi Jacobson's version is that it does not have an illustration of the &quot;Tree within a Tree&quot; diagram upon which this whole process is based. Although there is a diagram of the lower seven sefirot on the front cover, people who are not already familiar with kabbalah and the Tree diagram might not &quot;get it&quot; right away. For that omission, I'm docking it a star, because, in my experience, most people want to understand the theory behind the practice.The book itself is in a narrow spiral-bound format with the wire binding at the top, making it possible to have it lie flat on your desk like a daily calendar, or you can tuck it in a purse or coat pocket. (It reminded me somewhat of that notebook that Columbo the detective carries around). Each lesson is on a separate page, blank on the back, so you have room to journal and take notes. At the back of the book, you will also find the traditional omer-counting blessings and kavannot (focusng meditations.)"},{"Title":"Counting of the Omer","review":"This book provides a Chassidic explanation of the progression of the Israelites from Pesach to Shavous. Rabbi Jacobson explains the meaning of each of the Kabbalistic Spheres and their containment in each other ... from Hesed (kindness) and Gevurah (focus) to Malkut (actualization and voluntary subjugation).This is a piece of the Kabbalah that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Counting of the Omer","review":"Easy to understand, short, explanation of each days Omer.

He died in the Early 1980's. This is his defintive work. It is one of the only books Mormon Missionaries are allowed to read while they are serving their 1.5 or 2 year missions. The book discusses Mormon beliefs from marriage to temples to what Mormons believe about Heaven and Hell. Anyone investigating the church has not really investigated until they read this book, (other than the Book of Mormon, of course). It is easy to read and powerfully written."},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"Brilliant work that makes concepts some believe to be unexplainable mysteries so clear and even easy to understand. The book is a treasure and everyone should read it if they want to better understand the purpose of life."},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"This work of gospel scholarship is pivotal to any legitimate study of Mormonism. Evidently, the Missionary Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints considers this book to be a pivotal one, as well, since it is included in the Missionary Reference Library (a series of reference books which all full-time L.D.S. missionaries are supposed to have).The fact that this book excites the rage of anti-mormons--I use the term \\"anti-mormon\\" to distinguish the bigoted from the civilized non-mormons--only serves to empower the Mormon Cause (in the words of Brigham Young, \\"Every time you kick Mormonism, you kick it upstairs.\\")In general, I will simply state that this book illustrates, in its text, the peerless majesty of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (hereafter, \\"this Church\\"). It demonstrates, among other things, that: a.) this Church strictly upholds the doctrines and liturgical procedures set forth in Scripture, including the Bible; b.) this Church has been the means through which God has restored the precepts and powers previously lost to the world, and c.) all of this comes as the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, including Bible prophecy.One thing in particular that must be borne in mind, I believe, in reading \\"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,\\" is the principle of Prophetic Dualism, spoken of in numerous scholarly writings (in and out of the Mormon Church). This principle reminds us that Scripture might be--and often is--fulfilled more than only once. Of course, the general interpretation and overall meaning of a scriptural passage are the same, always. But, the application can vary.For example, in referring to Isaiah 6:9-10, Jesus said that this passage was \\"fulfilled\\" in the multitude which stood hearing Him upon the sea shore (Matthew 13:14-15). This multitude, naturally, was assembled at a sea side in Palestine. And yet, years later, in Acts 28:25-27, the Apostle Paul applied this exact same prophecy of Isaiah to: a.) the unbelievers at Rome (not Palestine!), and b.) those among whom Isaiah ministered (Paul calls them \\"our fathers\\").So, here we have the same prophecy of scripture fulfilled in three different groups of people. Hence, the doctrine of Prophetic Dualism, which must ever be kept in mind when studying \\"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder\\". Otherwise, some might rashly object to Legrand Richards' claims that certain prophecies are fulfilled in the Mormon Church, blurting such things as, \\"Heresy! That passage of scripture has been fulfilled, already!\\"But, I digress. Another great feature of this book is its monumental list--in the back--of over 40 principles of truth and doctrine which set the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints apart from all other denominations and religious groups. Many have scoffed at the Mormon Church, asking, in essence, \\"What's so special about Mormonism? How is it any different from the countless other churches in Christianity?\\" Well, this list of 40+ points answers that very question most effectively.One final point. In reading \\"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,\\" one must be willing to accept that revelations of knowledge ultimately come not through \\"flesh and blood\\"--that is to say, tangible or physical--evidence (Matthew 16:17). It is an evil and adulterous generation which seeks after a physical sign, after all.To any that would yearn to question those things which God has elected to keep hidden, I will simply say that intellectual curiosity is nothing shameful, as such, \\"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.\\" (2 Timothy 2:23)."},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"I read A Marvelous Work and a Wonder several years after joining the church. I really wish I had the opportunity sooner. It should certainly be recommended to every investigator or new convert. While Richards does not delve into as great of depths as, say, Talmage or Nibley, this book is perfect for starters. It is a quick and easy read with many scripture references.

The book is complete with a comprehensive dialogue of doctrines. The style of writing includes stories, quotes from leaders, and explanations of modern day prophecy. One of the more interesting aspects of \\"A Marvelous Work and wonder\\" is the historical accounting of the translation of the Book of Mormon. \\"A Marvelous Work and Wonder\\" challenges the reader to think about the future, as significant events unfold: the establishment of zion, the gathering of House of Israel, a royal army of God, the restoration of lost knowledge, the power of priesthood keys, and the final celestial realm of the earth.As I read, \\"A Marvelous Work and Wonder\\", I kept thinking about how innovative the insights were consider our day is filled with fears of war, plagues, bankrupcy, and moral decade. If we fail as a nation, it will be from the moral decay within, the proliferation of regulations and laws the limit freedom, and centralizing of power. The monopoly forces of evil seem to be moving contrary to the patterns of Heavan, yet in the Book, \\"A Marvelous Work and Wonder\\", the Kingdom of God does not die, instead, it endures the transistion and eventual trumphets with the return of the Messiah.

LeGrand Richards, an Apostle, was a marevelous work and wonder himself!"},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"In 1974, I dated a mormon girl, who gave me the book as an encouragement to become a mormon. I had been a born-again Christian for several years, though I belonged to a protestant church and was already deeply involved in a ministry of music. Now, nearly 40 years later, I remember little about the book, except that it seemed to me then like little more than the author's sales pitch for the virtues of mormonism.One narrative I do remember from the book is about the LDS rowing team winning a race wherein the author trumps the virtues of clean mormon living - specifically their \\"don't use\\" rules concerning tobacco, alcohol and caffeine. While such rules are not exclusive to mormonism, the book still left me with the distaste of ritualistic legalism and the pride therefrom, which stands in opposition to pertinent passages in the Bible, notably Colossians 2:20-23 and Romans 14:17-23.Our relationship did not survive the book, for shortly after I finished it, we stopped seeing each other. She wanted a mormon husband and I was unwilling to give up my freedom in Christ (all things are clean for me) to embrace what I viewed as mormon legalism.For balance concerning the LDS / Church of Mormon, I recommendChaos of Cults: A Study in Present-day \\"-isms\\"andThe Kingdom of the Cults/Limited. For a historical view of early mormon life, I recommendRiders of the Purple Sage- though fiction, it is nevertheless a composite view of early mormon history and thuggery in the Utah territory."},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"This book was given to me by a former Mormon missionary that I worked with. He and I had been discussing Mormonism versus Christianity. Rather than debating many of the strange Mormon doctrines that have been taught over its 200 year history, I decided to stay with one subject: historical validity of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith called the Book of Mormon the foundation of the Mormon faith and the cornerstone of their religion. He said that a man could get closer to God by obeying its precepts above any other book on earth. Smith also claimed that it was the most correct of any book on the earth. I challanged my Mormon friend to find my one evidence for the Book of Mormon to be taken as historically acurate. Mind you, I did not ask him to prove to me its theological content but only its historical content for if its historical content cannot be proven, why believe what it says theologically? He brought me this book. I read it in three days, marked it up pretty good, and brought it back to my Mormon friend. My conclusions: the LDS Church still is serching for historical evidence for the Book of Mormon. I have here in front of me a copy of a statement put out by both the Smithsonian Institute and the LDS leaders. The Smithsonian letter denies the content of the book of Mormon as being historical and views the material as only religious in nature with no archeological evidence to support its claims. The LDS leaders, in reply, ask &quot;Why question what the Lord has decided to keep hidden?&quot; I for one question. I question all things (1 Thess. 5:21). I am not a Christian because I have prayed and feel its right, I am a Christian because of historical evidence to support the claims of the Bible (2 Peter 1:16-21). Christianity alone is the only religion based not on the teachings of Jesus as much as on the historical evidence of Jesus' death and resurrection. Buy this book. Read it. Study it. But don't believe something simply because someone tells you its true. I believe I can fly btu that does not mean its true. My subjective truth will hit objective reality when I test it. Do that with Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, etc. You will find Jesus to be true (John 14:6)."},{"Title":"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder","review":"It's so sad that a recognized leader of an international church can so publicly mutilate the words of God and go virtually unchecked.

However, Mat 15:7-8 clearly indicates that this exact same prophecy is specifically fulfilled in Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.The abominable butchering of God's word continues non-stop throughout the first few chapters, and I'm quite certain it continues on throughout...

When he checked figures in the book against results from his electronic calculator, he found the numbers to be off slightly. I called Mr. Keller to discuss this, and he chuckled because when he wrote the book, he used a slide rule for his calculations because handheld electronic calculators were not yet available.

Each chapter focuses on one Spanish speaking country, provides some key historical facts and questions, one grammatical concept with corresponding exercises, some phonetic and orthographic nuances, idiomatic phrases or expressions and other miscellaneous exercises. The book is a great review for advanced students and a reference for Hispanics who learned Spanish in the home but had no formal training. The only flaw in this text is that it does not have an answer key, which is vital if the student is pursuing independent study.

It creates a fictional dialogue of professional leaders crying out for an economic theory based on demand-side economics. Keynes provided that theory in the depths of the Great Depression and Capitalism guided by Keynesian theory has guided us through 7 decades of general prosperity since that time.Opponents of Keynes point to the period of inflation from the late 1960s to early 1980s as proof of its failings. That inflationary period was caused by excessive Keynesian stimulation of the economy combined with an accomodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. In other words, policymakers used Keynesianism abusively and the economy faltered. As Paul Volcker contracted money supply in the early 1980s, Ronald Reagan effectively applied Keynesian stimulation to the economy in the form of tax cuts and increased spending. A formula followed by George W. Bush. However, Reagan and Bush have applied a sinister usage of Keynesian policy by shifting the costs of those policies towards the middle class and applying its benefits chiefly towards the wealthy.By the time Road to Plenty was written Say's Law and Classical Economic Theory had been discredited by its failure to end massive poverty in periods, like the 1920s, of high growth. The 1920s can be compared with the Keynesian era of the 1950s when growth and prosperity were spread much more widely throughout the middle class. Those who would return us to the policies of Classical Economics, also known as Supply-Side Economics, are very fearful of Keynes and his precursor, Road to Plenty. This fear is evidenced by the spread of venom and misinformation regarding the effectiveness of Keynesian policies and by lumping a known Supply-Side proponent and failure, Herbert Hoover, with Keynesianism. Read Road to Plenty if you want to know how we began on the Road to Plenty that was America in the second half of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Road to Plenty","review":"This book, a precursor to the consumptionist fallacies later made explicit in Keynesian economics, was (unfortunately) all the rage in the late 1920s. The authors pushed for statist schemes which eventually led America down a road NOT to \\"plenty\\" but to POVERTY. The authors summarily denounced the laissez-faire policies of Harding-Coolidge (1921-1928) - those which had brought America the truly-prosperous 1920s. In contrast Foster-Catchings demanded an array of unprecedented government interventions, allegedly to \\"smooth\\" the business cycle: state-sponsored consumption, deficit-spending, favors to labor unions, \\"make-work\\" schemes, tariffs, high tax rates on the rich, etc. Starting in 1929 Hoover began to implement many of the anti-capitalist schemes promulgated in this book; the result was the 1929 stock-price crash and the start of the 1930s depression.Of course, Keynesians today still try desperately to insist Hoover was \\"Mr. Laissez-Faire,\\" that capitalism caused the depression and that Keynesian policies somehow \\"cured\\" us of the depression and \\"saved capitalism.\\" In fact it was Keynesian premises and policies, as clearly embodied in \\"Road to Plenty,\\" which sabotaged 1920s capitalism and thereby caused the market crash and 1930s depression. Foster-Catchings explicate all the main Keynesian fallacies; thus it is no wonder Keynes himself so admired the book and its authors.This is probably the most egregiously mis-titled book on economics ever published. It's as if a book were titled \\"The Road to Health\\" and included such chapters as \\"how best to ingest arsenic,\\" \\"how high a cliff to plunge from without a parachute,\\" \\"or 6 ways to commit suicide.\\" \\"Road to Plenty\\" is worth reading if for no other reason than you'll learn how, precisely, Keynesian policies ruin stocks and the economy - and how closely the Hoover Administration followed this poisonous \\"recipe\\" from 1929 to 1932. Of course, FDR (1933-1945) didn't do any better in following the recipe himself."},{"Title":"Shenmue: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"I've had a lot of issues with Prima not delivering a guide with all the info that it could of had.

Malphurs is very comprehensive (in respect to the Church environment) and makes the challenge of leading well seem manageable and obtainable. I was able to read it very quickly because many of the suggestions are repeated and others seem (at least in hindsight) to be common-sense. The author is clearly familiar with many different church environments and is confident in the various strategies for implementing growth. Malphurs goes to great length to facilitate the development and implementation of core values, mission, vision, strategy, disciple making, forming a team, ministry setting, finances, and continued strategic planning.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the growth (and/or maintenance) of his/her Church. This is especially helpful for a topical overview of a solid Christian management strategy rather than a detailed, specific, custom-tailored strategy.5 out of 5 sailboat analogiesAM Yates"},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"I own a Mac product and when I run into a hitch in my productivity I go to the genius bar at the Mac store and they work me through my issue.

Is someone at Amazon going to help me out?"},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"Malphurs asserted that the typical church in North America is aimlessly adrift (9). Such aimlessness is the result of churches and their leaders failing to do the hard work of thinking through their mission and developing the strategies necessary to accomplish that mission. Three reasons primarily account for the lack of strategic planning: lack of understanding of the need, unfamiliarity with the process, and the deemphasizing of strategic planning within the business community. Historically, strategic planning in the business world adhered to a static model; that is, planning assumed business forces would not change significantly enough to alter the strategic plan. The reality was different from the assumptions and company plans ended up lying on a shelf unused. Malphurs desired to provide church leaders with a concise and workable model for strategic planning. His model comprised a seven-step process that takes into account the many forces influencing the ecclesiastical world. Malphurs accomplished his objective in a well-organized book free from the techno babble often found in similar works.Critical Analysis of Strengths and WeaknessesThe book's title is somewhat overstated. Advanced Strategic Planning is really the basics of strategic planning. Malphurs's principles are very elementary. An advanced book would assume some level of prior understanding of the process. Instead, Malphurs gave his readers a detailed primer on the subject. That said, Malphurs did an excellent job of succinctly outlining the planning process. He began with a discussion of the church and leadership's readiness to commit to the strategic planning process followed by ways to stimulate creative and strategic thinking. Additionally, as a prelude to the planning process, Malphurs detailed the dynamics of organizational development and change.Several issues of concern come to mind regarding the preparatory process. One, Malphurs identified five attitudes among pastoral leaders that characterize resistance toward change (19). However, he failed to note that some pastors are not wired for strategic thinking. Some by nature are implementers and some are dreamers. Most pastors understand their calling only in terms of ministry activities like preaching, teaching, evangelizing, hospital visitation, etc. These are the things that excite many pastors, not strategic planning. Second, Malphurs alluded to the time necessary to lead the church to determine its mission, discover its values, capture a vision, and develop a comprehensive strategy. He noted that it could take as long as five years just to get a church's lay leadership on board with the pastor's strategic thinking mindset. Unfortunately, most pastors do not stay longer than three or four years. For example, this reviewer is the forty-fifth pastor in his church's 155-year history--an average pastorate of 3.4 years. Conventional wisdom suggests that the church does not fully accept the pastor's leadership until the fifth year. Additionally, a pastor's peak effectiveness does not begin until year seven. A pastor in his or her fifties simply will not have the longevity to see the process to fruition.Perhaps the book's greatest strength is that it challenges church leaders to think critically about its mission, its congregational makeup, its visions, and its values. The instruments in the appendix are valuable, but they presume a well-educated congregation. An inner city church comprised mostly of high school dropouts living on subsistence wages is less equipped to undertake such a rigorously intellectual analysis. For those churches with congregants able and willing to embark on the journey of self-discovery, Malphurs provided some excellent tools.This reviewer did take exception to Malphurs's disparagement of bivocational pastors. He wrote: \\"I question if part-time is better than no-time. It may depend on the circumstances. My pastoral experience has taught me that pastoral ministry is a full-time venture. Part-time ministry most often results in a maintenance ministry at best. Rarely do part-time pastors lead growing ministries\\" (164). With all due respect, this reviewer's pastoral experience has taught him otherwise. Malphurs should not treat bivocational ministers as the redheaded stepchildren of Christian ministry nor should he suggest that their churches have less potential than one with a fully supported pastor. Does he suggest closing bivocational churches since \\"no-time\\" is better than \\"part-time\\"? Over one-third of Southern Baptist pastors are bivocational. This reader wished Malphurs had dealt more graciously with bivocational ministries and provided guidelines for greater success and faithfulness within the scope of their limitations.Finally, Malphurs's chapter on evaluation focused primarily on the quality of ministries and capabilities of staff. He should have more forcefully prompted his readers to evaluate how the church itself has changed since the planning process began. If the whole process takes five or more years to accomplish, the demographics of the church could have significantly changed. Key influencer could have moved, retired, or died. New members bring their own new distinctiveness to the church. The needs and expectations of the church change as it reaches certain membership milestones. A church with one hundred worshippers that grows 10 percent per year will have over 160 worshippers in five years. New members bring a new dynamic that leaders must continually evaluate.Subsequently, the church's values may change to reflect that of incoming members. Malphurs refers to values as constant (81), but that assumes that those coming into a church already share those values or will buy into them--a false assumption. For example, a rural church in the 1960's may have valued homogeneity, but forty years of cultural change accompanied by exurbanization can cause a church to value diversity.Evaluation of Author's SuccessMalphurs achieved his objective. He skillfully outlined a systematic process to help churches and their leader develop an intentional strategy for accomplishing their mission. The flow of his argument is logical, his illustrations helpful, and the appendices useful. He forcefully made his case for a more thoughtful reflection on the mission, vision, goals, and strategies of the church. He admirably urges leaders to lead with vision and intentionality."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"As a consultant to churches in the area of strategic church planning and leadership development this book is one of the best on the subject.

I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders. Pastors, church staff members, and lay leaders, this volume is a must-have. In my opinion, it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"Aubrey Malphurs, author of many books on parish leadership and strategy, is a professor of Pastoral Ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary and is also the president of the Malphurs Group (a training and consulting firm for churches). \\"Advanced Strategic Planning\\" is a book that seeks to assist a congregation to move from a stage of stagnation and plateaued growth to a period of change and revitalization.Malphurs's introduction lays out his belief that all institutions essentially operate on a bell curve (aka \\"sigmoid curve\\" or \\"s-curve\\"), that an institution begins and experiences rapid growth in virtually all dimensions, then begins establishing routines, the routines entrench themselves and become a source of comfot to those in the organization, then the institution declines and dies. Malphurs argues that institutions (and especially the church) should, as soon as they recognize plateau, should re-invent or re-structure themselves to experience a new period of significant growth. This necessitates the re-invention and re-structuring of countless aspects of church life and organization. \\"Advanced Strategic Planning\\" takes a church through the change process in a step-by-step manner.Throughout the book, Malphurs draws upon his wealth of experience as a pastor, interim pastor, professor, and consultant to take a church through the strategic revitalization process. He addresses many pitfalls and stagnation traps, reasserts the importance of following through on the process, and pastorally encourages the church leaders to carry on. He stresses the distinctions between values, missions, and functions in a helpful way. Most valuable for this reader, he spends much time defining and showing the importance of communicating a vision.The unhelpful aspects of this book are few, but include the following: Malphurs gravitates toward writing for the larger, wealthier parish and tends. The result is that smaller, financially strapped congregations may not get as much out of this book. Also, my parish operates a day-school and I had trouble applying some of Malphur's advice to my particular situation. However, these criticism are (admittedly) minor and should not detract you from reading this book.I recommend this book for pastors, parish leaders, and others in a position to move their religious-based organization form stagnation to revitalization."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"Professor Malphurs' book is a helpful guide for those needing church consultation from a conservative, Evangelical perspective. The book lays out a basic four-fold method for strategic planning: mission, vision, goals, and objectives. I find the format helpful in laying out a plan to implement a successful strategy for whatever a local church might seek, whether it is a new direction in ministry or a new church building program for an expanding congregation.The book has helpful insight into local church life expectancy and also hits home with how to arrive at a consensus in light of the general politicking that goes on in every congregation to one degree or another. Malphurs' discussion of decision making, church patriarchs, board member dynamics, and other similar observations are certainly worth the price of the book for any person currently in, or planning on, a ministry career.The book also engages with Scripture frequently, though theological methodology is normally not a strong suite for any \`practical method' book. However, I think Malphurs does well enough in his explanation of Nehemiah to use the book as a guide for a Christian church strategic planning session. I don't think you have to do any sort of biblical gymnastics to come to that conclusion, though the rebuilding of the temple by the post-exilic covenant people to worship YHWH in the Promised Land doesn't simply transfer right over either. However, that being said, I don't think he stretches it too far and I appreciated the biblical engagement and foundation.In conclusion, I really believe this book is strongest in the areas of brainstorming and creativity for the leadership/pastoral staff of a local church. Though many churches won't need the consultation the book frequently encourages, it is full of helpful ideas for a local congregation to be purposeful and formal in its declaration about what it is and where it's going, with a foundation in the Scriptures. I think Malphurs' book certainly succeeds in multiple areas, as well as its grand scheme, and is well worth a careful reading."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"The title of the book suggests a multifaceted tactical plan that promises an innovative approach to church structure. It focuses on the aspects of a church's mission by examining issues such as preparedness, the life cycle of the church, core values, the church's purpose for existence, the surrounding community, direction, plan, church crisis and stalemates, and evaluating effectiveness. The author injects thought provoking questions throughout the book in an effort to guide readers through the process of launching the church in a certain direction. It emphasizes that the process is a collaborative effort between the pastor and the congregation. The interesting feature of the book is the contingencies chapter-\\"how will the church handle pleasant and not so pleasant surprises?\\" (187). Churches encounter various situations so it is best to have a plan in place. For instance, if the senior or only pastor resigns, the church must have a way to continue with services. They should have someone to step in temporarily while they search for another pastor. The worse thing that can happen is for the church to be in disarray. An example of a \\"good contingency\\" is receiving a large sum of money. The church should have a plan in place for what will be done in case they receive an unexpected donation. Strategic planning is to plan for the future. Another interesting information from the book is the analysis of the environment. To illustrate, the social environment includes the mobility of the population (does the majority have automobiles or do they travel via public transportation?) (119). The \\"Readiness for Change\\" inventory contains the factors necessary for organizational change, but prayer is missing (214). Before any change takes place, much prayer should be devoted by church members."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"Malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail. I really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books. He almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, IF you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant. However, much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a \\"plateau'ed\\" or \\"downward spiraling\\" church that has been around for 100 years. The principles are easy and make sense IF you have 100% support of the congregation. That's pretty hard to do in most of the churches I've been in that need strategic planning the most. That's no fault of Malphurs; the book itself is a great book."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"I have to admit I did not purchase Malphurs book because the title grabbed me or I was enthralled by the subject matter. This was part of a group assignment with a growth team of other pastors. However, I only wish I had read this book twenty years earlier. This is a tremendous aid for pastors and churches. I would highly recommend each pastor, staff member and ministry team leader or committee chairperson reading a copy. I believe it would help churches refocus or perhaps really focus for the first time on their purpose and how to sustain continual progress, maturity and growth."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"Aubrey Malphurs' book Advanced Strategic Planning (already in its second edition) offers sound, practical advice to pastors seeking to chart out a strategic plan for healthy growth. As professor of pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary, Malphurs has experience teaching pastors to think strategically, and this book serves as a textbook for students who want to avoid the plateaus and valleys of church life. Malphurs is also the president of a consulting organization that helps identify weaknesses in churches and pushes them to implement changes that might help them grow again.There is much to be commended in Malphurs' book. He recommends the adoption of mission and vision statements for churches. He helps churches discover their core values. He understands that churches will look different in varying contexts. He communicates the value of professionalism and excellence in ministry undertakings. He offers helpful instruction for evaluating the ministry, and he affirms the necessity of church discipline.Malphurs' book is very practical. Malphurs does not seek to back up every practice he condones with biblical support. He is clearly pragmatic at times in areas he believes the Bible does not specify a certain procedure. One glaring exception is his advice to avoid putting older men and women on leadership teams or committees. How that follows Paul's advice to have the older mentoring the younger is beyond me! But aside from that, Malphurs does offer good, helpful principles for thinking strategically in churches today.I recommend that pastors take Malphurs' book, glean insight from his experience, and begin moving their churches forward with a strong sense of God-given direction."},{"Title":"Advanced Strategic Planning: A New Model for Church and Ministry Leaders","review":"PROS: Malphurs' book illuminates some standard truths about strategic planning. Christian leadership involves more than simply being a good person with noble intentions. Many well-meaning pastors do not know how to lead. If you struggle with knowing where you are headed or how to get there, this book will help you.CONS: Christian leadership also involves more than the ability to incorporate standard business practices. Effective ministry must have a supernatural element. Vision, power, and results must come from God. It is in this area that the book fails. The principles of this book play well in most college business classes, but they seem incomplete when applied to the church.RESULT: The book promises more than it delivers. The complete title is ADVANCED STRATEGIC PLANNING: A NEW MODEL FOR CHURCH AND MINISTRY LEADERS. It is not advanced. Nothing in the book was new to me, and it falls a little short when applied to the church. It is a very good book on STRATEGIC PLANNING. If this is your weak area, buy the book.

The story is a dramatic one, eloquently told.The few boatloads of convicts who land in Sydney Harbor in 1788 make poor pioneer stock indeed. That they survive at all is due to the courage and wisdom of their Captain Phillips. His story is told here as is that of a fictional character, Andrew prentice, a red-headed convict who escapes, takes a native wife, and flourishes with her in the wilds while his fellow English back at the settlement are near starvation. Parallel to the slow establishment of the white colony runs the sad history of the black men's demoralization, personified in Bellilong, an historical figure and a leader in his tribe, who develops a fatal friendliness toward the English. A visit to London completes his undoing, and symbolizes the coming degeneracy of his whole race.An excellent story and fresh background make this Mrs. Dark's most ambitious and important novel."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"Sir Walter Scott's 1818 novel, &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&quot; deals with events in the lives of the Deans family from 1736 to the early 1750's. The novel begins with the 1736 Porteous riots, in which disgruntled citizens of Edinburgh storm the local prison to take revenge on a needlessly cruel official. With Anglo-Scottish relations in a tailspin and Queen Caroline levying a rash of punishments against Edinburgh in the background, the action of &quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; commences.The principle heroes of the novel are Jeanie Deans and her longtime suitor, Reuben Butler. The two rustic born youths are from differently oriented Presbyterian ancestry - their parents' religious differences force an almost interminable delay in the progress of their affections. Butler's extensive formal and ministerial education notwithstanding, his financial position is such that he cannot comfortably propose a union to Jeanie's father. Further complication arises when Jeanie's younger and more impulsive half-sister, Effie, is seduced and later accused of murdering her child. The majority of the novel details Jeanie's attempts to question the impropriety of the judgement against her sister, and her interactions with the world outside of provincial northern Scotland.As always, Scott deals with a range of social, economic, political, and legal issues. Among these in &quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; is the right of the Scottish to control their own internal disputes - are Scottish law and British law compatible? On a related tip, the novel calls into question whether the governors of the people have sufficient sympathy with and understanding of all the people they govern. Scott also examines the nature of language - with plain English, various Scottish dialects, and quotations from classical Latin and the Bible - the characters in the novel often have to understand each other before they can adequately communicate.&quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; has a number of quirky and interesting minor characters: from the soft-spoken, yet intently-staring Dumbiedikes, to the hardline theologian-father David Deans, to the rake George Robertson, to the tragically mysterious Madge Wildfire, to the courtly, wistful Duke of Argyle. These minor characters add substance, humor, and diversity to Scott's intricate plot. In &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian,&quot; Jeanie Deans, an unpretentious young woman, takes on a world beyond the enclosed experience of her home, bearing the troubles of her family, her community, and her nation on her back. The result is a great, if sometimes gregarious novel which you will certainly enjoy."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"Having been asked to spend a few weeks at a remote Naval base in the former &#8220;German Democratic Republic&#8221;, I had plenty of time on my hands to read Walter Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Heart of Midlothian&#8221; in the Oxford World&#8217;s Classics edition (with notes, 580 pages), something that whiled away the time more than satisfactorily, this novel being perhaps the best that Scott ever wrote. In his previous Waverley novel, &#8220;Old Mortality&#8221;, he had described the unruly, extreme tendencies of Covenanter Calvinism. In this book, he shows us the other side of the strict Biblical piety he had got to know during his own childhood. The novel is based on two true stories, the Porteous riots in Edinburgh, and the heroics of one Helen Walker, a simple Scots lass who walked to London to save her sister from an unjustly imposed death penalty for child murder. Scott&#8217;s way of combining these two stories, making the leader of the riot to be the father of the child that had disappeared, is neither historical nor particularly convincing, and the fate of the child is, indeed, a horrible one. But for me, the most interesting aspect of the book was the description of the Christianity practised by Lowland Scots at the beginning of the 18th century. Davie Deans, the father of Scott&#8217;s heroine, is something of a Cameronian or strict covenanter, and it is, perhaps, his very strictness which drives his young daughter Effie to the worldly pursuits that he so much abhorrs. But Davie Deans is an honest soul, and despite his wordy arguments with his neighbours, emerges as a very sympathetic figure, who, towards the end of the book, reaches something of a compromise to enable himself and his elder daughter to live in fairly comfortable circumstances; this, surely, is a picture of how Scott sees the development of theological Calvinism, forced to come to terms with the political and social realities of a Scotland dominated by &#8220;prelatist&#8221; English interests. Jeannie Deans, Scott&#8217;s rather romanticized version of Helen Walker, is an equally strict believer, but her faith expresses itself not in words but in actions, and this is what makes her both a charming heroine and a symbol of what, according to Scott, is best in Christianity and Calvinism.As for the rest of the book, it is the descriptions of the Porteous riots and the storming of the Edinburgh prison, the &#8220;Heart of Midlothian&#8221;, at the beginning which make the greatest impression, followed perhaps by the trial scenes and then the interviews in London with the Duke of Argyll and with Queen Caroline, wife of George II. The last part of the book, which is due entirely to Scott&#8217;s imagination and has no basis in reality, is more disappointing, as though Scott thought he could not publish a novel without at least some scenes in the Highlands, scenes which here do not ring absolutely true.Reading Scott is never easy, but the World&#8217;s Classics edition makes a brave attempt at facilitating the procedure with copious explanatory notes, a historical overview and a glossary which, while not containing every difficult word, is comprehensive enough to help the reader through the intricacies of Scottish legal Latin and Lowland dialect."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"Heart of Midlothian is best known today in Scotland as the name of a football team from Edinburgh. Many may be aware that the team took its name from a novel, but Scott's story is little read nowadays so few indeed are aware that the novel took its name from a prison. This prison was situated in the centre of Edinburgh in the county of Midlothian, until it was torn down in 1817, and no doubt a certain irony was intended when it became known as The Heart of Midlothian. Scott's novel focuses on the prison firstly in its description of the Porteous riot of 1736 when a mob stormed the prison in order to revenge itself on a prisoner who it seemed was to escape justice. More importantly it is to this prison that Effie Deans is sent for the crime of child murder, because she has kept the fact of her pregnancy secret and cannot produce the child. Effie faces the prospect of execution even though there is no evidence that she has killed her baby. The law considered her secrecy as evidence enough of her guilt. This leads to a terrible dilemma for the novel's heroine Jeannie Deans. If she would merely say that she had been told of her sister's pregnancy, Effie would go free. Jeannie will go to any lengths to free her sister, but she will not lie. In her search for justice Jeannie must walk to London and her extraordinary journey takes her to the very top of 18th century society.Jeannie Deans is the greatest of Scott's heroines. She is strong both physically and morally. While she may not have the education of some of those she meets, she more than matches their learning with her own common sense. It is the investigation of her character, which makes the novel so interesting. The story is well told and is often exciting with lots of suspense and emotion, but Scott is less concerned with romance in this novel than in some of his others. The story of Jeannie's love for her childhood friend Reuben Butler is important, but told in such a way as to emphasise Jeannie's morals and sense rather than her romantic inclinations. If there is a romantic heroine in the novel, it is Effie, but her wilful, petulant nature together with her involvement with a rake is contrasted unfavourably with the behaviour and character of her sister. Heart of Midlothian is a long novel perhaps too long, as the fourth part is not quite as good as the first three. It is also quite a difficult read with a good deal of difficult legalistic language and a greater than usual amount of Scots dialect. The best edition of the novel is undoubtedly that edited by David Hewitt and Alison Lumsden. The editors have gone back to Scott's manuscript and the first edition of the novel in order to correct numerous errors and restore a number of important readings, which have previously been lost. The result is a stunning example of modern editorial scholarship, which provides the reader with a text, which is easier and more enjoyable to read. This edition moreover has an extensive set of notes and a full glossary both of which are essential if Scott's text is to be fully understood. Heart of Midlothian is perhaps not the best place to begin reading Scott. But it is a novel, which anyone who reads Scott should aim towards, for it is quite possibly the best of the Waverley novels."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"The Heart of Midlothian by Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is the best novel in the distinguished series by this author called \\"The Waverly Novels. (The series title derives from the name of the title hero in the first of these novels: the young English soldier Edward Waverly.)The plot is simple. Jeanie Deans is a young Calvinist lass who is engaged to be married to a poor schoolmaster named Reuben Butler. During the 1736 riots in Edinburgh, in which Captain Porteous a tax agent was murdered by hanging, Jeanie's younger sister Effie is accused of murdering her newborn child. Effie is imprisoned and condemned to death. Jeanie seeks to save her life by appealing to Queen Caroline in London who is the wife of King George II of Great Britain. As Jeanie travels on her long jaunt from Edinburgh to London the reader meets a broad crosssection of Scottish and English persons who assist the young girl on her quest for justice. Jeanie is one of the most appealing heroines in all of British fiction.The book is not only fascinating for this heartwarming story but also lluminates:a. The relationship between poor Scotland and wealthy England in the immediate years following the union of the two nations in 1707.b. A look at the religious differences between episocapcy supported by the English and the sternCalvinist Presbyterianism in Scotlandc. A nostalgic look at Scottish life as it moves from an agricultural to an industrialized age.d. Like Charles Dickens, Scott was good at drawing eccentric minor characters which add richness and humor to this long novel.And now for a caveat. Scott's novels are always difficult reading! He relishes in making authorial comments on the characters behavior and retards the action with long digressions on politics, religion and other aspects of Scottish life which may not have been familiar to his English readers. This material is often interesting but adds too many pages to his tale. The last quarter of the book needs editing as the decision regarding the fate of Effie Deans has already been decided by that point.Scott's books require a glossary of Scottish words, customs and phrases which are necessary to aid the 21st century reader's understanding of the novel. Scott was the first major historical novelists in the English language. His novels broke new ground by interesting male and young readers in exciting epic fictions. He was widely popular in his own day. A resurgence of interest in this important author is long overdue. Scott is an excellent writer but it takes concentration and study to enjoy his books. The Heart of Mid-Lothian was published in 1818 and has never been out of print."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"Written in 1818, \\"The Heart Of Midlothian\\" is one of the most famous works of the great Scottish Writer, Sir Walter Scott. It is set largely in Scotland in the time between the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 and revolves around the Edinburgh riots of 1736 that saw the lynching of John Porteous, Captain of the City Guard, and the subsequent retaliation by the English Crown. Intimately connected with this is the story of Effie Deans, condemned to death on the assumption of having had her child killed, despite a total lack of evidence and the efforts of her sister Jeanie to see her freed. Incidentally the \\"Heart of Midlothian\\" was the Edinburgh Tollhouse or Jail, which was later pulled down and removed.It is a longish read at 507 pages, but by no means long compared to many of the bloated works of recent years. It took me a very long time to read, not because of its length but because its style was so dry and tedious and so full of unnecessary detail as to prevent me reading more than a chapter or two at a time, and there are 52 chapters. A random example:\\"There was not a window in all the lofty tenements around it, or in the steep and crooked street called the Bow, by which the fatal procession was to descend, that was not absolutely filled with spectators. The uncommon height and antique appearance of these houses, some of which were formerly the property of the Knights Templars, and the Knights of St John, and still exhibit on their fronts and gables the iron cross of these orders, gave additional effect to the scene in itself so striking.\\"There's nothing wrong with this language, and the excessive detail may be interesting to some, but for me it makes dreary read.Scott was a lawyer by trade, and he carries his work with him in this novel. Not only does it read as though declaimed by a barrister at the Assizes, but it is full of lawyers, would be lawyers, lawyer's humour and lawyer's Latin. For example:\\"He has been a candidate for our remedium miserabile\\" said Mr Hardie, \\"commonly called a cessio bonorum. As there are divines who have doubted the eternity of future punishments, so the Scotch lawyers seem to have thought that the crime of poverty might be atoned for by something short of perpetual imprisonment. After a month's confinement, you must know, a prisoner for debt is entitled, on a sufficient statement to our Supreme Court, setting forth the amount of his funds, and the nature of his misfortunes, and surrendering all his effects to his creditors, to claim to be discharged from prison\\".\\"I had heard\\", I replied, \\"of such a humane regulation\\".\\"Yes\\", said Halkit, \\"and the beauty of it is, as the foreign fellow said, you may get the cessio when the bonorums are all spent. ...\\"The characters Halkit and Hardie and all their legal carry-on in the first chapter are entirely unnecessary as is the character Bartoline Saddletree, who's utterances throughout the book are tedious in the extreme, not only to the reader, but also to the other characters who are forced to listen to him. Obviously Scott had not the art of self editing, being entirely unable to cull his own dross, and the book is much the weaker for it.And now we come to the matter of religion. There is a great deal of religion in this book, and in my opinion at least, a great deal too much. I know that many folk in those days took the cult of Jehovah far more seriously than they do today, but it makes for boring reading. There can surely be few indeed who care a fig about the Cameronian Covenanters and their nit picking issues with the Protestant Church. For example:\\"There remained a third stumbling block - the oaths to government exacted from the established clergymen, in which they acknowledge an Erastian king and parliament, and homologate the incorporating union between England and Scotland, through which the latter kingdom had become part and parcel of the former, wherein Prelacy, the sister of Popery, had made fast her throne, and elevated the horns of her mitre. These were the symptoms of defection which had often made David cry out. \\"My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at the very heart!\\" ...These oaths were, therefore, a deep compliance and a dire abomination - a sin and a snare, and a danger and a defection. But this shibboleth was not always exacted.\\"...There may well have been people like the tiresome David Deans, and modern students of Christian history may be fascinated with the intricacies of Protestant doctrine but for the rest of us it just gets in the way of the story.Scott may, perhaps, have excuses for the above flaws, but what he can not excuse himself from is the books greatest flaw: the one dimensionality of the main characters. Jeanie the heroine is, to put it baldly, a drip. A courageous, do it herself woman, willing and able to risk her life and honour to save her sister. A steadfast Protestant willing to let her sister be sentenced to death rather than tell a lie before God. A loyal lover, prepared to wait years for her boring boyfriend to get a decent job before marrying him, meanwhile denying the suit of the local Laird. A fine cheesemaker and exemplary housekeeper. Wise confidant, providential saver, loving mother, dedicated Christian and dutiful wife. She never puts a foot out of line, never learns anything and never has any fun in the entire book! What a drip!Much the same can be same of her eventual husband Reuben Butler. A struggling school teacher and cleric. He has a smaller part but is similarly a paragon of virtue and dull as dishwater!The characters of people like David Deans and Bartoline Saddletree are \\"enlivened\\" by making them tiresome. The Duke of Argyle and the Queen of England are paragons of nobility: generosity, judgement and grace. Too pat and one dimensional Scott!It is the people of arbitrary morality that have the most rounded characters, such as Jem Ratcliffe, George Staunton, Duncan Knockdunder and Effie Deans herself, yet in the whole book it is only Duncan that has any real zest for life.Inexcusable Mr Scott, to fill a book full of dull characters. Surely 18th century Scotland can't have been THAT dreary!!!The other inexcusable flaw in this work is the way it all turns out. Not only is it predictably pat, but it is RELIGIOUSLY pat. Any character that has done wrong comes to a bad end. (With the exception of Ratcliffe). Obvious villains like Meg Murdockson and George Staunton are executed or die in battle. Misled unfortunates like Staunton's heir and Madge Wildfire die in misadventure. Even Effie Deans, guilty of nothing more than sex before marriage, cannot escape the misery of her sins and ends up in a convent. Meanwhile the religious zealots are elevated and live long and rewarding? lives. It's enough to make one want to vomit. Considering Scott came from a legal background and was a deputy sheriff I fail to see why he should exhibit such a narrow minded fundamentalist Christianity. Alas for this book.OK, enough knocking, is there anything good about this famous novel? Well yes of course, fortunately there is.Firstly, although dry and boring, it is very well written. Scott was an intelligent, educated man, and although his view of the world is narrow, it is, at least historically accurate and detailed.Secondly, for those of us who love Scotland it is wonderful to hear the Scottish dialect, that permeates almost every page. For example the worthy Duncan:\\"Fat ta deil, Mr Archibald,\\" answered the Captain of Knockdunder, \\"wad ye hae them ring the bell before I am ready to gang to kirk? I wad gar the bedral eat the bell-rope, if he took ony sic freedom. But if ye want to hear the bell, I will just show mysell on the knowe-head, and it will begin jowing forthwith.\\"Or the loyal Jeanie:\\"But when the hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the body - and seldom may it visit your Leddyship - and when the hour of death comes, that comes to high and low - lang and late may it be yours - O, my Leddy, then it isna what we hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for others, that we think on maist pleasantly. And the thoughts that ye hae intervened to spare the puir thing's life will be sweeter in that hour, come when it may, than if a word of your mouth could hang the haill Porteous mob at the tail of ae tow.\\"Thirdly, although Scott has done his best to obscure them, the events themselves are quite interesting. In better hands this book could have been a ripping yarn.And that's it folks.To conclude: I am giving this book 4 stars because it is a classic that has stood the test of time. Scott pioneered the historical novel. His work must be taken in context with its time, it cannot be judged as though it were written last year. Had it been written last year, it would not have been published and I would not be bothering to write this review.This book is indispensable if one is interested in Scottish literature. It would be a fascinating read if one were interested in old Presbyterian dogma or 18th century Scottish law. If you want a ripping historical page-turner I suggest you look elsewhere.The flaws exhibited in this novel are very serious, including the fatal crime of boring the reader, but the erudite may find them counterbalanced by Scott's learned prose and punctilious historical detail. In the end however it is the weight of history and this book's place in it that makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"The fact that this monster of a novel was a bestseller at its time (1818) possibly tells us that 'progress' has reduced the time that we are willing to spend on reading. So for me. I was looking for the usual half dozen pocket books to take on a trip of a few days. This one was the last Scott that was still in my shelf. For lack of space I relegate books that I have read and that are not top favorites to either box storage in the garage or to 2nd hand book sales at school charities. This one I had not read yet. I will probably never have the stamina for it, unless I am marooned on the proverbial island and it happens to be in my hand luggage.I did read the introductions and browsed through some chapters. Maybe another time. Possibly never, though I do remember that Scott's mansion Abbotsford near Edinburgh is one of only four writer's houses turned museum that I visited. The other three are Goethe's birth house in Frankfurt, the Joyce museum in Dublin (of which I can't remember for certain right now whether he ever lived there), and Nabokov's childhood appartment in St.Petersburg.I think my Scott time is over, so if you wait for the next instalment of my Melville excursions, don't worry, I am not sidetracked. Redburn will be next, but I am travelling a lot these days, and I don't take hardcovers on trips.Why then do I post a review on the 'Heart'? I was impressed by the editor's story of his trouble with identifying the right text for this publication. The writer, Scott, was a highly literate man in a modern society of his time, who even owned the publishing house himself, indirectly. The book was an international bestseller despite its folksiness and the excessive use of 'dialect' English. Finding out 200 years later which text is 'authoritative' can be damned hard.You see what I am driving at. Text reconstruction is hard and often impossible. How then can a text that was transmitted orally for decades, if not centuries, before it was committed to paper, have an 'authoritative' version that has any plausible relation to its 'author'?The 'Heart' is in a box in the garage now, in case you wondered."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"Aside from Ivanhoe (and I have my doubts about even that), Scott is woefully under-read today, probably because reading him is a challenge just as reading Shakespeare is a challenge. As with Shakespeare, the Waverley novels are filled with riches, and I have found that the effort of reading them is repaid many times over.The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels seems to have received little publicity, but I cannot praise too highly the herculean efforts of the editors. With the historical background, extensive notes, and glossary provided in each volume, Scott comes alive. The editors have outdone themselves with The Heart of Mid-Lothian, in particular. The sheer quantity of historical references, and the extensive use of Scots dialect, are enough to intimidate the bravest readers. I can imagine reading and enjoying this novel without notes and without a glossary, but the supplementary material enables the novel to be truly appreciated as one of the great works in literature. At its core it is a simple story of love and humanity. It moved me to tears, and really that is about the highest praise I can give.A note on the use of Scots dialect: In the early stages of reading this novel I wasn't entirely sure I would get through it, even with the glossary. I had previously read The Pirate and survived the Scots in that, so I doggedly persevered and soon found my comprehension growing and my reading becoming much faster. Scott could have written this entirely in standard English, but the use of Scots adds a realistic dimension that elevates it and--to use a visual analogy--turns it from 2D into 3D. I would suggest making a short definition list of the most commonly encountered Scots words (e.g, \\"muckle,\\" \\"ain,\\" \\"gar\\") and using it as a bookmark. Soon you will be speaking (or at least reading) Scots like a native!"},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics)In high school I read The Talisman and Ivanhoe and loved them both. This book is not that type of adventure story and is not always so accessible because of the dialect dialog. That, however, does not detract from the plot and characterizations. Scott does a marvelous job of bringing the major events of the novel to life. The picture of the riot is fantastic. What sets this novel apart for me is how the author is able do bring vividly and realistically to life so many aspects of society from the common folk to the nobility. To read this book in terms of women's rights and the strength that women display in times of trial makes this novel a valuable part of the history of women's place in society."},{"Title":"The heart of Midlothian, (The modern student's library)","review":"A tough read but the book is particularily rewarding for the notes in the back.

Scott might have had an interesting idelogical point to make about religion, but the story he found to tell it through was not worth 580-odd pages. Jeanie Deans story is more like a poor attempt at Jane Austen, who will she marry, how does her marriage go. Scott's interest is clearly in the supporting players, Douce Davie Deans and Dumbiedikes, who are aligned with whatever religious movement Scott didn't like. Honestly, if you don't care much for religious differences, you'll be skipping as I was. Too much character description and not enough character in action; the story doesn't fit the concept, and tells a story in 580 words what probably deserved 220 or less, for economic reasons, to sell the full three volumes (according to the introduction).Scott is famous for being immensely popular: but unlike Dickens, I'm struggling to see why. I will give him another chance some day.

I like \\"faerytales\\" so I'm able to put aside credibility and enjoy a book - not all readers will be able to do this - but there were other problems with this novel that really hurt the super effort. However, hang in there, you won't be sorry, it's still a very enjoyable read.Rory Kenilworth, California surfer girl, finds on her 23rd birthday her whole life has been a lie. Her mother died before she could break the news to her that she's a princess born. So, on her birthday a lawyer announces she has a half brother, the King of a tiny unheard of country, she must soon accept her place as princess and she's betrothed to Prince Laurent.Laurent, playboy, prince of another tiny unheard of country that borders her brother's kingdom, is the intended groom. He shows up to protect Rory and help her make the transition to princess, but does so pretending to be his secretary. Using his middle name Sebastian, he finds himself protecting her as one attempt after another is made on her life. And not just from one area, there are several factions wanting to stop the royal marriage.Joyce Sullivan's talented writing is what kept me reading. The premise was not credible, and there are so many wholes in the believability factor that she really asks a lot of a reader. At one point, she stresses Rory's given a bracelet with a panic button (a la West Wing). Yet, when Rory gets in life threatening situations she NEVER uses it. It's as if the bracelet and its button vanish after its first mention. Bad editing there. That should've been addressed. Why bother giving her the bracelet if the device is totally dismissed? Also, in this day and age, when the Internet is full of everything, Laurent a playboy prince hounded by the press (a la Lady Di) that Rory could not find even ONE picture of him anywhere just is so silly. At one point, he instructs his assistant to give her a picture of his brother when Rory keeps asking to see one, but that is - like the bracelet - forgotten as soon as the page is turned. It only makes the reader like Laurent less. There was no viable reason for him to continue the charade. And like the bracelet, it's forgotten as soon as it was mentioned. Did Rory get the picture or not? Rory does go to the royal site, where his picture was disconnected, but that is the ONLY place she bothers to look? What about newspapers, magazines etc. Sorry. That, again, asked the reader not to think. A woman engaged to a man she has never seen would be looking EVERYWHERE! Also, the one man trying to kill Rory - why kill her when he is trying to avenge his sister's murder? The motivation and reasoning behind the character is just too sketchy. That she does not address these issues shows the writer failed to step back and really look at her characters, see how they would TRULY act in that situation.The problems that needed addressing aside, I found Sullivan able to pull me along with the strength of her writing. She shows GREAT promise as a writer, a strong voice that flows smoothly. Her characters are very engaging; they leap off the pages and make you care about them. She is adept at tossing red herrings around, so she is good in developing plot. If she can stop dropping threads - important ones - and sticks to a more believable story, then you're going to see a rising star in Romance.I really enjoyed this book, despite the plot problems, and look forward to future books from this engaging writer. This book gets 5 stars for the writing- 3 stars for problem riddled storyline - I split the difference and gave it 4. Sullivan is atalented writer, so she just needs to pay attention to the small things and edit her book with \\"fresh eyes\\"."},{"Title":"Her Royal Bodyguard (Harlequin Intrigue No. 782)","review":"My first Harlequin had me thinking about the series writers mindset. This book was effeciently wrapped up with no fillers or lags. I kept thinking about its economy and that the author turns out several novels a year. They must have it down to a formulaic science. And having said all that ...I enjoyed this book. Rory and Laurent have good chemistry from the beginning and the mystery of the assasination attempts lent a quality of danger.

That said it is impossible to write on the all the emotional levels that \\"Raisin\\" brings to the reader and/or audience member.A struggling, African-American family strives to make it out of crowded Chicago Housing Project and to own their piece of American dream pie. Several of the characters in this extremely well written drama have their own dilemma to face: Ruth Younger, wife to Walter, must decide if she should have bring another baby to her already financially strapped family. Walter Younger, husband to Ruth, who has huge dreams and little means, of providing for his family. Beneatha Younger, sister to Walter, who is med student and dreams of being a doctor now questions her own life and culture. Finally, and most importantly, is Lena Younger (Mama) who is fighting to keep her family together after the death of her husband. The issue of assimilation of African heritage in American culture is still significant factor today and continues to be a struggle for many minorities in America as well. In my opinion, Raisin remains a fresh and relevant dramatic work for today and for many years to come."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"The book &quot;A Raisin In The Sun&quot; by Lorraine Hansberry was an outsatanding book to read.

The reason why I didn't like the book a lot is because of the ending. I feel the ending could have been more dramatic; however, still end the way it did. I liked the way Walter had took the responsibility over the money and I thought he was going to do the right things,such as pay for Beneathas medical school, but he didn't and because of Walter not doing the right things it caused conflicts.

I am an eigth grade student who was assigned to choose a book to read from a selection of literature about African-American life in the mid 1900's. While we were reading our independent book, in class we were also reading and studying To Kill a Mockingibrd, by Harper Lee. Th pupose of reading two of the same types of boos at the same time was to compare points of view within each book. In A Raisin in the Sun, the point of view is tols by the author through the four main characters: Ruth, Walter, Mama and Beneatha. All of these characters are members of an African-American family. Where as in To Kill a Mockingbird, the point of view is told by the author through Scout, a six year old white girl. The amount of racism changes from book to book because even though Scout is not racist by any means (she was raised that way), she is young and does not fully understand all of the components of racism, and as compared to the characters in A Raisin in the Sun, she does not start to convey the feelings of this terrible thing, because the characters in A Raisin in the Sun a re victims of racism, therefore they can portray it in a much stronger sense. Overall I felty that this book told a very interesting story about people living in a segregated world. It was fun being able to read it in a play format as well because I was able to vividly imagine them in action in my mind.

During our study of the 1930's in Alabama we were assigned to read another book by an African American author. I chose A Raisin the Sun because my mom recommended it. Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun written in 1959 is an intriguing, must read play. This play shows the strength of an African-American family's values and ability to stick together. They face many hard things that shock the reader and the audience including an accidental pregnancy. They battle against harsh prejudice and a system that attempts to keep them from having good opportunities to improve their life. Hansberry does a good job of intertwining family hardships with the individuality of each character. She develops each character personally and carries on his or her traits through out the entire book. The attitude she takes towards the great struggles of a Chicago family, Walter, Ruth, Mama, Beneatha and Travis Younger is convincing because of her tone and description. She shows that life for an African American person at this time is difficult and full of obstacles more challenging than the ones that white people faced. Although A Raisin in the Sun takes place 29 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, African American people are still treated with no respect and are limited in their rights. Both stories constantly demolish African-American families' dreams. Hansberry illustrates through her tone that the family life is rough and the Youngers' are eager for a big change. This action in the plot causes excitement and suspense. As a reader I constantly want the Younger family to over come their challenges and do well in the future. In the same way, In To Kill A Mockingbird I was always hoping that Tom Robinson would be freed. Although there are similarities in the way black people are treated in both books, Lorraine Hansberry as a black author develops her black characters more thoroughly than Harper Lee. Lorraine Hansberry leaves her white characters to roles that are minor. I like this play because it is realistic and shows how strong a family bond is no matter what comes between them. She really showed how the Youngers' were struggling financially but still managed to succeeded all of the obstacles in their way."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"&quot;A Raisin in the Sun,&quot; the play by Lorraine Hansberry, was produced in New York City in 1959. Hansberry creates the story of the Youngers, a struggling African-American family whose members deal with poverty, racism, and painful conflict among themselves as they reach for a better life. The Youngers are, in my opinion, one of the most unforgettable families in United States literature. Hansberry balances grim drama, comic moments, and redemptive love as the play unfolds.Although a few of the characters may seem a bit stereotypical, the play strikes me as surprisingly fresh after all these decades. It is also fascinating to hear the voices of three generations of a single family in this play. Ultimately, &quot;Raisin&quot; is a celebration of struggle, pride, and hope, in addition to being a historically important indictment of mid-20th century racism. This is essential reading for anybody with a serious interest in United States drama or African-American literature."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"The play, A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry was awonderful piece of writing. I'm a fourteen year old and I thinkthat the book is good for most ages but you need to be at least 12 to fully understand it. I read this book while reading To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. It was interesting to read those books at the same time to see the points of view of racism of both sides. I noticed something very similar in both books. The Black people are always very welcoming and polite to the white people. In To Kill a Mockingbird, Tom Robinson was always willing to help Mayella Ewell with chores. In A Raisin in the Sun, when the man came from the welcoming committee, they were very polite to him and invited him into their home. Little did they know that they would be rejected even though they were very courteous. That happened in both books. In A Raisin in the Sun, it seemed like their race was holding them back from accomplishing their dreams. When Mama bought the house for her family, they were all brutally rejected by the community. This upset the family very much. Walter says, \\"Maybe---maybe I'll just get down on my black knees,Captain Mistuh, Bossman. A-hee-hee-hee! Yasssuh! Great White Father, just gi' ussen de money, fo' God's sake, and we's ain't gwine come out deh and dirty up yo' white folks neighborhood...\\" When he says this it is a very dramatic part of the play. It shows how white people are controlling so much that goes on. They can't live in a house they want to live in. It seems like the white people are perceived as some kind of royalty in the book. Like queens and kings, they are not anything special but were just born into the \\"right\\" family. Unlike royalty, it's not the name they inherit but the color of their skin. I think this book was a great book to read. It showed me that in America you didn't always have a fair chance and social mobility used to be a lost cause for African-Americans. All of the people who lived in that crummy apartment had a dream but because of their skin color, their dreams were shattered. Either they wouldn't be taken seriously, or not welcomed, or given no choice but to take a low paying job doing unskilled things. I thought it was a great book because it was so realistic. There was suspense and most of all it was a book that really made me think."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"The book &quot;A Rasin in the Sun&quot; deals with a lot of conflicts including money, racism, love, and trust. The story is about the Youngers, a black family living on the South Side of Chicago. It details the family's different views on what should be done with the ten thousand dollar check. The character Mama wants to buy a house. Her son Walter Lee wants to open a liquor store, and the daughter Beneatha wants to finish her schooling. In each scene, a character is faced with a different decision. The story is written as a play. I personally thought &quot;A Rasin in the Sun&quot; was on okay book, and I would tell anybody who loves to read plays to read this story."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A Raisin in the Sun, written by Lorraine Hansberry ,is by far one of the best books have read yet. The setting is in the mid-1900's in the Southside of Chicago. The main focus of this book occurs around a poor black family in a poor black community, the Younger's. Hansberry does a great job of using dialect to make the scenes quite realistic and uses quite a bit of symbolism, irony, motifs, and situations that involve making decisions where you become stuck between a rock and a hard place. The book starts off with Walter Younger's obsession with his mother's insurance check so he can become a true entrepeneur and invest in his own liquor store. Since religion played a vital role in Mama's reaction to this sinful act it really damaged Walter's hopes and dreams. Later in the book Mama finally decides to give Walter the money and leaves him with the responsibility of taking care of the family, this is where the rising action begins. Then the climax hits when Walter finds out that the money he gave to his partner is gone. This leaves Walter and the rest of the family in a sudden feeling of disillusionment. Then as things cool down Walter and the rest of the family decide to go ahead and move into the all white neighborhood. The rest of the story is jam packed with racial, religious, economic, and even feministical motifs that aid in the release of all the true tensions in the novel, between characters, which Hansberry purposely relates to the reality of the way society really is. Her purpose for writing this book was to show the way society worked and to make it apparent how hard life was for a poor black family. Overall I really enjoyed this book. It had alot of realistic elements , enough to make the reader stay interested and more. The plot is dramatic and ends ironically. I gave this book 4 stars because it had all the elements of a good book it just did not have the ending I was expecting. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a easy reading book that contains alot of real life situations and the struggle of a poor black family just trying to &quot;move on up&quot;, just like the Jefferson's just without all the funny jokes."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"This book outlines a colorful premise on the life of an African American family and describes their fight for their dreams.Schools have been using this play to get students reading and give them different perpectives.I think this book is for all.Some language...but it's not like no one has heard any badmouthing anyway.I think that it is just a really really really good play too and that Lorraine Hansberry did a good job just weaving everything together.You can really relate to this story with the dilemmas and questions it rises.And it's not like anything of a complicated story either, you can really decipher it.And last I believe the author wrote from her heart, exprssing herself through her work majestically."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Produced in 1959, A RAISIN IN THE SUN was the first Broadway play written by a black woman: Lorraine Hansberry (1930-1965), a memorable author who based the central story on an incident that occurred in her own family and which eventually evolved into a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1940 as Hansberry v. Lee.The play presents us with three generations of the Younger family: the widowed matriarch Lena; her son Walter Lee and daughter Beaneatha; and Walter's wife Ruth and their son Travis. The family resides in a semi-slum apartment building on the south side of Chicago in the 1950s, where each tries to rise above the difficulties of their enviroment and the many social limitations imposed upon African-Americans at that time. But there is hope on the horizon: Lena is about to receive insurance money from her husband's death.Unfortunately, instead of pulling the family together, the money actually drives them apart. Each member lays claim to it in some form or fashion. Lena dreams of owning her own home; daughter Bea is attending medical school and needs money to finish her degree; and most especially Walter Lee dreams of owning a liquior store. Bit by bit the pressure chips away at the family, already strained by years of frustration, and explodes at the play's climax--although not precisely in a way that one might foresee. When the explosion arrives it does not shatter the family; it unexpectedly reaffirms it.When I review a play, I like point out that plays are not really intended to be read. They are intended to be seen on stage, where performing artists and designers breathe life into the lines and bring force to the story and its themes. This is true of every play. It may be especially true of A Raisin In The Sun, which on paper feels somewhat dry and slightly preachy. But I have seen the play performed--and let me assure that you that it brings the audience to hysterical laughter, painful tears, a sense of deep outrage, and an affection for its characters that few other modern plays can match. It is indeed a brilliant work and a great classic of 20th century American theatre.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"By fruitfully symbolizing the objects in the Younger's living room and Mama's plant, Hansberry effectively exposes an African-American family's plight to triumph over racial prejudice and reach its ultimate dream: to own a house with a garden. The play begins by describing the setting of the tattered furniture and diminutive window, both symbolizing the Younger family and their sticky situation. The furniture's arrangement displays a since of \\"taste and pride\\", which the Younger family embodies. Although the furniture and the Younger family reveal pride, both \\"are tired\\". The description of the furniture clearly depicts the Younger family's ray of pride, and their exhaustion of \\"accommodating the living of too many people for too many years\\". Walter Younger chauffeurs a rich white man, resenting the fact that he, like the furniture, lived too long accommodating people when he could be fulfilling his own dream to own a business. Also, the soul window in the Younger's family represents their entrapment. The lack of natural light contributes to the Younger's feeling of despair. The thin beam of light that \\"fights its way\\" through the window illustrates a gleam of hope for the Younger's dream. Premonitions of hope, seen through the trickle of light from the window, prophesizes the possibility of the Youngers ability to achieve their goal. Mama's scrawny plant also represents the Younger family. Mama exclaims that if the \\"little old plant\\" never sees sunlight, it will not see spring again. Like the plant, the Youngers need light or hope to live. Both the plant and the Youngers experience darkness when living in the tight apartment. When the plant begins to fall apart, the Youngers undergo tribulation. The plant that \\"ain't never had no sunshine or nothing\\" applies also to the Younger family not having any hope or anything at all. As Mama fixes the plant so it will not get hurt along the way to the new house, Mama states that it expresses her. Mama, the matriarch of the family, strives to protect the family, which the plant symbolizes. The plant expresses her because it shows the family's fortitude to stay alive, even though faced with problems such as lack of sunlight. At the very end of the play, Mama does not fail to forget the plant, which shows the importance of the family, unified by overcoming obstacles of racial oppression. Now the plant can live in a garden filled with sunlight and the Youngers can live their dream.Hansberry represents the Youngers through the setting and Mama's plant and shows how these entities correlate with the Younger's achievement of surpassing racial friction and obtaining the American dream."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I read this play as a required reading book for my 10th-grade English class. Boring, right? WRONG! I found the story to be inspiring and emotional, and the characters realistic, multi-faceted and down-to-earth. Beneatha's loftiness, spontaneity and charming flightiness reminded me very much of my younger sister, which enhanced the realism of the book. The character of Mama was someone I would have liked to meet in real life; simple and ignorant but conventionally wise and hardworking. The story dealt with both the characters' internal and external conflicts, conflicts with money, lovers and family, which in my mind made it very interesting reading. The author writes with passionate but realistic emotion and the problems of the Younger family could easily have struck a lower middle class black family in the 1940's. A definite must-read!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I LOVED this play. It's characters we're brilliantly created. My favorite was by far Beneatha.

It seemed very Shakespearian (another timeless playwrite) in its excellent characterization, wittisisms, and shifts between funny and tragic scenes.

In this family the head of the house is the mother because her husband was dead. In this family everyone has a dream that they want to accomplish. And they all have different dreams.The mother dream was to have a happy family and a big house. She wishes to have big house to make since a family of eight living in one bedroom. So when she see that, she always want to do something about it, but she didn't have money to buy a house so they can all have their own bedroom. One of her son's dreams is to buy a liquor store. But his problem was that he doesn't have any money in his account because he drinks too much when he got money. He thinks that they can live a better life if he can open one. His mother never approved of that idea because of her religion.Beth is a student who wants to go to medical school. Her dream is to become a doctor. She thinks that there is nothing that she can do. She always tries something and fail, but she never give up. She always does different things to see if she can do it or not. One day she told to her brother about her dream, and he didn't approved it, because one she was only little girl, second, they didn't have enough money to send her to school. When he told her about what he thought of her dream, she didn't listen to his remarks because she was certain that one day she will be somebody.One of the dreamers wants to have happy family. That all she wanted. It's always something that they find to argue. When she sees that, she feels very disappointed because there wasn't a day that goes by with out the family argue over nothing. They always fight.Those are the dreams that they have. But the sad thing was that, the mother was the only one, who accomplished her dream, because the mother bought the house. She got the money from her husband insurance money. When the mother got the money the first thing that she did was buy a house in predominately white neighborhood. There wasn't any black person who lived in that area. Even if they did, the white people were bombing them. The mother wasn't afraid of any of those things because the only thing that she wanted to do was to buy the house and make the family happy. She didn't care about all racially motivated attack the family might have to face in the new neighbor.After the mother bought the house, there was extra money in her hand. So she decided to give to her son so he can put it in the bank and take it out when Beth accepted by one of the medical school for her tuition. He agreed to follow his mother's instruction when he took the money. But instead of putting the money in the bank, he chooses to talk to some people that are planning to sale their liquor store. He talked to them and gave the money to one of his friends. This guy took the money and disappear some where. Nobody could find him. When son come home and told his mother and his family about what had happened, they were shocked. They couldn't believe that he would do such silly thing. He didn't only lost the money but also destroyed the family's dream. So because the son lost the money Beth couldn't go to medical school and he couldn't buy the liquor store.The family was very disappointed in him. There was nothing they could do without any money. Finally the mother say that she no longer wants to have the house because there wasn't nothing they can buy for their new house. But the whole family told her that it's better at least to keep the house. After they suffer for a long time, they were being able to have a house with big garden.The book relates to the most of the African-American family living situation even today. We can only learn that when money (luck) comes to us somehow, we have to be careful before we jeopardize our life and our loved ones. We certain have to carefully evaluate the possibilities before we decided to invest our money. We cannot trust people in money. It is such evil thing that has been turn good people in such vicious and merciless. We should always be careful with our money."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"This book is a very eye opening book.

Few modern writers better capture the essence of racism and housing discrimination in the 1950's than Lorrainne Hansberry in this play.This play has the ability to recover and sustain ethical idealism amid the conditions society puts against African Americans at that age. It is a play about distress, futility and tragedy, but hopelessness, courage out of fear, and idealism out of fatalism. Is it possible to believe that someone can not love the vivid images and miss the strenght,suspense, and knowledge this novel portrays? Mama is the stronghold in the family becouse the father died and Walter the oldest son has not found the inner piece with him self yet. There is a cast of very few characters, with one of the Youngers appearing in every scene; Walter, the protagonist, is the main character and focal point throughout. The play also has a unity of time and place. Only a few days pass in the drama, and almost all the action takes place in the small, dingy apartment of the Youngers, located in the ghetto of South Chicago. The play is further unified by the themes of having dreams, discrimination, and pride, which are developed throughout. Another unifying factor is the use of the symbolic potted plant, which stands for the struggling Younger family and appears several times in the play. The plant, starved from sunlight yet cling for life,as are her children, encapsulates Mama's primary role as caregiver and nurturer. She also does a great job portarying simple objects like a garden plot into symbolizing a great deal. The garden plot at the new house signifies, as for Willy in Death of a Salesman, a little part of the promise land.At the end of the play, Hansberry proves that dreams really can come true, even for poor black people. Even though Walter's business deal falls through and Willy steals the insurance money, Walter comes into his manhood, standing up to Lindner and telling him that the Youngers will keep their house in Clybourne Park. As a result of his maturing, his marriage to Ruth is certain to improve, especially since she is delighted about moving into the new place. Lorraine Hansberry made it clear and picture perfect on how Walter transformed and corrected his wrong. Mama is also ecstatic that her dream of a nice place for her family is coming to fruition. Reading the story gives you a wholesome feeling and a better image of your future. Struggling through hard times. Finally, Beneatha is delighted that Asagai has asked her to be his wife and is willing to help her on her way to fulfilling her dream of being a doctor.Lorraine Hansberry developes all these themes and makes them rhyme through her use of slang and jargon.

The fact that they all were worried more about the money and what they wanted to do with thier share instead of being concerned for the grandmother and her wishes.

There's a lot of irony in that; our teacher made us read this book but would not allow us to read To Kill a Mockingbird, because she thought our parents wouldn't like us reading a book about racism! ARITS DOES deal with racism! The Younger family is compelled to live a hard life because they are black; in fact, when they finally get enough money to build a new life, they find the perfect house in a white neighborhood - and are instantly offered money to NOT move there. Last time I checked, that was considered racism.I don't see how you can compare ARITS with TKAM; some say the difference is in black and white. Maybe so, but you must take into consideration that TKAM is told through the eyes of an innocent child, and cannot be expected to have the entire harsh perspective as ARITS does. I personally thought this play inappropriate for middle-school aged children, particularly because of some choice words, but that's just me. TKAM is a better choice for younger people on the topic of racism.This play also might lose the interest and patience of the reader. The ending was very strong, as were some other parts, but on the whole the play is very verbose. There isn't really much action, just a family talking on and on about dreams that will never be, and why they won't ever be. And if that's what you're interested in, take philosophy class."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I had to read this book for an english class, but I did like it! it was an amazing use of charachters and setting, and the way they were placed into the plot was amazing. Yet previously, I had read To Kill A Mockingbord. I loved that. It is definately the best book I ever read. They both covered the idea of racism with african-americans, yet TKAMB (To Kill A...) explained it from a white childs point of view, unlike ARITS (A Raisin...). While ARITS covered many issues expierenced by any and all families, TKAM was perfect. It was just a magnificent example of american literature. I'm only 13, but I don't think there is any book even comparable to TKAM except this one. It's defineately worth your time, yet, if you haven't already read it, To kill a mockingbird, by Harper Lee is brilliant."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"For my ninth grade summer reading I was assigned to read A Raisin In The Sun. I found it funny, amusing,and very suprisingly realistic. Of all the characters, I found that Beneatha amused me the most with her willingness to try new things and make the best out of hard situations. She does not have as many lines as Mama, Ruth, or Walter, but you can tell that the storyline of the play revolves around her. This book is touching, but certainly never borring. If you have'nt read it or you want to read a play for the first time then this is a good book for you!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Incredible! One of my all-time favorites.

However, some tend to abjure this idea of Hansberry's play, they believe that her view of this lifestyle was exaggerated. The acumen of Hanberry's knowledge on the subject is lost on some, however her detailed sketch of the Younger's life shows the rest of us that this must have deeply affected her. The acerbic tone of Mama Younger when she is discussing money with her son shows Hansberry's expertise. With acrimony Walter (Mama's son) goes to his job as a driver of the rich every weekday. Hansberry's makes it clear to the reader that Walter has much antipathy towards the people he is driving around. Some may argue that in real life a chaffeur would be treated with more respect than which Walter received. However, from my experiences I've seen nothing but disrespect towards these workers. The apartment, in which the Younger's have lived for the longest time, is not a pleasant place to live. Hansberry's does an excellent job in the way she makes sure not to adumbrate the condition of the run down apartment. Some find it unrealistic that they could have been living in this ragged apartment for such a long time, and not being able to move out. This shows directly the unfair situations and poor pay that African American's received at this time in Chicago. Lorraine Hansberry's detailed play is for anyone who wished to understand the hardships of African Americans. Those who do not agree with Hansberry's interpretation of the time period are seriously misinformed. After reading this triumph Hansberry will truly have your approbation."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"All in all, this book was a lot better than I thought it would be. Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun is an excellent story about the events of a black family in Chicago. It was originally a play, so the entire book is set in script form. I enjoyed this form because the book contained more talking and less description, thus allowing the book to move along a lot faster. The main event which occurs in the book is when the family of 5 (grandmother, mother, father, son, aunt) recieve a check worth $10,000 from their grandfather's life insurance. The author conveys to the reader how each character reacts to the money and what they want to do with it. Hansberry also describes the world that the family lives in. Their world is racist, hard to succed in and full of hate. The world, along with Hansberry's excellent writing, is comparible to Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. While I was reading A Raisin in the Sun, my eighth grade class was also studying To Kill a Mockingbird. I found myself constantly comparing these two books. In A Raisin in the Sun, the point of view is that of a black person, Hansberry. Because of her ethnicity and of the time she wrote the book, her point of view is different from Lee's. Hansberry believes that black people do not have any hope in a white man's world. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the point of view is that of a white person, Lee. Lee wrote this book during the 50's, about when the civil rights movement was really starting to get strong. Lee was in support of the blacks, so she wrote a book which showed hope for them. If To Kill a Mockingbird were written by a black person, the point of view would be completely different and the message would be that of A Raisin in the Sun. Both of these books are extremely good and well written. A Raisin in the Sun is a great book about racism from a black person's point of view. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I recommend it to everybody."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"\`A Raisin in the Sun' by Lorraine Hansberry is a play that has become a true American classic. In 1959 it hit Broadway like no other. James Baldwin proclaimed, \\"never before in the entire history of the American theater had so much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on stage.\\" Since its opening, this play has garnered worldwide acclaim and spawned movies, music scores and literature.The play depicts the plight of an African-American family, the Youngers, struggling in the 1950s. The title, inspired by a Langston Hughes' poem, refers to Walter Younger's dream to make it out of the South Side of Chicago. \\"What happens to a dream deferred? / Does it dry up / Like a raisin in the sun?....Or does it explode?\\"Hansberry's realism is evidenced by the vividness and believability of the characters. They are so rich and powerful that over the years they have been portrayed only by some of the biggest names in the African-American theatrical community: Sidney Poiter, Ruby Dee, Esther Rolle, Ossie Davis, Phylicia Rashad, Audra McDonald. In 1994, I was fortunate to see the play at Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, GA starring the late Esther Rolle as Lena Younger and Kenny Leon, now director, as Walter Younger. I was not disappointed.It is not by luck that this play has stood the test of time and made its indelible mark on the pages of African American literature. Take a few moments to observe the cast of characters through the playwright's pen and see the reason why it is a classic."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"This play was also required of me on my 10th-grade English class. Boring, right? Not really. I found the story to be inspiring and emotional and the characters realistic, multi-faceted and down-to-earth. Beneatha's loftiness, spontaneity and charming flightiness reminded me very much of my younger sister, which enhanced the realism of the book. The character of Mama was someone I would have liked to meet in real life; simple and ignorant but conventionally wise and hardworking. The story dealt with both the characters' internal and external conflicts, conflicts with money, lovers and family, which in my mind made it very interesting reading. This book outlines a colorful premise on the life of an African American family and describes their fight for their dreams.Schools have been using this play to get students reading and give them different perspectives. I think this book is for all. Some language...but it's not like no one has heard any badmouthing anyway. I think that it is just a really good play too and that Lorraine Hansberry did a good job just weaving everything together. You can really relate to this story with the dilemmas and questions it rises. And it's not like anything of a complicated story either, you can really decipher it. And last I believe the author wrote from her heart, expressing herself through her work majestically and with realistic emotion regarding the problems of the Younger family could easily have struck a lower middle class black family in the 1950's.\\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" shows the importance of family values during times of racial discrimination. The book teaches us a lesson that nothing should come between family ties. It's definitely one of my favorite classic reads plus the film version featuring Sidney Poitier is great as well."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"So much has been written about this play, it's difficult to add anything else to the conversation. Suffice it to say that this is a play anyone interested in theater should be familiar with and anyone interested in being a human being MUST be familiar with. It contains so much humanity and wisdom and beauty, grafted on to the sorrow and anger love inherent in every line. Read it and see it both!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Lorraine Hansberry's play \\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" provides an in-depth view of a family struggling to achieve their dreams. It shows how a person's dreams can oftentimes be the only glue that holds a family together. The Younger family lives in a world of poverty in post World War II Chicago. Their cockroach infested home and inability to provide basic funds for the child's education really pull you into their world.To the credit of Hansberry, I found myself very frustrated at times in this novel. It seems as if every time the family grows close to escaping their situation, unfortunate events cause their dream to be \\"deferred\\" as the opening poem of the novel suggests. Every time I would begin to root for one of the characters who seem to be making strides toward improvement, they fall very short of their goal. I found the character of Walter to be the most troubling because of his inability to devise and execute a plan to provide for his family. Though I certainly do not find Walter to be a treasured literary character, he did allow me to better relate to the struggles and pressures of men who are unable to provide for their family. Walter, however, does undergo a somewhat dramatic transformation which really served to redeem him in my eyes. Raisin's imperfect cast really makes this novel a gem because of the humanity of the characters.This book is an easy read and can be well-understood by any high school student or above. I would strongly recommend this book for people who enjoy books on civil rights struggles, but more importantly to those who treasure books about the strong bond of a family's dreams."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"The play A Raisin in the Sun takes its title from a line from the classic poem by Langston Hughes that I is called &quot;A Dream Deferred.&quot; Appropriately enough, the play focuses on the deferred dreams of the Younger family, an African American family living in Chicago sometime after World War II. The family consists of Mama, Walter Lee Younger, his wife Ruth, his son Travis, and his sister Berneath. The whole family lives together in a small apartment. It is long been Mama dream to move into a house and she could finally make this a reality with the aid of insurance money from her deceased husband's policy. Walter Lee, however, wants to use the money to open up a liquor store because he is tired of working as an unrespected chauffer. Berneath--a college student--dreams of becoming a doctor and believes that some of the money should go to her schooling. Thus, although each family member believes that the money will fullfill their dreams, it actually just causes more conflicts. The ultimate theme of the play is that money itself cannot make your dreams come true. Dreams must be worked on in order for them to come true. Eventhough some dreams may never be realized, they never truely &quot;die.&quot; Instead, they allows remain in the back of your mind ever if they will never actually be realized.I found this play an enjoyable and quick read. To me, it was more appealing than plays of August Wilson, who wrote plays of a similar theme (Fences, The Piano Lesson). One good thing about the play is that although the Youngers are a black family, the theme of the play seems appealing to any audience since many families have had money problems and even more families have had dreams about life that they have struggled to fulfill."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A Raisin in the Sun is a great book.The novel dealt with a great deal of problems that a family would probably go through.This novel also showed that even though familes go through a great deal of problems,they will always stick together.I give this book two thumbs up because this book was great."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"In the book A Raisin In The Sun by Lorraine Hansberry, she talks about the younger family. This story is sometime set between World War two and the present. The wife(Ruth) and mama(Lena),they both have to work in someones elses kitchen. Lena was receiving a big check, and lenas son walter was very excited.In this story three of them have a vision. Mama vision is she wants to move to a new neighborhood.&quot;Been thinking that we maybe could meet the notes on a little old two-story somewhere, with a yard where Travis could play in the summertime.&quot; Beneatha vision is she wants to go to college. &quot;Some of it got to be put away for beneatha and her schoolin.&quot; walter vision is he wants to own his own liquor store.&quot;Yeah. You see, this little liquor store we got in mind.&quot; This story is a very good story, and I hope who ever reads this enjoys it."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A Raisin in The Sun, by Lorraine Hansberry is a powerful and captivating book. The book sheds light on many issues not only dealt with in African American families but for any American family. There are problems with racism, unemployment, living conditions, and disputes over the way money should be spent are all present in this book and plenty of people can relate to them. The characters in the book are realistic and the reader should be able to find a piece of them in one of the characters. One of the characters that stood out to me in this book was the father Walter Younger. He was a strong man but he also had many weaknesses. He would do anything for his family but that also led him to making wrong decisions that put his family in bad positions. I feel like I can relate to Walter because I know I would go to any length to support my family even if I had to do things that weren't viewed upon as morally right. I feel that this book was a great read and being able to watch the play is an opportunity that should not be missed. I would recommend this book to anyone from the 8th grade and up."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I had been looking for a raisin in the sun for a very long time and when i found it here I was very excited because the price was great.

It pulls you into its interesting story line from the beginning, and takes you on a wonderful adventure full of fun and laughter. Although the plot and theme are more mature than other plays, it was a joy to read."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"My granddaughter is starting to become socially aware, so I purchased Raisin for her. She has not read it as of yet, but I know it to be affirming and uplifting without being too scary. This is good stuff!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A good theme is the most important piece of a play, it is necessary to create a play with literary merit. This is one of the key factors that make A Raisin in the Sun an excellent play. The general theme of the play revolves around the conflicts that can arise when dreams are put on the line. The author, Lorraine Hansberry uses this theme to illuminate how selfish people can be when dealing with their dreams. This selfishness is generally not a problem; however when given the opportunity to achieve this dream people tend to loose themselves.The delivery of the theme in A Raisin in the Sun is excellent. Hansberry places opportunity and hope in one of the most unlikely families possible, the Youngers. The Youngers are an African American family living in Chicago during the 1950s. The Youngers have lived a somewhat deprived life because of the nature that African Americans were treated during the 1950s. However this is all about to change when they hear that of an insurance check for $10,000 heading in their direction. This dramatic shift in hope allows Hansberry to show the true power dreams can have over people.Hansberry does an exceptional job of displaying the desperation people can feel for their dreams. Before the check comes it is made apparent that Walter and Beneatha both have very clear and distinct dreams. Walter wishes to open a business and Beneatha wishes to go to college. Beneatha and Walter have no mind for each other's dreams. An example of this is when Walter neglects to deposit money for Beneatha's education before giving the money to Willy Harris. Through his mistake, Walter shows how dreams can get in the way of judgment and lead to desperation.Lastly Hansberry manages to wrap up the story very nicely by showing great character development. Throughout the play Walter becomes more and more conflicted with Mama as she continually rejects his proposal. As time goes on Walter loses almost all hope in life because of Mama's choice. This along with other decisions of Walter pushes the reader to lose hope in Walter. By the end the play it is revealed that Walter has given up on his dream in exchange for his family's respect. Walter giving up on his dream shows character growth because he sees the importance of the dreams of his family.In conclusion a Raisin in the Sun is a play that delivers a great theme by showing the conflicts that dreams can create. A Raisin in the Sun isn't a great play but it is exceptional as play I read in English class."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Nice book.. kind of boring... Need it for class! It was not that intersting.. The online Movie is much better"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Just as it said to be. It is a wonderful book whose main topic is dreams. I enjoyed the service. I got the book on time."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A well wriiten play that remains relevant today. I highly recommend it. It is one of those books, that you continue to think about, long after reading it. I hope to be able to see it performed live. I will have my teenage son read it as well."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Lorraine Hansberry based the title of her play on Langston Hughes's famous poem about a dream being constantly deferred. Case and point are the fictional Youngers who are about as nonfictional as you can get. They are a struggling family of African Americans desperately in need of something better than what life, or perhaps a better word would be society, has dealt them.Love is a constant in the Younger home even if it seems to be in hiding for most of the play. That threatening of love dying spurs the play forward as each obstacle beats the Youngers down into what would seem to be unyielding submission. However, throughout the play Hansberry cleverly intercedes with hopeful new dreams and metaphors such as the sun, children, and Big Walter's presence equating to hope. As the Youngers wait on the check to come in the mail of Big Walter's life long struggle to gain some money, the Youngers retain hope. But as their dreams are constantly stepped on hope becomes the last thing to die.This play not only talks about African American rights, but women's rights as well. The author touches on it briefly throughout the play to give a reminder that not only are African Americans being subjugated against, but women as well. It makes Black women the bottom of the proverbial totem pole. Not-so-surprisingly, then, she makes her female characters extraordinarily strong in this play. It also comments on ideas such as returning to Africa as a 'cure' to the desperate situation African American's must face in America. Asagai, a Nigerian man, is very secure in his identity and suggests it, but it is only briefly considered, giving a hint as to where Hansberry stood on that particular subject.Many other smaller, but no less important, nuances of the text include lost identity that is captured well in Benethea. She is divided into categories as to how an African American should look, talk, or otherwise conduct herself.As Walter, our male whirlwind of the story, struggles on his big ideas and dreams the women tend to focus on smaller, more attainable battles. While he focuses on money, they focus on love. A balance has to be reached and defiance of the 'system' needs to be established or else the threat of society will crush the Youngers and all that they represent."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"In her play, Lorraine Hansberry indirectly poses many tough-to-formulate-an-answer questions: What hapens to a dream when it suspends in time? Does its power grow and ultimately force him to act to make it happen sometime in the future-if not in his lifetime then in the future members of his kin? On the other hand, does it eat away at him, crystallizing and internally segmenting his own derived purpose and meaning of life until it is indiscernible from its original state of grandeur and grace? And perhaps more importantly than the aforesaid: Are these questions and the experiences of her Youngers only confined to them--people of &quot;their&quot; color, &quot;their&quot; ethnicity, &quot;their&quot; people?The reader will find her work truly enriching and thought provoking. She doesn't impose censures or &quot;beat around the bush.&quot; Her characters emote a sense of drive, passion, and hope that are truly at the VERY least reflections of many of our own lives.This story about dreams and what happens to them is certainly one worth reading about."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I recently read this play. Although I haven't seen it performed yet, I must say that it is certainly an excellent play that, given the appropriate actors, has the power to move the audience. At heart this play deals with dreams and racism. Some of the scenes, especially the last 5 - 10 pages will really move the readers/viewers through the skillful dialouge written by Ms. Hansberry.Overall, this is a powerful, enjoyable, moving play I'd recommend for anyone mature enough to appreciate it.As an interesting aside, in case you didn't know, the title &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; comes from a Langston Hughes poem called &quot;Dream Deferred.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"THIS WASNT A BAD BOOK AT ALL BUT IT'S DEFINTLY OVER RATED. Yeah it talks about racism and life in the 1950's, but it's not very entertaining as a book. I definitly do not agree it should be compared to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as one reviewer did. To Kill a Mockingbird did discuss racial issues but it was also very entertaining as a novel. A raisin in the sun is worth reading if you have nothing else to read, it is a quick read. However I think the whole story can be summed up by Langston Hugh's poem a DReam Deferred."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD BY HARPER LEE, about a white family having to deal with the problems of racism. A RAISIN IN THE SUN BY LORRAINE HASSNBERRY, about a black family having to deal with the problems of racism. Both books were read in my eighth grade English class and both books are related by one main idea, racism. Both books were based after World War 2, TKM in the South and ARITS in the North where racism was very alive and controlled by the white man. In ARITS the family wanted to move so they could have a comfortable life, but when they bought a house it turned out by being in an all white neighborhood. There is some discussion about not moving. In TKM if Tom Robinson and his family wanted to move into a white neighborhood there would be more than discussion there would be a decision that there would be no chance of them getting out of his black neighborhood because he would be hanged and tortured. In To Kill A Mockingbird there is a very powerful father, Atticus, who is like Mama in A Raisin In The Sun both have connections with powerless men who finally rise to the top, by becoming strong and believing in themselves. Walter Younger (ARITS) is a very stubborn black man trying to make a comfortable living for his family when Karl Linder, a representative from the white community, enters the families life and tells them that it is not a smart idea to move Walter gets very emotional and upset but finally stand up for his family. Tom Robinson has been accused of Rape of a white woman, at the time racism was very alive, even though there was not enough evidence to prove that he was guilty, and since there was an all white jury, Tom didn't stand a chance of being proven innocent. Harper Lee is a white woman writing about a white family having to struggle in a world dominated by the WHITE MAN. It seems as though Ms. Lee has hope for blacks, she shows that in the book by having Tom Robinson's trial. She knows that blacks have a chance and that they should never try to give up. Loraine Hasenberry is a black woman writing about a struggling black family who has given up hope in a world of white supremacists. In the book her characters reflected upon her thoughts by giving up hope of ever becoming anything. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who shows an interest in plays about segregation in the 1900's. I had a great time reading it and I hope you do too!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"This play does capture the African American History in America after World War II, however the characters are a bit extreme. The story ends in a bit of a tangent with Walters character completely changing. There should have been more to it.

That just made no sense to me."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"this book is a breathtaking drama that really touches your heart. it shows love between a family through tough times and how they worked together. i think that this is a really good book and that everyone should read it sometime in their lives."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Great- this book arrived on time and was in the condition that was stated.

What I liked most about this novel is the fact that it is a very realistic story. Many of the things that occur in it are real life situations. I like stories that have real life situations in them because I sometimes can relate to them or know someone who can. In this situation I can't relate to it. What I didn't like about this novel is the fact that it takes place in such a short time. The reason why I dislike stories that take place in such short amounts of time is because I feel that the author does not include enough time for changes to occur. I am use to reading books that take place over a time period of a couple years and/or just through one summer. A Raisin in the Sun, takes place in a very small apartment building awhile back. There are five family members living in the same place. On top of that, one of them expects another child. This is a family that struggles financially, like many people do in the real world. Three out of the five residents are working full time jobs trying to support the family. The other two do not work because one of them is just a kid and the other is in college hoping to become a doctor in the near future. Unfortunately this task is a lot harder than it seems because the money is limited on what they can do. The good thing is that there is an insurance check coming worth ten thousand dollars. To find out more about the money, you must read this novel. The other problem is that they want to move out of the apartment they live in and into a real house that actually has a yard to play in for the kids. After they buy the house, the next problem that lies ahead is that their new house is in an all white neighborhood . As far as books that are related to A Raisin in the Sun, I'm not really sure if there are any books that are similar to this one.

It was filled with much meaning, and the emotional drama held my attention easily.The story, a play written by Lorraine Hansberry, is centered on the Younger's, a poor African-American family living in a small apartment on Chicago's Southside sometime after World War II. The dynamic characters of the family, their relationships, and their conflicting ideas of what should be the fate of a ten-thousand dollar insurance check, combine to make a very rich, realistic, and unforgettable story.From the first scene, the tension in the family is obvious. All of the adult characters want to use the money to help achieve their dreams. Walter, Lena's son, wants to use the check to open a liquor store which he believes will help him become a man of higher class. Beneatha, Lena's daughter, wants to use it to become a doctor which will help her overcome many of the racial and sexual stereotypes she experiences as a young black woman. Lena and Ruth, Walter's wife, want to use the check to buy a house so they can be free from their wretched apartment and so that Travis, Walter and Lena's son, can grow up in a rich environment. The eventual fate of the money, their dreams, and their relationship with one another at the end of the story is surprising and it gives the story a realistic value that makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"But not great.

This play is a definate must-have for your collection."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Its incredible how this play, A Raisin in the Sun is capable of getting the reader's mind thinking of reality just as it has with mine. The way Lorraine Hansberry portrays the struggle those who live with colored skin vs. non-colored have gone through, maybe even right at this moment, establishes realization at the thought. The harsh racism being shown through this dramatic piece leaves a moral well said and awareness of cruel reality. In scene three, as Linder, the \\"Welcoming Committee\\" representative tries to explain his point, going out of his way to talk to the Younger family, he stammers out, \\"...It is a matter of people of Clybourne Park believing, rightly or wrong, as I say, that for the happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities\\" (Hansberry pg. 117-118). Although Linder lays the point down soft, the point he's tries to get out is so unreasonable and candid as someone out there might have relatively experienced. The fact of being a Negro family mustn't have anything to do with happiness of any American family. The color of a human being mustn't even be recognized as classifications in the first place. Going further along the lines, as Mama is being informed by Benetha, Walter, and Ruth of what the welcoming committee representative came for, Ruth comments, \\"Well - that's the way the crackers crumble\\" (Hansberry pg. 121). This derogatory statement, \\"cracker\\" towards Americans demonstrates that it's not only the Negros that receive the discrimination. A great deal of a hate bases somewhat equally on both sides resembling real-life situations. The veracity of hate in the world just needs to stop."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"What a great story! I had to read this for a class and i hesitated because I felt like I knew the story. I felt like it was going to be an over-exaggerated play about poor black people in a poor community trying to come up, and it was that. But, somehow there was more depth to the characters and plot than I expected. By the end of the second act, I found myself all twisted up inside the characters' conflicts and personalities because they were not much different than my own personal struggles. By the end of the play, I was begging for the playwright to give me some advice on how to quench this inner conflict within myself. This was an absolute masterpiece!"},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"My daughter needed this book for school. It was in great condition and we really needed the book in a bad way."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Lorraine Hansberry's dramatic play, A Raisin in the Sun, is about the life of an African-American family living on the South Side of Chicago in the years following the Second World War. Lena Younger (Mama) is the head of the family that includes her married son Walter Lee, his wife, Ruth, their young son, Travis and Walter's younger sister, Beneatha, who is a college student. The family is struggling to support itself. Walter Lee works as a chauffer, and Ruth and even Mama work to bring in enough money. They leave in a run-down apartment and even have to share the bathroom with other tenants.Lena's husband has died and she is about to get an insurance check for $10,000, a lot of money for those times. Everyone in the family has a dream for a better life. Walter Lee wants to buy a liquor store, Mama wants to have a house with a garden, Beneatha wants to become a doctor and Ruth just wants everyone to be happy and content. The check arrives and the drama plays out against a backdrop of racial prejudice.This play was the first drama featuring an African-American theme to play on Broadway. It has been highly acclaimed ever since. It shows basically decent people struggling against life's difficulties. It is particularly relevant now, given the recent election of an African-American (not co-incidentally from Chicago) as president of the United States. For that reason I give it five stars."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"A raisin in the sun is a good book for people to read, because you can learn more about African American drama, but this book not only talk about African America it also relates about class society, and it talk about different type of racism.This play is about a group of character that want get out of a little apartment. Mama is a really good character, she adjusted to many things in life and overcome many more, and her face. Mama get ten thousands dollars check from a companies for her husbands death she want to use this to pay schools for her daughter, but mama's son name Walter want to set up a store liquor with his friends. Everybody in the family want to spend their money in different way, and the rest of the family anticipate of using Mama money for themselves. Another character that I like is Beneatha because she was talking to Asaigai like he never understand between men and woman there is more than one feelings can exits. I also like Asaigai because he is proud his African roots and is proud of the color differences.The Character that I like especially is mama because she is strongest person in the Whole play, and she is the best.I think with out no mama the play would not be interesting, Mama give the play life I learned a lot of stuff about life from reading it. I would suggest more people to read this book."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"\\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" portrays a black American family through real life struggles and financial burden. Ongoing generations of marital conflict and racism is witnessed through the eyes of the Younger household. Mama is the faithful and benign character who clearly ranks title as matriarch of the family. Mama's veracious spirit sets a tone of warmth and compassion which cannot be compared to her moronic and harebrained son Walter. Throughout the play you witness Walter complain to his wife about living a life absent of solitude and his get rich quick schemes of becoming rich.The Younger household all agrees that nobody will stop them from carrying out Mams's dreams for a better future for her kids despite the ongoing racism they are expected to endure. Mama continues to take pride in her family and her admirable spirit of hope will touch every reader and remind them of their own dreams and ongoing struggles of life."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"\\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" is a required read to anyone who wants to learn more about the true meaning of the American dream. It not only relates to African Americans, but it also can be related to by other minorities, the lower class society, and basically anyone who seeks the pursuit of happiness in America.The play is about a hard-working lower class African American family who is trying to get out of their crumy little apartment. Lena Younger (Mama) is getting a ten thousand dollar check from an insurance company for her husband's death. She wants to use this money to buy a house for the family to live in and pay for her daughter's (Beneatha) college tuition, but Mama's son, Walter, has other plans with her money. Walter wants to open a liquer store with a couple of his no-good friends. The family's anticiapation of using Mama's money ends up tearing them apart. Everyone wants spend the money differently. The Younger family has to hit rock bottom before they notice the mistakes they have made and agree on a common goal.I especially liked the character, Mama. She is the strong willed head of the household. While reading this play I often thought about the old saying, \\"mama knows best.\\" Mama is the character who brings the family together and gives the play its life. Reading Mama's character was worth reading the play alone. I actually learned a great deal about life from reading this play and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading it."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"&quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; reads more like a novel than a play.

In particular, whenever I watch old re-runs of \\"Good Times\\" I always think of Walter, and the Younger Family, living happily, albeit not necessarily comfortably in the \\"ghetto.\\"I definitely recommend watching these old re-runs to get a feel for the play.

The book same in a timely manner and was what I expected."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Lorraine Hansberry's famous play offers raw and realistic drama. The story examines conflicts and dreams within an African American family from Chicago's South Side in the 1950's, plus the effects of racism. The family includes Walter and Ruth Younger, his widowed mother Lena, son Travis, and sister Beneatha. Walter is a hard-working chauffeur who dreams of buying a liqour store before he loses his money to a con artist. Beneatha is an ambitious college student newly attracted to the back-to-Africa philosophy of her Nigerian friend, while Lena and Ruth dream of escaping their slum and buying a house in a better area. That latter dream becomes reality via the life insurance from Lena's late husband. Lena purchases a house in a better area, at which point the all-white neighborhood tries to pay off the Youngers to keep them from moving in. We see the family separate with the expected insurance settlement, only to reunite when faced with rejection.This drama presents potent trends like resistance to integration, pan-Africanism, and militancy, but never becomes soapy or preachy. This play was first performed in 1959, as Chicago's South Side was fast turning from white to black - integration being defined by neighborhood activist Saul Alinsky as that brief period of time between when the first black family moves in and the last white family leaves. Sadly, several once-stable neighborhoods became crime-ridden slums, and cancer took Ms. Hansberry (1930-1965) at just 34. Still, her raw, realistic drama provides a powerful testament."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"I had to read this book for my senior AP english class and I was quite stunned when I realized that I actually liked it. I like to read, but not usually the books the teachers assign, and the other two books she had assigned turned out to not be all that good. I liked a Raisin in the Sun because it had just the right mix of drama, and humor. Lorraine Hansberry really knows when the drama has become too much and she adds in a little bit of humor like any great author would. I really liked the characters, especially Beneathea who I found to be especially poignant and humorous. This book did not have a greatly detailed plot, but it made up for it in the way it was presented. It wasn't supposed to be an adventure novel, so I wasn't looking for a whole lot of plot twists. I also liked the message it sent."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"It is a nice book. The characters personalities made the book good.

While some readers may find reality hard to swallow, most readers we see a reality that is too true.The Younger family is a typical post World War II black family in America. They are grateful for the end of slavery, yet the younger generation is thirsty for more freedom. As Walter sees it, this freedom comes with wealth. When Walter's father passes, the family has a chance at financial wealth through the late father's insurance policy. But a foolish investment leaves the family right where it started, in poor financial shape. Walter does have an opportunity to amend for his foolishness with the price of submitting to a white man. Walter's ulimate choice is between pride and wealth.While this play is a tense drama, few people recall the humor in this show. There are many points when I found myself laughing out loud. By any standard, this is a classic and American standard in theater and literature."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"In many ways, this play was in itself a Civil Rights Movement. Written by Lorraine Hansberry, a black woman living in the segregated and tense Chicago of the 1950's, this became the very first play written by an African-American for the Broadway stage. It was a smash hit, enjoyed and appreciated by both blacks and whites at the time for its realism, its powerful family drama and its sentimentality. Hansberry drew from her own experiences in Chicago. Her father was a landlord in the slums of Chicago and she experienced racism when she first moved to an all-white neighborhood much like the Younger Family in the play.This play is groundbreaking. It depicts something 50's audiences were not used to. For blacks, it was like seeing a slice of real life, though in some ways this play is a tad romanticized. Some of the lines are awfully real. Mama and her daughter's conversations are rather believable. The character of Beneatha is colorful and nuanced. She is an optimistic intellectual, with much pride in herself and in her African heritage, as she attests by dating Asagai, a student hailing from Nigeria. This play was first popularized by stage renditions and film with the incomparable Sidney Poitier as Walter. This play is one of the top plays of all time and deserves to be taught in English classes at the High School or College Level. Excellent."},{"Title":"A Raisin in the Sun","review":"Some might call the Youngers black; I call them black and blue. All the rage of the minority experience in America has found its way into one household, and the characters of this drama burst on stage with the sheer weight of it. The American Dream has been placed within the hearts of a people who have not the resources to make that Dream a reality -- so what do they do?What else? They fight about it.Hearts are bared; hearts are broken; hearts are emptied. And the playgoer is left there to pick up the pieces. After hearing the moving story of Walter Younger, should he give up his dream? After watching the despair of Lena Younger, should he give up his history? After watching the transformation of an American family on stage, should he sing for the exuberance of life or smash tables for its injustices?And yet, fifty years later, \\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" has wilted -- if only imperceptively. Segregation, time has proven, cuts both ways. The problems of injustice in America have not let up one bit, even as our problems of racism have steadily improved. Hansberry was not shortsighted, but this marvelous play of the 1950s does not apply quite as brilliantly to the problems of a new millenium.Nevertheless, this play should be required reading for any American who wants his rights to be respected, and occasionally has a wrong idea of how.

Other reviewers have commented on the content and writing style, which are very impressive. As a Salk Polio Vaccine vaccinated parent with a child, who became very ill with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis , I found the book very informative. My child participated in the NIH study on FSGS and tested positive for active SV40. The researcher has now lost funding for further studies that could link SV40 and FSGS.I first learned of Ms. Bookchin and Shumacher's investigation of the Polio vaccine contamination from their Atlantic Monthly article on the internet when I was searching for information on FSGS and SV40. I am pleased that they expanded that work into a very complete book. The negligence of the people, who permitted the contamination of the polio vaccine by this virus, is appalling. I am glad that this book was published, and hope that, finally, something may be done to help those who were unknowingly infected with SV40."},{"Title":"The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed","review":"You will be attracted and repulsed by the brainy people inhabiting this book. Painlessly, the the authors draw the reader into the rarefied world of medical research. Without talking down, they equip readers to fully appreciate the brilliance and boneheadedness that led to one of the greatest medical advances and public health fiascos of our time. The heart of the story is the clash between the science of heroic genius and the search for shared intelligence. This book treats you intelligently. Most of all, it is gripping story and a good read.

Bookchin & Schumacher succeed not only in piecing the history of SV40 research together to create a coherent narrative, but I had no trouble following their abstracts of the scientific research.The only thing that bugs me about their approach was how they consistently fell back on stereotypes to characterize the players involved. Sabin and Salk are both characterized as \\"bad guys,\\" which can get pretty old after several chapters. The book would have been better to leave the reader to discern the characters of the men and women by their actions. Equally annoying was the presentation of Michele Carbone as an Italian racial stereotype. It did not improve my read of the book to be subjected to such nuggets as how Carbone has a capuccino every day at 10:30.

Their brains will convince them that it is not so.Other questions it raises include: do people have a right to know the truth, even when the authorities \\"know better\\" (or are liable)?

This book tells everyone about the risks, either past or present, in vaccines. These blunders have not been dealt with by government or industry due to the economic impact that any correction might have. They (government and industry) want to scare you into vaccinating for everything because if you don't you'll get sick. Everybody please panic, so that the vaccine producers make plenty of money. Why is it that if Polio has been eradicated in the US are there still polio cases among those who have been vaccinated. How can a monkey kidney virus cause cancer in humans and why was such a dirty animal's kidney chosen as a substrate for vaccine production.This is a must read for anybody who thinks that vaccine production and development is as sound and safe as the interpretation of the bible by religious zealot. If you are going to invest your faith in anything, invest it in yourself and read this book.

There are so many ways to go with writing a review. First, there's the readability factor: Scores a 10 there - it's a page turner as others have written. I read it over the course of 3 nights and found, like others, that it reads like a thriller or perhaps even a Grisham novel - only this story is TRUE.Second, there's the important lessons for all of humankind factor: Scores a 10 in this department as well. Polio vaccine is a human invention; human beings are not infallible, they have never been infallible, and by extension there never has been nor will there ever be a human invention that is not prone to errors in human thinking, reasoning, and judgment and not subject to continuous improvements and/or great change as human knowledge advances.Despite this undeniable truth, large health organizations and government health agencies would like the public to believe a very one-sided message about polio vaccine: that it is a medical milestone worthy of great praise and worship as it has delivered mankind from the evils of the childhood affliction of polio. Amen.But that's only half the story. This book is about the other half - the one you won't read about in the press and that's about a great trade off of the polio vaccine. In exchange for reducing the rate of paralytic polio instances in childhood, has this wondrous medical marvel cut decades off many of our friends' and neighbors' lives? We all know people, some of them really great people, who died of rare and mysterious cancers in their 30s, 40s and 50s. They were diagnosed with cancer and as soon as treatments began their tumors spread fast and they succumbed quickly to their strange form of cancer. They left behind spouses, children and parents who will never be cared for by them in youth and old age.I'm not suggesting that all, most or even some of these deaths are a result of SV-40 contaminated polio vaccine, but we are not in a position at present to ever know for sure as the party-line from the organizations who are supposed to protect public health continues to be that SV-40 in polio vaccines has not been proven to cause harm to man.Please read this book and encourage other thinking people to read it too. There are many lessons that can be and should be learned from the polio vaccine history and SV-40 story. You'll also come away with new modern-day heroes who, unlike so many of the icons of today, are truly worthy of your respect and admiration. There are the scientists and researchers like Bernice Eddy, Michele Carbone and others who did and continue to do the right thing despite the many pressures to not stir up this pot. And then the biggest heroes of all in my mind are the authors for taking the time and dedicating years of their lives to accurately tell this great story...the true story that plain and simply has to be told."},{"Title":"The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed","review":"I'm glad that someone has finally gone public, really public, about the contamination of polio vaccines with SV40. I was 25 when I was diagnosed with collapsing variant Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, and immediately sought out research to try and find some help, and hope for my situation. The researcher I found is mentioned in the book as being one of the lucky few who is funded for SV40 Research. He has found the virus in a high percentage of patients with this kidney disease, including me. What the book doesn't say is that at the time he focused on SV40, he was searching for possible viral causes for the disease, and that's what his grant was for. When he sought a grant to focus on SV40 exclusively as a cause, his grant was denied.I, too, am a researcher, and will soon be attending medical school. For the most part, I have been fortunate. I have recovered fully, while most of those afflicted with this disease don't, even with transplants. It recurs in the new organ. There is no telling whether my recovery is temporary or permanent. The researcher in question has come to regard me as a colleague, and even though he has lost his funding, he firmly believes SV40 plays a role in the disease, and has the data to support it. He will not give up on trying to find further funding for research in this area. It is my hope that people will not only read this book, but also be prompted by their curiosity to read the scientific papers cited in it, as I had already done prior to even knowing this book was coming. This book is the first to compile all of the data together and to reveal the overall conclusion- An error was made in the rush to find a way to prevent polio. One can accept that error in the short term for the benefit vs. risk during the polio epidemic. However, rather than making the small effort necessary to resolve that error and create a safer vaccine, our government decided to bury the data and continue manufacture and distribution of the contaminated materials. I may not be a physician yet, but I have read the Hippocratic Oath. Here are excerpts from that oath:&quot;Above All, Do No Harm&quot;&quot;I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.&quot;&quot;I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.&quot;It is shameful that the very people who took this oath have gone to such great lengths to continue administering a preventative measure against polio known to contain a harmful virus, knowing that it can easilly be made safer, and at the same time ensuring the prolonged and painful deaths of thousands from the variety of cancers and other diseases SV40 has been indicated to cause."},{"Title":"The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed","review":"I'm not going to repeat all the great things the previous reviewers have written. It's all true. Yes, this book does become complicated, but as you continue to read on, everything begins to fall into place. I couldn't put it down. This is not an \\"anti-vaccine\\" book. It is a factual account of how the polio vaccine came to be, the harms it's done to humans, why that harm occurred and why it was allowed to continue, as well as the players involved. It was interesting to learn how the government, researchers and vaccine manufacturers are intertwined with each other. Anyone who wonders why the U.S. government would allow it's citizens to continue to receive vaccines if they were harmful needs to read this book."},{"Title":"The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed","review":"This book is an excellent resource for those who want more information about SV40.

The approach is neither wild nor hysterical but rather it is meticulous as the authors unfold the story of a nation held hostage by the seasonal polio epidemics to the truth being held hostage by scientific dogma, politics, ambition and greed.

Worse yet, the medical leaders in our government repressed research showing that this virus could cause cancer in humans. I highly recommend reading this book to find out what they did to the millions of people who were given that vaccine."},{"Title":"The Virus and the Vaccine: The True Story of a Cancer-Causing Monkey Virus, Contaminated Polio Vaccine, and the Millions of Americans Exposed","review":"This book is terrific. Despite the complexity of the subject, the writers maintain a very clear voice as they tell this compelling story. The prologue to the story instantly engaged me, as they recount the tragic story of little Alexander Horwin, who died of a medullablastoma when he was 2 years old -- a cancer that may have been caused by his exposure to a Polio vaccination.The writers give a detailed account of the history of polio and the creation of the Polio vaccine by Jonas Salk in the late 1950s. The account clearly shows what a horrible disease Polis was (and still is), and how desperate the world was for a solution. When the vaccine was created, it quickly eradicated the disease in the US. But there was a cost...and it turns out, it was a calculated risk on the part of our Federal government and the pharmaceutical companies who manufactured the vaccine. They quickly knew that the vaccine had been contaminated with live monkey virus, but dismissed the possible consequences of that contamination on the human population. (In today's world, where the CDC and the World Heath Organization are extremely concerned about viruses that go from animal to human -- like SARS and the Avian flu -- you think that such a vaccination would not be permitted. But after reading the book, you can see how science is diluted by the hard realities of immediate needs for \\"cures\\" and by the costs of manufacturing the vaccines).In the months and years after the vaccine was manufactured and injected into millions of men, women, and children, a number of concerned scientists began to gather a body of information about the dangers of the vaccine. People like Bernice Eddy, a scientist at the NIH. Her career was destroyed when she tried to alert the public. Others suffered similar experiences.This story talks about how some scientists fought against the political pressures to suppress their scientific data.

Understanding how the gospel actually creates fundamental change in a person has always fascinated me and this book has the best explanation I have encountered.

In this book, the author says the iron rod, or the word of God, is the Holy Spirit's individual instruction to each person. He says the key to finding your way to the love of God is to be perfectly obedient to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.When I read that, my biggest question by far was how to distinguish the promptings of the Holy Spirit from my own thoughts and ideas. In the section called \\"The Voices,\\" which begins on page 36 (first edition), the author teaches how to make that distinction.I typed up a few pages of the book to give a flavor of the author's teachings on the subject. I found this most helpful, although I'm still trying to incorporate it into my own life:Excerpt from Following the Light of Christ into His Presence, by John Pontius (pages 36-40)The VoicesIt is one thing to say we must follow the voice of our conscience, which is the voice of the Lord within us. It is quite another to be able to clearly distinguish it from the other voices we hear. Toward that end, let us cast some light upon the other voices. Elder James E. Faust had this to say about the voices we hear:\\"But we hear other voices. Paul said, 'There are... so many kinds of voices in the world...' (1 Cor. 14:10) that compete with the voice of the Spirit. Such is the situation in the world.\\" (Faust, \\"Voice of the Spirit,\\" 7; ellipses in original.)There are three main sources of voices in a healthy mind. The first is the voice of your own mind. You hear yourself think. You talk with yourself, discuss things with yourself, argue with yourself, berate, praise, and jabber with yourself all day long. This voice is distinguishable because it is unsure, or in other words, it questions things, and is seldom definite or decisive. It almost always asks questions. \\"What was that? Who said that? Why did you say that? What does it mean? Do you suppose? What would happen if? I wonder?\\" Even when it is emphatic, it leaves open the possibility of change. \\"I'm definitely going to bed now--Okay?\\" \\"I'm going to town--if the car will start.\\" You will notice that this voice usually takes the personal case; \\"I think I should fast today.\\" The Holy Spirit would have said, \\"Fast today.\\"The second voice comes from Satan's realm. It is unlikely that we receive much attention from the king of that kingdom personally. Rather, we deal with his minions, his messengers, and tempters. These beings have been in the business of tempting mankind as long as the earth has existed, perhaps longer. They are undoubtedly very skilled and highly motivated. Each have probably tempted thousands of people like ourselves. They have spent thousands of years of intimate contact with mortals. They have much more experience with tempting mortals to sin than we could possibly have in resisting it. They know the subtleties and tricks necessary to entice and trick us into failing. They undoubtedly specialize in their work, meaning that certain of them specialize in anger, marital infidelity, family disharmony, murder, drugs, illness, depression, hate, or a million other maladies, sins, and vices. Once successful, they linger year after year with those they afflict.When we hear a voice from this source, it will be cleverly disguised and enticing. It will appeal to the natural, carnal, sensual, and devilish side of us. There is real intelligence in the message, and malice aforethought. They plan and plot against us, and their messages are carefully chosen.\\"The adversary tries to smother this voice [of the Holy Spirit] with a multitude of loud, persistent, persuasive, and appealing voices: murmuring voices, conjuring up perceived injustices; whining voices, abhorring challenge and work; seductive voices, offering sensual enticements; soothing voices, lulling us into carnal security; intellectual voices, professing sophistication and superiority; proud voices, relying on the arm of the flesh; flattering voices, puffing us up with pride; cynical voices, destroying hope; entertaining voices, promoting pleasure seeking; commercial voices, tempting us to 'spend money for that which is of no worth' and our 'labor for that which cannot satisfy...' (2 Nephi 9:51), and delirious voices, spawning the desire for a 'high'... [which is] death-defying experiences for nothing more than a thrill.\\" (Faust, \\"Voice of the Spirit,\\" 7.)A prompting from this source will nearly always be stated as an absolute. \\"Don't let him get away with that. I'm too tired to pray. You deserve better. Pay him back. No one will notice. It should be yours anyway--just take it. She's your wife--not your mother. Football only happens once a year, the church can get along without you for one Sunday. She wants you--it's only natural. He loves you more than your husband, how can you not love him back?\\"These promptings will always lead us away from the truth. They prompt us to disobey, not to pray, to abandon church assignments and family responsibilities, to commit sin and walk in forbidden paths. They do not limit themselves to voices alone. They can draw from the trash stores in our minds to dredge up memories which will either lure us away from purity and virtue, or keep our minds harrowed up with vivid memories of our sins--even after we have repented of them.The evil ones cannot read our minds or hear our silent prayers. It seems they hear what the Holy Spirit says to us, for they respond immediately. When the Holy Spirit prompts, \\"Say your prayer,\\" you immediately hear, \\"Don't say prayers, you're too tired.\\"\\"Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart.\\" (D&C; 6:16.)They cannot force us to do anything, unless we yield to them, and value our inability to see them. They can tell when a temptation excites or repels us. They are most successful in half-light, half-truths, and half-hearted people. Their tools are limited, but they use what they have with great effect. They have destroyed millions of souls, and you are simply the next on their list. They are confident, efficient, successful, and they hate us with unimaginable intensity. From their perspective, they are engaged in an all-out war against us. Our perspective barely includes a realization they exist, and certainly no thought of an all-out war against us. It is no wonder they win so frequently. Yielding to the enticings of Satan's minions will have the opposite effect of yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit. Any time we receive a prompting to do wrong, or disobey, it comes from Satan's realm.One of their weaknesses is that they can rarely voice just one lie. While the Holy Spirit generally prompts us only once, the tempters often voice many objections to each prompting. The Holy Spirit may prompt us to call everyone to family prayers. Thereafter, the evil ones suggest many reasons why we should not obey. \\"Everyone is tired. They will complain. You don't feel like it. The wife is already in bed. It's late. It's useless. You can do it tomorrow.\\" This is actually one of the ways we may discern the voices. The Holy Spirit whispers truth, and thereafter, the opposition tirades against it.The third source of information in our minds is the voice of the Lord through the Holy Spirit. It begins as the conscience, the light of Christ, and is a free gift. In its most rudimentary stages it is a quiet urging to choose right, to abandon wrong choices, and to seek greater truth. This voice grows in content and quality as one heeds it direction until it becomes a significant guide, and measure of truth. Following baptism and the bestowal of the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit assumes greater power and authority, and though remaining still a still small voice it becomes a comfort, guide, and source of great strength as we learn to obey it.This voice always entices to do good, to believe, serve, pray, and repent. It nearly always prompts contrary to where you were headed. If you were lying under the car Sunday morning, it would tell you to go to church. If you were already on your way to church, it would prompt nothing, but would give a feeling of comfort and satisfaction.The voice of the conscience is easy to recognize, because it is the only one of the three which prompts to do good. These promptings come as absolute statements. The Holy Spirit would say, \\"Fast today.\\" Your mind would have said, \\"I wonder if I should fast today,\\" or \\"Perhaps I should fast.\\" Any time you have a prompting to do good, it has come from God.We have been talking a lot about promptings. Perhaps even the term needs clarification. A prompting is information which originates outside one's mind. The Holy Spirit prompts to do good, the devil prompts to do evil. Our minds consider and analyze the promptings, and make decisions concerning them. These promptings all appear, and sound, exactly like our own thoughts. The only way to differentiate between them is the way we have already discussed. Good comes from God. Evil comes from the adversary. Questions and analysis come from within. It really is just that simple.[By the way, if you would like to read how this book came about, you can read the author's blog post about it at [...](or search for \\"unblog\\" and \\"how ftl came to be\\").]"},{"Title":"Following the Light of Christ Into His Presence","review":"The author pointed out things I had never thought about.

I have purchased many copies as gifts and many who have received those gifts are now giving copies to others. Brother John has a great style of writing that draws the reader into his experiences of following the promptings of the Spirit that will allow you to believe you can have those experiences also. And you can. I have done so and many others have also. If you want to be closer to the Savior, even to the point of coming into His presence, then this is a great book to learn that process.There are few books available that will teach you how to do this through the examples and directions that Br. Pontius explains and he invokes the scriptures that for many, are not so clear because we tend to doubt they could happen to us. But if you believe that these things can, and do, happen in our day then they can happen for you as well.But don't take my word for it. Get this book and let the Spirit testify to you that it works.

This book belongs to a very small and select group: Texts that I feel honored to have read."},{"Title":"Following the Light of Christ Into His Presence","review":"When Family members first told me about this book, I admit I was a bit skeptical. The title sounded like a book about near-death experiences. But I'm glad I overcame that obstacle and read it anyway.While Pontius humbly acknowledges that this is his own work, and not a declaration of Church doctrine, I think he has has done an increadible job of clarifying the role of the Holy Spirit and it communicates with us on an individual basis. He makes a few statements that are certainly opinion, and not scripturally justifiable, (I.e. &quot;[The spirit] nearly always prompts contrary to where we are headed.&quot;), but, on the whole, it is doctrinally sound and extremely enlightening.I see only three main drawbacks to this book, and they are superficial: 1) The cover art is unattractive, 2) There are numerous typos, and 3) The title may scare some awayIf these three things could be changed (and they easily could be), then this book could and should certainly be recognized as one of the great classics of LDS literature."},{"Title":"Following the Light of Christ Into His Presence","review":"John Pontius is a very gifted writer, but even more gifted in understanding of the fundamental precepts of gospel truth.Pontius' book cogently addresses spiritual advancement rooted in Christ.

There is an honest, earnest quality in it which persuades me that Brother Pontius is not interested in setting himself up as a teacher or leader, but is sincere in his aim to help as many others as possible enjoy greater blessings than we presently do. I just finished reading the book this morning, after plodding through it for 6 months. I'm glad to have read it this way, because there is much in it that could be called redundancy. However, the redundancy is necessary and helpful.I am interested in the comments of a few who say they have \\"followed the steps and seen great results.\\" I am not one who has enjoyed much success in making a list of what to do and then doing it with a certain result. Thankfully, it seems Brother Pontius speaks to both kinds. For me the great message is to let go, to cast the burden on the Lord, and let Him redeem us. I've been living for 50 years and unable to do it myself, unsuccessful at the checklist approach to life. These teachings give me hope that my greatest problems can be solved, and greatest desires can be fulfilled--problems and desires struggled with since my youth--and not just in the next life, but in this one. This is something I had nearly given up trying to expect.Thank you, Brother John, for listening and writing as prompted.The stories that were told at the beginning of the book were beautiful--the one of the man who was prompted to prepare to give a blessing, and the one of the man who worked with drill bits.

He goes on to reference Washington D.C., The Smithsonian, Sam Vaughn, Virgil himself and other things that have nothing to do with the actual work; this creates a meaningless time-void/warp within work.

His description of the methods, techniques and aircraft in the (English) Bomber command and the (American) USAAF is clear and entertaining. He puts some emphasis, rightly in my view, on the German effort to thwart the bombing war's aims and vividly illustrates (German) general Kammhuber's successful tactics. The stupidity (with hindsight perhaps) of sending bombers into Germany with no fighter escort until early 1944 (when the long range Mustang P-51 fighter became available), because the brass had decreed several years before that \\"the bomber will always get through\\" needlessly cost their lives to many crews and the point is not lost on the reader. By necessity, telling the story of bombing raid after bombing raid could be tedious, but Mr. Neillands makes up for that with frequent and often moving stories from the men who actually fought that war.I enjoyed the book but Mr. Neillands's insistence in defending Air Chief Marshal (\\"Bomber\\") Harris's memory and his somewhat lengthy and convoluted arguments over the Dresden tragedy or the \\"morality\\" of the bombing war are a bit disappointing. One is left wondering about the point of the exercise: war is cruel and immoral by necessity. Should we really keep debating whether Dresden was a \\"legitimate\\" target and whose \\"responsibility\\" it was almost seventy years later? Was it \\"moral\\" for Nelson to catch the French unaware at Trafalgar?"},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Here is an in-depth survey of the Allied bombing campaign over Europe in World War II. It's still striking to read of all the turf wars, infighting, doctrinal differences, stubbornness, and all-around friction that were behind this massive effort.Throughout, there are plenty of technical details concerning the aircraft. The stories of the P-51D Mustang, the Norden bombsight, and the B-17 Flying Fortress will all be familiar to military buffs, but are still intriguing nonetheless.This was the high-tide of the doctrine of Air Power, and with hindsight it seems that air marshals overestimated the power of longe-range bombers to affect the War. The skill and bravery of the men behind missions like the Ploesti raid are beyond praise, but their tangible effects turned out not to be decisive. In fact, when strategic bombers were used in tactictal operations in France, to help the bottled-up armies break out of their salients, one might argue that this use was more productive. But, of course, there was no way to know any of this beforehand.The author wraps up with Dresden and its moral repercussions, and also with the revisionist reevaluation of the bomber war. His point in brief is that everyone thought it necessary to hit the Germans as hard as possible with everything to hand, and that we've got the whole rest of history in which to second-guess those decisions. In one personal note, he notes that the Germans destroyed the City of London so thoroughly that he, the author, practiced wargames in its ruins as a Royal Marine in 1952. One comes away with a renewed appreciation for the brave aircrews, and for the knotty task of Bomber Command and the USAAF, who had no 100% good way to fight the Good War."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Took a bit to get through this book. The information provided regarding the tactics and technology used during the various phases of the war was well presented. It was very interesting to read how the human element played in the development of the tactics and testing of them.The interviews and sections provided by various people was very interesting. The reports from those under the bombers, those who felt and experieneced the effects first-hand, were astonishing. These reports truely tell the tale. The crews accounts also were great, as those who were there are able to recount the sights, sounds, and experiences. We need to do more to document as much as possible of those in the skies before the generation is lost.The ending of the book where he seeks to defend the Dresden raid wasn't really in line with the rest of the book. I enjoyed the blending of historical facts, numbers, and personal accounts throughout, but the ending didn't quite fit as he devoted an awful amount of time and effort to Harris.Overall a good addition to anyone's collection of WW2 bomber library."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Four stars for this thoroughly researched and eminently readable book. It is also pleasing to note on this page that veteran flyers and relatives of such find this book to be accurate and respectful.Neillands uses a wide variety of documents to examine the way strategic bombing developed as a tool of warfare, describes how technology evolved and likewise traces the way in which the allies constructed their policies on this aspect of the war. It is all fascinating.One thing that Neillands always does very well is the incorporation of veterans' recollections into his work. This is accomplished without appealling to emotion and depicting images of blood & guts like in Ambrose's books, that goes without saying. Rather he simply relays the stories of men getting on with their jobs and leaves the reader to construct his/her own emotions.Morality? Civilians died in their tens of thousands, but all war is immoral.The late Robin Neillands does have a tendency to be a little repetitious in his books, and I do feel that a couple more maps night have been useful here - hence one star docked. Nevertheless, this book is a significant achievement and quite rightly champions the crews who died and endured.Finally, post-war the politicians involved in developing bombing policies and directives (including Churchill) failed to put their hands up when the accounting was done, allowing the prosecutors, men like Harris and his crews to shoulder the opprobrium.........things don't change. That Churchill refused to sanction a campaign medal for Harris's men of is a black mark against his name. Fighter Command received due adulation in 1940, it is a scandal that Bomber Command have not been sufficiently honoured"},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Neillanos is open that he wrote this book to defend the British leaders of the bomber campaign, above all Arthur Harris, the chief wartime commander of the RAF Bomber Command.

He includes a fairly extensive discussion of what the US Eight Air Force did insofar as it is necessary to explain what Bomber Command did, and to clear up several myths about differences between the RAF and the USAAF.This book has almost nothing to say about the experience of the majority of the people involved in The Bomber War, the tens of millions of Germans, French, Dutch, British, and Japanese people who suffered under Allied, Nazi, Italian, and Japanese bombing during the Second World War. This book discusses them only in regard to the wrangling of military chiefs or the lives of the flight crews. For that story I highly recommend _Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945 by Frederick Taylor_, _The Night Tokyo Burned by Hoito Edoin_ and _To Destroy a City: Strategic Bombing and Its Human Consequences in World War II_ by Hermann Knell. Each one of them can be reached by clicking on the links to my other reviews above this comment.What Neillanos is good at and what he really seems interested in is explaining the real lives of Allied flight crew. The book is laced with many descriptions of bombing missions, life on the bases, the training regimen, and other features of the lives of aircrew of both the RAF and the USAAF, all in the words of British, American, and German aircrew. You find out more of what the missions were really like for the men flyign the planes.This book also provides a clear account of the various bombing campaigns, aircraft, technical equipment, and tactics used by the US, British, and German air forces in Western Europe.Neillanos is good at detailing the technical and organizational development of Bomber command and its tactics. However, Neillanos is self-contradictory and unobjective because in broader discussion he clings to a defense of Arthur Harris's determination to continue following the \\"Bomber Dream\\" first put forward by Italian air power theorist Douhet.The idea was that bombing cites, killing people, and demoralizing the enemy in war time would produce so much political dissatisfaction with a war, that it would force the enemy government to cease war or be overthrown. Bombing alone without support from land or naval actions could win a war. Harris and his colleagues believed that by terror bombing the cities of Germany, they could force an end to the war. They even believed that land invasion or bombings aimed at strategic military targets or purely economic targets like oil or transport were diversions from this.Despite claims made especially by the USAAF and crack \\"precision\\" units of the RAF, WWII bombers were incapable of serious precision bombing of anything without overwhelming losses. It was a constant struggle to lead the bombers to the right cities, let alone to hit precision targets without special efforts. The RAF Bomber command learned this after the first two years of WWII. They then changed their strategy to aim at massive destruction aimed at setting entire cities alight in firestorms. Their models were the Nazi blitz, particularly the small firestorm raid against Coventry, England in 1940. While exception and horror has been raised by the bombings of Hamburg in 1943 and Dresden in 1945, these were not exceptional. They were simply successes at what Bomber Command hoped to do every time it hit a major German city with a heavy raid. You will not learn this in Neillanos's book but Taylor and Knell's books tell that grisly story.Harris was so extreme that even Neillanos has to admit that by the fall of 1944 he had been proven wrong and needed to relent. Yet, Neillanos simply ignores evidence that was developed in the strategic bombing survey carried out by the US government at the close of the war and several years after, that the political impact of the bombing was to harden Germans against the allies, and to embitter some who opposed Hitler and the war against an Allied victory. Neillanos simply ignores the fact that these bombings were relatively ineffective in damaging military and economic targets, even though they killed hundreds of thousands of Germans and other Europeans and nearly tens of thousands of Allied aircrew.Neillanos is right to show that despite public relations attempts to distance themselves from British terror-bombing, particularly after world uproar after the February 1945 bombing of Dresden, the United States Eighth Air Force came to the same conclusions and carried out raids with the same results. He is particularly vociferous in pointing out that the US air force bombers cooperated with the RAF in the bombing of Dresden, and bombed Dresden for several days after the British night bombing of February 13, 1945. Showing the USAAF was no better than the RAF, he explains how P-51 fighters that escorted US Bombers would swoop down and attack fleeing civilians and firefighters at Dresden and elsewhere.At the end of the book Neillanos embarks on an embarrassing attempt to defend Harris's terror bombing tactics morally and militarily. His arguments are all over the place and completely inconsistent. The author has already explained that Harris considered bombings with military targets or with transport or oil targets to be diversions from simply slaughtering Germans and destroying their homes (\\"dehousing\\" being the term Bomber Command used). Yet in his defense of Harris Neillanos tries to take credit for raids with economic or purely military targets that Harris was forced to carry out by his superiors. Likewise, while Neillanos uses the amount of German resources involved in shooting down the bombers, fighting the fires, and clearing cities to justify the terror bombing, he says nothing about what the resources that went into the terror Bombing campaign could have been used for. Approximately 10 thousand British and American strategic bombers were shot down. The majority of crews were killed, captured, or wounded, leaving more than 100K aircrew casualties. These figures do not include aircrew from the tactical air forces that worked directly with the Allied armies and navies bombing targets on the battlefronts.Yet, the real point is the indifference of the imperialist British and American governments to the lives of the working people of Germany, or for that matter, to the lives of the aircrew. In this regard they were no different than the German imperialists who prosecuted the war at such a heavy price to their own population and carried out massive atrocities including terror bombings of their own.The real question is the replacement of the capitalist system that engenders insane rivalries for control over the world between plutocratic governments of \\"democratic\\" or fascist nature."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"_The Bomber War_ by Robin Neillands is a fascinating, comprehensive, and well-written overview of the entire bomber war against Germany during World War II, covering both British (RAF Bomber Command) and American (largely the USAAF Eighth Air Force) forces as well as the German defenders.Neillands originally set out to refute what he saw as a growing mythology that portrayed Bomber Command in general and Air Chief Marshall Sir Arthur Harris in particular as being guilty if not of war crimes than at least of an immoral war, and that their area bombing of German cities was wholly unnecessary and that precision bombing should have used instead.Though Neillands went well beyond these questions in writing this book, he did in my opinion refute these allegations quite thoroughly, showing that the bombing was both moral and necessary and also that precision bombing was difficult if not impossible.First of all, Allied leaders were well aware of the moral implications of what they were doing and early on did strive to avoid civilian casualties; Neillands detailed early efforts by the British and later by the Americans when they entered the war to avoid attacking any target that might result in civilians injuries.Unfortunately, as the war dragged on, civilian deaths became unavoidable. To an extent some of this was from an erosion of concern; leaders and air crews just wanted the long hard war to end and anything within reason that brought that end even one day closer was an option. There was also a firm belief in the \\"Bomber Dream\\" (particularly with Harris), that a successful bombing campaign could bring the horrors of war to the German people and induce them to force their government to sue for peace as well as destroy the war-making capacity of Germany.The main reasons though that civilians were bombed were technical, weather, and enemy defense problems, ranging from frequent cloud cover and adverse weather in Europe, industrial haze over many targets, technical problems with radar bombing technology, navigational problems, fierce and growing fighter and flak opposition, and lack of fighter escorts for much of the war, all leading to often fantastically inaccurate attacks. If one worried too much about not hitting civilians by accident, many important targets would have enjoyed weeks or even months of respite from attacks. Allied leaders quickly discovered that if one worried about hitting civilians, one could not bomb Germany at all.I was surprised at how inaccurate the bombing could be. Very early in the war British bombers had great difficulty even finding the cities they were supposed to bomb owing to a lack of good navigational training and equipment. Even once they found the cities they had real trouble hitting the target; one British study of 1941 concluded that only one in three bombers dropped their bombs within five miles of the target! Since the inquiry decided that the target area had a radius of five miles, this meant that bombs were being dropped in a 75 squire mile area around the target. Even the Americans as late as 1945 admitted in their official histories that an average circular probable error of two miles existed when using radar bombing methods, and could only achieve any effectiveness by \\"drenching the area with bombs.\\"The United States prided itself on its attempts at daylight precision bombing, but was not able to really achieve this to any degree until 1945. Its prewar precision-bombing doctrine proved fundamentally flawed thanks to misconceptions about what the bomber could achieve in combat, frequent cloud cover and haze over targets (rendering their vaunted Norden bomb sights useless), deficiencies in radar bombing methods, and lack of fighter cover (not remedied until the advent of P-51 Mustang fighters in 1944, capable of long-range escort).Neillands firmly concluded that the bomber war was vital to the Allied victory. In addition to the tremendous damage done particularly in the latter years of the war, the bombing campaign opened a Second Front well before the invasion of Europe, tying down vast resources to fend off the bombers. Goering had to deploy 8,876 very useful 88 mm flak guns to fight off the bombers (Rommel's Afrika Korps only had 35 of these guns, which were quite effective against tanks). To man these guns (as well as 25,000 pieces of 20 mm and 30 mm canon) Germany required 900,000 soldiers (Rommel's army for the defense of Normandy only had 500,000 men). Similarly, many pilots and aircraft that could have been used to attack Russia or the United Kingdom were tied down defending the Reich.The book as I mentioned is quite comprehensive and dealt with a number of other topics relating to the bomber war. The operational histories of both the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command are covered, as well as the evolution of bombers in both countries, not only in terms of design, engineering, and the service records of the various aircraft used, but also in terms of bombing philosophies, as Neillands explained for instance why the Americans even well before the war focused their energies on precision bombing as well as the wrong lessons learned by pilots used to North American terrain and climate, lessons not serving them well in Europe. Also fascinating were the differences in structure, culture, morale, and training between American and British forces and the series of measures, countermeasures, and counter-countermeasures developed by Allied and German scientists in terms of radar, radio, and navigational aids, as one country produced an innovation that was then countered by the other nation, which sought to counter that countermeasure.One of my favorite things about the book were the many quotes and anecdotes provided by those who served in the war, their words painting vivid and fascinating pictures of life from the point of view of Bomber Command and Eighth Air Force air crews as well as from Luftwaffe pilots, German flak gun crews, and those on the ground who experienced the end result of their bombing raids."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Hello,Excellent book, Niellands put you really back into the mindset of times we never hope to encounter it again.Furthermore it offers an excellent analysis of the &quot;we were victims&quot; version of WW2 which is gaining popularity in Germany.Niellands also doesn't spare Bomber Command and the USAAF regarding tactics and results.Niellands ask the obvious questions, &quot;historians&quot; out on anti Harris mission fail to ask. A must read for someone who seriously wants to learn about WW2 events, or someone who just wants to read an original analysis of these horrible times."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Nothing new here, except the fact that, in the writer's opinion, Butcher Harris was a great guy, just trying to make the war end faster... What a nice fellow Harris was...One thing was to believe that destroying german cities and killing their civilians by the thousands was a good way to shorten the war and, doing so, spare the lives of thousands of Allied men. Another completely different thing is TO ENJOY doing it, as Harris apparently did!"},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"This is an excellent book. Whether or not you agree with the author's view, the work is well-researched and well-written. Bombing planes were used in World War Two by the Germans, British, and Americans to destroy factories and other targets in an effort to reduce the enemy's ability to wage war. Neillands covers the history of such strategic bombing from its earliest use in World War One to the 2000-plane raids of 1945. He comes to some interesting conclusions.The first is that bombing is messy. I flew over Germany in a four-engine, B-17 heavy bomber in the winter and spring of 1944. During training, we were told that our precision bombing would only hit factories, sparing civilian areas. But I quickly saw that our load of bombs scattered all over a city, despite our best efforts to be accurate. Women and children were certainly killed.Neillands' also concludes that the American boast that its B-17 bombers could fight their way alone to a target was false. He was so right. German fighters destroyed our bombers by the hundreds and killed huge numbers of American flyers. Five members of my crew were killed and two, including me, were wounded. It was only when hundreds of P-51 fighter planes became available to escort the bombers that the slaughter of aircrews lessened.Probably Neillands' most controversial argument is that German cities, including Dresden, were bombed to destroy factories and other strategic targets, not to destroy centuries-old buildings. Aircrews have been villified by people who should know better for bombing cities. The aircrews were not the bad guys. Whether they were German, British, or American, they had no choice. It was fly or face execution. The bad guys in war are not the soldiers, sailors, or airmen. The bad guy is the one who started the war, whether it was World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, or Iraq.General Sherman said, \\"War is hell,\\" and he was so right. Neillands' careful research shows how bad it was for the civilians on the ground and the flyers in the air. For a picture of what the decision to wage war brings, this book is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"The wildly different reviews of this book I suspect reflect politcs not judgement. As usual with books on subjects like this one.This is a pretty straightforward account of the \\"bomber dream\\" as practiced against the third reich. It rarely strays beyond that scope. It is a useful corrective to the bombers-were-useless nonsense and a readable narrative."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"As the son of a flier who flew two tours in Halifax bombers during the offensive against Germany, I must say that a book taking this position is long overdue. War is a terrible, but necessary undertaking to protect civilized society from barbarians, whether it is the Nazis or the fanatical Islamic terrorists we are experiencing today. Any book which sets the record straight to counter all the left wing propaganda which attempts to paint allied fliers as murders is welcome. May garbage like the C.B.C.'s \\"Valor and the Horror\\" eventually be forgotten. These men deserve to be remembered with honor and respect. Thanks for writing this book."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"As head of RAF Bomber Command, Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris became one of the most controversial figures of World War II. While most of the men he commanded respected him, his advocacy of saturation bombing and the infamous fire raids on Dresden and other German civilian targets caused much controversy postwar, if only muted concerns were expressed during the war itself. Yet for author Robin Neillands it seems quite preposterous that critics of RAF Bomber Command and Sir Arthur Harris can pose the question, \\" Does a state of war really justify the killing of defenseless civilians?\\"......well, yes , in the case of Nazi Germany, yes it does ..it frankly beggars belief that people can think there possibly be any other response even if admittedly there was an element of retribution in the punishment meted out to the German civilian population...Harris took a demoralized and dispirited RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and built it up into a most formidable force that played a vital role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. The author points out that the policy of night-time area bombing designed to destroy the cities that served as the locations of the German war industries was decided upon before Harris became Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command. Within a few weeks, he put together the extremely risky Operation Millenium, the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne, whose success proved to sceptics the power and effectiveness that Bomber Command was capable of wielding. Although it really took another two years to make the bombing campaign really effective, it has been proven beyond a doubt that German war production was severely damaged by the bombing campaign; the comments of Albert Speer, Hitler's Armaments & Production Minister emphasize this point.RAF Bomber Command were the much vaunted Second Front; even as early as 1941 over 500,000 Germans were manning anti-aircraft guns in the cities.....a considerable number of these could perhaps have been fighting soldiers at the front...against the British in North Africa or against Stalin's Russia in front of Moscow...The book is a riposte to those that would heap opprobrium on the entire theory of strategic bombing in WWII and the wholesale slaughter of civilians specifically.....this is a moral viewpoint, the luxury of which was denied the British in 1940.......of course bombing erodes humanity but we were fighting a regime that was slaughtering millions of civilians in death factories.....Our American reviewers conveniently forget that the British were on their own against the might of Nazi Germany for nearly two years between the fall of France and Pearl Harbor....sitting back on the defensive, ie not bombing civilians was NOT an option... Neillands reserves his sharpest barbs are for those politicians (Churchill included) and senior military planners that made policy and knew full well that wide-area terror bombing was the only avenue available to Bomber Command. Neillands also correlates Bomber Command's policy and operations with that of the USAAF, who, he writes, also hid behind a pretense that collateral casualties were a regrettable but unavoidable tragedy of war. The British also tried surgical strikes with their cadre of highly capable precision bombing units, such as 617 Squadron's Dambusters.. ironically in view of the arguments for precision strikes, destroying the dams was ultimately an object in laying waste to an entire region. Quite simply the technology to do anything else was not available..Of course the Yanks were just as eager to bomb the big German cities and especially Berlin as the Brits had been and the USAAF tried any number of times from March 1944 when they felt sufficiently strong enough to do it. The hypocrisy of THEIR position was laid bare following the continued slaughter of unprotected German cities in 1945 long after everyone knew that the bombing would make no difference to the outcome or even pace of the war. It became bombing just for bombing's sake, or in the case of Dresden, showing the Soviets what Anglo-American air power could do; slaughtering refugees fleeing from the advancing Soviet horde. Neillands argues that the moral repugnance that is increasingly attached, almost wholly, to RAF Bomber Command serves unfairly to exonerate the Americans who continue to protest that theirs was a precision campaign; the truth is that the USAAF were still carrying out large scale raids as late as April 1945 until they finally called a halt when there were no worthwhile targets left to hit....and of course in the Japanese theatre the Americans went on to unleash the \\"area-bomb\\" par excellence in the form of the nuclear weapons that devastated two cities and which significantly for the critics of area bombing brought about the Japanese capitulation....even the Germans recognised that a few more attacks like those which razed Hamburg in July 1943 killing tens of thousands in huge firestorms could have potentially ended the war there and then...."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"It's been always embarassing to review Neillands' books, as normally his work are subpar and should not be taken seriously. Displaying a true lack of knowledge in the subject, especially the technical side of it, the author has written a largely fogettable book."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"I won't explain what this book is about. Others have done that much better than I could. I bought this book because I love reading about the WWII avaition campaign involving B-24s and B-17s. In saying that, I was disappointed in this book. Neillands discusses the strategic and tactical use of bombers during the war and their effectiveness in bombing targets. This book doesn't offer much of a perspective from the American point of view. The USAAF comes across as &quot;second stringers&quot; in this book. Neillands gives the impression that the British Bomber Command were the ones running the air war.Most of the text is devoted to missions flown by the RAF with supplemental references to the USAAF. In that respect, the book was more about Bomber Command than it was the &quot;Allied Air Offensive&quot;.Neillands criticizes the air effort as, perhaps, unnecessary since the bombing was not very accurate. He gives the impression that the RAF and the USAAF succeeded in spite of themselves!The book is worth reading one time but I would not read it again. Secondly, I don't think the issue of morality deserves a discussion in this book. The RAF and the USAAF did what was right at the time and we should not discuss history with today's moral views.If you are interested in reading anecdotes about the air crews, stick to Roger Freeman's books or Stephen Ambrose."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Being a pilot myself and interested by WWII, I naturally bought this book. The author surely made an extensive research on the subject but I found the book pretty labourious to read. He constantly repeats himself, he often mentions that he will talk about a subject later in the book, and, worse, the chronology is not always respected: sometimes we go backwards two years, so it is hard to understand the evolution of the bomber war.The description of the various electronic aids (Gee, H2S, Freya...) shows that the author hardly understands what he is talking about, although the aids were key to the precision of the bombings.In terms of organisation, a chart showing the structure of the bomber command with the various groups and squadrons would have saved pages of blabla. A map of Europe, UK with airfields (I doubt that readers can figure out where a countryside airfield in UK can be located), and Germany with the main cities would have helped, as well as a concise list of the missions, given the fact that the author doesn't follow a chronological order.All in all, I found very deceptive that a good base of information is so badly organized, as if the book were not finished. The author could have done a much better job with at least 100 pages less. Simply put, the author didn't put himself in the reader's shoes.On the positive side, personnal stories give a more lively account rather than dry statictics. The fact that the author could get testimony of so many people directly involved in the war more than 50 years after its end is remarkable: this will be hardly feasible in 10 years.Also remarkable is the fact that the author crosschecked information between allied and German sources, and we are amazed by the descrepancies about the real damages (target destroyed and planes shot down).I won't enter the polemic of who (RAF or USAAF) did the best job or had a leading role, I think the book is pretty well balanced in that respect. There will always be people on one side or the other but all in all the book presents the contribution of everyone (US, UK, Canadians, Australians...), and behind nationalities there were just humans fighting for liberty.The book also deals pretty well with the fact that the more the war advances the more you don't feel bad about using terror weapons. It is an infernal spiral where human beings die in horrible conditions and cultural heritage is devastated and gone for ever. Bombing is not a computer game where you are happy with a good score, bombing generates wounds and death of innocents, and behind each human killed there are family members and friends grieving. Let's not forget it"},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"This is a balanced account of Allied bomber war. Both RAF and USAAF contribution is considered. It rightly concentrates on Germany, because the pre-war doctrines of strategic bombing were put to practise above Germany. This concentration lets him to condense the war to manageable 400 pages, while including many reminisences by those involved: both commanders, pilots, navigators and gunners, and he also lets German fighter pilots and flak gunners as well as bombed civilians to speak.Neillands tries to understand the bombing effectiveness, unlike Harris, who preffered to bomb cities because they were large enough targets to hit with lousy navigation aids. Neillands spends a lot of time discussing morality of area bombings, but very little on alternative ways of fighting the war: heavy bombers are accepted as the main fighting vehicle of bomber war and no alternatives are considered or cost-benefit analyses tried. Yet USAAF 10% losses per mission (which translates to 12% chances of surving 20 mission tour of duty) and even the 4% RAF losses (with 30% chance of finishing 30 missions) should have made somebody think about alternatives (like Mosquito \\"light\\" bomber which could carry the same bomb load as the B-17 \\"heavy\\" bomber, but with 0.2% loss rate).Neillands has the tendency to repeat selected topics so many times as to drive the reader furious. His favourites: 88 mm flak gun was an excellent anti-tank weapon; bombing accuracy in cloud-covered Europe under enemy fire is worse than in training bombing in sunny Texas; losses are prohibitive in daylight bombing without fighter escort. These comments and many others appear 5-10 times in the book. 50 pages could have easily been culled by removing repetition.On page 387 Neillands commits a statistical fraud when discussing losses: assumably he tries to soften the allied losses by quoting side by side the Luftwaffe fighter command losses. These two, however, have very little to do with each other: Bomber command and the 8th USAAF were minor contributors to German fighter losses, compared with the Eastern front. Early in the bomber offensive Germans lost one fighter for two heavy bombers, which in economic terms was a bargain: two shot down fighter pilots who could often parachute to safety of fatherland, vs. 20 airmen who either died (only 20% survived, based on Neillands's scattered statistics on the topic), or were captured and imprisoned. 8 aircraft engines destroyed against two. Towards the end of the war the situation developed into parity: one fighter for one bomber.Neillands spends a lot of time speculating whether bombers could have won the war without ground forces, and he believes that Harris and Arnold could have done it. But then, on page 396, he refutes his own argument: \\"Germany was still fighting in 1945, and fighting hard.\\" which means that the infantry had to invade Germany to end the war, and the \\"bomber dream\\" of winning the war from the air was just a dream.Despite these deficiencies and shortcomings Neillands's book is clearly the book of choice on bomber war. It may be complemented by Arthus Harris's memoirs \\"Bomber Offensive\\". A book to be avoided at all cost is Denis Richards's RAF Bomber Command."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Robin Neillands' &quot;The Bomber War&quot; is a book of limited value that plows old ground. The author sets out to rehabilitate the memory of Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, address the morality of the bombing campaigns waged in the Second World War and dispell myths. In the end, he makes much ado about nothing new.Respecting Harris, Neillands early on establishes that he did not initiate the &quot;area bombing&quot; campaign he is so well identified with and then commences what can only be called a whitewash campaign. Neillands blithely ignores many indicators of the truth,--even those evident in his prized oral history --that paint a less improved picture of Harris. In the final reflection, Neillands reveals nothing new about Harris and ignores the real implications of a barely acknowledged ruthlessness and obstinacy.Denis Richards' 1994 book (&quot;The Hardest Victory&quot;) did as much to dispell any evidence of Harris initiating the area bombing campaign and contains a much more realistic summation of Arthur &quot;Butch&quot; (short for &quot;Butcher&quot;) Harris' connection to area bombing: &quot;...he became not only its chief executant but also--though always within the official channels--its most ardent, eloquent and obdurate champion.&quot; Neillands's faint observation that Harris continued to hold on to &quot;the bomber dream&quot; does not describe Harris so well. As for Harris's good qualities as a commander, those too were addressed by Richards seven years before.Thus one is left to wonder if Harris' reputation needed, or deserved, rehabilitation.Concerning the morality of the bombing campaigns, Neillands spills a tremendous amount of ink only to retrace the path of a multitude before him and conclude &quot;there was a war on.&quot; While this is thoroughly true, it is hardly new or revealing. Along the way, he disgraces his arguments by attempting to bolster the rationale for area bombing by essentially pointing a finger at the USAAF on behalf of the RAF and declaring &quot;you did it too&quot; largely as a result of systemic flaws that rendered the basic USAAF doctrine unworkable.While his arguments are technically and militarily correct, they fall short morally (in the ETO). Certainly both bomber forces (and the high commands that directed them) suffered an erosion of the ideals they initially entered the war with, but the RAF went much farther than the USAAF as a matter of policy in Europe. The fact that imperfect practice on the part of the USAAF often amounted to the same thing as what was policy in the RAF fails to disguise the fact that the RAF was blatantly attacking cities with the intent of killing large sectors of their populations with relative indiscriminacy.Neillands would have been more wise to mark the parallel decline in ideals between the two services that is evident if the bombing campaign against Japan is also taken into account on the USAAF side. Instead, Neillands, like so many before, is at least partially blinded by the racial issue. When one includes the USAAF experience in the PTO in the overall continuum, the decline in moral compunctions of the RAF and the USAAF is remarkably similar.Neillands' conclusions that the bomber was available in insufficient numbers, hampered by weather and technically immature are quite correct. So too is his conclusion that there &quot;was a war on.&quot; These points simply required much less proof to make and did not require finger-pointing to do it.This brings up Neillands's third purpose: dispelling myths. As nearly as I can tell, after studying this subject for a quarter of a century I'm at a loss to discern just where some of the myths he purports to identify hold sway. In 25 years I have encountered no credible work that does not conclude the following:1) That the RAF deliberately targeted civilians as a de facto matter of policy that was not beyond the standards of the war being fought and arguably had a significant impact on German production, but not on morale;2) That the USAAF attempted to make the precision bombing doctrine work but was largely unable due to the weather, the initial lack of fighter escorts and the immaturity of the weapons system, with the result that its attacks wrought similar and often indiscriminate damage akin to RAF raids;3) That the USAAF fire bombing in Japan was every bit as ruthless and morally disappointing as what the RAF did to Hamburg and Dresden;4) That the RAF developed a small cadre of highly capable precision bombing units;5) That the bombing commands suffered a drain of resources to other fronts.6) That the fire bombing of Japanese cities was actually worse than the atomic bombings.None of this is new, or revealing, and given that it represents mainstream thought it hardly constitutes truth hidden behind the veil of myth.Neillands also falls prey to a few myths and errors himself. Henry Arnold was never actually taught to fly by either of the Wright brothers and the conclusion of the Pacific War had more to do with internal Japanese politics than the use of the atomic bombs. (had a very few things gone differently, Japan would not have surrendered on 15 August 1945). So when it comes to myth-busting, Neillands is seven years late and $14.55 short (just comparing to Richards).Even Neillands' avowed purpose of using oral history to ensure the veterans are heard before they pass is nothing new or unique. Richards's book contains 33 pages of nothing but air crew quotes. Richards's book also contains extensive appendices completely absent from Neillands's work.Neillands's book comes off as old news. It is RAF/Euro-centric and seeks to both absolve the RAF and damn the USAAF by association on the issue of area bombing. It was not necessary to spend 406 pages reaching the same conclusions as those who have gone before. Richards's 363 pages are much more informative."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"The story was very good and engrossing. It is well written. The author starts out with a thesis and sets out to support it. It is shocking how many men went to their deaths daily in the bomber war over Europe. Given the very close accounting kept of current skirmishes, I think it would have been truely appalling, though informative, if everyone knew exactly how many people were being killed every day during World War II.However, I do find the book to be very repetitive and I have never seen a professionally published book with more typographical errors than this one. Editing and proofreading were lacking."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Prof. Neillands does an excellent job setting the props, introducing the actors and explaining the plot of that incredibly tragic drama which was Allied strategic bombing in World War II.

Rich in data yet compelling in pace, Prof. Neillands kept my interest at a level I seldom reach with nonfiction.There are those who will still castigate him for his defense of Air Marshal Harris. Having been in the military myself, I understand the limitations of command. As far as bombing Dresden is concerned, there is very little doublt but that Harris and Spaatz were following orders. Therefore, the blame must rest higher.All in all, I would place this in the top ten of all WWII nonfiction I have ever read.

The book badly needed both careful editing and close reading by experts well-versed in the subject.The fact that it received neither renders it useless in its stated aim, as an argument calling for a reappraisal of RAF Bomber Command chief Arthur Harris. Such an argument could be made, but not with the level of error here.A detailed discussion of the morality of area bombing (one reaching the exact opposite of Neilland's conclusion) can be found in Michael Walzer's \\"Just and Unjust Wars\\". For a good history of the RAF bombing campaign I would suggest Max Hasting's \\"Bomber Command\\", both available nowhere else but on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"While providing a good history of the RAF's Bomber Command at war the author provides only the most limited space to the the US 8th AF and 15th AF. The phenominal advances in aircraft technology are also given very little attention. The author does, however, provide the reader with an outstanding history of the revolution in avionics with special attention being paid to long-range night navigation.The prolonged defense mounted on \\"Bomber\\" Harris' behalf reads as false and disconnected. The author is trying to refute the arguments put forth by an ealrly 1990's CBC/BBC documentary on the bomber offensive. In the absence of first-hand knowledge of the documentary the reader is asked to accept Neillano's explanation of the program's thesis. I could not make that leap of faith given Neillano's far to dogged (syncophantic?) defense of Harris.Leave this on the shelf, unless you want to read the author's defense of Ol' Bomber. Read Hasting's \\"Bomber Command\\" and Freeman's \\"The Mighty Eighth\\" for excellent depictions of the Anglo-America bomber offense as conducted by the US 8th Air Force and RAF Bomber Command. I dearly wish there was a similiar work available about the 15th AF but historically it seems to have been consigned to some sort of footnote to the air war in Europe. Ambroses' \\"The Wild Blue\\" is good but it addresses only one tour (9/44-5/45) of one B-24 crew of the 15th."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"I just wrote a long review & my computer crashed before I could submit it, so I'll be brief. Yes, the book is pro-Bomber Command, but theirs was a remarkable story & they did, after all, win. The first person narratives are fascinating, and the author gives due credit to the USAAF 8th Air Force. The 9th Air Force is stiffed, which is fair because the author tells you that he is going to stick to strategic bombing, but surely more could have been written about the 15th Air Force?? I also thought the Halifax and its pilots were given a bit short shrift, but the author gets kudos for being fair about the B-24, and giving its pilots their props. Neilland is not a \\"professional\\" historian, but is more or less a professional military history writer, and he writes lucidly and compellingly. Definitely recommended for the WWII buff, especially if you have not given enough due to Bomber Command. I think one of the author's theses, that he is seeking to exonerate Air Chief Marshall Harris, is successful, even on the Dresden bombing. I also think the author's criticisms and conclusions about strategic bombing are fair and well-put."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"Robin Neillands succeeds in writing a very comprehensive review of the British and US Strategic Bombing of Germany in WW2. The author states in his introduction that he is not so much interested in the technical aspects, or whether or not the bombing of Germany was effective, but was it moral? Ironically, Neillands is at his best when he does touch on the scientific and impact of the bombing raids on Germany, issues that add great value to the book. The political, military and personality conflicts that arise in any allied effort are also well covered.To answer the morality question, Neillands starts back in 1915 during WW1 and reviews the intra war years when theorists such as Douhet, Mitchell and others thought a war could be won by an air campaign alone. The Second World War is covered phase by phase, the growth of the Allied bomber force in size, training, technology is reviewed. Even as an experienced reader, I found it very comprehensive and enlightening. I enjoyed his inclusion of personal narratives from bomber crews and key leaders. British, American and German views are recounted here.I would recommend this book to someone who has never read a high level review of the Allied bombing campaigns in WW2. I do not think new ground was covered. The author gives a very good, logical answer to the alleged purpose of this book in the introduction. War is hell, once started, it is best to finish it as quickly as possible. The author concludes that the Allied commanders had to do what was done. I rated it four stars because it's not really new ground or perspective as the author claims, the issues of morality have been covered elsewhere. It still is a good, single source reference, well researched and documented."},{"Title":"The Bomber War","review":"In \\"The Bomber War\\", author Robin Neillands sets out to provide a one-volume history of the British/US air offensive against Nazi Germany during 1939-1945. At just over 400 pages, he succeeds in providing a reasonably comprehensive account of the strategic bombing campaign, accessible to the general reader and to the student of the Second World War.Neillands approaches the air campaign from a functional as well as a chronological point of view. This approach results in some duplication but also in an all-around account of the air war. Neillands nicely mixes narrative and first person accounts; the latter bring home a sense of the difficulties, and the horror, of strategic bombing from the air and from the ground.Neillands promotes a number of points. First, early in the war, strategic bombing was virtually the only way Britain and the US could strike back at the German homeland. Second, it took years of trial and error effort to build effective British and US strategic air forces. Third, both Britain and the US expended the lives of thousands of their airmen trying to prove the efficacy of strategic bombing, an objective they probably lacked the technology and numbers to achieve.Neillands returns repeatedly to the emotional debate over the morality of the Allied strategic bombing campaign, especially the February 1945 firebombing of Dresden. His specific purpose is to demonstrate on a factual basis that Air Chief Marshal \\"Bomber\\" Harris and Bomber Command executed the air campaign against Germany as directed and well within the context of the war. Readers may judge for themselves how well he succeeds.\\"The Bomber War\\" is recommended to the general reader and to the non-specialist student of the Air War as a very useful one-volume account. Specialists on the strategic bombing campaign can find more detailed accounts, and more exhaustive arguments, elsewhere."},{"Title":"Tessie and Pearlie: A Granddaughter's Story","review":"This is Joy Horowitz's tribute to her two jewish grandmothers. They are both in their 90's and as feisty and loving as can be. In a book full of wisdom, humor, and yes, recipes, there is a lingering sense of mortality as both bubbes tell their tales and wonder when death will claim them. This is a book for anyone who treasures the stories of years past, who loved to sit at their grandmother's knee as she told stories of years gone by. It will leave you at turns both happy and almost tearful as each grandmother grapples with the life she has lived and the fact that she won't be around much longer.

At the same time Joy is dealing with the vagaries of old age as she tries to gain insight into the lives her grandmothers led before they BECAME grandmothers, she is dealing with the pain of her own miscarriage and the joy and trials of her own children.The is a book for anyone who has ever known/dealt with/loved/been driven crazy by someone elderly, anyone whose ambitions include growing old, anyone who is either curious or fearful (or both) about what their own old age may be like.This you should know: This book will bring a tear to the eye and a lump to the throat.

Or, in this lucky case, to BOTH her 90-something grandmothers. How I envied her the privilege, courage and perspicacity to ask these questions before it was too late! I shared many, many things with my beloved grandmother, but I wish with all my heart that I had done what Joy Horowitz did in &quot;Tessie and Pearlie&quot;, to search out and record the stories of her grandmothers' lives, what made them who they are, what their lives mean to her own life, to her children's lives. Joy Horowitz did, indeed, build an amazing, bittersweet bridge between her family's past and future and created a truly precious legacy for her own children and subsequent generations of her family. Especially when one is young, it is very often difficult to let go of the irritations and inconsistencies you see in your parents and grandparents and really communicate with them. It is usually in middle age that the sense of one's mortality overcomes these quibbles and by then, for most, it is too late for grandparents. If you are now fortunate enough to have a living grandmother, seize the moment. Read this book, put on Bill Withers and cry and - and then go call her up and ask and ask and listen and listen.

But all of a sudden, \\"what he believes is right\\" is changing. Are bad R-rated movies, explicit music, and trashy friends really the way to go? Does seeing a lot of things that he shouldn't be seeing make him sophisticated? And how is he expected to witness to people, when he scarcely thinks of God, himself?This was a really good book! It has little twists and turns that will surprise you, and an entertaining storyline to keep you interested the rest of the time. The characters are all likable, but you might find yourself getting a little bit irritated with Hannah sometimes, because she can be pretty obnoxious when she's trying to prove a point about the Bible. I recommend the \\"Brio Girls\\" series to all girls between the ages of twelve and sixteen.

I have never met any teachers or collegues that don't know about this book. This book has more or less become our vocal &quot;Bible&quot;, suitable not only for the advanced classical singers, but perhaps even more suitable for the beginners. Despite the fact that similar editions from other publishers of these songs are readily available, I still think this edition reigns supreme.The songs chosen in this book, in various levels of difficulty, are great as teaching materials, as well as performance materials for recitals and exams, etc. In my teaching experience, I find that every singer finds something in these songs that can improve their singing voice, maybe because I think it teaches them so much about the rudiment of legato(smooth) singing.For anyone wishing to take singing lessons, particularly that of Classical singing, this book is a MUST-HAVE in their music library!

They also purposely leave out any information on birds some may find undesirable, like Starlings and House Sparrows, which can be aggressive and keep small songbirds away.This guide is for the utmost, novice and does not contain extremely detailed information on identifying and feeding birds.

What captured me the most about the book was the way Gini Sikes was able to give the most vivid image of gang life through that book, I have ever read. I felt like I was on those L.A. streets and in those San Antonio neighborhoods.I believe Gini Sikes not only captured the violent side of gang life but the human side. I was able to see these people, she wrote about, as more than &quot;gang bangers&quot;, these people had lives and were living like any other person. Overall, this book is like a documentary written down. &quot;Cocoa&quot; and &quot;Alicia&quot; were having some normal troubles in their life and in some way or another, I could relate to that. It was things like man trouble, parent trouble, and school trouble, any usual young adult will go through those things (maybe not to the extreme. In my imagination, I visualized every part of the book as if it were a film.Last, I believe Gini Sikes was very brave for going into each neighborhood personally and seeing for herself &quot;the life&quot;. I think this made the book a lot better and it put more feeling into the book.

From &quot;&quot;White Trash&quot; mamas to the Cholas and &quot;Homegirls&quot; of the great American Southwest, the reader is able to sense the inner rage, often coupled with indifference (more a numb acceptance of one's fated role in society) that is a part of the lives of many of America's disadvantaged or maladjusted youth.

The book is mostly about females that hang out with gangsters and are horribly and brutally mistreated. The actual girl gangsters mentioned are few and far between, in fact author Sikes interviews as many males as she does females.The book also contains some bizarre lapses. For instance on one page she states the going price for cocaine at that time was $12,000 a kilo, yet in the very next paragraph she states that 500 grams is worth $50,000 dollars!!! The author says the horrid lives of the girls in the book reflects society and as an example she gives &quot;Antia Hill's hazing by Congress&quot;. Please! Getting question by Congress does not compare to nor cause being gang raped while being tortured, an event that happens quite regularly in '8 Ball Chicks'.If you want a book about gangs get 'Monster' by Monster Cody Scott or &quot;Do or Die&quot; by Leon Bing. If you to watch a contributor to Mademoiselle magazine gawk as people get brutalized get '8 Ball Chicks'."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I began reading anxiously, hoping to get a peek into the world of girl gangsters. I was disappointed, for Gini Sikes' style was more like a he-said-she-said description of teen gangs. The writing was often confusing and vague, leaving much to be described about the situations the author encountered. There were way too many interviews and jumps without warning, leaving you to believe that Shygirl's testimony was actually made by Sadgirl, or whoever. Had it been a bit less rushed and hurried, and been edited a little more, this book would have been much better."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"I, literally, could not put this book down. It captured my attention and held it throughout the entire book. It was upsetting, eye-opening, and incredibly intriguing. Sikes did an amazing job researching and writing about this overlooked group of girls. Sikes showed another sub-culture group we have ignored or failed to believe existed. She gave them an amazing voice! Sikes also wrote so clearly through the eyes of the various girls (and guys) she interviewed without adding her personal judgement. I was also amazed at the risk she took to fulfill and ultimately complete this project. I could not do it even though I find it incredibly necessary. Because if we want to understand all the girls in our society, we need to include this group, and Sikes did a good job at accomplishing this. She also showed the remarkable amount of courage these girls have while living in some of the worst conditions. You will cheer for a happy ending, but find there are not many.

It was both fascinating and frightening to look into the world of girls in gangs. It's very sad how most of the time neither male gang members nor police officers see any value in the girls, most of whom are depicted as being intensely intellignet and insightful. They're a group of people who slip through the cracks, so to speak; they're neglected by social workers, police think they're worthless, and male gang members think there's nothing wrong with beating a girl, even if she's pregnant. This book shocked me."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"I agree with Amazon's review of 8 Ball Chicks.

Whoever you are, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"An unbelievably eye opening book to the difficulty many of our youth face that details much of the circumstances in which many of them live. Haunting. Frigtening. It's chilling to realize that most of us never even see what goes on - but we do feel the repercussions, we live with the consequences, we deal with the societal costs every single day, but we are unaware of how these lives get lived out, how the cards are dealt to these young people and how everyone in society is somehow intertwined, even though living in ignorance. Crisp, well written, this work chronicles the lives of many teenage girs from cities in the US and just how and what gang life means to them. It endeavors to reveal the hard reality. For example revealing that many children come from gang parents - a culture being passed to the next generation. I'd always thought it was the other way around - kids the problem and the parents suffered. WOW did this book open my eyes! It records the bleak futures and the little glimmer of hope for getting out of gangs - unwanted pregnancy. Anything to leave the life! Compelling and eye opening. I really enjoyed the book and enjoyed getting an education as to what is happening with much of our youth. It helps answer why the difference in kids today. Helped me learn what is going on in my own city and since reading the book have I been involved in learning more and helping more. Even got to witness first hand some of the things recorded in '8 ball chicks'."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"As someone who's read about gangs before, I found this book particuarly helpful because it detailed the various roles girls may play in gangs -- from Mama Sheik, a leader of an autonomous girl gang to Alicia, who is basically a sexual punching bag for the boys. People may not want to read an the ugly truth, but this book opens one's eyes to what happens to the more vulnerable girls, as well as telling the story of the stronger ones."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"Gini Sikes' 8 Ball Chicks is a frightening yet fascinating investigation into the world of gang girls. The book looks at girls in the black gangs of LA, among the vatos of San Antonio, and even in the American heartland of Milwaukee.Sikes makes clear that for many girls gang banging is either a stage of adolescent rebellion or the characteristic reaction to an life filled with adversity. Indeed, the unremitting catalogue of life's horrors that the girls in the book describe can become oppressive at times for the reader to endure. The stories of rape, molestation, beatings, and abandonment begin to run together, a more horrifying story just a page away. One problem for the reader is that as she reads these stories it is easy to become desensitized to the violence and human suffering in the book. Another difficulty is keeping each girl's story distinct.Surprisingly, the most disturbing girls in the book are a pair of well to do white teenagers who slum with gang members in a quest for teenage thrills. An obvious criticism of Sikes work is that she is little different from these girls; that Sikes is a fashionably liberal writer who parachutes into urban misery for a few weeks for a quick dance on the edge before jetting back to Manhattan.However, Sikes comes across as an honest journalist who is brave enough to enter a world where most of us do not dare to visit, or even think about unless it comes looking for us. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"I thought that this book was very informative, Gangster rap &amp; clothing has always been glorified but to learn what these people experience at extreamly young ages &amp; the things they do inorder to survive is so scary.

I was enthralled and repulsed by the experinces of these young women. Drugs, gang-rape, and killings are the life style for these girls. Politicians should read this book to get a real grasp on what is going on with teenagers living in poverty and see why so many teen-age girls are pregnant and on welfare.I will never forget this book."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"eight ball chicks, was a great book. it tells you how it really is out there. in the places where there is no other choice, where you don't have time to be a kid, and where there's nothing but bad around you. gini sikes does what she set out to do. to study, learn, and let the world know about these girls and what they're all about in these gangs. although there was much more that could have been said, and many more gangs to see it was nicely written no doubt. these were just a few of the girls, but there are many more, with different stories, all leading them down the same path. it's showing you, where these women come from, why they do what they do. in most cases there's no other way. if they could all have that nice house, with both parents, and a nice safe community, i'm sure they would take it, but when all you have is a barrio full of drugs, and guns, with nobody who gives a damn, there really isn't much hope. you got to be strong, emotionally to survive these places. no doubt there's some who do it for the thrill and what not, but they all end up the same. another banger behind bars or shot down somewhere. all my respect to this book and to those people who really have no choice. there's a whole lot more trouble out there that some turn a blind eye to and wish not to see, but this book is an \\"in your face\\" kind of book and i love it for that."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"this book is good if you are interested in how gangsters interact with each other. its more of a documentation book rather storytelling."},{"Title":"8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangsters (ISBN: 0385474318)","review":"I loved reading this book!

I like the book but think she needed to include more on the gang culture of women out here and there.All these writers write about gangs in California, Texas, Illinois. Yet, there are few compared to these states but there are more of us gangbangers out here in the other states. Such as the east coast; Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland. Some writers are careful in not stereotyping their novels but I personally dont judge them because most of them time it is about stereotypical stories.I wish I can write my own books and let people know what more there is out there.

Sikes never seemed to know what was truth and what was hyperbole. with a topic like this, you at lest have to have a pretty good idea. Her bad girls were not clearly and vividly drawn, and her bad boys were down right one dimensional.The lack of realism was astonishing.

Although this theory would not hold water in for example China,(because of the large masses of people living together)here in our society it is the opposite. Punishment is much severe and swifter in China.

But this book does provide readers with insights into what daily life was like with this musical genius. His letters demonstrate both his love for music, and his goal of doing justice to each composer's intentions, AND his abiding love for his wife and daughters.Other books can provide you with more complete information on his symphonies--when and where they were performed, and what was thought about them at the time. This book is for those who want to learn more about the man--from the woman he both neglected and yet adored. Even with its occasional faults, Alma's description of their life together is invaluable to all of us who love and wish to better understand the \\"one-of-a-kind\\" Gustav Mahler."},{"Title":"Business Korea: A Practical Guide to Understanding South Korean Business Culture (International Business Culture)","review":"This is a good reference book if you go to South Korea for business or do business with Koreans in your own country.If you would like a book with more information and references, than I would recommend the book Korean Etiquette & Ethics in Business by Boye Lafayette De Mente.

I'll give them credit for presenting some interesting trivia--such as the fact that Koreans think many Americans smell bad--and at least they do give some Korean phrases that can be helpful for the non-Korean English speaker. However, if you want to really understand South Koreans and their businessmen today, this book does not tell you much.The book is outdated too, and certainly not worth the price.

We were VERY disappointed when we received the book. After paying close to $..., we expected the book to contain more information and pictures of aircraft.

This is about Casca trying to stop a Viet Cong assassin squad carrying out its mission, and the personal duel between Casca and the Viet squad leader that has a unique conclusion in the crocodile infested swamps of southern Vietnam.

This particular book brings us back to the beginning of the first book when Casca is brought into the hospital and the tale begins. Now I will grant you that Sadler will never be up up for any big literary awards, but this story, like the other stories in the series are simply fun to read. They are true page turners for those who enjoy this genre. Actually, when you examine the facts Sadler spikes his book with, it is quite clear that he has done his home work. After Mr. Sadler passed away, the publisher has attempted to contine the series with a couple different authors. Those stories are a complete waste of time and paper. Stick with the Sadler written books. All in all I recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"The Phoenix","review":"Barry Sadler served in Vietnam in the 60s and this novel, set in 1970 in that region, was written with a comfortable flow that spoke of a familiarity few could unless they'd actually been there.The Casca series began with a wounded Casca being flown into a hospital in Eternal Mercenary, and this book tells the story that led Casca to that point. The basic story is that a Viet Cong Colonel plans to destabilise US-backed South Vietnam by sending in teams of trained assassins to take out the top military and civilian figures in the country. Casca becomes involved when he is shot at the start and the Colonel believes him to be dead.Of course Casca cannot die and rises from the dead to carry out a personal act of revenge. The story deals with the sparring between the two at distance and the attempts to kill as many South Viet administrators as possible. The action is fairly well spread, not too much and not too little, and Casca eventually succeeds in capturing the enemy plans and tips the balance against the communists.The story then shifts to the jungle and Casca teams up with a tribe of Cambodes under a disreputable bandit called Phang who decides to help after payment of gold. There is a long chase and the Colonel becomes obsessed with killing Casca, something Casca knows and uses this obsession against the Colonel, leading him and his troops into a deadly trap of some originality, something that would send shudders of horror down the backs of most people!Job done Casca returns to South Vietnam only to fall victim to a random attack and this is where he gets picked up en route to hospital.A decent story of obsession and a trial of wits between two tough adversaries."},{"Title":"The Phoenix","review":"I think this was Barry Sadler's last book. (In terms of great storyline and overall characterization, leastways.)The cover art captures Casca perfectly. He doesn't look like a muscled romance novel model. Great and highly addictive, this novel was never dull and boring like most of the rest after this one. It is without a doubt a Barry Sadler novel. No mistaking that here. Full of action and adventure, out hero dies twice, only to come back like the mythical Phoenix, to take his revenge out on a Vietcong commander.Utterly fantastic!

Rather, it was composed of the author's whimsical ramblings interspersed with prayers. The prayers, overall, were the best part of this otherwise unnotable effort."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Only fans of Marianne's work would like this book. The &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style is irritating. If an author has something to say, then why not state it plainly? Granted, prayers often have an improvisational quality, but an entire book of prayers mixed in with the author's own stream of consciousness &quot;insights&quot; leaves me wondering if this work was completed just to complete another book, or if there was inspiration behind the rhetoric. Some of the male-female &quot;relationship&quot; ideas were also a bit curious. I wouldn't think that an enlightened woman would feel she needed to keep a man interested by playing &quot;games&quot; rather than attempting honest and straightforward communication....Have the ideals of the 60's women's movement disappeared in the 90's woman? From reading this book, you would think so."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Ms.Willamson is going to take a lot of heat for this book. First of all, people have a tendancy to lean toward the familar. Gone is the benevolent, spritual face with the modest shoulder length hair that she had on the cover of A Return To Love, in it's place we see a retro '80's Pat Benetar look on the cover of Enchanted. Her prose is beautiful, even metaphysical, at times. But, there are times when her musings are downright sexist. The lady that said a relationship should'nt be based on the size of a wallet now says she needs to cared for like a &quot;Mercedes&quot; or a &quot;Jaguar&quot;. One thing is for sure. This book will seperate the men from the boys, and, the girls from the women, because you're either love this book unconditionally or you're going to hate it immensely."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"This is one of those books I found very readable and it kept me reading till I was through it. It is also one of those valuable books that has so many good ideas and thoughts that I can pick it up at any time and find something that speaks to me that I didn't see the last time or it means more now. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"If only the world saw love in such a beautiful way. This insight brings peace & forgiveness from inside. We are one."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Loved the book and received on time. Am very happy that I purchased this book and recommend it to women."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"I love this book it has help me a lot love is a dificult topic and she does a great job"},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Marianne Williamson makes some important points about how love, and relationships in particular, can help us in our spiritual growth. Relationships, whether we see them as negative or positive experiences in our lives, teach us a lot about ourselves. And isn't this what life is all about?"},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"This is her best book yet. There is a mystical quality to the writing itself. Marianne creates a context for relationships in Enchanted Love, rather than just telling you what to specifically do to get them to happen. Without this context, it doesn't even matter what you do, in a certain kind of a way. With this book, Marianne goes more to the essence of what is needed in order for us to create the kind of relationships we all dream about. I read some of these customer reviews and I think a lot of people are maybe looking to this book as some kind of self-help book, having certain expectations for what it's supposed to be. You know, step one, do this...step two, do that. I think Marianne breaks that mold with this book. For me, just reading it shifted me, opened me. She is speaking to another part of our brain, I think. In other words, it's the kind of book that gets in there, even when you are not looking. For instance, I read Enchanted Love and then a couple of days later I found myself referring to certain ideas Marianne talks about in the book, while I was talking with a friend...concepts I didn't even know had particularly registered with me while I was reading them. I find myself doing that a lot...going back to sections of it over and over again. Almost everyone I know who's read it says they want to read it again. I am constantly amazed at how much more I can see about life, about love, and about romance since I read Marianne's remarkable book. Do yourself a favor, sit with it. Read it slowly. Let it sink in. Think about it. Savor it. It'll open doors. It did for me, anyway."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"I am now reading this book for the second time and I love it just as much now as I did the first go around. Marianne Williamson really understands how spiritual contact with a Higher Power influences and shapes the kinds of love we initiate and sustain in our lives. I particularly like the way she describes the relationship dynamics between men and women in the midst of intimate relationships and just how much spiritual work needs to be done. The prayers that she intersperses through the book are beautiful and moving.As for those who try and insult her work just because she hasn't been married to 'Joe Schmoe' for 25 years with a whole troop of kids and grandkids...might I remind those that true love does not always take the traditional conventional route. Some of the greatest loves of my life have been men I never married and never would, the real point is that they were all still worthwhile and valid experiences that contributed to my growth and knowledge as a person. Also just because someone manages to stay married for 25 years in no way means that relationship is healthy, happy or worth emulating.With that being said this book has to be one of her more underrated works yet in my opinion I found it to be the most poignant and moving. It has definitely deepened my emotional and spiritual capacity to feel and accept love into my life."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"If you want to have an idea of this book, i suggest reading the Amazon.com and the Booklist reviews, as i will add to those comments. It is right to point out that some of Marianne's theories about male-female dynamics are rather surprising of her. Such theories certainly do not stem from the teachings of A Course In Miracles and are misguiding. But, that putted aside, her teachings are very usefull in bringning light on many aspects of intimate relationships. To illustrate the principles exposed in her book, the author shares a text addressed to her lover (be he her true lover or an imagined one). These are by far the most touching and powerful parts of this whole work. Marianne's words come from deep within her heart and are very useful to put the reader in the spirit of the denser and more &quot;practical&quot; parts of the book. Booklist's reviewer don't seem to share this opinion, to make your mind on this topic and to have a good idea of the book, i recommend you read the two chapters that the author lets you read for FREE. On a closing note i would say to those who have read ACIM, that Marianne's new book's message seems to be that intimate relationships are not all &quot;special relationships&quot; and that they can be used as healing and holy relationships, and i can only agree with her. She comes to find a name for those relationships; Sacred Romance. I would give this book 4 stars, but that being not not possible, i will give 4 stars, for its tiny flaws."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Oh, you silly willies! She says in the introduction that &quot;ENCHANTED LOVE&quot; is a collection of prayers, meditations, and little more than her own impressions about love - it's not a &quot;book&quot; in any sense of the word at all - and she didn't mean it to be. It's instead sort of an intimate evening at home discussing romantic love with Marianne. She's just sort of free-associating at times - and if this works for you, great! If not, well, there are plenty of &quot;how to&quot; books out there. This is a great book, if you're willing to &quot;forget logic. Forget your head. Open your heart, and come with me,&quot; as she writes in the frontispiece. And I think the dedication is VERY classy!"},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Marianne Williamson, lecturer on metaphysics and spirituality, turns her attention to romantic love in Enchanted Love: The Mystical Power or Intimate Relationships. The book is in thirteen chapters with titles such as \\"The Enchanted Sea\\" and \\"Of Space Captains and Angels.\\" It also contains poems and prayers by the author.One of Ms. Wiliamson's earlier books, A Return to Love, explained some of the principles of A Course in Miracles as they relate to issues in daily life. A Return to Love was a very clear, well written book, that I have enjoyed reading at least five times over the past few years. Unfortunately I found Enchanted Love something of a disappointment. It lacks the organization around clear topics that one finds in A Return to Love. Enchanted Love contains some very good paragraphs, but the book often seems like a not very interesting assortment of preachy pronouncements. Although some of the author's statements are explained with examples, others are simply uttered, and one may well wonder \\"Is that really true?\\" or even \\"What does that mean?\\"We are told, for example: \\"I once heard Pat Allen say that men produce into women's appetites. Men are by nature producers, and one of the things they produce into is female desire. From our sexual lives to our emotional lives, that is an archetypal pattern of great beauty and significance.\\" I do not have the vaguest idea who Pat Allen is. I have never before heard the verb \\"produce\\" followed by the preposition \\"into.\\" I cannot imagine what \\"produce into\\" means, but \\"producing into\\" certainly does not sound like a pattern of beauty to me. Perhap there are circles of people who know of Pat Allen and who speak of \\"producing into appetites.\\" Who knows? I don't. One wonders what sort of editorial process the book went through.Ms. Williamson writes, \\"Marrieds and singles are constantly sending telepathic communications to each other. There is a constant conversation everyone knows is there, but which few dare to verbalize.\\" I was unaware of such constant telepathic communication. Is it really taking place?Although some of the author's poems and prayers may serve as worthwhile meditations, some are quite banal. One poem, for example, contains the line \\"Your issues are more interesting now.\\" Is that poetry, or merely the sort of psychobabble one may routinely hear at twelve-step meetings?Fans of Ms. Williamson may find that the book contains some interesting material and food for thought. For those unacquainted with Ms. Williamson, I would recommend A Return to Love, but not Enchanted Love."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Thank you Marianne for this beautifully eloquent expression of real and deep love. My husband and I read this book together and from page one we were amazed at how truly you captured the experience of true, romantic love. For those of you looking for a &quot;how to&quot; book on love, I agree with your reviews that this would have missed the mark for you. But for those of us out there who are blessed with the gift of being in an enchanted love, it was amazing to see on paper what it is most times impossible to ever find words to describe. Your book touched my husband and I tremendously and reminded us that we indeed have been given a gift from God in each other and the heights of love that we are able to experience. It is also a reminder to us both that the love we share is something we should never dare to take for granted or treat lightly. Enchanted love is rare and when we are chosen and blessed in this lifetme to experience it, it is to be cherished. For those of you who read this and didn't quite &quot;get it &quot;, then my guess is that your beloved has not yet entered your life. When they do, you will know it, and then re-read this book. I guarantee you it will be a totally different book for you the second time around and will touch your heart as much as it has mine and my husband's."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"\\"Enchanted Love\\" is simply a beautiful book. Particularly in the introduction and through the early chapters, it truly is an enchanting journey along a path of romance into a woman's essence. While some of the enchantment seems to be abandoned in the later chapters, where she turns more philosophical, the poetic dialogues that illustrate the book have the ability to carry the reader back into the greater depths of love where enchantment lives, and bring bearing to her more surface, technical beliefs and observations.In particular, I was surprised by her views on monogamy. They seem almost to be an intrusion on the feelings carried earlier in the book; but as she says, she is a complex woman who makes no apologies for being, \\"high maintenance\\". She does, indeed, appear to be a woman leading the way into a new era of open expressiveness and freedom, although I'm not convinced through reading this book that her ideas are as independent as they are rebellious, which is where the intrusion is made on the enchantment.Still, from a man's perspective, reading this book has the familiar comfort of laying in a lover's arms for a beautifully intimate moment. Williamson's words often assume the texture of a golden honey being poured into the reader's soul, and bear a sense of authenticity and subject-knowledge reminiscent of her work in \\"A Woman's Worth\\" This book is highly recommended reading for anyone who has ever felt in love."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"I am not one for self help books, I really don't buy in to the dysfunctional ways of our society. I have read every Marianne Williamson book on the market (more than once.) I like what she has to say. I am not a literary scholar..just a woman making it in this world. My spiritual journey has been long, profound, and quite beautiful..I have some questions for her though, I would love to pick her brain. Enchanted love was my favorite of all her work and an awakening to spiritual growth and letting go of all that I was raised with. Most of us believing we have to be strong,get a college degree, and only depend on ourselves. Most of us have a low opinion of men, marriage and have lost the key to what those relationships should mean in our lives. We so desperately want to be married and live the &quot;dream&quot; but that dream has three parts one of our mothers, one of our grandmothers, and one of our own ..we were disillusioned. What I wonder and question is when we have done the work,come full circle, discovered our true selves, and find the key..the key being..loving yourself more, believing in the Word of the Lord, and ultimately surrendering to the Word, and surrendering to that child like state that we all want to inherintly surrender to...I ask only this: Marianne what are we to do when we believe in the power of your words, of His word, surrender, and are ultimately left in pain, that pain we were so afraid of to begin with? I have prayed the prayers and believed in the Word..this has left me in more pain than I have ever known or imagined. To love like this is a very big risk, it is so unconditional, so beautiful, and when this happens it is very few that can reciprocate-even from those of God.. I wish I could talk to her about this book..it has affected my life in a very powerful way. It wasn't the book alone, however,it was all of the actions and the journey prior to reading this book that led me to such a beautiful place of seeing those around me. I see miracles happen every day..I feel the Lord stronger than I have ever felt..but to love like that is very painful. Sometimes I wonder if what our mothers taught us would not be better. &quot;you don't need a man!&quot; I don't want to believe that, but after taking those steps she outlined in her book and being left where I am now..I can not help but wonder who is emotionally better off?"},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"If you can read this book and not be excited about loving someone in your life, you had better check your pulse. Marianne's imagery and poetry thrill the soul. While it comes with words of wisdom, I think it is like sex, it needs to be savored and felt, rather than analyzed and diagramed, slowly with full attention. Marianne's own sensuality and beauty comes out in her words. One can picture her soul mate being called to and responding with a love that makes the world spin even faster than normal. Bonding is the deepest of all relationships."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"This is a most inspirational and affirming book about love there is. If one is not spiritually inclined, I think one needs some groundwork first before being able to digest this book. It came at a time in my life when I needed hope that love can truly happen in my lifetime. After the demise of a marriage of 20 years where my husband was unable to love himself never mind me and the children, Marianne tapped my inner soul to seek hope. I highly recommend this book to young and old alike. It is deep, but it is one book that can be read over and over again in excerpts. it is not a novel. It is not a thriller. It is a search for one's own soul and that just doesn't happen in one sitting. Be blessed and love."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"this book makes no sense. it is just stream of consciousness.

This seems much more like her capitalizing on her reputation and duping those of us who truly thought she might have something NEW to say.

The imagery is beautiful - angels, perfumed seas and so on - as are the prayers which are the only things worth reading in the book. The instructions are vague, and the message is lost somewhere in all of that rambling. Not only is this book sexist, it is cruelly insensitive to those not in relationship (&quot;no one gets into heaven alone&quot;), and also ignores those who might have alternative lifestyles.

She was so entangled in her flowery expression of words that she must have forgotten the point she was trying to make. This book is confusing more than it is enlightening.In the book she talked about the difference between men and women. How men usually don't lie, unless women proves we're hysterical in the light of truth. Hello! Since when are we responsible for how others behave? If that is the case, women definitely need to do the &quot;right&quot; thing to get men to behave the &quot;right&quot; way. It sounds like manipulation, but she calls it a dance.The two stars are for the prayers in the book. It's about the only part that is worth reading. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their time on this book. If anyone wants to read about love, I'd recommend Deepak Chopra's &quot;The Path To Love&quot;, or Iyanla Vanzant's &quot;In The Meantime&quot;."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"A beautiful, beautiful publication.

I stayed up late reading it, sent a copy of the Divorce Prayer to my ex (and immediately got a very warm \\"thank you\\" back from him), re-read the book, and then sent it off to my new love. It gave us so much to talk about, so much faith when we needed faith, and a reason to hold fast to our belief that we could have love in our lives again. Seeing this person as an angel struggling with his own experience has been so amazingly helpful. The discussions of monogamy and sex were extremely helpful to me as well as I was trying to find a sane context for my understanding and beliefs around these things. This is a very quick read. It's not to be analyzed. I don't think it's important to sweat the details here. This book is to be experienced, to be savored, to be shared. Thank you, Marianne, for reminding me about the incredible gift of this bond with another person, which I hope I will never again treat lightly."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"Love relationships can be our greatest joy and our greatest sorrow! Ever wonder why some lovers run from us while others choose to stay? Williamson gets to the heart and soul of what lies (or often &quot;lurks&quot;) below the surface of intimate relationships. In this book, she uses her own past relationship experiences as examples and gives examples she's gleaned from friends and couples she has worked with professionally.After perusing the following excerpt from the book I knew this was a book I had to read.&quot;Often upon seeing the weaknesses in each other, we have the tendency to go &quot;Yuck!&quot; and walk away on some level. But often it is not a change in partners but rather a change in perception that delivers us to the love seek. When we shift our view of the purpose of intimacy - from serving our own needs as we define them to serving a larger process of healing - then an entirely new opportunity presents itself. Our wounds have been brought forward, not to block the experience of love, but to serve it.&quot; Later Williamson writes, &quot;The purpose of an intimate relationship is not that it be a place where we can hide from our weaknesses, but rather where we can safely let them go.&quot; and, &quot;We unconsciously seek the relationships that challenge us to deliver on our most soulful selves, as well as tempt us to fall into our most neurotic patterns.&quot;I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. It should be used by parents, teachers, ministers and counselors to help young adults and couples of all ages understand what's really going on when people unintentionally touch their partner's emotional wounds.Short, thoughtful, compassionate, at times divinely inspired, easy to read and understand, this book rates as one of my top ten."},{"Title":"Enchanted Love (The Mystical Power of of Intimate Relationships)","review":"This book fed my soul, but not my critical rationality. I too share the yearning for love's sweetness and the synthesis of human and Divine Love in my relationships. Everything Ms Williams says makes perfect sense to me and I found lots of substance here. Her concept on the evolution of and need for spiritually healing relationships are basically the same as Gary Zukav in his Seat of the Soul and many others.

I really like her comments on a relationship, that we become united in spirit. She simply throws out few thoughts on a subject of love and relationships. Not a guide to marriage or relationship. Would I recommend this book to a friend? Yes, only because I haven't read other books on relationship, so I don't know what else is out there. But it is an enjoyable reading.---CASE AGAINST---She had some things to say and a lot of it seems like she was saying just to fill up her book.

She reminded me that if we trust our heart and not our mind, we can indeed find heaven on earth. How liberating to discover that my longing for God and my longing for romance are not mutually exclusive.

From jaguars, venomous snakes and crocodiles down to the relentless flies and chiggers that inhabit these inhospitable environs there is never a dull moment.

He did not believe in big expeditions and elaborate paraphernalia - he was a man who carried his own belongings and charged ahead. This same trait enabled him to perform extraordinary feats of military intelligence and reconnaissance in difficult and dangerous areas during World War II. Clark attended the University of California, then joined the army, attaining the rank of colonel. During the war, he spent many months in China behind Japanese lines organizing guerrilla activity. His post-war expeditions began in Borneo, and over the years he made trips to Mexico, the Celebes, Sumatra, China, India, Japan, Central America, South America, and Burma.&quot; He passed away in 1957 at the age of 49, while on a diamond-mining expedition in Venezuela&quot;He wrote:A wanderer till I die [1937] very rareAn article on National Geographic magazine - September 1938Among the big knot lois of Hainan: wild tribesmen with topknots roam the little-known interior of this big and strategically important island in the china sea [1938]The Rivers ran east [1953]... - translated in italian by Garzanti...The marching wind [c1955]...Yucatan adventure [1959]...Alle sorgenti del fiume giallo [1996 ] italian edition...I hope I've found something interesting for all!"},{"Title":"The Rivers Ran East (U.K. Reprint)","review":"Clark,an American who helped engineer the resistance to the Japanese occupation of China, goes looking to the source of gold flowing to Spain from the new world. He finds the key in the archives of Spain. He travels alone into the interior of the Amazon river basing seeking the gold source. His guide abandons him the first day into the trek, leaving Clark armed only with his wits and a .38cal revolver. The story takes you into the vicious lifes of the head hunting Juarvo indian natives,..even as friends, they are deadly. To say more would give away the story. The reader gets a stark education of the ways of the not so primitive South American jungle inhabitants. Add to the mix a young Italian lady on a shadowing river boat, who is all to eager to assist him. But , in his quest, or demise. The book should be labelled as addictive to anyone who likes to read fast moving, hair raising non-fiction. REVIEWER NOTE: &quot;The Rivers Ran East.&quot; is such a fantastic story that when it was published, no one took it seriously. Finally, two expedientions were mounted to follow Clark's footsteps. The first found that the indian resistance was even more formidable than Clark had reported and turned back. The second team found the gold, it is the richest gold strike in history. Their claim is said to the to be the &quot;most expensive real estate on earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rivers Ran East (U.K. Reprint)","review":"Having lived in the Amazon valley (Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, on the upper Rio Negro just south of the equator, and also on the Amazon near Manaus), for ten years, I find much of the book amusing. It is inconceivable that Clark is the only explorer that ran into more horrifying Indians, more snakes and other jungle creature out to get him than any other who had gone before him.For example, Clark wasn't fond of swimming in the river because there were crocs on every shore, and flesh eating fish at every depth. Explorer Adrian Cowell (The Heart of the Forest), found nothing like this in all his travels and even snorkeled at the Xingu tribe he stayed with. Earlier, Earl Hanson in Journey to Manaos found most of the Indians quite curious. My sister has worked with tribal Indians in Brazil for 35 years and has never reported such savagery. The Indians are known for killing, but usually out of fear - not because they are simply mean.Loren McIntyre paints a totally different picture of the Amazon and its people in Amazonia (Sierra Club). Don't forget Teddy Roosevelt. He had a great time on the Amazon. And finally, Alfred Wallace's Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro (1889), talks of Indians and fauna, but never had the problems Clark had.It is my guess that Clark, knowing no one would be able to confirm or deny his wild tales, took poetic license and created a story that is a great read, but simply not totally factual. It is his vivid imagination that makes the journey even more exciting - but I was disappointed because I thought I was going to read a nice historical account of his travels and instead caught myself laughing to myself in disbelief.I suppose I could be wrong. I've never been to the Amazon in the Peruvian headwaters.

The narrative gripped me as few true tales of high adventure ever have. I suspect that may have been because as a pre-literate child, my grandparents had read an excerpt of it which had been reprinted in some Sunday supplement of a Dallas newspaper. It was the incident involving Indians curing Clark's temporary blindness caused by some hideous parasitic worm using a long thorn and some tar-like substance. The description stuck in my mind's eye for over 20 years until that deja vu moment when I read it for myself. I don't recall how many times I reread that book down in the Valley but it was several.I never could find a copy of The Marching Wind mentioned in some old reviews I found but I kept my eyes out for it at every used book store I ever visited. The most bizarre incident was, however, when I encountered a man who had served with Clark in the OSS in China. He was working as a postman in tiny Valley town and like the few others of his type I've run into over the decades, you would never imagine this man had successfully passed as a Chinese cavalryman and been part of the team that rescued Chiang KaiChek from the Mainland. But there in a multitude of moldy cardboard boxes on his screened in porch were hundred of documents and photos which should have been classified material and certainly belonged in a military museum along with his rare US manufactured Fairbairn-Sykes commando knife in the \\"pancake spatula\\" sheath. There was no doubt whatsoever this man was the real deal and when I mentioned Clark, he casually affirmed that he knew him. He also commented cryptically \\"Didn't he die down in South America?\\" I had no idea at the time of what became of him and still didn't until I read his niece's review here.An old New York newspaper review I read criticized Clark's veracity commenting:\\"My Spanish is better than his.\\" I dismissed this as snooty critic talk from someone who had probably never been south of Manhattan. Still, in the rereadings, I began to notice passages which I suspected were a bit of artistic licence but not grounds for revocation. The book spurred me on as far as Central America and Africa but I haven't made it to the Upper Amazon as of yet. So in reading the two negative reviews here from two had spent some years down there, my glowing golden memories of the book were tarnished ever so slightly but not enough to keep me from replacing the copy of The Rivers Ran East I left behind in the Valley. Nor did the aspersions weaken my resolve to collect the other books which Clark authored. This is quite similar to my experiences in collecting the works of Count Byron de Prorok, another adventurer/explorer/archaeologist from that same period. I know you can get more accurate if tepid information from the likes of Wallace but I prefer people like Fawcett and Clark, who both went out in the mysterious grand manner of so many El Dorado/Lost City seekers. I suppose, in my mature years, I've come to prefer Aguirre, The Wrath of God over the latest National Geographic Amazon Special pc eye candy. I'm willing to cut Clark a lot of slack in exchange for a rip-snortin' high adventure classic like The Rivers Ran East which leaves the best Classic Pulp Fiction in the dust.

Then, for years, I completely forgot about it. During that time I lived and worked in the Orinoco and Amazon Basin as a field biologist. When I re-discovered this title I had been working in Amazonian Peru for over a decade. Happy to find the book, I purchased a copy and read it again. Only this time I found myself laughing out loud. Clark did in fact get around while he was in Peru, but he clearly had little understanding of either Spanish or Quechua, and he had a vivid imagination. His facts are such an unreliable mishmash that I could tell immediately where he spent the majority of his time down there: in the bar of the hotel. Perhaps the most telling thing is that, with experience in the region, one can discern the kernel of truth at the heart of each of Clark's fabrications. It is far more instructive to read the journals of great scientist-explorers like Alfred Russel Wallace, Richard Spruce, or Bates...all of whom traversed the Amazon under much more grueling conditions. Their accounts reveal all the wonders and hardships of the area but with none of the silly exaggerations."},{"Title":"The Rivers Ran East (U.K. Reprint)","review":"I've nothing to add to the others reviews, because you've said all.

The reviewer who is a biologist and worked in the Orinoco hit this on the head, \\"mishmash\\" is the right word. An incredible collection of odd facts, phrases, trivia, all woven together in a hilarious account. Anyone who has actually been in the rain forest in South America, which includes me on several occasions, knows this is pure hokum. Few animals are ever seen, and mostly it'd dark, green and quiet. But what makes this book so great is how much is going on every few lines--snakes are poised to strike, jaguars snarl, natives threaten. But it's all in fun and this really does beat Swiss Family Robinson, Robinson Crusoe and rivals Lord of the Ring for sheer fantasy enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Rivers Ran East (U.K. Reprint)","review":"Leonard Clark was my uncle, and the new edition having been released, I have recently re-read The Rivers Ran East.I found this book to be most incredible, not simply for the storytelling, but more importantly for Len's foresight into the value and preciousness of the South American rainforest. While he was admittedly not an environmentalist, he was truly a man ahead of his times in that respect. His appreciation for and finely detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna of the Amazon River basin are extremely topical and perhaps even more pertinent today than when he wrote the book. Among all else, he identifies specific native tribal practices and forest herbs as remedies unknown by Western medicine; as with many other products of the rainforest, these hold great promise and yet remain unresearched. Furthermore, his anthropological descriptions of the Amazonian natives capture a culture that now, just 50 years later, has largely been transformed to modern society and lost.Purely on a swash-buckling adventure-tale level, the book is priceless: this is a real-life Indiana Jones! Len's hair-raising stunts, death-defying experiences, and encounters with Amazonian headhunters hit the reader one after another with nearly a breath in between.Altogether five of Leonard's books were published: A Wanderer Till I Die (1937), The Rivers Ran East (1953), The Marching Wind (1954), Explorer's Digest (1955), and Yucatan Adventure (posthumously in 1958). All five make for fascinating reading. Many of his books were translated into Italian, Japanese, and other languages. My mother was Len's younger half-sister and I inherited her collection, which includes first editions in English of all five, as well as several of the translated versions, for example, the Japanese edition of The Marching Wind. In addition to The Rivers Ran East, The Marching Wind has also recently been republished and is now also available on Amazon.com. Beyond his books, articles by Len were published in National Geographic, Life, Literary Digest, Field and Stream, Popular Science, and American Weekly. The family still receives inquiries from time to time about possibly make a film based on one of his adventures, but none has been produced to date.All of Len's books except for A Wanderer Till I Die were written after World War II. However, it was during the war that he perhaps made his greatest - though unpublished - contributions. Leonard served as an officer in the OSS, spending a good portion of the war in the China-Burma-India corridor conducting intelligence work in the Yellow River valley. Near the end of the war, he was stationed on Formosa and accepted the first (unofficial) surrender of the Japanese there. He earned the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Order of the White Cloud with Ribbon, the highest honor given by the Chinese to the foreigners who served them.All of Leonard's works are fact, not fiction, and he is very highly regarded in our family as a military hero and quintessential adventurer. After the war, he built a log cabin near Fresno, California that I visited as a child. I remember Len as a large, quiet, gentle man who liked to tease us children, smoke his pipe, and take long contemplative walks in the woods with my mother. Yet he also embodied a sophistication, powerfulness, and seriousness that I sensed even as a child.Len was born on 1/6/1907. He died on 5/4/1957 under mysterious circumstances while exploring for gold and diamond mines on the Caroni River in Venezuela. You will find a fairly extensive biography in Current Biography, Volume 17, No. 1, January 1956, although this does not cover his last years. In addition, my father devoted 20 pages in our family history to Len.

It was the most incredible true adventure I had ever read, and it still is. I have read it repeatedly over the years; somehow the story is always fresh and exciting.Leonard Clark was a former intelligence officer and a first-class explorer when he set his sights on the fabled land of gold, El Dorado. He started his journey in Lima, Peru, in 1946, with a thousand dollars and a very old Spanish parchment map of El Dorado. One one person was going to accompany him: Jorge Mendoza, a young, college-educated Peruvian who spoke perfect English.Everyone in Lima remotely acquainted with the area Clark proposed to travel warned him not to go. Much of his path was through completely unexplored and impenetrable jungle territory, where people were regularly murdered or disappeared. Compounding the difficulty was the political situation in Peru, which forced Clark to take a very long and indirect route. He had to first travel east from Lima to Iquitos, then travel west to Borja and Bella Vista, in order to reach El Dorado. His 'cover' was that he was looking for medical secrets of the Indian brujos (witchmen). He did indeed discover amazing jungle remedies, many of which he brought back with him.The constant stress of heat and humidity; the threat of attacks by headhunting and cannibalistic Indians; insect bites (some of which could blind a man); dangers from wild animals, including enormous man-eating snakes -- and over it all, the incessant sounds of the jungle -- were nearly unendurable for the two men. Every single page in this book is captivating, packed with sounds and smells and images of the jungle that linger in your memory.About two-thirds of the way through the story, before they reached Iquitos, Jorge's brother died, and he left to head his family's estates -- leaving Clark alone. Inez Pokorny, an American woman who had already traveled for eight months on her way up the Amazon, accompanied Clark on the rest of his journey, from Iquitos west. Her help was inestimable; he described her as 'the best friend any explorer ever had.'Clark's journey and its culmination surpass any adventure fiction. This is a remarkable book -- describing not just an amazing treasure hunt, but one of the finest pieces of exploration in the Amazon Valley."},{"Title":"The Rivers Ran East (U.K. Reprint)","review":"I read this book many years ago and am now hoping to find copies for young friends just now poking their way into the world.

Well, I was not prepared for this journey. My jaw hit the floor on the first page and remained there throughout the whole incredible story. Clark's quirky personality and unbounded enthusiasm and belief in this trek to find the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola captured my imagination and had I been lucky enough to have been asked along on this trek, I would have followed without question. And all because of a treasure map someone sold him! The description of the silver and gold objects that had been reported was the most fabulous thing I had ever read or heard of. His ingenuity in getting over the difficult parts of the rivers on the trip out was amazing and his harrowing trek back to civilization kept me on the edge of my chair. And how clever of him to keep the best secret until last--they actually found gold. And Inez! No woman ever had a more interesting journey or life. I think young teens all the way up to seniors would be amazed to read about the part she played in this fabulous adventure. Before I really start gushing adjectives, I'll quit and just say read it.

I've been fascinated by the exploits of the great Victorian explorers, especially Sir Richard Francis Burton, for years. To me, Leonard Clark was probably the last of the Victorian-style explorers - facing the wilderness armed with few supplies, but inspired by a burning desire for exploration (with selfish reasons like gold thrown in for good measure).Like some of the other reviewers, I want more information.

It is packed with excellent information. No fluff, no wasted space, it gets right to the point. It is an obviously well researched and scholarly resource.I have the 1 volume softcover edition. The type is so small I can barely read it, but I discovered that I used it more because it was so handy. It is easily carried when I travel and is always kept nearby even at home.This is a serious resource. It contains information on everything. Outlines and backgrounds of the books of the Bible, Biblical cities and countries, Biblical characters, animals, trees and plants, some customs of the time (though very little compared to books written specifically for that purpose), and much more.The sad thing is, you can probably find it for $2.00 at a used book store, when the reality is that it is worth infinitely more than many of the higher priced modern books. If you can't afford an extensive library, you can learn a whole lot by using this book in your Bible study.

Borrow it from the library, or, at least, don't pay full price."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Sallie Tisdale starts off well, but never manages to answer the many questions she poses about food. In the end the book reads as an extended whinge. The introduction is basically the book, the rest is too often just extended repetition. The bibliography is especially light on credible historical sources,yet the history of food is often her subject. After a short time, Tisdale's glib assumption that she,her family,and her attitudes to food are the norm for all Americans passes from being ridiculous to being insulting. There are better books on the subject, notably &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; and &quot;The Primal Feast.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"I knew I would be in trouble when she repeated exactly the same quote from a cookbook only 6 pages apart. Still, I dutifully slogged through this book and came away disgusted and bored. She raises a few good points in the book, but those gems were obscured by her 300+ page diatribe against everything involving food. I got the sense that she doesn't particularly enjoy eating and can't consume even a bite of food without feeling either guilt or anger. And this book really has no sense of what it's supposed to be -- did she mean it to be a memoir? A social critique? Or just therapy for herself? Too bad this was actually nominated for a Beard award. It shows that food writing has a long way to go."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"This book was not at all what I expected based on the BOMC blurb. It is more an erudite treatise than a popular cultural commentary. It is an arcane essay on anthropological, sociological, and philosophical aspects of food &amp; food choices. The author says in the Introduction that \\"For many years, I've been a Zen Buddhist, and in many ways this is a matter of going against the tide of larger cultural forces around me.\\" The viewpoint flavors this endeavour. I give this book one big yawn. Now, hand over the Chalupa!"},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Tisdale is a hack at best and nothing she writes has much to do with life in general. She writes as if she's bothered with the process, less a critic and more a condescending harridan with a lot of words at her disposal. She certainly needs an editor but from what I gather, she's too difficult to be bothered. Bullheaded, opinionated and obstinate..she is definitely a bore. I would recommend any other book about food except this one. She should stick with what she thinks she knows: pretending to be a bisexual and being a bad parent."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Frankly, I gave up a third of the way through. The author sneers at American food, American food tastes, and American versions of ethnic food. Boy, has she got attitude!"},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"This is a thought provoking, wonderful, in-depth look at the food we eat and the recent and ancient history of where it comes from. Also celebrates the joy of cooking and eating. A philosophy and theology of food? Or just her meanderings? No matter. It is great food for thought."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"A must for all foodies who are interested in history and culture. It's a scholarly, well-researched book, and I will never look at &quot;fusion&quot; cooking in quite the same way.Seriously, I loved the book. What a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"This is a history of how, what and why Americans eat. The author looks at how corporations have dictated what we eat and the effects their decisions have had on our diet and health.The book contains many interesting facts and trivia - at times eye-opening, other times thought provoking. Tisdale relies heavily on research and opinions of others, but by bringing it all together gives us a broad and easy to digest picture of how we got where we are today in the world of food.The book starts as a memoir, with food a minor player. Having had a mother who disliked cooking (but did it day in and day out, nonetheless), her food memories are made up of things like Velveeta and white bread. She suggests that she had (or has) an unhealthy relationship with food and alludes often to weight problems.Initially she tries to define American cuisine, drawing heavily on other writers' ideas - both past and present. Eventually she brings us to the heart of the book, how corporate America has shaped what and how we eat since the 1800s. The information is fascinating and enlightening. Though we've heard much of it before, Tisdale offers new insights and a different perspective that really brings the truth home to in a non-confrontational way.One theme peripherally connected to food is the \\"myth\\" of timesaving appliances. She points out that the tie saved belongs mostly to the men, children and servants (for the wealthy at least) of the family, as the housewife and her shiny new appliances were left with all the domestic chores.Fast and prepared foods are probably here to stay, despite the slow foods movement and the embracing by the mainstream of local and seasonal eating. Tisdale implies that we have come full circle - now rejecting all things \\"corporate\\" and processed, yet at the same time buying prepared foods at the grocers and getting take-out for dinner; putting sodas and artificially-flavored, sugary breakfast cereals in are carts along side organic produce and whole grain foods.Tisdale concludes the book with a couple of rambling and mournful chapters. she moans: \\"each single thing [was] ruined because we want everything at once.\\" While the ending was less than satisfying, the bulk of the book was engrossing. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in food and its deeper cultural/social meanings."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"This books gives a great insight into why we all feel warm and fuzzy for certain foods. It is not always genetics, friends, or education of a food. We can again thank corporate America for our love of Wonder Bread and Betty Crocker. Sallie Tisdale really does a good job describing our love of food and the history of that love. A real page turner."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"We've all been told \\"never judge a book by its cover\\", and sadly that is true here. Based on the title, I was expecting (and hoping for) a book like Laurie Colwin's \\"Home Cooking\\", but I was sadly disappointed. Like many other reviewers, I only finished about half of the book because I was very tired of the author's whining. I kept waiting for the good part where she told us about the best thing(s) she ever tasted, but she wasn't writing a food memoir. I'm not really sure what she was writing about; all I got out of it was a disjointed collection of complaints and unintelligible thoughts about fusion, fisheries, and Zen Buddhism."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"What is Sallie Tisdale trying to say with this book? I read the entire book over the course of 3 months (small portions) and I never discovered &quot;the secret of food.&quot; This book is over 311 pages of disconnected musings. Each musing is well-written but there isn't a coherent whole. Its more like a coherent hole. A second helping? No thank you."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"While there are some interesting bits in this work, the author truly needed an editor who could organize the material. The book lacks focus and the author couldn't seem to decide what she wanted to write. Is this a memoir? Is this a work of gastronomic history? Is this a study of some aspects of American popular culture? It was not at all clear to me after a few days of laborious reading why this book was written."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"I was disappointed.I was looking forward to be informed and entertained about food, in a fond and celebrative way as implied by the title. Perish the thought! Although the contents and insights are worthy and well researched, it is also preachy and constantly harks back to the &quot;good ole days&quot;. Worse, it has a patronising attitude about American food habits / culture and a paranoid view, e.g. in chapter about white flour, a conspiracy theory about how consumers have been manipulated by the industry, well and good if she has a lively captivating style of writing. Instead, the overall impression is dry, dreary and remote; I gave up after reading a third of it."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Sallie Tisdale's book opens with her memory of trying to make acorn meal for a fourth grade class project. This childish idealism informs her entire book, most notably in the recurrent idea that medieval times were good times for gourmets. Tisdale frequently evokes &quot;medieval feasts&quot; as an example of a cohesive community enjoying locally produced food together, intentionally ignoring the fact that most medieval peasants (who were the majority of the population) lived on an unchanging diet of rotten porridge. We poor modern Americans, in contrast, are forced to subsist on a diet of meaningless variety, foisted upon us by heartless conglomerates and, even worse, chains: fast food restaurants, grocery stores, even health food chain stores. Big business is the unnamed villain of Tisdale's jeremiad. Like all nostalgia, Tisdale's reflections on food are built on a vision of a non-existent past and dissatisfaction with the present. Read only if you are in a foul mood and want a companion in your misery."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Sallie Tisdale's The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food is a collection of personal essays on Americans and their eating habits.I enjoyed the earlier essays; it was interesting to read about the influence of the big corporations on what women buy and how they cook it, even in how we view our own roles in our familes. Who hasn't heard and smirked over 'Nothing says lovin' like somethin' from the oven'? And I'm old enough to remember when no one was smirking.Her essays on the evils of fast food were interesting if not especially informative.But when she got the to the section on Americans and diet and began blaming corporate America for our obession with diet, I was ready to talk back. Her conclusion seem to be that since the advertising world was pushing thin, that it's okay to eat whatever. Sallie, I have no plans to grace the cover of Vogue but health is a motivating factor in my diet. Convince my doctor that I need to gain 10 pounds and I will.Too much personal opinion and too little objectivity."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Tisdale covers a lot of ground about the meaning of food. She touches on history, such as the first appearances of plates and utensils. But this is mostly about modern food history, specifically Tisdale's history, and by extension, our own.Tisdale reminisces about the meals she had growing up, meat at every meal, recipes from the Betty Crocker Cookbook and Peg Bracken's I Hate to Cook Book. She contrasts that with the food in her life now, as a Buddhist, organic, small-is-better, locally grown sort of person. On a whim, she makes her macrobiotic daughter a grilled Velveeta and white bread sandwich and is not really surprised when her daughter loves it.Tisdale discusses fast food (she still makes the occasional, disappointing, trip to McDonald's), eating out, dieting, and supermarkets. In a particularly interesting chapter, she ruminates on what makes Martha Stewart tick, and marvels at the way Martha kept correcting Julia Child on a TV appearance together.Many of the chapters in this book first appeared as magazine articles, and I look forward to more articles and books by Tisdale about food."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Like another reviewer here, I, too, first read the book and then the reviews. I was surprised to see that the book had only a three and one-half star average, as I found it to be a really thoughtful discussion of how we feel and think about food--a five-star read! Tisdale gives some really good historical insight into the evolution of our food culture and ideas. But, best of all for me, it was one of those books that had the ring of truth with my own psychological, physical, and emotional experiences of eating. Too often food writers come off as uppity and pretentious, even when they are trying hard not to be. Sallie Tisdale quite naturally does NOT have this problem. Like good food, Tisdale's writing is just rich enough to be delicious. Maybe it helps to be middle-aged and to have had some of the same eating experiences growing up as Tisdale had, and, maybe it's like another reviewer says--a person either loves or hates this book. (Another of my favorite books/authors is like that--people seem to love or hate Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's HIDDEN LIVES OF DOGS.)Anyway, I really love Tisdale's writing style, so much so that I found myself reading aloud from this book last night to my husband, who thoroughly enjoyed the chapter I shared with him.THE BEST THING I EVER TASTED is yummy!"},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Instead of being a charming food memoir, Tisdale takes the reader on a dreary deathmarch through her own unending guilt over her abandonment of her glorious hippie co-op past. One gets the feeling that all of the lights in her emotional life have been dimmed by the overhanging cloud of her loneliness for those brown rice and tofu days. I wanted to stop half way through, but came upon one of the only nuggets of intriguing and insightful writing where she discusses her own relationship to food and dieting. Encouraged, I pressed on, but now wish I hadn't so that I could have been spared her assault on every cook from James Beard to Julia Child to anyone who might dare cook anything without spelt and unpasteurized Portland goat milk!"},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"I have been reading her books for years, but this time she has outdone herself. This is at once incisive social commentary about food and famine, asceticism and dieting, an elegy for a way of eating (and being) that is gone (and may never have been), and a memoir of her family's (especially that of her mother) history that continues to sadden her.About The Zone diet, she says, &quot;What he [Barry Sears] does is tell his readers again and again...how to get the body we evolved to protect ourselves from having--that lean, mean, hungry look.&quot; You should read this book."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"After reading the first few chapters I told my mother about this wonderful book I was reading, and said I'd pass it along once I was done. I later realized that she would probably feel put on the defensive by my recommendation and wouldn't enjoy the book at all.Why? Because Tisdale asks her readers to reflect upon things many Americans don't want to think about. That the decision about what to put on (or leave off) the table for dinner might be in any way influenced by advertising, social history or the government isn't something my mother really wants to consider.I have always counted on Tisdale to make me think about everyday life differently, and this book is no exception. I found it to be well researched and a thoroughly enjoyable read. I believe it would be great for people interested in gender studies, American studies and sociology."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"I read the book, then I read the reviews, and was amazed at how contatradictary they are: Either you hate this book or you love it. Tisdale asks us to examine our appetites, and that makes some folks very touchy-- so touchy they didn't even finish the book! I think that's a shame. I found it well-researched, well-reasoned and well-written."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Tisdale here uses humor, history and her own insights to explain the lust for food and flavors, examining how this instinct controls eating conception habits and choices. From the extravagance of medieval feasts to modern culinary trends and including the publishing industry's winners, Best Thing I Ever Tasted is lively, fun and informative."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"This is the first book I have read by Tisdale, but it will not be the last. Despite flaws, Tisdale's book contains passages, sentences, that stopped me dead because they were profound insights. In her introduction, she captured a moment of small despair and ennui -- the kind of moment that haunts you from childhood -- and identified its context and revealed at least one meaning. This is rare. I was happy to continue to find similar gems throughout the book.As to the harsher critics' comments: I agree that the book would benefit from another edit, but that is not a fatal flaw. I agree that this is much more of a group of essays than one cohesive work; however, I think that this is a rather doctrinaire criticism, and the structure of loosely related essays was not at all troubling to me. I agree that Tisdale leaves the reader with questions rather than answers. I'm not quite sure why that is a problem -- I welcome writers (artists, actors, philosophers, etc.) who are willing to shed light on the shades of grey, rather than explain to us why their &quot;black&quot; is preferable to someone else's &quot;white.&quot; I tend to think of such work as provocative and demanding. I also tend to think that it is a rather appropriate tone to take with the subject -- perhaps it's not as easy to recognize and appreciate as a Happy Meal, and perhaps that's part of the point. It is a somewhat academic book -- but it's readable and approachable. For example, I think Tisdale likely has, through this book, instilled core theories of semiology in people who would otherwise never encounter them, and she does so gently, in plain English, long before she ever mentions the name of Roland Barthes.Perfection is far too much to ask of anyone. This is a lovely book, provocative and interesting, in which the writer avoids self-indulgence, whining, proselytizing, or placing herself beyond reproach."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Ms Tisdale has written for us a most sensitive, intelligent and well researched personal account of her relation to food in our present society. With so many others who have come to see the hate/love relationship we have towards what should be a high point of daily life, she has touched upon the delights that can be had from a well thought-out meal without torturing ourselves about the high pollution of pre-prepared foods nor about the amount of calories, fats or additives that each 'new' scientific discovery tells us to be aware of. One would almost get the feeling that Ms Tisdale tells us: 'dare to live'. I highly recommend this book for lifting up your 'hunger' spirits and I have bought several copies for friends. PS The averse reactions of this wonderfully warm and loving book speak for themselves as obviously Ms Tisdale gets often too close for comfort."},{"Title":"The Best Thing I Ever Tasted: The Secret of Food","review":"Tisdale has always written from the heart informed with an eagle's eye view of whatever subject she focuses on. Food just happens to be the latest target. There is a lovely seduction in reading her prose, whether she's writing about the milling process and its evocation of &quot;whiteness&quot; to her nostalgic recollections of her mother's venture into the brave new world of food processing. The blurring of regions, globally and nationally, is something we take for granted and her commentary on the inevitable effect it has, homogenization, is keen and precise. She writes with wisdom and insight and I've read almost everything she's ever written. She just keeps getting better with time."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"This book was just what I needed. I just started as freshmeat with the Philly Roller Girls and read this book before I went to tryouts. It gave me an inside look at what I might expect in the derby world.

Although the author continuously claims that she is \\"not cool\\" in real life, one would never know it. She has great wit and tells her story with charm, vivaciousness and intelligence...what could be more cool?I highly recommend this book, even if you're not a Derby Girl. For some people, it may be the closest they come to getting to know one!"},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"From Austin, Texas to Seattle, Washington all the way to the Big Apple, even as far as Great Britain and New Zealand, roller derby is back and it's for real! All over the United States and the world, groups of strong, tough, determined women are lacing up their skates, strapping on helmets, elbow and knee pads and mouth protectors to go out and show what they're made of on the oval track. This book, by Melissa 'Melicious' Joulwan, is the definitive story of the birth and explosive growth of the flat track roller derby revolution as told by one of the women who started it all.Beginning with her own introduction to the sport as a spectator in Austin, Texas circa 2001, Melicious tells how the Texas roller derby revival made its first shaky steps, on to the founding of the Texas Rollergirls, of which she was an original member, through their first season championship and culminating with their victory at the 2006 Dust Devil National Championship in which the best players of 20 different leagues from cities all across the U.S. competed in the one place for the very first time. In addition, the story is augmented throughout with quotes, anecdotes and profiles of a variety of rollergirls, mostly from original members of the Texas Rollergirls, but also including some members from other leagues, including Seattle's Rat City Rollergirls. Full disclosure: I'm a hardcore member of the Rat Pack, as Rat City's fans are collectively known.(On a side note, the Rat City Rollergirls won the 2007 Dust Devil Western Regional Championship in February, in one day defeating both #1 Texas and #2 Tucson in back to back upset victories, making them the #1 seed in the upcoming National Championship which will take place in September 2007.)This book is very easy to read and I often had a hard time putting it down. As an author, Melicious is down to earth, with an engaging writing style and it's clear from the way the stories are told, in frank and occasionally embarassing detail, that these are authentic rollergirl stories. I love this book and whether you are a devoted fan like me or you're just curious what it's all about, you should read this book! Buy it, borrow it, steal it (well, maybe not steal it) whatever you have to do, get this book and read it. You won't regret it.Let's roll!"},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I loved recounting some of the things that I encountered in my rise to rollerderbyness!I'm glad I bought this book.

Melicious has written an perfect description of today's roller derby that mirrors my own experiences. And, she's done it with humor and accurate detail.

Its an entertaining and informative peek into a world not many will experience."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I'm not sure which is more fun: reading the book, reading her blog or meeting \\"Melicioius\\".This is a slammin book and I loved it."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I picked this up just weeks into learning how to skate on quads in an effort to join my local league. I read it in record time, feeling her passion, experiencing the ups and downs, and celebrating along the way. It really ignited my interest in roller derby and helped me to not give up. I just participated in my first bout, and then I really understood the high and elation expressed in Rollergirl.

I was thrilled to read this and could not put it down! I finished it in less than a day. It had a fun section on how to choose a Derby Name (of course I read this right after name submissions) and I learned why so many leagues are \\"by the skater, for the skater!\\" I had never considered what it would be like to be in a league where the board wasn't as concerned with our safety as our board is.

I would highly recommend it to anybody who is into roller derby."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I bought this book just before buying a pair of beginner skates and deciding that roller derby might be just what I want to do.I wanted a firsthand account of starting derby out of nowhere from newbie to veteran.More or less, this is what I got. The fresh meat part wasn't as thorough as I'd hoped, but it was still nice to get some insight.The writing is fun and light, and its an easy read to just keep turning the page, turning the page. Melicious has a great sense of humor and really adds personality to the book (as if it could possibly be lacking when its about derby girls!!)I totally reccomend the book, and as a plus it comes with a lot of pics and some background on how the flat track derby league was started.I also reccomend watching \\"Hell on Wheels\\" to understand the work and trials that the original derby gal's overcame in order for the sport to bew what it is today."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"Loved it.

Melicious from the Texas Rollergirls (flat track association) tells her roller derby saga - from watching her first bout, to joining the Bad Girls Good Woman league to the split in factions and subsequent formation of the Texas Rollergirls and Texas Lonestar Roller Derby Girls. Anyone interested in the Woman's Flat Track Roller Derby Association (WFTDA) could also benefit from this book, as it tells the tale of how the whole dang flat track revolution started. An easy read from front to back, Rollergirl Totally True Tales From the Track, was worth every penny."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"Roller derby is back, but very different from the banked track derby that many people remember from the 70's. The reimagination of derby as a flat track, skater-run sport started with a single league in Texas in 2003. Today, there are leagues of smart, strong women all over the country ready and willing to step into their skates and knock a bitch down.A fascinating history of flat track roller derby, starting with the founding of the Texas Rollergirls in 2003, and continuing through th Dust Devil National Championship in 2006. Quotes, stories, and profiles from real rollergirls, in addition to fast-paced derby action, make this a book that will be almost impossible for skaters or fans of derby to put down.Melicious describes her immediate enchantment with the sport after seeing a bout and her subsequent trip to the rink for her first practice. I could relate because I had the same reaction. Even though I hadn't been on skates since middle school, my local team has welcomed me and is patiently teaching me how to hold my own on eight wheels.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I attended the very same roller derby bout that inspired Melicious to become a rollergirl. I was awed and wildly entertained by the spectacle of roller derby and really wanted to join up myself. Unlike Melicious I was too scared to do something that looked like soooo much fun. The girls out there just looked so intense. I just didn't think there was any way I could do something like that. I've continued to attend roller derby and have enjoyed the heck out of it. But, I always wished I had the courage to try-out.So, when I received 'Rollergirl' as a present last month I was thrilled to read about a sport that I enjoyed watching so much. I'm happy to say that I loved this book. It's fun, and entertaining, with tons of great stories about the early days of the roller derby revival. I enjoyed reading about all the behind-the-scenes stuff, and the fun stories of roller derby drama.The best part, is that this book inspired me to finally pursue my dream of being a rollergirl. The way Melicious describes her league and her fellow rollergirls made them seem strong, but also human. The more I read, the more I realized that roller derby is full of regular chicks just like me. They practice hard, and they skate like demons but they are real people. So, I'm officially inspired to try-out. I've got my speed skates, skate lessons, and tons of gear. I've also got butterflies in my stomach and a whole lot of admiration for Melicious for showing me that I could do something I really wanted to do.Thanks!"},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"Imagine living a fairly quiet life, having come out of the \\"dog eat dog\\" corporate world and moved to laid-back Austin, Texas. A real, enjoyable change has taken place in your life. However, one day you go and see a flat track roller derby match, and you are hooked so much by what you have seen, you decide to try out for roller derby.This is just the beginning of a personal journey by author Melissa Joulwan, aka: Melicious, who describes in her book Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track an amazing adventure that brought an admitted nerd into team sports.Readers find out that Melicious in fact worked very hard to get as good as she could, and loved skating with her teammates, although after her first regular season, felt there was nothing really satisfying about the team sport aspect of this new activity. That situation would change, and so readers share in that pursuit that saw the formation of skater-owned and operated flat track roller derby, and eventually the formation of well over 150 roller derby leagues throughout the world.I found this book to be difficult to put down, although Ms. Joulwan's descriptions are so vivid at times I had to slow down and savor her writing. For a roller derby fan like me, it was a thrill to find out how the revival of roller derby in this decade came about. It was fascinating to hear stories like how her first pair of roller derby skates used for tryouts were just the wrong color (white) and so her husband Dave drew an anarchy symbol on them in magic marker to make them derby acceptable.It is the first of many wonderful stories in this book. Highlights include the story of how a major injury in an uninsured venue, drove a split in the organization she was skating in, and eventually led to a skater-run league that would be the pattern for most emerging roller derby leagues in the next four years. It is also satisfying to read about her many friends and co-league skaters, all of whom seem to have very unique backgrounds that came together in this passionate love of an emerging sport.And for Melicious, after four years of skating, and being a fan at the first National Flat Track Championship in Tucson, Arizona, a real transformation had taken place. The former nerd and sometimes roller skater had become a teammate, and a sports participant. She had gone from an empty feeling on team sports early in her derby experience, to understanding the artistry and strategy in other team sports.This book is a must read for fans of roller derby, but I also think it is an excellent read for sports fans in general. As a sports fan, and a former player and coach in sports, this book reminded me of the unique qualities of team sports. Winning games and derby bouts may be nice, but the discipline of sports and the friends who support the effort are invaluable. These teammates and friends are truly treasures of life and I think Ms. Joulwan has done an excellent job of communicating this in Rollergirl: True Tales from the Track."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"Not only does this book explain the neat history of derby and the even neater story of the author's rise to derby stardom, it gives the reader a wicked personal boost. Melicious' positive attitude is refreshing and infectious. It's high time we have a strong, smart, and savvy role model who proves that women of all ages and all backgrounds can excel both on and off the track. The perfect gift for your friends, moms, kids, etc."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"When Melissa Joulwan saw her first roller derby bout way back in 2001, she was immediately hooked. Having just moved to Austin and looking for ways to reinvent herself, the chance to become Melicious, a roller derby powerhouse, seemed like the answer to her prayers. Little did she know what she -- and the rest of the world -- was in for.As a sport that had come in and out of fashion since the Great Depression, roller derby was all but dead when a gang of girls from Austin, Texas got ahold of it. Through hard work, determination, and an unwavering desire to strap on a pair of skates and knock each other over, the Texas Rollergirls single-handedly launched a flat-track roller derby revolution. Currently the fastest growing women's sport in America and boasting over 160 DIY, grassroots leagues in cities across the nation, roller derby has broken barriers, changed lives, and formed countless relationships and communities.As one of the founding members of the Texas Rollergirls, Melicious has been there from the beginning, and in Rollergirl she spills it all -- the early interleague drama, the first public bouts, the heartbreaking and bone crushing injuries, and the \\"by the skaters, for the skaters\\" ethos that has sustained roller derby through thick and thin. A memoir, a history book, a how-to manual, and all told in an intimate, conspiratorial tone, Rollergirl is an epic ode to a sport that's so much more than just a game. You don't have to love derby to get a kick out of Rollergirl, but I dare you to remain indifferent once you finish. In fact, you might just find yourself compelled to don a pair of fishnets and seek out a slice of glory on your own eight wheels.And somewhere, anywhere, there's a roller derby league waiting with open arms to take you in -- and knock you down."},{"Title":"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track","review":"I loved this book so much!!

It is a well-written narrative of one woman's experience with flat-track roller derby. This experience is framed within the history of the sport and laced with details of the sport's re-emergence. Insights are provided into the role of the skater's persona, team identity, and the relationships between the fans and the skaters.

A quick flip through would have revealed that most of the five star ratings come from fellow Derby skaters and fans, and, sure, I can see how this would be a great read for them.But once the successful formation of the new league has been covered, the book wallows around in mundane details that weren't really of very much interest to the average civilian.

It is a raw and unpolished book that gets a bit racy at times. It is obviously riding on the success of the A&E TV series \\"Rollergirls\\". The book successfully maintains the tone of the popular series. Another facet of its success comes from the dearth of current books about one of the fastest growing phenomenons in sports today. All the Roller Derby skaters and fans will read this book. They will get a straight forward in your face account of events a seen by the author.

Other than the two-laminated pullout charts, the entire book appears to have been printed on a laser printer. Only about half of this book contains technical information. The rest of the book is filler. Information such as the history of the HP printers and a cross-reference chart of OEM toner cartridges to the authors refilled toner cartridges make up the second half of this book. I later purchased a genuine HP Quick Reference manual for half the price of this book and found it to be far more informative.Perhaps one of the most insulting portions of this book was the constant sales pitches that where made to use the authors refilled toner cartridges. In the event that the charts in the book does not provide you with the information you're seeking, the author supplies you with a phone number to call for more information. When I did call this phone number I didn't receive the answer to my question.

Save your money."},{"Title":"The Africa Cookbook","review":"It is hard to complain about a book that is so well written and attractively put together. Ms. Harris has done a very good job, and this is a welcome addition to the small (but growing) collection of African cookbooks. Many African dishes (e.g., Poulet Yassa or Groundnut Stew) deserve to be as well known as classic dishes from Europe, Asia, or the Americas, and Ms. Harris is doing something to make make these dishes better known. She has also collected a great many lesser known recipes, so there's something here for everyone. To the extent that she provides some information about African food, it tends to be anecdotal, though nothing is incorrect as far as I can tell. It may be a bit too much to expect one book to describe the gastronomy of an entire continent. (Could we imagine a book called &quot;The Europe Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent&quot;?) and therein is the problem.This book's title says &quot;continent&quot; and it contains recipes from Western Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern Africa and some from Northern Africa. My real complaint is the complete absence of recipes from Central Africa -- the Congo River basin area. This willful ignorance (in the sense of &quot;to ignore&quot;) of Central Africa seems to be common among &quot;fair-weather Africanists&quot;; it also occurs in &quot;Wonders of the African World&quot; by Henry Louis Gates. It is distressing to see that even as we enter the 21st millenium there is still a &quot;dark place&quot;, an unknown place on the map of Africa, much as Conrad described in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; over a century ago. True, there has been a civil war going on in Congo, and before that Zaire was not an easy place to travel. But there are many Congolese who live in Europe and America who could have provided insight into to the gastronomic traditions of Central Africa. Ms. Harris seems to have picked only the low hanging fruit. Of course it is much easier and pleasant to travel and dine in Senegal and Ivory Coast, or Kenya and Zanzibar rather than Congo and the Central African Republic, but if you want to say your book covers the continent, you can't ignore the very heart of Africa.Ms. Harris has written a good book, despite the fact that it ignores the very heart of Africa. If you're interested in cooking you should have some African recipe collections; this is a good one. Other good African cookooks that contain not only recipes but also very good writing that puts the recipes into a cultural context (but also mostly ignore Central Africa) are:Ellen Gibson Wilson - &quot;A West African Cookbook: An introduction to food from Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.&quot;Laurens van der Post - &quot;Foods Of The World: African Cooking&quot; (from Time-Life) and &quot;First catch your Eland: a taste of Africa&quot;"},{"Title":"The Africa Cookbook","review":"This book is wonderful for anyone interested or experienced in Africa or cooking, because it gives recipies from all over the continent from soup to nuts, ie. main courses, salads, desserts, the range of food items.

The author, a food historian, draws on her many experiences traveling through the continent in this collection of recipes. The recipes are authentic and tasty, and many of them are quite easy to prepare. However, I found a few of them a little unrealistic (such as frying slices of four small eggplants in a single tablespoon of olive oil without so much as soaking them in saltwater first), leaving me wondering to what extent Harris had actually tested the recipes. Nonetheless, overall the book contains many exciting recipes and would make a welcome addition to the library of any adventurous cook."},{"Title":"The Africa Cookbook","review":"Jessica Harris is a national treasure. This is so much more than a cookbook, though it is certainly an excellent representative of that genre.

As an African, many of the recipes have, well, quite obviously not been made by the author but instead garnered from others, errors and all. Which is why she suggests that Nigerians make eba with palm oil... ah. no, no they don't... I doubt they actually incorporate the oil into cassava... not sure how that would work... these and other little quirks made the book funny in a laughable kind of way, but not practical... or accurate really. I do appreciate the idea, and hope a real African who has lived on the continent can make a good cookbook showing different recipes from all over the continent (as herculean a task as that would be) Also, lots of typos... not sure how that's possible in a cookbook...but it happened. Long story short, this is a good book to impress your friends with if you're not African and want to show how diverse your interests are. If you are African, this is a good book to have a laugh at with other Africans."},{"Title":"The Africa Cookbook","review":"its great recipees from my homeland, i can create different tastes of my homeland africa for delicious great thre course menus and buffets"},{"Title":"The Africa Cookbook","review":"The book is a nice introduction to African cooking with hard to find senegalese recipes. However, the ethiopian selection is ridiculous, there are so many wonderful possibilites and yet she chose to include a recipe for raw beef with instructions that make it clear she knew very few if any readers would actually want to make this dish. That I found very disappointing."},{"Title":"Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press","review":"Many Americans have grown increasingly disenchanted with the quality of national news coverage and journalist Kenneth Walsh is one of them. Taking aim at the vindictiveness and sensationalism that pervades coverage of the White House in particular, Walsh attributes much of the blame, not surprisingly, to shorter news cycles that encourage reporters to &quot;advance the story&quot; with &quot;hard-edged&quot; analysis and predictions, fierce competition for ratings, and the public's appetite for entertainment over hard news. The strength of the book, I believe, lies in his interviews with White House reporters and network news anchors. Their reactions to Walsh's questions struck me as running the gamut from surprisingly self-aware and candid to hopelessly defensive, sarcastic and naive. The weaknesses of the book, while not outweighing the strengths, are manifold. Walsh takes too much time to detail how, at the outset, Clinton and his youthful press secretaries needlessly antagonized the press; in the end, he concedes that Clinton's aversion to &quot;gotcha&quot; journalism is well-founded, and that even deft handling of the White House press would have done little to curb rampant negativism. And while he criticizes the Clintons for failing to reveal enough of their private personas to the media, Walsh also acknowledges that the unquenchable press appetite for this sort of information exceeds the limits of human toleration. My most serious reservations concern the author's conclusions. After identifying the competitive pressures that drive the news business, Walsh seems to forget about them as he lamely calls on journalists to restore professional standards. And although many would agree with him that Washington reporters often seem out of touch with the public, his cliched recommendation that reporters reconnect with the &quot;real&quot; America, MIddle America, seems to contravene his own agenda. If Middle America had a greater predilection for hard news and reasoned presentation, as offered for example on public radio and TV, it seems to me that commercial news sources would be only too happy to oblige them."},{"Title":"Water Birth: A Midwife's Perspective","review":"I had heard of and was considering a water birth for my first pregnancy. After reading Napierala's book I wonder why waterbirths are not everyone's choice. Now it seems a &quot;no brainer.&quot; She gives wonderful detail on options, methods and benefits of waterbirths. She paints the picture of waterbirth as spiritual and gentle; the way a birth should be. Also included are moving birth stories. Plus a &quot;how to build a tank&quot; chapter for midwives. Excellent resource to show skeptical grandparents as well!"},{"Title":"Water Birth: A Midwife's Perspective","review":"I became interested in water birth because I have back problems, and the only way I've been able to have a normal range of motion has been in the water. Being in the pool takes the pressure of gravity from the baby off my back, and warm water relaxes my stiff muscles. Water Birth gave me tons of detailed info, and thoroughly explained advice on the complete water birth process: the history behind it, how to make a tank, what problems may come up, and laboring in the water. The book isn't just a bunch of fluff that you could've just found by doing a net search. Yet it does contain beautiful stories that really draw you into the sacred experience while reading, which makes it interesting as well as informative. I bought this book in combination with Active Birth (revised edition). While Water Birth does outline some different positions a woman can try to help her labor progress, Active Birth focuses on this 10 times more, and has better diagrams to show what's happening inside a woman when she's going through the different stages of labor and pushing the baby out. I really needed these extra anatomical diagrams, lengthy explanations, and numerous positions so I could see how different positions would affect my spine. If you have a back problem as well, I'd suggest buying these two books, as they've complimented one another for me."},{"Title":"Water Birth: A Midwife's Perspective","review":"Read this book after attending my sister's water birth (which was amazing).

I hope all goes well for mine:) I loved all the pics and detailed info on positions and pushing etc."},{"Title":"Water Birth: A Midwife's Perspective","review":"Water Birth: A Midwife's Perspectiveis one of the few books entirely devoted to childbirth in water. Written by a Californian midwife who helped pioneer the contemporary interest in water births back in the 1980's and early 1990's, it is authoritative guide for those seeking a water birth as well as for birth practitioners. The author Susanna Napierala provides a wealth of personal experience and first-hand accounts. She also scrupulously cites her sources when discussing the history of the modern practice of water births and the benefits of laboring and/or delivering in water.The one caveat for this book is that is was published in 1994, so the information it contains is slightly dated. While once considered experimental and viewed as suspect, the American attitude towards water births has changed. Many U.S. hospitals now have birthing tubs in their labor and delivery suites and offer the option of water births for low risk mothers, and a variety of birthing tubs including inflatable ones can be purchased or rented via the internet for those planing a home birth.Many of the concerns raised by the author -- such as whether or not a women should be allowed to labor in water once her membranes have broken due to the risk of infection -- have been answered over the last quarter of a century. The standard practices described might have also changed or evolved, so check with your doctor, midwife, or doula if you have any questions."},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"This book is so good! I am a hardcore Osbournes fan[long before the tv show and I thought I knew everything there is to know about them so I got excited when I heard they were doing this book but I had doubts that it would reveal much I didnt already know.

I give Sharon a lot of credit on what she has been put through in her marriage to Ozzy. She is an amazingly strong person that is dedicated and truly loves her family.

Not only was the story fascinating and at times sad, it gave me a huge perspective on Ozzy's behavior and what makes him tick. The photo bonus in the middle of the book is a true treasure. It was so good, I read the whole thing from cover to cover in less than 3 hours! Definitely worth every penny spent!"},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"Without the editing of MTV, Ozzy and family come across differently and more honestly. Here we see them, warts and all, and realize just what they've had to overcome in their personal lives. It hasn't been easy for Ozzy and Sharon to maintain their relationship through the drug and alcohol abuse, not to mention the spousal abuse that occurred periodically. When Jack, Aimee, and Kelly describe how they felt watching the police handcuff their father and drag him out of the house the night he tried to kill their mother; it's important to know this side of the story. The Osbournes are very funny to watch on their MTV show, but read this book to get the true picture of their lives."},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"I really loved the beginning of the book! Sharon and Ozzy's childhoods and the beginnings of their careers in the music industry are fascinating stories. I can honestly say, though, that I started to get a little irritated and frustrated by their daughter Aimee's entries in the book. When you read Jack and Kelly's entries, it is mostly a &quot;this is what I remember happening and this is how I felt,&quot; but with Aimee, she rants on and on with her opinions. She may say that she feels her family is making fools of themselves by doing this show, but I don't think any less of them, and I actually can say that I admire how they've survived all these tragedies. She's lucky they won't cut her out of the dough after all the money they've made!"},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"Just go ahead and buy it because its the only book of its kind with almost the entire book in Ozzy and Sharon's words(the remaining from the three kids). And take it from a longtime Ozzy die-hard, Ozzy and Sharon spill personal issues and stories never written about in any other Ozzy book. A must read for any Ozzy fan."},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"I loved this book. When you watch the show you get an edited version of the family so it is nice to have something that gives you true insight. I especially loved that Aimee put her views in. I really think Sharon is dynamic and an inspiration to all women. There was a part that I think about daily, Sharon said that in America its more acceptable to be a drug addict than to be fat. If I could pick one family to have dinner with this would be my choice thanks to this book!"},{"Title":"Ordinary People: Our Story","review":"Thank the Lord for the Osbournes !

Cheers to the family Osbourne, I tip my hat to them and gladly welcome all they have to say."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"I would ask that Willard Gaylin burn his mail-order psychiatric degree and take classes at a real university. How anyone can claim that he is a \\"leading\\" theoretician, educator, or anything else in the field, for that matter, astounds this reviewer beyond belief. Such praise should be considered insulting to the rest of psychiatry as a whole.This book is not \\"groundbreaking.\\" It presents no new or previously unheard-of information. All that this book accomplishes is the terrible feat of translating old assumptions and excuses about racism/other hatreds, commonly made from an anglo-saxons/Americans first ideology, and the evidence commonly used to support such assumptions into mid-level technical and medical dialogue. Not quite so advanced that the average educated reader can't understand it, but high enough to lower the burden of proof. The author's supposed medical credentials lend him even more undeserved trust.The result is a book that encourages change, but not in the manner you'd think. Instead of decreasing or raising awareness of hatred, this book demonizes a small portion of that which it claims to fight while justifying and encouraging a great deal more of the same kind of hatred targeted at other groups and individuals.Who cares about the situation?Who cares about one's neurological makeup?Who cares about the fact that violent crime rates in the U.S. are the lowest they've been since the 1960s?Who cares about any of that?It was written by a DOCTOR! He must be right!Nothing's subjective at all! Those filthy arabs are just jealous of America!It disgusts this reviewer to think that such a pile of 100% grade-A concentrated propaganda can pass as a respectable psychiatric thesis. If this is the \\"cream of the crop\\", then psychiatric medicine it might as well be flushed down the toilet.I would have given this book a lower rating, if I could. Unfortunately, Amazon's user-rating method is incapable of going into negative numbers."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"In an era of mass-marketed books pertaining to jihad, hatred, etc, it's so refreshing to find one that actually gets to the ROOT of hatred. Dr. Gaylin systematically dissects, piece by piece, the mentality of those who hate -- and what's more striking is the simplicity in which it is all delivered.I am never one who is attracted to dark subjects, but this is so much more than mere horror stories of [end of a race]: it is a study and analysis of the dark side of human nature. The book serves to help us to understand how people born under the same sun as us, when in the right circumstances, commit such unthinkable acts of horror.A must read."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"This is an incredible book, but one with a limited focus. It seeks to better understand how to contain isolated acts of violence associated with hatred, rather than how to deal with the cumulative effects of normalized, sublimated societal hatred-that is hatred permitted and made acceptable by a given culture or society.It seems that the anecdotal evidence from history would overwhelmingly argue that \\"normalized\\" and sublimated cultural and societal hatred in the form of sanctioned \\"bent-up\\" resentment and stored hostility (as in the case of the passive assent of Germans to the mechanized murder of Jews during the holocaust of WW-II, or the centuries of sublimated and stored hatred between opposing factions in Yugoslavia or Rwanda, or even the episodic eruption into violence by blacks in America).While this profoundly serious, well-written and well-researched analysis based both on the best psychological theories and the best results of clinical experience is right on target in the issue it has isolated for analysis-the evil of hatred that spills over into violence--it suffers from what I call \\"the error of the psychologist.\\" It fails to deal with the issue of how cultures and societies themselves promote collective hatred through its institutions and through conditioning. When hatred that spills over into isolated violence is staked out as being qualitatively different than collective hatred that has been quietly normalized and diffused through the societal mind and through societal structures, it ignores all available evidence that there is such a thing as \\"structural hatred,\\" a kind of societal pre-positioning of hate, or staging area that prepares and directs a culture towards the kind of hate that is permissible.While it is understandable why it is currently fashionable to focus on the \\"Hitlers\\" and \\"bin Ladens\\" of the world, this focusing on the aberrant is itself a form of projection in which ordinary people get to \\"distance\\" themselves from the hatred within themselves by projecting it outward onto the isolated aberrant cases. In giving us permission to ignore the hatred within us and to hate any deviations from the norm, it is made all the easier to ignore the generalized collective hatred within the society at large--a hatred which condones and conditions us to passivity-the very kind of passivity that allowed Hitler's holocaust machinery to take full reign.This may seem like a fine point-so many angels dancing on the head of a pin-but in an era where symbolic hatred is so much easier to formulate, consolidate and direct than hatred based on \\"real\\" fears, it is not a small matter at all.Yes, we must deal with the killers of James Bird, and the Idi Amins and bin Ladens of the world, but we also must deal with cultures of hatred-including that of our own. In the U.S., by the definitions the author uses for hate, Americans still have permission to hate blacks-so long as they do not hitch them to a pick up truck and drag them to their death, or call them \\"niggers\\"-at least only do so when paraphrasing Mark Twain's Huck Finn, etc.This restricting one's clinical vision to what is below rather than what is at or above the societal level makes the Psychiatrist's myopic analyses look a great deal more profound and useful than they really are. We live in a culture where everyone but the Psychiatrists is peering over the head of society looking deep down within its abyss rather than being captivated by what is inside it and looking up.The Psychiatrists had better wake up or they are going to be left holding the bag. But this criticism aside, this is a great book, much, much better than Rush Dozier's \\"Why We Hate.\\""},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"I have only read half of the book so far and I am literally riveted by the writing style and the content of this book. It has opened, for me, a whole new perspective on the difference between those that hate - like the Osama's &amp; Ted Bundy's of the world - and the those that feel an emotional-based rage or anger and may impetuously act on it. It IS an all together different thing to hate in the manner that Dr. Gaylin talks about. Please read this book. As a society we need to stop condoning/romanticizing some behaviors on our own misconceptions of what they are."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"In the spirit of a number of books attempting to unearth the roots of evil, this book has its place. And an important place it is. Gaylin, like Kekes (Facing Evil, 1990) and even Armstrong in her \\"Battle for God\\" (2000) refer to behavior as a function of a multiplicity of factors including, most of all culture (Patai, The Arab Mind). As humans we rationalize as Goleman tells us in his classic book on psychological defense and self deception (Goleman, Vital Lies Simple Truths,1997). None of these books are definitive of the subject matter nor are they meant to be. They are, instead, sincere attempts to understand phenomena, like \\"militant piety\\" (Armstrong,2000) that defy any and all logic. In particular, I appreciated Gaylin's chapter on \\"The Psychotic and the Psychopath\\", because these two distinct yet related diagnosis have much to teach us about aberrant and hateful behavior. In case you were wondering, there are no solutions to this dilemma we call, hatred. Human perversity is not curable (Kernberg, 1995) and yet we are fascinated by its labyrinth structure. Intelligent people want to understand what makes them tick so that they can 'tick', so to speak, better and faster than their competitors. \\"Moral Relativism\\" denies absolute evil and in the spirit of Gaylin, Kekes (Facing Evil; The Roots of Evil) and Menninger (What Happened to Sin), agree with his thesis that moral clarity must be a lifelong pursuit. I find Gaylin's ideas informative and stimulating and if he promotes serious discussion on the topics of evil, hatred, and destructiveness in this our age of terrorism, he has served us well."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"Getting thru the first chapter is no problem. I would presume it would be a good book. instead I found that Hatred as a symptom is what the zionist and judaist populations have as an obsession of the holocaust to continue writing about it. Once you get past chapter 2 , read chapters from last to first.. On page 207 is a clear attempt to recontext the Freudian SuperEgo as the heritage supremacy of the religion of judaism over all other races INCLUDING Caucasians. Read it for yourself. The Trinitarian belief of id , ego and superego are transformed into a method of regarding infallibility to the preceeding culture and justified murder of Jesus Christ as though he shouldn't have been forgiven ( Matthew 18:21-22 . If Peter is to forgive 70 x7 times, guess who is to forgive 7 times and NOT call for crucifixion for entertainment? ( betting lots) )The book is a distractionary device; and not the big picture. A book to read before is Lynn Picknetts \\" The Secret History of Lucifer, AND John J. Robinsons' Born in Blood ( history of FreeMasonry) and base conclusion after all three.It excludes the mention that the Torah censorship had let directly to the environment that Pakistani female Malala Yousafzai was nearly killed and sharia law created.Certainly that is a very recent event. Its been happening before. The belief that judaism is unjustly prejudiced is false. The group that has been longer oppressed up thru 1920 than Jews is Women by Jews. As we know from Nuremberg , there is no such thing as 'just following orders'. Likewise, when continuing sexism from Egyptians, there is no innocence in male patriarchy prejudice. The repetition of the Mitzvot prayer ' thank you for not making me a slave, a woman , or a gentile' 3 x daily for 1600 years is certainly a brain wash that all 3 demographics would summarize into on stereotype. That stereotype of females continued subordination thru into the catholic prejudice against female clergy even though 'jesus' did have female priestesses and apostles.. All of the male apostles were cannonized saints but none of them joined him THAT particular day in crucifixion.The obsession upon retreading the holocaust specific to THIS book is to create criticism of Jews as a symptom rather than a socially justified manner of their own contribution to crime , prejudice and injustice .To generate such a disgusting false science stems from lack of acknowlegement that Lilith not being in the torah or Old testament has continued sexism thru the previous 3400 years. if the Divine creation of Adam is so important , why then is the Creation of Lilith glossed over if not myth .. and infact that hatred is the obsession about the Holocaust to embellish the acts of genocide as though they even need to be? This book is a quackery. It seldom finds other examples in larger than a paragraph."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"Gaylin's text is eminently readable and coherent. He describes in great detail the processes leading up from prejudice to hatred, which serves to give a richer understand of what hatred actually is. Additionally, Gaylin makes a very worthwhile distinction between the \\"clinical phenomena\\" of hatred and the idea of hatred that has become so infused in folk psychology that the two are used interchangably in the popular nomenclature. However it is my opinion that some of the text contained social commentary that was heavy-handed, self-contradictory and uninformed. For example, he woefully underestimates the power of the situation in facilitating hatred or the expression of hatred through brutality. Various psychological experiments (most famously, Zimbardo's Stanford Prison experiment - http://www.prisonexp.org) have demonstrated how ordinary people can commit extraordinary acts of brutality given the \\"right\\" mix of social and environmental factors. Gaylin seems at times to largely discount the environment, but yet notes it's importance in the development and formation of hatred. What's left is a disconnect between the development and the expression of hatred, which leaves this reviewer befuddled."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"Este libro debe ser le&iacute;do por mucha gente en Venezuela donde lo descrito por el autor se aplica en gran medida en quienes ocupan cargos p&uacute;blicos en la actualidad.

Realmente recomiendo este libro aunque escrito en Ingles es &uacute;til leerlo, sobre todo por quienes aman el actual regimen de cosas.This book should be read by many people in Venezuela because what is described by the author applies heavily on those who hold public office today. The author's approach with regard to the envy and resentment fits perfectly with the current cries emitted by politicians of the day.

I have returned to it several times for specific guidence towards the resources Dr. Gaylin used to produce it and have always found it to be a concise collection of information to support my research. I would highly recommend it for anyone wishing to gain a thorough understanding of the subject matter. I purchased it because I can always use access to this knowledge."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"Gaylin's simplicity and concrete thinking makes this book invaluable for those of us who would like a better understanding of this violent and scary world in which we live."},{"Title":"Hatred: The Psychological Descent Into Violence","review":"I read 100 pages of this book while in pure agony and despair, and yet maintained the smallest of hopes that maybe, just maybe, on the next page Gaylin would actually get into something tangible that could be taken WITHOUT a grain of salt, but it never came. Instead there was only endless kitsch-poetic blatherings about the differences between palestinian terrorists and americans with road rage. Terrorists this, blah blah, terrorists that blah blah... It just goes on and on. You'd think from the sound of it he was President Bush after 9/11, he says terrorist so much. This book is disgustingly disappointing. I was hoping to get an honest look at the human condition but I got propaganda. That's what you get for reading a book by a psychoanalyst: a whole lot of case study and thus a whole lot of nothing applicable... Sorry for anyone else who liked this book, but I just can't be honest with myself if I say I do. If you want to read something good about the roots of violent and aggressive behavior in humans, then read Demonic Males by Wrangham. He knows the balance between biological and cultural determinism. Not this guy though. This guy's a waste of time."},{"Title":"Wounds of the Spirit: Black Women, Violence, and Resistance Ethics","review":"Traci West accomplished something very difficult and very rare: she wrote a book that is very readable yet extremely smart; it is well researched, well argued, and engages current scholarly discussions, yet it is timely and has great political significance. &quot;Wounds of the Spirit&quot; engages deep and painful social and cultural structures and systemic injustices and does a very good job at showing some of the connections between the possibilities for resistance that already exist and some that may become possible in the future. This is a book about the cost of sexual violence that is written with intelligence, compassion, and a strong and clear activist intent. It benefits greatly from the author's relentless refusal to be pigeonholed as either too &quot;churchy&quot; or too &quot;academicy&quot; and her self-conscious reliance on the voices and wisdom of the women she interviewed and whose stories centrally inform her study. The result is a highly relevant study, written with the conviction that black women's lived reality can and does tell all of us something incredibly important about society, religion, and culture. Do read this book!"},{"Title":"Wounds of the Spirit: Black Women, Violence, and Resistance Ethics","review":"This book successfully attempts to do three things: (1) look at the impact of violence on black women, (2) shows the ways in which society and church covers up this problem, and (3) gives and ethic in order to create change with the church and society.First using narrative, West chronicles the lives of Black women as they struggle with various forms of violence. Especially troubling is the idea that violence does not exist for black women.This silence is enforced not just by men but by the structures in society which place how white women are affected by violence as the norm for how all women are affected. West analyzies how this happens in our society.She then outlines an ethic as to how the community can create change so that the issue og violence against black women can be understood and made to change.A must read for all church workers and those concerned about violence against women."},{"Title":"Breakfasts & Brunches","review":"\`Breakfasts & Brunches' is another book of cooking recipes and advice for the amateur / home cook prepared by the Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Like those before it on \`Cooking at Home', \`Book of Soups', and \`Gourmet Meals in Minutes', but unlike their more professional volumes such as \`Baking and Pastry', this volume is very good for the home cook, but it has a few lapses here and there which make it less than perfect as a manual for teaching the very best cooking technique.The first thing which surprises me about the book is the subtitle which proclaims that the volume contains \`Over 175 New Recipes...'. If I am to buy just one book on cooking breakfast dishes, I don't want novelty; I want the very best standard recipes and techniques. On looking at the specific recipes, I find that there is novelty, but the book does cover the expected bases of breakfast cookery. I can only find one breakfast dish missing, and this is scrapple, which is pretty specialized to the Pennsylvania Dutch / Southeastern Pennsylvania / Greater Philadelphia area.The primary chapters are:Breakfast & Brunch Mise en Place - I find this chapter just a bit unnecessary or incomplete. It is unnecessary in that much of its contents are repeated in more detail in later chapters on various dishes. It is incomplete in that it gives pantry shelf-lives of a large variety of foodstuffs, but in a narrative form. It would have been much better to focus this chapter on neat, tabular information, and leave all the narrative to the detailed recipes. I also think the term \`mise en place' is misused here. \`Pantry Stocking' would have been a better name.Breakfast & Brunch Drinks - Very nice collection of recipes and advice on making coffee, tea, chai, eggnog, cocktails and smoothies.Muffins, Quick Breads & Coffee Cakes - Six muffin recipes, eight breakfast cake recipes, eight quickbreads (biscuits, scones, soda bread), plus funnel cake, lemon curd, and cornbread.Sweet and Savory Breads & Pastries - The sticky stuff and recipes with yeast. A very nice variety of recipes which tend to be more complicated than the quickbreads, and the authors tell you when the recipe may be difficult.Pancakes, Waffles, & Crepes. Of course, you expect this chapter. It includes several different flavors of pancakes; including blinis and many different fruit fillings for crepes. I am surprised that there is but one recipe for French toast, as this is a dish with many variations. I'm also surprised there is not more exposition on tips for making waffles.Eggs. Another obvious category with all the usual suspects, such as fried eggs, scrambled eggs, egg and sausage sandwiches, omelets, frittatas, poached eggs, quiches, egg salads, and soft boiled eggs.Grains & Legumes. Grits, polenta, and cold cereals, oh my! The usual characters include oatmeal, cream of wheat, kasha, rice, couscous, muesli, granola, bean salads and spreads.Meats, Fish & Potatoes. This may seem like an odd combination with potatoes in the same chapter as meats, but both types of dishes often play second banana to the eggs, pancakes, and cereals. Ham, sausage, and breakfast steaks are here, with several chicken dishes, hash browns, O'Brien Potatoes, Potato pancakes, Lyonnaise Potatoes, Rosti potatoes, and corned beef hash.Soups, Salads, & Small Bites. These items are more appropriate for brunch than for breakfast, especially as they are mostly cold soups and salads, plus \`tea sandwiches' great for brunch buffets.The appeal of this book depends a lot on how big your cookbook library is now. If you are just starting out, filling your shelves exclusively with CIA books would not be a bad idea, just as you could accomplish the same result by concentrating exclusively on \`Martha Stewart Living', \`Cooks Illustrated', or \`Better Homes and Gardens' books. And, a CIA collection is likely to be more focused than what you get from magazine collections.On the other hand, if you already have one or more \`comprehensive' cookbooks such as the \`Joy of Cooking' or \`James Beard's American Cookery', and you are not into collecting cookbooks, this volume may be less useful. This is certainly less valuable if you have a breakfast cookbook such as Marian Cunningham's \`The Breakfast Book' or \`Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Caf&eacute;' or even a good bread or biscuit book such as James Villas' \`Biscuit Bliss'.I would recommend this book even if you already owned all these titles IF this book were more highly focused on breakfast dishes, with more variety within egg and cereal dishes and less attention to soups, sandwiches, and drinks. I also found some odd lapses in this book. The most unusual is their treatment of scrambled eggs and omelets. To a person, every authority I read on the subject says these are two different dishes, yet this book from an authoritative source simply says that an omelet is scrambled eggs left to solidify in a circle rather than smushed up into mounds of eggy goodness. I also find sections on several other central recipes such as granola and French toast to be much too simple. Nothing is said about the details of how long one should soak the bread in the batter for French toast. Nothing is also said about baking your granola mix. On the other hand, the biscuit recipe is half again more complicated than you need for simple buttermilk biscuits. My favorite Nick Malgieri biscuit can be done in half the time.This is a good book which has lots of useful recipes, but you may not need it unless you happen to do a lot of breakfast and brunch entertaining, and don't have a good source for basic recipes. Contrary to the CIA source, it is NOT an authoritative text on how to do important breakfast dishes."},{"Title":"Breakfasts & Brunches","review":"I have plenty of cookbooks, but this was my main standby in the first year of our bed and breakfast.

I read it all in Saint John (Canada) at New Brunswick's Public Library. I must admit I enjoyed it pretty much.It's like yesterday.Aga Khan made his comments half a century ago and I am sure he would have written the same sentences nowadays.On page 19 he says, \\"We are condemned. Peace ought to be universal. Islam means peace, God's peace with man and the peace of men to another. Usury is condemned, but free and honest trade and agriculture - in all its forms - are encouraged, since they manifest a Divine service, and the welfare of mankind depends upon the continuation and the intensification of these legitimate labors. Politically a republican form of government seems to be the most rightful; for Islamic countries, which have witnessed the development of absolute monarchies with a great concentration of power within them, the election of the monarch has always remained a lifeless formula which has simply legitimized the usurpation of power\\".......Aga Khan goes on to explain after death Divine justice will take into consideration the faith, the prayers and the deeds of man.Aga Khan speaks of the \`chosen' that there is eternal life and the spiritual felicity of the Divine vision. For the condemned there is hell, where they will be consumed with regret for not having known how to merit the grace and the blessing of Divine mercy.Aga Khan refers to Islamic doctrine that goes further than the other great religions, \\"for it proclaims the presence of the soul, perhaps minute but nevertheless existing in an embryonic state, in all existence - in matter, in animals, trees, and space itself. Every individual, every molecule, every atom has its own spiritual relationship with the All-Powerful Soul of God.\\"Aga Khan refers, in this context, to men and women, being more highly developed, are immensely more advanced than the infinite number of other beings known to us.Aga Khan speaks of how Islam, without going as far as Christianity, recognizes the existence of evil spirits which seek by means of secret suggestions to us to turn us from good, from that straight way traced by God's finger for the eternal happiness of the humblest as of the greatest - Abraham, Jesus, Mohammad.Aga Khan explains, in a nutshell, the difference between The Sunnis and Shia thus: \\".... the divergence of the streams of thought, The Sunnis are the people of the Sonna or Tradition. Their Kalama or profession of faith is \\"\\"There is no God but God and Mohammad is the Apostle of God\\"\\". To this the Shias add, \\"\\"And Ali, the companion of Mohammad, is the Vicar of God\\"\\". Etymologically the word \`Shia' means either a stream or a section.Aga Khan goes on to give us a vivid explanation to this \`sectarian' situation in Islam. \\" The prophet (Mohammad) died without appointing a Khalif or successor. The Shia school of thought maintains that although direct Divine inspiration ceased at the Prophet's death, the need of Divine guidance continued and this could not be left merely to millions of mortal men, capable of being momentarily but tragically misled by greed, by oratory, or by sudden desire of material advantage. These dangers were manifest in the period immediately following our Holy Prophet's death. Mohammad had been, as I have shown, both a temporal and a spiritual sovereign. The Khalif or successor of the prophet was to succeed him in both these capacities; he was to be Emir-al-Momenin or \`commander of the true believers' and Imam-al-Muslimin or \`spiritual chief of the devout'. Perhaps an analogy from Latin, Western world will make this clearer; he would be Supreme Pontiff as well as Imperator or temporal ruler.\\"Interesting to read this:\\"Ali, the Prophet's cousin and son-in law, the husband of his beloved and ONLY surviving child, FATIMA, his first convert, his bold champion in many a war, who the Prophet in his lifetime said would be to him as Aaron was to Moses, his brother and right-hand man, in the veins of whose descendants the Prophet's own blood would flow, appeared destined to be that true successor, and such had been the general expectation of Islam. The Shia have therefore always held that after the Prophet's death, Divine power, guidance and leadership manifested themselves in Hazrat Ali as the first Imam or spiritual chief of the devout.The Sunnis, however, consider him the fourth in the succession of Khalifs to temporal power\\".....Aga Khan also makes the following distinctions, which are very important :\\" The Imam is thus the successor of the Prophet in his religious capacity; he is the man who must be obeyed and who dwells among those from whom he commands spiritual obedience. The Sunnis have always held that this authority is merely temporal and secular, and is exerted only in POLITICAL sphere, they believe therefore that it appertains to any lawfully constituted political HEAD OF STATE, to a GOVERNOR or to a PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. The Shia say that this authority is all-pervading and is concerned with SPIRITUAL MATTERS also, that is transferred by inherited right to the Prophet's successor of his blood\\"Aga Khan this time refers to the words spoken by Mr. Justice Arnold in his judgment in the High Court of Bombay on November 12, 1866 in the lawsuit brought against Age's grandfather, to describe the emergence of the Sunni and Shia .....\\"\\" The influence of AYESHA, the young favorite wife of Mohammad, a rancorous enemy of FATIMA and ALI, procured the election of her (AYESHA) own father ABU BAKR; to Abu Bakr succeeded Omar, and to him Osman, upon whose death, the year 655 of the Christian era, ALI was at last raised to the Khlifat. He was not even then unopposed, aided by AYESHA (Mohammad's widow) Moawiyyah of the family of Umayyad, contested the Khalifat with him, and while the strife was still doubtful, in the year AD 660, Ali was slain by the Kharegite, or Muslim fanatic, in the mosque of Cufa, at that time the principal Muslim city on the right or West bank of the Euphrates (Iraq)- itself long since a ruin, at no great distance from the ruin of Babylon\\"\\".... Mr. Justice Arnold's judgment gives a lucid and moving account of the effect on Muslim life and thought of this assassination and of the subsequent murders - nine years and twenty years after their father - of Ali's two sons, Hassan and Hussein, the Prophet's beloved grandchildren whom he himself and publicly hailed as \\" the foremost among the youths of Paradise\\"....; of the tragic and embittered main Muslim sects, and all the sorrow and the strife that afflicted succeeding generation....On page 89 \\" I called on Lord Cromer, the British Resident in Egypt, whose power and authority in Egypt at that time were paramount. He said that Egypt badly needed a man like Sir Syed Ahmed, to do for its Muslim population the sort of educative a regenerative work, which he had done in Aligarh. There was in Egypt at the time a deep rift between, on the one hand, the old-fashioned conservative, pious Muslim, who was contemptuous of modern science and techniques and who spoke and read Arabic and, on the other hand, the Frenchified upper class, whose meeting place was the club, whose diversions were cards and nocturnal gambling, who detested British, yearned to see them out and longed for a return to the regime of the Khedive Ismail. There was nothing like Aligarh to show the vast Muslim population the way toward a compromise with and understanding of modern, Western science, and to raise an elite capable of co-operating with the British administration and technicians in that process of economic and social uplift of which the country was in such desperate need\\" .......On page 165, 166 \\" To a strategist like Churchill this decision (to attack Turkey in WWI) offered an opportunity (which was never seized) of ending the slaughterous deadlock on the western Front and of striking at Germany and Austria from the southeast. To me at that moment it was a shattering blow. Its sharpness and severity were mortifying in the extreme; and when the Turkish Government, striving to put a respectable and popular faade on what was in fact unprovoked, inexcusable aggression, proclaimed a Jihad, a holy war against Christendom, my distress and disappointment crystallized into bitter resentment against the irreligious folly of Turkey's rulers. ...................... I reacted strongly. I joined with other Muslim leaders in an earnest appeal to the whole Islamic world to disregard the so-called Jihad, to do their duty and stand loyally with and besides Western Allies.........,I stressed the fact that neither Turkey in particular nor Islam in general need have any apprehension about the purely defensive actions of the Western Powers\\".....It is interesting to read the rest... and to compare the recurrent events..."},{"Title":"Quick & Easy Sushi Cook Book","review":"This book is an excellent guide in teaching you how to make sushi. There are literally hundreds of pictures in the book. You will find all of the typical edomae-sushi and &quot;rolls&quot; that you get at a Japanese restaurant. It will take you step by step through each of these, from selecting and making the rice, forming the rice balls, cutting the fish, choosing the fish, making sushi rolls, etc. I have been making sushi for myself and friends for over six years, and it started with this book. I highly recommend it for a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; type person. One last tip: go to an oriental food store and get quality soy sauce, rice, seaweed, etc. It makes a BIG difference."},{"Title":"Quick & Easy Sushi Cook Book","review":"The pictures are undoubtedly the best feature of this book: they're clear, bright, colorful, and most-importantly, helpful. The text and recipes are easy to understand, although not flawless; occasionally, they read like poorly-translated stereo instructions.However, the author has strangely neglected several of the most common types of sushi. There's absolutely no mention of fresh salmon (sake), yellowtail (hamachi), grilled eel (unagi), or even tobiko. Some of the more popular rolls in the USA, such as spicy tuna, California (crab & avocado), and spider (crab tempura) are also missing. A section on sashimi would've been nice as well, but no luck.Rice, the basic ingredient of any sushi, only gets three pages in the back, and they're all in black-and-white (unlike the glorious color photos used for everything else).In short, it's a nice presententation, but woefully incomplete."},{"Title":"Quick & Easy Sushi Cook Book","review":"I love this book because it gets right down to business, with precise, concise methodology and explanations, with nice photos of each form, and the various forms divided in to categories of sushi, many of which are still not in the American lexicon. Su Shi actually means \\"Vinegar Rice\\" and that is the basis of the dish we know as sushi. What most of us who are not Japanese don't know, is that beyond the rice prepared a special way and seasoned with vinegar, salt, and sugar, everything else about sushi is optional.This is a mind-expanding text on sushi. It will not turn the reader into a sushi chef with expert methods at filleting and preparing the specialty forms of sashimi (though it does provide detailed explanations of exactly how to filet and prepare the seafood portion of each), but it will give even a novice the core understanding and breadth, to prepare and serve forms of sushi both familiar and exotic (within the limits of locally available ingredients). It also takes it from a priesthood, to a ground-level, human, attainable food, that can be as simple as a bowl of good sushi rice with other ingredients mixed in, or as formal as a pressed molded smoked salmon sushi with capers, that looks more like something out of a 1950's American cookbook on cold buffet ideas.Solid, honest, unpretentious, easy to use, and very educational. Not just a compilation of recipes, but a methodology book."},{"Title":"Quick & Easy Sushi Cook Book","review":"The Quick and Easy series to which this book belongs is generally very good and this book is no exception for the most part. Each item is extremely well illustrated with step by step photographs and this is a definite plus here as the text sometimes is sometimes brief to the point of being perfunctory. There are quite a few recipes that beginners should have no trouble following but that is not always true for others. In particular, some of the fish cutting techniques will require bit of skill and confidence in order to produce results as illustrated. I also got the impression that the author probably had a readership in mind whose skills were more than just basic as the section on actually preparing the sushi rice only appears at the end of the book and is just a few pages long. Moreover, there is no progression throughout the book from simpler techniques to more complex, rather the odd simple item is interspersed with some quite difficult things. Still, that being said, this is a book I am very happy to have in my collection."},{"Title":"Home country","review":"This is a collection of newspaper columns designed to be read over the breakfast table. However, thanks to the talent and compassion of the man writing them, Ernie Pyle, they give a great picture of an America that no longer exists. These are stories of great people (a lunch with Walt Disney circa 1935) and everyday people (the woman who was on her way to commit suicide and ended up becpming a trapper in Alaska), and people you never heard of, but through them all Pyle's empathy makes these folks come alive. Non-judgemental and accepting, yet always looking for the unusual, Pyle honed his craft with these character studies and unknowingly prepared himself for being embedded with US troops in WWII."},{"Title":"Panic in the Pantry (Consumer Health Library)","review":"In its various editions, this book has always been a jumble of mixed messages. It is intended partly to dispel myths propounded by food faddists. The authors hammer away at unscientific views on food additives, \\"natural\\" foods, over-the-top food supplement claims. This is not hard labor since the claims they attack are often ridiculous. However, it seems a bit odd that these \\"quackbusters\\" and \\"junk science\\" critics don't provide footnotes for their own assertions. They apparently fancy themselves such revered experts that readers are to take their declarations at face value. Or they are too lazy to provide documentation. These authors should know better.To a disturbing extent, the book reads like a legal polemic. There are countless references to the legal plights of those who they consider to be quacks. Often these legal issues have nothing whatever to do with the merits of the scientific issues. Do we really learn anything about the value of, say, chelation therapy, by being told that one proponent has been prosecuted for tax evasion? Because of these frequent asides, the book has a sleazy, even authoritarian tone. The authors, and editor Barrett, are known to favor relentless government action, both legal and regulatory, against people with whom they disagree. Barrett has even advocated changing the laws so that consumers can sue publishers who publish articles with (what Barrett considers) erroneous and harmful health advice. So much for freedom of the press.The authors give us clues on how to recognize a \\"health quack.\\" One of these clues is that quacks \\"display credentials not recognized by responsible scientists or educators.\\" This is said to be the insight of editor Barrett. But Barrett, who is referred to by the patently unscientific term, \\"consumer activist,\\" is actually a psychiatrist! Is that a recognized credential for expertise on nutrition or biochemistry? Not a few people would counter that psychiatry itself is the quintessential \\"junk science.\\"Another quality of quacks, says Barrett, is that \\"They encourage patients to lend political support to their treatment methods.\\" This is disingenuous in light of the fact that author Whelan is director of a group, The American Council on Science and Health, among whose purposes is to influence government policy. These self-styled experts are allowed to engage in politics, while \\"quacks\\" are not. The \\"quacks\\" are supposed to just lie there while the government gives it to them good and hard.But are these authors infallible? In the 1975 edition of this book, Stare and Whelan wrote that \\"an accumulation of lycopene following daily consumption of a half a gallon of tomato juice for several years can pose a hazard.\\"Again the book is poorly referenced, so we cannot verify this claim. On its face it seems silly since few people would drink that much tomato juice. And now we know that lycopene is very likely a cancer preventive, so the authors were apparently wrong. The reference to lycopene is missing from the current edition. Are these authors quacks for making such an outlandish assertion?The authors have no sense of humor. They go about the business of attacking \\"quacks\\" with grim-faced determination, when a horse-laugh would often be more effective. It is obvious that the authors do not limit themselves to countering false ideas, they want those ideas, those who promote them, and those who sell \\"unproven\\" health products to be defenestrated. It never occurs to them that people have the right to sell and buy products without the approval of health experts or the government. Hence, there is a hint of Big Brother throughout the book. Like most \\"consumer advocates,\\" they care nothing for the choices of consumers, they want to DICTATE to consumers.The authors are essentially Chicken Littles who think the sky will fall if Americans don't follow the health practices they endorse. So, the book does every bit as much to spread panic as to squelch it. Like so many health writers, they don't doubt that the most important value in life is GOOD HEALTH, and that anyone who gets in the way of that should be stamped out. Liberty is not accepted as a value of competing importance.Finally, I have personal knowledge that one example of \\"evidence\\" supplied in the book is completely false. The casual way that this false information is used casts doubt on the authors' powers of discernment."},{"Title":"Panic in the Pantry (Consumer Health Library)","review":"The Center for Media and Democracy's PR Watch found that this book was authored by people working for the food industry. The book's authors are funded by Burger King, Coca Cola, DuPont, Exxon, Frito-Lay, General Mills and General Motors, to name a few. This book is and was a complete farce and that's why it costs 5 cents on amazon."},{"Title":"Panic in the Pantry (Consumer Health Library)","review":"Evidently the first edition of 'Panic in the Pantry,' which was published in 1975, didn't have sufficient impact, since the new edition starts with a history of the 1989 Alar panic.A lot of people thought the Alar-in-apples scare demonstrated the dangers of pesticides in our food supply. What it really showed is that most people don't know beans about nutrition.Fortunately, according to Elizabeth Whelan and Frederick Stare, they don't have to, since America's food is not only the most abundant but the safest in the world.'Panic' is really aimed not only at people who don't understand anything about nutrition, but whose education is so defective they are incapable of understanding anything about it. Therefore, unless they are willing to study hard, they will continue to have to take somebody else's word for it.Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, and Stare, retired founder of Harvard University's Department of Nutrition, say you should take the word of scientists, like them.Of course, lots of habitues of the health food stores seem suspicious of scientists. They are right to be skeptical but are facing the wrong way. ACSH, for example, occasionally runs blind surveys of Healthfoodland (as Whelan and Stare call it) to find out what quality of advice is being given out.The results are appalling. In 1989, another group, the Consumer Health Education Council, called 41 Houston health food stores with a concocted story about a man with AIDS who was continuing to have sexual relations with his wife. The callers purported to seek nutritional advice for the couple.Thirty of the 41 nutritional counselors claimed their stores sold cures for AIDS, all 41 recommended vitamins and various 'counselors' recommended other nostrums from hydrogen peroxide to herbal baths. Not one counselor recommended either abstention from sex or condoms for the wife at risk.The quality of the advice from Healthfoodland is literally a matter of life and death, and not just from AIDS. I know health food quacks who are telling insulin-dependent diabetics to throw away their needles (which the diabetics are only too happy to hear) and replace them with Chinese herbs. That is a death sentence.But isn't it true that lax regulations and slovenly testing practices allow dangerous chemicals and adulterants into our food?No, say Whelan and Stare. The Food and Drug Administration 'testing process is so rigorous that many \\"natural\\" substances -- including vitamin A -- could not survive it.'That's because more people (one or two a year) die from vitamin A overdoses than have died in all history from dioxin (zero). These victims are readily identifiable because typically they get their vitamin A from drinking carrot juice -- up to a gallon a day -- and their corpses consequently are bright orange."},{"Title":"The constitutional history of England from the accession of Henry VII, to the death of George II","review":"This book ought to be read by anyone who is interested in the meaning of the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights. What it will supply is a view of the meaning of the various contentious phrases of that document, by illustrating the controversies to which the Founding Fathers were replying.As history, this book is seriously flawed, but even its flaws are enlightening. Hallam's subject is the &quot;English Constitution.&quot; Of course, there is no written English Constitution; it is a tacit understanding of the proper limits and aims of power, and as such it has changed remarkably over the many centuries of British history. Hallam blandly assumes that the consensus of his own period is consensus that has always prevailed. If it seemed contentious in the past ---- the several tyrannies great and petty, the civil wars and glorious revolutions, and the sundry controversies between King and Parliament --- these were the result of royal or parliamentary usurpations of authority, never reflecting adversely on the Way Things Ought to Be, which just happened to be the way things were at the time he wrote.This view of things is so clich&eacute;'d that it is often labelled &quot;Whig history,&quot; the claim that the grand powers ultimately assumed by the House of Commons, in derogation of the Royal authority, really reflects an ancient and inherited order rather than a dramatic change from the former status quo. As history -per se-, it is open to serious doubt.The point is, though, that whether this history is -true- or not, people believed in it as patriotic myth, and acted as if they believed it. This is nowhere more apparent than in the pages of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The very notion of a Bill of Rights was borrowed from the events chronicled in this book. The various usurpations that Madison thought to guard against in his amendments were aimed, not only at British colonial rule, but also against the alleged abuses of power committed by the Stuart and Tudor monarchs. To read this book from 1827 is to get a rare and valuable glimpse into the political habits of mind of respectably liberal English-speaking people in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This gives this work continuing value.A literary note: Prof. Henry Hallam, the author of this book, was the father of Arthur Hallam, Alfred, Lord Tennyson's friend, whose early death occasioned Tennyson's -In Memoriam-."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"I was very excited with the character development in the first 150 pages, but was disappointed with the remainder of the novel. With over 700 pages it is hard to beleive that so little can happen."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"This is a novel about a love story and a hoped-for war of liberation. The oddity is that neither happens. The beginning and end are separated by hundreds of pages of christian drivel.Alas and alack there is no rescue from characterization. The author begins with a bright, curious, sensual young woman who 'adopts' a religious vocation as an escape from an unwanted marriage. The entire book evolves around her vocation, unbelievable though it is from the 'get-go', and how she 'chooses' it over the love of her life (a taste of which we are given in a very few pages at the end of the book).Our hero is more sympathetic yet more inept. He is unable to land the heroine, find someone else, or initiate his lifelong goal to liberate his country from invaders.One is left to ponder what Mr. Bragg had in mind."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Melvyn Bragg's Credo is astonishing. It is so well researched and so well written that the characters live in your head long after you have closed the pages for the last time.It's a classical battle; between the Pagans and the Christians, and between the Christian Celts and the Christian Catholics, set in a violent and turbulent period of history.What makes this book is such memorable characters: Bega, the devout christian, destined to become a saint; the pagan woman whom Bega so despises, yet who is so human, Bega's &quot;man&quot;, who's love she is prepared to forgo to persue her love affair with God.Read this book. It will change your outlook on life, love and religion. It is wonderful. This book has been reprinted as &quot;The Sword and The Miracle&quot;, but is also available as &quot;Credo&quot; from Amazon.co.uk"},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Armed with careful scholarship and a deep insight into the personalities, tragedies and triumphs of his characters, Melvyn Bragg weaves an engrossing and remarkably authentic tale of the struggle to save Christianity in its original purity as it barely clings to life during the dark ages of the British Isles. This is an historic tale of true triumph through great tragedy of real people and the communities they served - or cruelly dominated - deftly mirroring the eternal struggle we all face between our dual natures of godliness and devilry.The background and locale of the story is historical, as well as most of the characters Bragg summons from the dead pages of history. The protagonist herself is a mysterious and only partially mythical figure known as St. Bega. Her intense inner conflict between her most deserving earthly desires and her ideally pure devotion to God serves as a personal parallel for the historic struggle between Christianity and pagan ritual which had hitherto served, yet chained mankind to a barely sustainable earthly existence.As in true life there are no pure heroes, only men and women doing the best they know how to do in the circumstances they find themselves. In the face-off between Bega, servant of the new \\"one God,\\" and the priestess of the old gods of stone and sky, druids and druidesses are portrayed - quite accurately - as largely benevolent and wise stewards of an ancient magic, and whose advice the sometime fanatical Christian monks and abbesses would have been better off to accept on occasion. The Celtic Church, though clearly superior in true devotion and spirituality, cannot match the necessary pragmatism of the falsely pious and worldy Roman church, whose demands that the Celtic church accede to the authority of Rome have much more to do with a raw lust for power than they do with saving souls. Indeed, the religious enemy is clearly not the pagan druids and priestesses, but the enmity between professed followers of Christ.Finally, this is a story of sacrifice. True and noble sacrifice born of faith and love for one's fellow man no matter how undeserving they may be. This is not your Sunday School version of sacrifice where, in the end, God rewards the valiant with all the glory and worldy riches they had denied themselves in His service, but the true, Christly sacrifice where one gives up his or her most cherished dreams to bring about a better world for others. Then, finally perishing in the struggle, as they realize those dreams will be left forever wanting, the only reward they are left is a knowledge that such a sacrifice has been acceptable to God and has, indeed, brought a measure of divinity into a world which so desperately, though ignorantly, needs it."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Bragg has done very well to recreate the atmosphere of Dark Age Britain when Christendom was still an infant in the isles. Although the plot itself isn't riveting, Bragg has welded his words together strongly enough to keep you interested. He is very articulate and creative, a veritable word-monger. The reader is subsumed into this strange world of miracles, superstition, and barbarism on the edge of the post-Roman world. The characters are very real and face curious conflicts which may seem very foreign to the modern reader, but the sheer atmosphere which Bragg infuses into his work is what really captures. After reading it, one feels like they have actually journeyed to Dark Age Cumbria and breathed the dank air which the Arthur of history (not of legend) breathed. And no, the book is not about Arthur - it is about Bega the Irish princess who would be a saint."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"I have many books that deal with the world of ancient Ireland. Subjects range from druids to archaeological finds to monasticism. Mr Bragg has synthesized this knowledge and created sympathetic characters in an accurate historical milieu. Modern people want characters to act with modern sensibilites in settings such as this. But such anachronistic leanings detract from the color and excitement of reading historical fiction. I found this book funny, inspirational, and sad though I was disappointed in how Bega and Chad died. I think it wasn't fair of the author to do away with them in such a off-handed manner. This book is now available under the title: The Sword and the Miracle from Random House."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"This is a huge book (780 pages in paperback) which sprawls across England and Ireland circa 650AD. It is a highly literate (Bragg is a prominent UK arts broadcaster) fictional exploration of Saint Bega and other real life characters set against the religion and politics of the time. It is very readable with plenty of action, believable characters and fascinating historical observation. It is however a big novel so strengthen those wrist muscles first!"},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Sorry but I couldn't see the point of finishing this book when the only character I had any interest in was killed off one quarter of the way through. It was a struggle to get that far since I found everything so superficial. This is a great idea for a book but I felt Bragg was only scratching the surface."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Please note that this excellent book about Celtic Christianity and the evolution of the church in the English-speaking world has been published in the US as The Sword and the Miracle, and is available from Random House. Unfortunately the new title makes it sound like some awful, trashy sci-fi/fantasy, which is not only misleading but insulting to US readers. Fortunately it is still a good book and it does work as a historical romance."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"Melvyn Bragg wrote a very interesting and moving novel. The construction of the story is a model for other authors. The story, characters and action are so well presented that this big book never seem too long. Althought french is my mother tongue, it is very readable. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"As badly written a book as I have ever encountered. I toiled through this dud because a good friend recommended it; now I doubt that friend had read it herself. Bragg puts a badly chosen modifier with nearly all his nouns - perhaps he wrote this at speed and put down whatever came into his head; surely this book had no editor. And we don't learn much about life or customs or important matters in 7th century northern England. Bragg needs a good critic: someone to tell him to shape up and learn to write decent prose, not the ponderous, inflated stuff in this book."},{"Title":"Credo","review":"This is a good portrayal of Orthodox Christianity in the West before the Great Schism. The ascetic struggles of holy men and women formed the core of Christian spirituality in Ireland, as elsewhere in the West, before the corruption spread from Rome and turned the Church into a worldly organization bent on wealth and power. Just compare the saints portrayed in the book with holy men as described in modern Eastern Orthodox writers like Dostoyevsky; you will then get an idea of what the Christian faith is really about."},{"Title":"Earl Mindell's Herb Bible","review":"Mindell does here for herbs what he did for vitamins in his &quot;Vitamin Bible,&quot; only much better organized.

Enjoy this excellent source of personal care!"},{"Title":"Earl Mindell's Herb Bible","review":"This book is great for beginners studying Herbalizem. The Herbs are right in the store so there is no trying to figure out if the herb you found is the herb your looking for.

I read it to my son's kindergarten class yesterday and it made me look like a hero. They ATE IT UP. We laughed so hard we cried. Olivia is a great little heroine, and the kids could identify with her and were tickled with the \\"trouble\\" she cooked up.Can't wait to dig into my next Munsch/Martchenko book. Thanks, guys!"},{"Title":"Wait and See (Classic Munsch)","review":"I always buy books by Robert Munsch. My grandson did not like to read UNTIL he read one of the books I had. Not only did he like it, but wanted to take it home to read to his mother. Robert Munsch writes books that are about children and children love to read about other children. I simply love all books by him."},{"Title":"Wait and See (Classic Munsch)","review":"On the heals of discovering the oh-so-wonderful Paper Bag Princess by Munch, I ordered several more of his books. BIG MISTAKE. Not all Munch is created equal. In this book, a child gets everything she wishes for for her birthday, including the pregnancy of her mother. NOT A GOOD MESSAGE. Willful child in charge of adults with no consequences. I bought this for my grandson and never showed it to him."},{"Title":"Wait and See (Classic Munsch)","review":"A delightful tale that makes you smile. My third grade writers laughed at each outcome. It brings meaning to be careful what you wish for."},{"Title":"Wait and See (Classic Munsch)","review":"I purchased this book for my six year old daughter and she loves it. The illustrations compliment the story and are just as funny. My daughter also loves it when the candles are being blown out for each wish that is made and the answer that the little girl in the story tells her parents after they ask her about the wishes. My daughter always insists on reading these parts, especially loud and while giggling. It is a wonderfully creative story and I'm glad that I got it for her."},{"Title":"Wait and See (Classic Munsch)","review":"I love every Robert Munsch book I have ever read! I teach first grade and his books are always a hit. This book, just like his other books, helps students use their imagination, laugh at situations and guess the results.Olivia is a great little kid that my students can relate to and enjoy reading/listening to the trouble she gets into.It shows ANYTHING can happen.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Virgin Soldiers (Fiction - general)","review":"I thought the book was excellent. Unfortunately, I had read the third book in the trilogy (Stand Up Virgin Soldiers) before this one - the first one. This left me somewhat confused as to the sequence of events, but still pleased with Thomas's description of events."},{"Title":"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Being a New Dad","review":"New grand children coming a yearly now...great book for new dads since the children don't come with directions, and dads are more reluctant to pitch in for fear that they don't know anything!"},{"Title":"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Being a New Dad","review":"This is an easy to read book with a guys insight. I really like that the author includes gay men as fathers."},{"Title":"Personality-guided Cognitive-behavioral Therapy (Personality-Guided Therapy Series)","review":"This book provides the experienced therapist with the tools and techniques to enhance conceptualisation and treatment planning for both Axis I and II disorders. Rasmussen blends Millon's model with Beck's/Ellis model of CBT very successfully."},{"Title":"Railroads and Regulation, 1877-1916","review":"Gabriel Kolko, a left-leaning historian, wrote his Ph.D. thesis to identify the forces that brought railroads under regulation at the end of the 19th century. Surprise, surprise, it was the railroad barons themselves who eventually sought regulation (and thereby brought it about). Kolko recounts the customer protests against high rates, especially for short-haul service, and the cycles of boom and bust, when competition caused railroads to overbuild, and then underprice their services. The railroad industry eventually sought regulation as a means of dividing up the market and ending ruinous competition. This is a great read, and debunks the common view that Teddy Roosevelt and the progressives, acting at the urging of angry farmers and other customers, forced government to assert regulatory control over the railroads. Readers will want to read McDonald's biography of Samuel Insull, and various biographies of Theodore N. Vail, who pulled off the same transformations in the electric and telecommunications industries, respectively, around the same time."},{"Title":"Collector's Encyclopedia of Niloak: A Reference and Value Guide, 2nd Edition","review":"After having looked at far too many of these books lately I wasn't expecting more than the usual workmanlike job-- well lit photographs of perfectly displayed examples of Niloak pottery, brief history of the pottery itself, usual pricing information. However, I have to say that this book was an unexpected surprise.It is well laid out as to the price guide-- the information is right next to the page with the photographs. The photographs are good. And there are a generous selection of photographs of the bottoms of pieces-- in other reviews I have talked about how the finish on a bottom of a piece of pottery is very helpful with identification.Bless this author though, he also provides information about look alikes-- companies that might have a connection with Niloak and who produced wares similar to Niloak and which might be, innocently or not, sold as Niloak. The popular Missionware is particularly susceptible to this. I was also happy because this information helped identify a miniature I had bought a couple of weeks back. He further discusses how to determine if a piece might have been reworked-- ground down to get past a chip or break, and how to determine if a label might have been attached to piece that originally had been unmarked. This is all excellent information that is not just applicable to Niloak.Very, very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"I usually do not recommend a book for martial arts study. A few I have found contain the basics that can help a beginner. This is one. Though Mr. Mattson may blush at his form now--he was a 1st degree and he is now a 9th degree--it is sufficient to help a student in self-study.I would recommend a student use this book to help their study under the guidence of a teacher."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"I purchased a 1963 first edition copy of this classic book in good condition, but plan to purchase a used paperback for use in practice.Good pictures and down to earth explanations. No mystical walk-thru-walls or super human power talk.The book is divided into a short section on philosophy, a short terminology chapter (enough to get through a traditional class and body parts), stretching chapter, and others.The strength of this book is in the description of Sanchin and Sesan. This is why the book warrants the 4 star rating in my opinion. The book is a good overview, but I would recommend learning from a proficient instructor.For more in depth Karate information, especially on Uechi Ryu, I recommend The Encyclopedia of Karate and Related Arts, by Ted Kresge. The book was checked by Master Kanei Uechi before publishing. It can be very difficult to find."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"Obwohl ich nicht aus dem Uechi Ryu stamme, halte ich dieses Buch f&uuml;r eines der besten Lehrb&uuml;cher der Kampfkunst die es gibt. Mr. Mattson hat meine vollste Hochachtung f&uuml;r diese gelungene und n&uuml;tzliche Arbeit."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"The depth of this book, first and foremost, not just on the physical movements, but on the philosophy of Karate, is phenomenal. Mr. Mattson, though young when he wrote this book, had an incredible grasp on the essence of Karate-Do, and of his style. Though not a practitioner of Uechi-ryu Karate and therefore unfit for an indepth judgement, his skill is obviously there. He shows, step by step and in great detail (including diagrams), the movements of two of the three main Kata: Sanchin and Seisan. Before the forms he outlines basic hand strikes, leg strikes, blocks and stances, as well as warm ups and drills. After each kata, however, he delves even deeper, while showing a generous amount of applications (Bunkai, I believe it is usually called in Karate). The stories/legends of great teachers at the end - which are my favorite part of all martial arts primers - is what adds a real aesthetic value to the whole book. Another good book on another Okinawan style of Karate is Shoshin Nagamine's \\"The Essence of Okinawan Karate-Do\\".Great piece of work! Enjoyed it a lot, as well as learned a few things too!"},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"This is a blast from the past. The author did it right. He went to Okinawa and studied with the best folks he could find and listened to every word he heard and believed it all.He then enlisted a great photographer (the black and white photos are neat) and put together a neat book.The upside; he sets out a traditional style of karate (Ueichi-ryu) in good detail, and recites exactly the stories he heard at the dojo after training. This book could not be more sincere. And there is a lot of good information in it.The downside; he wrote this book a long time ago, when he was a shodan (first degree) black belt. Now he's a ninth degree black belt in this style. Therefore his style isn't as mature as it would become. He also, at the time of this book, bought every story he heard about the style hook, line and sinker. The book is therefore exclusively that of an advocate, with no critical balance.The book is primarily of historical value at this point; there is better scholarship that this on the history of his style, and there is better instruction in technique than this. But this sets out beautifully the awe and wonder of a karate student who is exposed to a legitimate style at a time when karate was as exotic as the far side of Neptune.So read this for historical value, and for the sincerity of the author, and for the nifty photographs."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"I used this book as the primary reference book while doing research for a children's book that I wrote several years ago. Encyclopedias and other karate books just weren't as definitive as Mr. Mattson's. It was fantastic. Thank you for all the illustrations and directions. I thought so highly of this book, that a brief description and thank you is included on my acknowledgment page. It is now several years later and I am finally going to start my own training at a local school."},{"Title":"The Way of Karate","review":"This is a great book. It gives a nice historical perspective on Uechi-ryu Karate. Sensei Mattson has done a lot to help spread karate here in the U.S. One word of warning- in this (his first book) the term Karate and Kung-fu is sometimes used interchangably- Consider that this book was published in 1963 and those words did not mean quite the same as they do today. A definite must for your martial arts collection."},{"Title":"Sentence improvement,: A practice book in applied grammar,","review":"This practice book is not as explanatory as I expected. I will not recommend it for people who don't have a very strong grammar background to use it."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"I have read many of the \\"Law of Attraction\\" books out there, including Abraham-Hicks 'Ask and It is Given', Joe Vitale's 'Attactor Factor', and Tom Pauley's 'I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams' to name a few. Those books were good too, but I keep coming back to this one. I found this one resonated most with me. This book helped me to truly understand what I had been doing wrong, and what I needed to change to make the law of attraction work positively for me. It answered for me all the questions that the other books left me asking. Thank you Bob, for showing me the light!"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Maybe you need to be motivated to attract wealth. Good luck with whatever book you decide to buy and furthermore good luck finding the motivation to read it.That said, if you are already motivated to learn and are ready to learn a simple, practical, and proven technique---- this is the book. I own the others mentioned by the others in the reviews. I have also been to the author's website and have taken advantage of his information above and beyond the book. I am a simple guy who believes in results. Simply put: Read the whole book (and that is easy) then try the techniques. I have not had a single person I have recommended it to not get results. All the best!"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Among the reasons why it is so immensely valuable includes the fact that NOT everyone will resonate with the approach taken by Esther Hicks or Joe Vitale (or any other author for that matter). The \\"attracting abundance\\" message reaches different people from different directions. The one constant truth is that everyone needs to receive and internalize the teachings Mr. Doyle presents. Is one book covering the subject \\"better\\" than another? How can any one individual decide that for you? Of course they can't. And neither can I. You can though. I found Bob Doyle's treatment of this subject absolutely perfect and suited to MY needs. You may also, you may not. At 16 or so dollars you can afford to find out for yourself - and then pass the book on to someone you care about."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"I have read many books on the Law of Attraction over the last six months and although I kept learning new techniques and the foundations about why this law is absolutely true, I must admit that Wealth Beyond Reason has had a huge impact. The book is straight to the point about what you need to do to purposely and intentionally activate the law and why it simply does not work for most people (and how to avoid those mistakes). I can go on and on about how great of a book this is and since reading it, I have started to have some great results in my life.In the past I might have seen these circumstances as \\"coincidence\\" but after reading the book I have learned how to leverage these experiences into acquiring more of what I want out of life. I highly recommend the book to anyone that is currently a student of Law of Attration."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"I absolutely loved this book...it's humorous and informative and really takes the time to explain things in layman's terms, without \\"dumbing it down\\". I love the resources that are listed as well. This book gives a lot more than just a book...I was impressed and pleased to have a copy of it! The LOA has changed my life, and this book was my first introduction to it - something I have always known, but really helped me learn how to focus it and use it effectively in my life. I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants to improve their life - in every way!"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"This book has a great tone - an easy read with a bit of humor thrown in the mix - and very motivating and positively inspired. The book really gives a great launching point for working with the Law of Attraction as well as providing resources to tools, information, fun stuff and more. I love the tone it is written in and how easy it is to read, while also being informative and making a lot of sense! If you want to change your life - this book will surely help you get started on that path!"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"\\"Wealth Beyond Reason\\" is an inspiring and insightful book that describes and explains how anyone can apply the Law of Attraction to create unlimited wealth. This has enabled me to see some of the constraints I often put in my way to remarkable success melting away, opening avenues and opportunities that previously did not exist.The book is easy to read, understand and follow. It presents logical and practical steps that anyone should be able to use to achieve their goals in life, whether it is financial, career or social goals, say in relationships. The author spices his writing with humour at the appropriate points, which makes the book interesting to read.The book made me realize the vast potential that was lying dormant in me which I am now unlocking, revealing the boundless possibilities the world has to offer. The examples given in the book helped to reinforce the concepts presented.There are many other motivational books out there which are quite good depending on your tastes but this one had a huge impact on me. I recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration to be their best."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Really clear description of fundamentals of theory and practice for creating the life you want- with generous references to others, past and present who have been successful using these methods."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose. Even the sample meditation is uninspired.The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"I think this book was well worth the money. It's well-written, easy to understand, and is a quick read. Sure, there are other Law of Attraction books out there--and he gives you a link to eight of his recommendations. I've read a few books on the Law of Attraction and they all have their own mix to add to the pot, so you pull what you need from each one. He also includes an Experiential Meditation for you to record yourself to play back daily which I found helpful. He basically gives you all the tools you need, then it's up to you to put them to use."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"...For anyone interested in creating wealth, law of attraction, etc., this is a great book. Well-written, simple and easy to read and understand. Addresses some questions people may have after reading other e-books out there, and even includes examples from the author's personal experience to illustrate how such changes came about, so the reader can get a really good 'feel' for the process.

Thats the truth. Truth is independant of opinion...it just is. The Law of Attraction is true and the manner in which Bob Doyle expains it is fundementally spot on. In the Bible we read: \\" And ye shall know the truth, and the ctruth shall make you free.\\" (John 8: 32) You can know of the nature of the message by the fruits, and of all the Law of Attraction authors in the spotlight Bob delivers the unadulterated truth when it comes to The Law of How we Attract what we are experiencing in life. Honest evaluation of ones self will allow this knowledge to alter your reality and your results. I have experienced things I always wanted but always resisted at the same time. My Gratitude to Bob is emense in that he wrote this book not so much to obtain wealth but to share the truth. He has one book on the subject: \\"Wealth Beyond Reason\\" and I have noticed that he has not written scores of books as other authors have done. This demonstrates, at least to me, that he knows that what he is sharing is the very substance of truth on the subject matter. It is a masterpiece in and of itself. If I may share my opinion: This work has come from God Given Inspiration!Thank You Bob,Jordyn Archer"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Bob Doyle's conversational style makes this book easy to read.He is careful to introduce unfamiliar concepts clearly and concisely and to reiterate each point, often using various examples to illustrate their relevance to the reader.His use of short paragraphs adds to the book's readability.Mr. Doyle succeeds in conveying his genuine compassion for his readers and his desire for their success in absorbing the strategies which have made him so successful. His positive outlook is infectious!"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"This book arrived in half the time stated.Really made me think about things,and my life in particular and realise I need to change direction.I seem to be at the cross roads again!Understanding the Law of Attraction is really powerful stuff.A motivational read to spur you on, and more importantly keep you on trackThanks"},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"I didn't really care for this book. It may touch other people differently than it touched me. After all, different things touch people in different ways. This didn't really work out for me. It was just a rehashing of the same-old same-old out there already.If you're looking for a new angle on wealth attraction, try True Prosperity by Yehuda Berg or the one I book I keep coming back to over and over again, The Trick to Money is Having Some by Stuart Wilde. You may also like Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker which is also a great book.This one just didn't cut it for me. There's nothing new or different about it than everything else that's out there."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"This is a good book on the law of attraction. It takes the material in \\"The Secret\\" to the level of practical application. The author emphasizes the action steps needed to use the law of attraction.

His message is very similar to that of Madeleine Kay, whose book \\"Serenditpitously Rich\\" I've also reviewed and liked a little better."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Wealth beyond reason by Bob Doyle is worth whatever you paid for it. Many books have been written about the Law of Attraction, and recently also many have written about The secret (or the Key) behind The Secret, the book/dvd by Rhonda Byrne. What makes Bob's book stand out among the others is his way of explaining things from the point of view of Quantum physics. I admit, this may not be the right thing for people not familiar with physics. Another achievement of Bob is the clarity he gave me about the limiting beliefs or roadblocks that hinder our success in manifesting our desires. This is the strong point of his book. I would definitely advise everyone to read the book, especially those who are familiar with the LOA and The Secret and have not been very successful so far. Try this book."},{"Title":"Wealth Beyond Reason","review":"Just the perfect follow up ( or precurser) to The Secret.

The book helped inform us of the day-to-day activities of Jesus, and helped us sense his heart as he connected with the people around him. Some of the characters are not actually mentioned in the Bible, but Margaret brought them into the story to make it more real. We better understood the attitudes of various types of people who had contact with Jesus or heard him. We felt that we were over-hearing his close conversations with his heavenly father, and even comments from the unseen angels who were present during all the events of Jesus' life.

Margaret Montreuil's Jesus is interesting enough without shocking revelations.Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, this book takes a fresh, original approach, focusing not just on Jesus' ministry and miracles, but on his drama as a human being with his own disappointments and fears, his own joys and sorrows, and his awesome destiny that he surrenders to: to suffer, be crucified,, and be reborn to save mankind from sin.Hollywood secularists, repent: The Jewish religious leaders, channeling Jim Bakker, as well as the Reverend Fred Phelps who erected a monument against murdered Matthew Shepard (who Montreuil's loving, fiery Jesus would not have damned) in Wyoming, condemned Jesus because of their own arrogance. Oh wait, that sounds more like the Hollywood secularists trying to block Mel Gibson's \\"Passion.\\" In the Jewish leaders' denial of Jesus we see grim specters of the ACLU and the liberal left banning Nativity scenes, prayer at public events, and at high school football games.

Then, give yourself the experience of knowing the Jesus that Montreuil evokes in her love letter."},{"Title":"God In Sandals","review":"God in Sandals is a retelling of the life of Christ with the sensory details of someone who has made pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Margaret shines new understanding on well known stories. I could smell the Sea of Galilee and feel the breeze on my face and listen at Jesus' feet.

The book is written to give the reader more then just intellectual knowledge of the gospels, but to help you right into the time and place of the gospels. Through these wonderful descriptions of the people and places the reader can do more then just analyze the gospel, you can have a chance to be there through the pages of the book."},{"Title":"God In Sandals","review":"&quot;God in Sandals&quot; is unlike any book ever written about Jesus.

Their young boy, Johann, is soon re-christened \\"Johnny Texas\\" in recognition of the family's new life.One day, Dad comes home with a slave, a young black man named Tobias who seems eternally morose, because they need help on their farm. Soon, Dad decides to give Tobias his freedom; thereafter, Tobias is a much happier fellow. He puts his bill of sale (proof of freedom) in a leather pouch and wears it around his neck.Later, Dad gets involved in the war for Texas independence, and readers are treated to a BRIEF recap of the Battle of San Jacinto, wherein Sam Houston routed the Mexican army and captured Santa Anna.This is a good book for seven-year-old Texans because they will, if they have been properly educated, recognize much of the Texas history -- plus, it's a simple story organized into chapters, and serves as an excellent introduction to the world of literature.I recommend this book to kids throughout the United States. Texas history is more interesting than the history of any other state, and everyone should learn about it."},{"Title":"Johnny Texas","review":"When I was 6 years old in 1950, my grandmother took me to a special event at the local drug store in Yorktown, Texas, which as of three years ago still had the original iron hitching posts along the sidewalk. The event was the local release of Johnny Texas, and Carol Hoff was signing copies of her new book. Recently my sister came across my copy and sent it to me. It's pretty ragged by now, having been read several times by me and having subsequently gone through a number of other kids. But I was overjoyed to find that it still has the same magic it had 50 years ago. I recently reviewed a number of books for a school curriculum program, and it was daunting to find just how muddy, disjointed and confused--both emotionally and philosophically--most \\"modern\\" juvenile fiction has become. All these years of pop psychology and political correctness have taken their toll. We no longer tell stories kids are expected to enjoy; we indoctrinate future citizens of the gray zone. Johnny Texas is about real people confronting and handling challenges in a real world. Their motivations are recognizable, their moral choices unambiguous. The history is fascinating. More importantly, real kids in or out of Texas will still find this one heck of a great story. Given current literacy levels, I'd say it's good for ages 8 - 12--also for English as a Second Language programs."},{"Title":"Johnny Texas","review":"This book is an old-fashioned adventure story in which a young boy shoulders the responsibility of taking care of his family.

Tragically, the book was lost in a move many years ago, but I still treasure the memory of the story of Johann and the deep love he came to have for Texas.

My first little stack of books made me feel right at home. Johnny is a newcomer to Texas, too. He is from Europe (he is Czech, actually), and in this book and its sequel, we learn that Johnny and his family come through Galveston via the Harrisburg Stage. That is lots of fun for us Houstonians. Harrisburg is now just a street \\"inside the loop,\\" but it was once a thriving community of its own. Johnny's family farms, learns to live in Texas, is anti-slavery.In a sense, one could say the book is dated in the simple language and goals of the characters.

Seeing how he came to be cosmopolitan helped teach me how I could make some progress towards that goal.Don't think that you're going to come away from this book with a thorough understanding of cosmopolitanism.

I didn't know that , too. The guy, the author of this book, is insanely brilliant; I never thought I could read a book on philosophy, having taken only two philosophy courses in college, although I read a lot on the Philosophy of Science and the Methodology of Economics. Superb work!The book tells us that globalization is out; localization is in. But cosmopolitan localization comes with a clear head and mainly a warm heart. Cosmopolitans' sensibilities no longer depend on the travels to remote places by curious anthropologists and their interpretations of the world, far from it. The foreigners are already here - among us - and to stay. This means \\"cosmopolitan isn't hard work; repudiating it is (p. xx); it begins with the simple idea that in the human community, as in national communities, we need to develop habits of coexistence: conversation in its older meaning, of living together, association\\" (p. xix). The fact that \\"the foreignness of foreigners, the strangeness of strangers ... are real enough, [but also that] we have been encouraged ... to exaggerate their significance by an order of magnitude\\" (p. xxi) challenges our inherited values and value systems. The challenge affects self-image adversely; it \\"shatters the mirror.\\" Looking at ourselves in the pieces of broken glass we still see ourselves, but now also the stranger behind us, which makes us feel confused. Since the stranger is us, at least he is one of us, the old-fashioned positivism becomes obsolete, and \\"the facts on the ground\\" begin to dominate highbrow theories. Moral contentions are now a part of life and only practice brings resolution, and resolution it must bring because the stranger we see is imaginary, contaminated by cosmopolitanism, and struggling to sort out whose culture it is he is following. In this struggle, the \\"counter-cosmopolitans\\" are still present but they are losing the day, thanks to the \\"kindness of strangers.\\"Cosmopolitanism is truly one of the \\"issues of our time.\\" I learned so much from this book, and want you to do the same as well.Amavilah, AuthorNational Wealth Accounting and Baseball Player Exports: Economic Implications for PerformanceISBN: 978-3838330099Economic Versus Non-Economic Dimensions of the Well-being of Nations.ISBN: 9783838320984Modeling Determinants of Income in Embedded Economies.ISBN: 1600210465Quotable Arthur SchopenhauerISBN: 9781430324959"},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Cosmopolitanism addresses some of the host of questions that arise from our living together on the same small planet with a diverse range of cultures and peoples, whose practices and values differ, sometimes radically, from our own. When individuals and cultures clash on questions of how to act and what is important, it can seem impossible to adjudicate between them without simply taking sides. This is especially true when it becomes clear that both sides make sense, at least on their own terms, given the history and context out of which they arose.Appiah uses examples drawn from his own experience growing up in Ghana, and brings to bear ideas drawn from a range of sources, in an attempt to carve out a middle ground between \\"dogmatic universalism\\" (the view that there is one right way to live and other ways are wrong) and \\"skeptical relativism\\" (that suggests anything goes and every worldview and set of practices is as right, or wrongheaded, as any other). One attractive possibility is to find at least common grounds for adjudicating disputes, under the assumption that where we can't agree regarding the ultimate values that inform our actions we might be able to agree to accept a common tribunal. This agreement to accept a \\"higher power\\" that adjudicates disputes can be rooted in the Hobbesian motive of self-preservation: i.e. we might see that it is in our interest to submit to the decisions of governing bodies because otherwise we are likely to kill each other. But if that was all there were, there would be no reason for a stronger people or nation to accept the rulings of these bodies when they have the power to overcome disputes by force.The argument here is that there needs to be something more than self-interest motivating our agreement to disagree peaceably, and to find ways of adjudicating disputes without resorting to violence. This \\"something more\\" is what Appiah calls \\"cosmopolitanism\\" - a kind of attitude of respect for and interest in differences. It involves, as he sees it, an extension of sympathies from the local to the global, but always in particular ways. I can never know enough to care about everyone except in the most abstract and general way, but knowing enough about some culture other than my own to appreciate their ways and see them on their own terms, can help at least to minimize the strangeness of other cultures I have so far not understood. That only sets the stage for solutions to the really hard problems that arise when these others engage in practices I find detestable or that impact me directly. Still, cosmopolitan values make it more likely that we will support institutions that help us to resolve such problems collaboratively, through dialogue, by appealing to ideas and values and practices implicit in the opposing worldviews, and by being open to the possibility that we are the ones who might need to adjust our expectations and actions.Obviously, this attitude of fellow feeling with strangers is only a starting point; care on a local level is always care for individuals, but I can only care about anonymous others in a very generic way. In some cases it can do not much more than compel a weak sense that \\"something ought to be done\\" about the needs of others who I don't have a connection with. I think there might need to be something stronger, and there may be something stronger than the extension of local care beyond the local. Part of what binds us together in community at a local level is the kind of care he describes as the heart of cosmopolitanism; but what brings us together in the first place is something stronger than care, the drive that the Greeks called eros. We are not just obliged to take care of each other given that we depend upon one another, but we also want to be together, we are driven to come together, both to procreate and to collaborate in the creation of communities and institutions and culture. Eros is a creative drive, but one that can only be realized through collaboration with diversely situated partners. Part of what drives the cosmopolitan, part of what motivates exploration of unfamiliar worlds and motivates the desire to initiate oneself into unfamiliar ways, is this creative drive. The intriguing thing, though is that \\"eros\\" as I'm describing it is not something that can be anonymously extended like care can be extended into a sense of general respect. This creative drive, that urges me to connect with others who are different and find and create new ways of being together, can't really be the basis of ethics. It is not something I \\"ought\\" to do, as I \\"ought\\" to care about the suffering of others, but is always born of a kind of excitement and longing. As I read his book, a side of cosmopolitanism that I think Appiah does not emphasize sufficiently is the importance of finding ways to foster the cross-fertilization between cultures that doesn't just lead to mutual understanding and care in spite of differences in traditions, but also creates new ways of being together that are unanticipated in the traditions that were formed apart."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"With entertaining vignettes from his experiences in Ghana, Kwame Appiah holds out the possibility of living peacefully together by valuing not just humanity but specific human lives and accepting our share in supporting one another."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Excellent, Brilliant and full of wisdom.

Call me a globalized liberal who thinks we can work most things out, but the fact that besides a bedrock belief in toleration of all but intolerance, there is little else that exists as a absolute in Appiah's thinking is attractive to me.Appiah (like me, I'd say) is not interested in all encompassing theories. But he is also wary of an all out relativism. Appiah seems to be trying to walk a line somewhere in the middle. He argues that through engagement, \\"contamination\\" and tolerance we can create a new ethics what exactly this means in practical application isn't always clear, and this small book doesn't answer all the questions I have, but it's a start.

It is a pity the author did not address this question, before rushing into its development. For indeed, the fundamental question is: do we need one? Of course, there will be no dearth of those who'll argue that without \\"absolutes\\" (theirs, of course) humanity is doomed. Now more than ever: as numbers increase, we risk getting on each other's nerves - the clash of civilizations, you know.The genius of Darwin was to dispense with the idea that \\"intelligent design\\" was at all necessary for the evolution of living nature. The bets are that he was right. The next step would be to dispense with the idea that an \\"intelligent ethical design\\" is necessary at all. Professor APPIAH, whose life and experience straddles continents, would have been well placed to dare utter the unmentionable - that we do not need a \\"universal ethics\\" - we manage to get along with simple, local rules, thank you very much - or plain common sense.Take one of the mainstays of armchair arguments about humanity. Selfish humanity is the prisoner of prisoner's dilemma. Unless common and compulsory rules are designed and enforced we'll be faced with the tragedy of the commons. Based on such a glorious insight a famous demographer argued in 1968 for a global and compulsory, enforceable agreement on population control. Had he done a reality check instead, he would have noticed that educated women in the West were taking the matter into their hands. No agreement was necessary - millions of diverse minds in infinitely diverse circumstances somehow zeroed in on a convergent solution. And indeed, this is what is happening now worldwide today - except where intelligent moral design or conflict is interfering with it.It all goes back to the \\"absolutist\\" view that humans are essentially identical dummies, clad in fancy but contingent garb. Men are selfish - period. Men are totally corrupted by sin - pass the port, will you? The world outside, thank you, is everything but essentialist. Diversity is the name of the game, so general rules are difficult to derive, even more difficult to enforce. On the other hand if you let diversity play out long enough, accommodation will ensue. There is no high road, signposts and all, just infinite path-dependent outcomes like those that led her mother to declare Kumasi her \\"home\\", and his father to be a British barrister.Based on such grains of reality, had he asked cultural anthropologists like Leach or Geertz, they would have explained that plasticity and pragmatism within traditional societies - rather than contamination from without - is what makes their classification so difficult. Do I hear some distant whimsical giggles coming from Western Samoa?Studying humanity as it adapts (or maldapts) would be, in my view far more fruitful than putting it on the Procustes bed of theory and a priori thinking. Of course, it all comes with a price: we cannot make predictions. We are not *assured\\" the outcome beforehand, even though, as anyone who dabbles in history knows, this is pure delusion.Speculating whether surreptitiously killing a mandarin in China to enrich oneself is morally justified or not (pg. 155) is just idle thought. The author lifts this question from Balzac - but misses the obvious cue in the text: the person to whom the question is directed answers with a joke. A frivolous question only deserves a frivolous answer.Having chosen to engage in theory, this text is a tortuous intellectual canter at the edge of reality, skillfully avoiding any reality check of most concepts and abstractions that are introduced. So large looms the preoccupation with the \\"ought to\\" that any enquiry into \\"what is\\" or \\"what do we actually do\\" is ignored. At the end the ride looks no more than the rocking gently on a wooden horse in the merry-go-round: pleasant, but in the end circular.The author ought to have stuck to consequentialism. Experience uncovers consequences. Experience is transformative - so all ex ante armchair speculation is vacuous. Our use of \\"values\\" shows that each one of us is seldom consequent about values - even less so about their ranking. Circumstances sway us, and then we construct rationalizations after the fact. If we can draw a conclusion from our experience is that humanity is \\"crooked timber\\" - to use Kant's famous words. Which should come to no surprise, the whole of nature has the same feel about bit.Yet, looking back at the history of our last 10'000 years we can detect some form of progress - the accumulation of experience seems to have taught us some lessons. Famines, disease and poverty are receding, slavery is on the wane, and the role of women is better accepted. We have waged wars, persecuted, and even created holocausts along the way. But at the end of the day we seem to be adjusting to a cosmopolitan way of life - even without a cosmopolitan ethic to guide us into it. Such an ethic might just be the result, rather than the precondition, of complexification.Of course, \\"past performance is no guarantee of future results\\" - and one may still be tempted to impose \\"redeeming\\" values from on high to ensure the outcome. There are certainly those who are agitating in this direction, or imagining \\"clashes of civilization\\" unless we do so. Looking back it seems that trying to enforce conformity on our profoundly diverse species has been cause for many (I'd venture most) wars. Experience would tend to make me skeptical of any \\"intelligent design of morality\\". This is not a recipe for \\"laisser aller\\" - it is a plea for aconcentrated study of what works in accommodation, hoping that among the many recipes few can become more widespread.Nothing is certain, and indeed, intelligent moral design (be it religious or secular in origin) may be the way to go. My skeptical mind would rather entrust the future to the study of diversity of approaches and the accumulation of experience - hoping for a cosmopolitan society at the end of the run.Experience is the best Ockham's razor at hand. Pity the author has failed to wield it decisively, adding irrelevancies like witchcraft and taboos instead. Though our mind invents such constructs every day, the slow working of experience wears them away continuously."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Appiah surly has a gift with pen in hand, and this book here is perhaps one of the most comforting book I have read covering a range of intellectual disciplines; anthropology, ethics, cultural geography, humanism, moral, sexuality, sociology, and virtues to name a few \\"areas\\" the book brushes on.

When I started reading it, I thought it was about globalism. How wrong I was. Well, it IS about living on a multifarious planet, but I found many of the insights useful in understanding local email flamewars which I have witnessed (and perhaps caused), and other local differences of opinion. It has caused me to question some of my own attitudes about communities and beliefs I regard as backward (such as American fundamentalist Christianity). I have discovered strong culture clashes within my own nation, a confrontation more stark than much of what I expect to encounter upon traveling.I feel I have become somewhat more aware of my unproductive attitudes toward those who differ from me, and that boon alone is worth the time I spent with this book.

Besides the advices on how to converse properly, I was left with a taste of subtle fatality hidden behind a veil of optimism."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Very insightful. Draws on past scholarship to apply to our world today."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"There is, so far, no better or more mature book on moral cosmopolitanism than Appiah's Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers. In it, Appiah makes plain, by well-crafted appeals to the reader's good sense that are replete with ethnographic examples and real-world insights, what romantics and theologians have been telling us for ages: There is but a hair's breadth of difference between us; a tiny space that we can fill with causes for consternation and hatred, or with salutary joy at considering that difference. This Appiah does without in any way suggesting that there can ever be an end to the moral and cultural tensions that those differences do and must invite. He sketches the tenable cosmopolitanism we have been waiting for, and he parts company with the sentimentalist versions that remain - and should remain - in the shallow end of the pool.Appiah, here as elsewhere (The Ethics of Identity), marvels that so many intellectuals have distorted the truth about the key insights of cosmopolitans, and he takes them to task. These have argued that cosmopolitanism contains an incredible and/or dangerous set of normative proposals and disregards the \\"facts\\" of human nature (that we are an insular species, with a territoriality that is red in tooth and claw). Appiah deftly replies that it is the cultural conservative, the jejune jingoist or nationalist, the duped hyper-contextualist, whose view of the world and of human nature is distorted, for the history of human social, cultural and even sexual intercourse is replete with cross-pollinations of language, religion, art, dress, rites, metaphysical outlooks, and progeny, all bespeaking an enormous aptitude for cooperation, bonding and friendship. We are an inter-cultural, intertwined, and interdependent species, just like every other on the planet. The view of ourselves as culturally isolated is the view that bears the burden of proof. It is, in fact, demonstrably false.Appiah laments that so many philosophers and intellectuals, adopting a bad historicism, have argued, falsely, that we humans can only see the world up to the point of our own contextual \\"walls.\\" He joins many - George Lakoff, Martha Nussbaum, William Sloane Coffin, Mohandis K. Gandhi, R.W. Emerson - in arguing that the greater truth of our humanity is our ability to imaginatively think new thoughts, to reconsider plans of life, to fashion new worlds of possibility, while acknowledging that each of us has a home that we should cherish, improve, perfect, and defend.However, I in turn lament that this volume has failed to address what continues to go missing in normative literature - the role of love in moral imagination. For it seems to me that it is love - a word we are so often afraid to use in our secular and public discourse - that has the most power to make proper use of that hair's breadth of difference that we often find so important, that we are so ready to murder and maim for - where we, sometimes and lamentably, lend credence to those who would see us as best understood as having natures that are red in tooth and claw. I would like Professor Appiah to consider this a challenge, a challenge to write one more book to overcome what I perceive as this volume's single, but important, failing. I make this challenge because, once this failing is remedied, his body of work will have provided us with a full circle of mature cosmopolitan thought in the contemporary world."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"One of the most pernicious ideas has spung from the myth that we are necessarily separated and segregated into groups that are defined by criteria like gender, language, race, religion or some other kind of boundary. And it is easy to see that these boundaries are a major cause of conflict.The author of this enthralling book - Kwame Anthony Appiah - challenges this kind of separative thinking by resurrecting the ancient philosophy of \\"cosmopolitanism.\\" This school of thought that dates back almost 2500 years to the Cynics of Ancient Greece. They first articulated the cosmopolitan ideal that all human beings were citizens of the world. Later on, these ideas were elaborated by another group of philosophers: the Stoics.According to Appiah, the influence of cosmopolitanism has stretched down the ages and through to the Enlightenment. He takes Immanuel Kant's notion of a League of Nations and the Declaration of the Rights of Man to be two manifestations of this ancient idea.Appiah sees cosmopolitanism as a dynamic concept based on two fundamental ideas. First is the idea that we have responsibilities to others that are beyond those based on kinship or citizenship. Second is something often forgotten: just because other people have different customs and beliefs from ours, they will likely still have meaning and value. We may not agree with someone else, but mutual understanding should be a first goal.The book is full of personal experiences. I doubt that anyone else could have written it: His mother was an English author and daughter of the statesman Sir Stafford Cripps, and his father a Ghanaian barrister and politician, who reminded his children to remember that they were \\"citizens of the world.\\"Appiah was educated in Ghana and England and has taught in both countries. He now holds a chair of Philosophy at Princeton. He is no starry eyed idealist, and he knows that differences between groups and nations cannot be wished away or ignored. But he contends, rightly, I think, that differences can be accepted without being allowed to become barriers.As he says, \\"Cosmopolitans suppose that all cultures have enough overlap in their vocabulary of values to begin a conversation. But they don't suppose, like some Universalists, that we could all come to agreement if only we had the same vocabulary.\\" The reason is simply this: most of us arrive at our values not on the basis of careful reasoning, but by lifelong conditioning and subjective beliefs and attitudes.In parts of Europe, there have recently been misgivings about the growing diversity and multiculturalism of countries like the United Kingdom, with people asking whether it is doing no more than fracturing society. Appiah tackles this question head on. He has this to say, \\"If we want to preserve a wide range of human conditions because it allows free people the best chance to make their own lives, there is no place for the enforcement of diversity by trapping people within a kind of difference that they long to escape. There simply is no decent way to sustain those communities of difference that will not survive without the free allegiance of their members.\\"Cosmopolitanism, balances our \\"obligations to others\\" with the \\"value not just of human life but of particular human lives,\\" what Appiah calls \\"universality plus difference.\\" He remains skeptical about simple maxims for ethical behavior such as the Golden Rule. He swiftly demonstrates its failings as a moral precept. He argues that cosmopolitanism is the name not \\"of the solution but of the challenge.\\"This is an important book that will inevitably be controversial. In a world that is becoming more interconnected and shrinking by the day, and where the \\"clash of cultures\\" threatens our existence, Appiah has many new perspectives as he articulates a precise yet flexible ethical manifesto. He does not claim to have all the answers, but this book should be of interest to all of us as we try to make sense of the turmoil, challenges and opportunities of our globalizing world."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Appiah has written an intelligent, urbane, and concise analysis of, and prescription for, the global world we have come to inhabit. His title \\"Cosmopolitan\\" is intended to evoke its etymology, that we are \\"citizens of the world.\\" Unlike Robert Wright in \\"The Moral Animal,\\" Appiah rejects a one-world government, insisting we need to maintain a pluralistic system of governments for the ostensible purpose of creative enhancements, e.g., changes to the existent models through new insights, programs, and trial-and-error (hopefully, with errors corrected).This book tackles some of the ethical issues involved as the global perspective is taking shape. Most of his prescriptions are pragmatic (Chap. 4: \\"Primacy of Practice\\"), rather than doctrinaire, evidenced most clearly in his chapter on pluralistic cultures and how best to \\"manage\\" their differences (Chap. 8: \\"Whose Culture Is It, Anyway?\\"). He clearly disdains the positivist approach (\\"Escape from Positivism\\"), yet in spite of this disdain, he keeps to the empirical side of most questions (Chap. 3: \\"Evidence on the Ground\\"). Aristotlean common-sense is offered where it's needed.That we are all neighbors should by now be obvious (Chap. 5: \\"Imaginary Strangers\\" and passim), and while capitalism is accepted, not without its fetters. Islamic and Christian fundamentalism are reproved appropriately (Chap. 9: \\"The Counter-Cosmopolitans\\"), while the Anglican-type of latitudinarianism is espoused (without the religious particulars). \\"Pluralism\\" is our global credo, to which I heartily reply, \\"Amen.\\" I often wish we recognized it as our national credo as well.He forthrightly repudiates Singer's and Unger's utilitarian \\"moral calculi,\\" and extols a person-centered ethic in their stead. He also insists that the \\"stranger\\" is no longer an alien, and we still need to heed the New Testament's advice (Rom. 12:11: \\"Contribute to the needs of the saints, extend hospitality to strangers\\"). Indeed, we all come \\"at\\" our situations with different assumptions and histories, and, with some obvious exceptions, we owe each other respect as we \\"converse\\" in hopes of appreciating our differences and understanding our common ground.Multiculturalism, besides being incoherent, is not the solution, because \\"original cultures\\" are a myth, and not all cultures are \\"equal.\\" He takes issue with cultural \\"contamination\\" and its typical reaction of \\"disgust,\\" offering examples of inappropriate stigmitization (e.g., homosexuality, unusual religious beliefs, etc.). Only when we recognize each other as \\"fellow citizens,\\" and respect everyone enough to engage them seriously, then we're on the course to mutual respect, pluralistic tolerance, and genuine concern. And the Golden Rule, while not perfect, isn't a bad place to start. Ultimately, there is no \\"us\\" vs. \\"them,\\" for we're all citizens of the same world."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"In this short, brilliantly written book, Princeton philosophy professor Kwame Anthony Appiah attempts to articulate an ethical theory that applies to our current age of globalization. Taking as his starting point the writings of Diogenes, the 4th century Greek Cynic philosopher, Appiah develops a philosophy of cosmopolitanism modeled on Diogenes' \\"citizen of the world.\\" A citizen of the world regards the individual rather than family, tribe, or nation as the primary focus of ethical agency. And that it is important to recognize that individuals are bound by belief systems and cultures that are not only different but may also be opposed to their own. Cosmopolitanism is an ethics somewhere between relativism and universalism that can build a working relationship between adherents of different belief systems enabling coexistance but not necessarily agreement.This is not as easy as it sounds; in fact, it doesn't even sound easy. Cosmopolitanism is, in addition to Diogenes legacy, a product of the Enlightenment in that it celebrates diversity and multiculturalism; it is tolerant of diverse moralities. However, it is intolerant of those who would deny tolerance of this diversity or plurality. This is the central dilemma of cosmopolitanism. It attempts to reconcile liberal universal values with the values of those who disagree with them. Cosmopolitanism believes in the basic freedoms, including freedom of speech but it will curb any speech that calls for restricting that freedom.This dilemma is currently playing itself out worldwide with the publication in a Danish newspaper cartoons depicting Mohammed. Denmark is a quintessential liberal country and regards mocking belief systems as a basic human right. On the other hand, for Muslim fundamentalists the content of the cartoons roils beliefs that they live and die for. Other European countries expressed solidarity with the Danes, reaffirming their rights to freedom of speech. Likewise, Muslim extremists worldwide are rioting and calling it blasphemy.Appiah is, of course, a product of Western schooling, so his position is probably more on the side of the Danes. (I'm assuming since this book was written before the incident.) Appiah's cosmpolitanism stands for enlightened liberal values, but with a difference. He recognizes that Muslim fundamentalism is a challenge to cosmopolitanism - he calls them counter-cosmopolitans - because it too is a morality, a universal one. However, Muslim fundamentalism is not a tolerant universalism. Appiah's cosmopolitanism believes in universal truth as well, \\"though we are less certain we already have all of it.\\" This is not skepticism nor is it relativism, it is a more humble relationship with universal truth. Cosmopolitans believe that there are many values worth living for, its just that we cannot live for all of them, but we can live alongside them.And how will the cartoon drama play itself out? My guess is that the Muslim fundamentalists will not back down, for them it is blasphemy pure and simple. The Danes, being secular, tolerant, and inclined towards cosmopolitanism, will recognize that freedom of speech is an excercise in self-restraint. They will have learned that the cartoons genuinely offended a certain group of people, and, as a consequence, they will apologize, but without abandoning their values. This illustrates another aspect of cosmopolitanism known as fallibilism. They know that knowledge is at best imperfect and is subject to change in the light of new understanding. The Danes will have learned something from this incident because cosmopolitanism is a open-ended system, the Muslim fundamentalists, on the other hand, will have learned nothing beyond what they already know.\\"Cosmopolitans don't insist that everyone become cosmopolitan. They know they don't have all the answers. They're humble enough to think that they might learn from strangers; not too humble to think that strangers can't learn from them.\\""},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"In my opinion this book deserves considerably less acclaim than it appears to have received. As a modest call for understanding among cultural groups, who could disagree? Appiah, however, himself a product of two contrasting cultures, here takes on a more daunting task: reconciling his respect for the cultures of both his African father and English mother, but the result is a rather incoherent narrative, especially in chapters 2 and 3. This is perhaps best demonstrated by two statements that appear on p-42. In defense of his paternal culture, he first writes \\"There is nothing unreasonable, then, about my kinsmen's belief in witchcraft.\\" His word \\"then\\" is a reflection of his claim, made on the previous pages, that the \\"Duhem thesis\\" allows him to argue that all attempts to grasp reality are culturally conditioned and can therefore be regarded as \\"valid\\" within the cultures in which they arise. However, this claim seriously misconstrues the Duhem thesis, with Appiah's arguments reflecting the postmodernist thinking of the \\"science wars\\" era of some 30 years ago that is now largely discredited. But then comes his second statement as his mother's culture comes to the fore: \\"What's wrong with the theory of witchcraft is not that it doesn't make sense but that it isn't true.\\" In these two statements one can see the tension in Appiah's struggle to reconcile his bicultural upbringing. That his Asante father really believes he is communicating with his ancestors when he pours whiskey on the floor (p-34) may be interesting, but that is hardly a convincing alternative to the scientific worldview of his maternal forebearers.Another problem is Appiah's seeming unawareness that \\"culture\\" can be a literal prison for a sensitive person raised within it. In defense of what used to be called \\"female genital mutilation\\" he here (p-73) tells African women that the operation can be regarded as \\"an expression of your cultural identity.\\" Try telling that to Hirsi Ali, whose efforts to free herself, at considerable personal risk, of the bonds of a very similar cultural background after having received such a \\"cultural identity\\" mark has attracted worldwide attention. Also unmentioned by him is any recognition that over the span of human history it has often been precisely those who found the courage to think and act in opposition to their cultural heritage who became some of humanities greatest benefactors. When confronted by epilepsy Jesus saw only a boy possessed by demons, but 400 years earlier while discussing that same disease Hippocrates mocked his cultural compatriots and their demon-haunted world by claiming that epilepsy was nothing more than the result of natural causes, and he thereby laid the foundations for the long journey that culminated in the benefits of modern medicine. Appiah's primary motivation seems to be a desire to step on no one's toes, but his efforts are unconvincing, and he might well have considered these comments of Edward Grant, a major figure in understanding the history of science. While speaking of the cultural backwardness of medieval Europe when faced by the superior cultures of the Middle East, Grant wrote:\\"Latin scholars in the 12th century recognized that not all cultures are equal. They were painfully aware that with respect to science and natural philosophy, their civilization was manifestly inferior to that of Islam. They faced an obvious choice: learn from their superiors or remain inferior forever. They chose to learn. Had they assumed that all cultures were equal . . . they would have had no reason to seek out Arab learning and the glorious scientific legacy that followed would not have occurred.\\"Well said, even though Appiah provides little evidence of grasping the significance of such a perspective."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"There are few individuals more qualified to write a book on the idea of cosmopolitanism than Kwame Anthony Appiah. Biracial, raised in both Ghana and England, multicultural, multilingual, educated at Cambridge but teaching at Princeton, Appiah has an inside familiarity with larger world that few can rival. It is tremendously encouraging to me, a WASP who has been unable to engage in any real travel, that we both seem to share precisely the same ideals. My experience of the world counts for little; his a great deal. Yet it shows that people with extremely different backgrounds can embrace the same ideals.Appiah is a philosopher, but though he has clearly been raised in the Anglo-American linguistic philosophical tradition, he has not found himself restricted by it. From the various philosophers he quotes, I'm sure that he and had had similar philosophical training. I envy the way that he can make what I learned as logical positivism (Appiah lops off the \\"logical\\") and make it relevant in a discussion of wider cultural issues. Though he obviously was trained in the tradition honed by Russell, Carnap, Frege, Ryle, Austin, Anscombe, Dummett, and the large contingent of American and British logicians and philosophers of language, none of them have informed his literary style. In fact, the two writers Appiah reminds me of most are Herodotus and Montaigne. Like them, he feels a license to bring into his discussion almost anything. If he is cosmopolitan on a moral and social level, he is also as a multidisciplinarian. Nor does he hesitate at mixing cultures. Many of the most compelling passages in the book detail incidents from his experience in Ghana.The point of the book is to discuss many of the problems that arise if one attempts to embrace--as Appiah clearly feels we all should--cosmopolitan ideals. He deals interestingly with a host of issues, from the idea of who owns the products of a culture to the incommensurability of values from one culture to another (or their possible commensurability) to whether it is problematic when there are conflicts on fundamental issues. As a person he seems to have been deeply molded by all of the cultural influences in which he grew up, but as a philosopher he is exceptionally British. Over the decades there have been a number of British thinkers who have been able to cut through a thick wad of nonsense and discuss issues in a balanced, commonsensical manner. Gilbert Ryle had this capacity, as did (sometimes) G. E. Moore, and so also Mary Midgley. While his views are unquestionably progressive, Appiah always seems to avoid extremes to arrive at conclusions that are, above all else, balanced and reasonable. He is a master at making sense. So when philosopher Peter Unger argues that we all have a moral obligation to give every penny that we do not need for our own sustenance to organizations like UNICEF and OXFAM so that food and medicine can be purchased for the desperately poor in the Third World. Appiah, on the other hand, believes that a world in which no one bought a ticket to the opera would be flat and uninteresting. Besides, what really matters is reforming local governments in order to provide long-term transformation of the socioeconomic structures in the areas most afflicted by poverty, something that giving exclusively to UNICEF and OXFAM will not accomplish (though for the record, Appiah thinks both organizations are very important and he does not discourage contributing to them). Though he does not state it as a principle, he constantly employs something akin to Aristotle's golden mean.I especially enjoyed his chapter on The Counter-Cosmopolitans. He places many of today's Islamic extremists in this category, though he also very correctly places many Christian fundamentalists here as well. I have long fantasized about writing a book about contemporary proponents of Counter-Enlightenment ideas (a book I will never write because I haven't mastered the range of disciplines such a project would require). Isaiah Berlin wrote frequently about various Counter-Enlightenment thinkers such as Hamaan, but I believe it can be extended into the present for such mass movements as various religious fundamentalisms (Christian, Islamic, as well as Jewish), the New Age movement, contemporary astrology, right wing political movements, and free market capitalism. Obviously I can't make my claim here, but I found Appiah's discussion of the counter-cosmopolitans to overlap entirely with counter-enlightenment ideals.I value this book not only for its ideals and the intelligent discussion of a host of thorny issues, but for Appiah's warm humanity and wonderful literary style. It is not merely an intelligent book but a well-written one as well."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"We can move to a better neighborhood or to a different country. But all humanity is our neighbor, like them or not.Mr. Appiah, the renowned Princeton philosophy professor, challenges us with the paradox of a common humanity, among which, different ethnic and religious groups often do not share customs, or even the same values. The Cosmopolitan thesis is that, despite being strangers in many ways, our common humanity provides a basis for mutual respect and compassion.What anchors the paradox at one end is that, for most of human history, we knew only our own kind, with limited need to understand, let alone to accept, the customs of people in other groups. Over the last few centuries, increased trade and communication, as well as industrial pollution and international terrorism, has changed framework. Since our actions can affect \\"lives everywhere,\\" ethical living implies responsibilities beyond our immediate environment and social group. Humanity has become, in a sense, one \\"tribe.\\"Mr. Appiah reminds us that the view of being a citizen of the world reflects intellectual traditions at least as old as classical times; that Marcus Aurelius, whose works were attractive to many Christian intellectuals, himself sought to suppress Christianity; that, then again, Christianity, whose allegiances have often fueled persecution, originally spread from Paul's assertion of \\"neither Jew nor Greek . . . . for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" Yet, Mr. Appiah also reminds us, respect for those different includes respect for their freedom to be separate, as in the case of the Amish in the United States.If you find yourself often straddling the same paradox and long to find a partner in the journey, you will find one in Mr. Appiah's short (196 pp.), varied, and challenging book. He provides examples of agreeing, yet agreeing to disagree. The non-Muslim for example, would agree on the devout's right to make a hajj to Mecca, but may not agree that a Deity has commanded it, or that avoiding pork is appropriate. The paradox is exemplified in explanations of the natural world. Even an agreement on facts leaves ambiguity in theories; e.g., whether it is germs or (many tiny) spirits that cause disease. Mr. Appiah makes a case that there are even fewer compelling arguments based on fact in the determination of values. The journey continues to the Ghana of the author's father, where we find out about \\"taboos\\" dealing with bush meat and menstruating women. A distinction made here is that, while taboos separate peoples, or classes within peoples (rulers, nobles, and slaves), morals differ in that they guide us in the treatment of others, so a taboo is a distinction with less of a difference. Even so, taboos are common to all cultures; westerners eat pigs but not cats.A cosmopolitan understands and can live with difference, even when the differences are mutually understood. A \\"universalist,\\" on the other hand, expects agreement through understanding. Mr. Appiah has us step back from taboos, to the more engaging questions of values. Still, while most people in a society value fair punishment, not all agree that punishment is worth the risk of punishing the innocent; while men in different societies relate their honor to the chastity of related women, not all of these men would agree that honor compels killing a woman who is raped. We find that reasoned argument does not compel either of these positions to those taking them. There seems to be a sort of getting \\"used to,\\" that even a great mathematician (von Neumann) would endorse as reason's companion.Mr. Appiah's treads lightly across serious subjects, and perhaps that is a cosmopolitan virtue. He contends that strangers are beyond communication mainly when they are imaginary; that is, when they are people we have not met one-to-one. Also, that, among diversity, there are inevitable commonalities: \\"I have failed to get people interested in Zeno's paradox in three continents.\\" That, when caring about others requires an \\"out-group,\\" one's caring is perhaps mere self-comfort.Mr. Appiah explores the concept of cultural preservation. He proposes a difference between preserving culture and preserving cultures. He challenges the idea of \\"authenticity,\\" as limited by the facts of history, such as the role of trade in the development of kente cloth and bagpipes. The need to \\"preserve\\" is argued as an ignorance of how free non-Westerners are to interpret American TV and consumer products. At worst, an attitude of cultural preservation condescends. We learn that the ancients saw the value of \\"contamination\\": stoic teachers traveling between city states, an African-born playwright, Publius Terentius Afer, using Greek ideas in Roman drama. We are offered, quoting this playright, a golden rule: \\"I am human: nothing is alien to me.\\"We are given a glimpse of the founder of the scouting movement, collecting (or looting?), as a prelude to a discussion of cultural objects. Mr. Appiah takes us to the question of whether a Norse goblet is more valuable in a Spanish museum or in a Norwegian family's living room. Cosmopolitanism proposes that the connection through ethnic identity across centuries is no less real than the connection through a common humanity.Mr. Appiah includes some discussion of counter-cosmopolitans, for example, Islamic fundamentalists, to help us understand by way of contrast. The universal aspect in this case, and in others, is one that looks beyond borders or ethnicity, and excludes those who disbelieve. This discussion evokes the cosmopolitan understanding that different people will have different values, and that this is quite acceptable (with some exception for values not worth having). The cosmopolitan knows that one can learn from those with whom one disagrees. The counter-cosmopolitan sees nothing to be gained by reaching out from the faithful.Finally, we are given the author's reflection on questions of sacrifice for the benefit of others. So, how much would we sacrifice to save the life of a child in a foreign country with nutrition and medicine? One hundred dollars? If that much, why not more - say, another hundred dollars. Or is there a point when it's more important to go the opera? And - is it really possible to save another's life for more than a few days, given the harsh realities of their life situation. Is it as easy as deciding to ruin a suit in order to save a child from drowning, and why? What is the principle behind the answers to these questions, if there is one.The journey continues: Mr. Appiah provides an informative and provocative guide to how to treat strangers, meant of course, in the large. I do not guarantee the reader will find comfortable answers, only insights and surprising information, and that your answers, which are how you actually live, will now have questions to challenge them."},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Appiah (the Laurence S Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy and the Center for Human Values at Princeton University)writes in an urbane introduction to the issues multiculturalism poses for our society and should be must reading for all those who want to really understand the complexity of our new century. After reading this book we might all be able to agree (to paraphrase what someone famously said about Keynes) that we are all cosmopolitian (ists) now. No one can truly escape into their own monocultural island --our cities, our media and most important our language and culture are infused with layer upon layer of global cultures whether we are aware of them or not. Appiah begins by examining the root meanings of cosmopolitianism--\\"A citizen--a polites--belonged to a particular polis, a city to which he or she owed loyalty. The cosmos referred to the world, not in the sense of the earth but in the sense of the universe. Talk of cosmopolitianism originally signaled, then a rejection of the conventional view that every civilized person belonged to a community among communities.\\"Appiah's easy non academic style helps you understand the role of the Enlightenment thinkers such as Wieland--(once called the German Voltaire Appiah adds) who wrote\\"Cosmopolitans..regard all the people of the earth as so many branches of a single family, and the universe as a state, of which they, with innumerable other than rational beings, are citizens, are citizens, promoting together under the general laws of nature the perfection of the whole, while each in his own fashion is busy about his own well-being.\\"Appiah's learning is worn lightly as he answers the all important question --what does it mean to hold the view that we are citizens of the world? What happens to local allegiances--for Virginia Woolf it meant--\\"freedom from unreal loyalties\\" and Leo Tolstoy wrote about the \\"stupidity of patriotism\\"--on the opposite side of the equation are people like Hitler and Stalin who are deep foes of cosmpolitianism and we all know how that ended up. Appiah's huge store of reading helps him navigate through the issue of loyalties which lies at the heart of the question. George Eliot's creation of Daniel Deronda-the very English gentleman who discovers his Jewish heritage only as an adult--explains his interest in studying his heritage in these terms, \\"I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of view. And I want to get rid of the a merely English attitude in studies.\\"The issue comes down to self definition and how we claim it--we have to be open to the idea that our cultural background creates a way we can connect with others--Eliot talks of the \\"closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical.\\"And this is just the introduction! The cluster of questions Appiah considers are truly wide ranging -but often remain invisible in debate--questions such \\"as what we owe strangers by virtue of our shared humanity?, can culture be \\"owned\\" ?As a philosopher he can be skilled with applying some important distinctions--so for example when we talk about objective values we are really talking about desired values --some of which depend on certain facts--he gives the example of universal vaccination as being a value --but we are often prepared to give this value up when the disease has been eliminated. Where we often go astray Appiah argues is where we view an individual's moral vocabulary as belonging to one individual--all the important values-such as kindness, cruelty are public and shared across cultures. It is first and foremost evaluative language we are using--a way of communicating to each other our preferences--if your values were not shared in language --there would be no way we could refer to them. The reason why values are important in our society is that they allow us to get things done together--we appeal to those values in order to act in the public forum--whether it is building a road, going to the moon, or making peace. Our stories that we share embody our values and certain stories are more important than others in our national culture because they enshrine some key values. So one of the purposes of studying a foreign language and reading books in translation is to appreciate the nuances of other people's values.Not all chapters are discursive essays--some are personal meditations based on growing up in Ghana and the ways that the culture and beliefs shape someone so that conversation sometimes becomes problematic. The author gives the example of medicine and how the conversation between someone who believes in witchcraft to accept the findings of modern medicine. Why should they believe in viruses--that you cannot see? Just because you said so? You can say that you can predict who can get well but not who will get sick. In the end you have to appeal to a community of people who can test the evidence that goes beyond the anectdotal and subjective.There are insights all along the way--for example the independence movements in Africa and elsewhere that brought to an end colonial rule were arguments about values--not African values per se --but values embodied in the rhetoric that hadguided the Allies in their conflict with the Axis powers--\\"It was a conflict of interests couched in terms of the same values.\\"Important points are made about so called cultural purity and cultural contamination--we see so many examples of ethnic communities within hetrogeneous cultures choosing to live within their own cultural borders--but as Appiah so eloquently argues--\\"cultural purity is an oxymoron\\"--multiculturalism is in some shape or form in all our lives--in the Middle East, in China, in Ghana and in our own western world. The entire history of culture has been related to mixing one cultural strain with another--from the Roman through to the Alexanderian and British empires to the American century--cultures are continually reinterpreted and reinvented. Intolerance for others is bred of universalistic fundamentalist creeds whether they be Islamic or Christian or Jewish can as we know all too well lead to dangerous consequences--however as Appiah reminds us the truly toxic aspects of this are not so much in terms of those beliefs but their fear and sometimes prohibition of conversation. Without conversation they can extend their belief that \\"not everyone matters\\" and other equally savage ideas and not owe anyone a justification as to why. They don't want to be drawn into explaining precisely because they don't want to have to justify themselves or their beliefs to others--because they know that their values are not ultimately defensible. Reason is at the center of it all--\\"come let us reason together\\" should be the motto of every civilized person--it offers a ground for your thinking and my thinking.In terms of the central question--what are our obligations to others--Appiah's answer is to be common sensical--it is to do \\"our fair share\\"--we cannot be required to do more. But what is our \\"fair share\\"? How do we deal with the fact that so many people are not doing their fair share? He discusses this and other issues--such as the paradox that one of the world's greatest capitalists is providing billions to help eradicate preventable diseases around the globe and our economic system allows the average cow to live on a $2.50 a day subsidy when 3 billion people live on less than $2 dollars a day. Appiah points out that Jeffrey Sachs has argued that we can eradicate extreme poverty for about $150 billion a year for 20 years. Clearly we can do better, as Appiah argues it is a \\"demand of simple morality\\" and we can also agree with him that this end might be more achievable \\"if we made civilization more cosmopolitan\\""},{"Title":"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (Issues of Our Time Series)","review":"Philosophy is hard.

The story revolves around a group of British ex-Special Forces men who are hired to assassinate Saddam Hussein and the planning and organisation involved to infiltrate Iraq, shoot Hussein and then escape. They draft in a sniper, Danny MacDonald, who is a deer stalker and we are introduced to Danny at the beginning of the book as he explains about shooting to a deer hunter. This aspect of the book - the technical detail of the sniper's craft - is fascinating and not something I've read elsewhere.As the book progresses we learn more about the characters and the plans that they are making to carry out this difficult task, although we don't know the full plot at any time - as it unfolds we understand why they organised things as they did. There is a parallel story taking place in the American NRO (National Reconnaisance Office) as they find themselves tracking the team and trying to work out who they are and what they are doing. Big brother was definitely watching them!The book has some technical detail but perhaps less than a Tom Clancy book - which isn't a bad thing. There is also more characterisation of the men involved in the mission - why they are doing it, how they handle the stress and violence - and even a couple of little romantic storylines for three of the main people involved.And do they succeed in killing Saddam Hussein? Well, you'll have to read it to find out, but it's a really great read and there's a little twist in the tail which I wasn't expecting and was fun.

Here is a book that will give you the technical details on those ships and what factors drove the particulars of their construction. Of couse this book is a study of seafaring worldwide, but much of this technology was in heavy use on the inland seas in the late nineteenth century. This makes this book a valuable addition to the maritime enthusiast's library."},{"Title":"Sail's Last Century: The Merchant Sailing Ship, 1830-1930 (Conway's History of the Ship)","review":"This is one of the Conway's History of the Ship series and like all of them, consists of a set of essays by various historians rather than a continuous narrative. After a helpful introduction, two chapters cover wooden sailing ships over and under 300 tons, then two chapters cover the transition to iron and steel sailing ships and a final chapter put all sailing ships in the nineteenth century under consideration. Next there are chapters covering schooners in American and Britain, Baltic sailing ships and finally, an intriguing chapter on the changing problems of shiphandling in the nineteenth century. There is a very good annotated bibliography and a reasonably complete glossary at the end.So what does all this give you? First the various essayists cover the economics of shipbuilding and operation in considerable detail. Next they relate that to the technical and operational advantages of sailing ships vs. steam ships and wooden ships vs. iron and steel ships. There is also knowledgable discussion of the pros and cons of various sail rigs and their effect on operations. Ship stability and structure are explicitly explained and considered though, as would be expected by the work of historians, no quantitative analysis is offered.In some of the essays the level of detail might seem a bit overpowering for a general reader but can passed through without difficulty if needed. One thing apparent is the real affection and respect the various writers have for the ships being described and for the people who sailed them. The illustrations are quite numerous, of variable quality since contemperaneous, and well related to the text.I have no hesitation recomending this book for someone with an interest in nautical matters who wants to dig deeper and learn more."},{"Title":"Cherokee Vision of Elohi","review":"This is a very good resource for anyone learning Cherokee or anyone who wants a bilingual book in Cherokee and English, and for anyone interested in Cherokee culture and history.

In between all the stories, are the authors thoughts and beliefs on reincarnation...many which come across as authoritative and unbending to other opinions.Hardo is a total believer in reincarnation, which is not bad, in my opinion. But he also seems to feel EVERYONE should believe in reincarnation, and believe in it exactly as he does. He even states at one point in the book that obviously everyone that had reached that point in the book must certainly now believe in reincarnation! In other words, he starts sounding like a missionary...no different from missionaries of organized religions. Reincarnation answers most of his questions about life, and he believes it would be that way for everyone, if they just gave it genuine consideration, and read stories that \\"proved\\" reincarnation was a reality.He also adheres to \\"God's Laws of Karma\\"...which he says means one must reap everything one sows in one's current life or future lives. Thus, if you were cruel in your last life, it makes no difference that you are no such thing in this one, and all the rest of your lives...you must still reap that cruelty! It's supposedly the only way you'll learn not to be cruel...even though, you actually obviously learned it some other way! :) I mean, really, is this way of thinking anything but a simple minded type of vengeance...that even makes God responsible for the revenge? (Roy Stemman deals with this matter very nicely in his book \\"One Soul, Many Lives\\", using an excellent quote from English journalist Hannen Swaffer.)For some reason, Hardo appears to believe all humans are cruel in the beginning, and then must go through many lifetimes to become loving. Why he believes this, he does not say. It almost sounds like the belief that we are all sinners due to the Garden of Eden. Hardo ends the book by listing all the ways life on Earth will improve once everyone believes in reincarnation. I don't know...I doubt believing in reincarnation will make \\"saints\\" out of all the \\"sinners\\" anymore than any organized religion has done so. :)"},{"Title":"Children Who Have Lived Before: Reincarnation today","review":"Children from England and around the world share their past life memories in Children Who Have Lived Before, a title which follows cases which not only recount past lives led, but includes some thought-provoking insights on kids who've been born with lost limbs and are able to describe when and where they lost them in a past life. The case for reincarnation moves up a notch in this absorbing, unique title, packed with case histories and reflections on how children's statements were verified."},{"Title":"Children Who Have Lived Before: Reincarnation today","review":"If, as a reader, you are not well informed about theories of reincarnation and after-death studies this may be the book for you. It is easily understood, presents 30+ case studies that are quite compelling, and provides a great deal of optimism for the existence of conscious life beyond physical death.If, on the other hand, you have a fairly high degree of understanding of the works of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross and Ian Stevenson, you will find parts of this book to be a bit troubling. First neither Ross nor Stevenson ever said that they have provided complete proof that there is either life after death or a phenomenon called reincarnation. Both scientists went to great lengths to state that these were merely viable options to the other conclusions that could be reached for the circumstances that they were exploring. They stated that these were possible explanations and not 'the' explanations. For this author, Trutz Hardo, to claim otherwise is somewhat slanderous on his part. Secondly, I am not sure if it merely because of a translation process, but there are a few parts in the text that the English interpretation makes little or no sense. Thirdly, the author has attempted to make a god-like icon out of Stevenson that he may, or may not, have actually deserved. Admittedly, he was a very hard working, dedicated and single-focused scientist who preformed as objectively as possible in a highly subjective and emotionally charged subject area. He was very humble and while his findings were quite compelling, he never wanted his works to have been compared to the likes of Galileo as Mr. Hardo inanely attempts to do. Lastly, the author has a tendency to be a bit Pollyannaish in his projection of the ramifications to these after-death studies. He suggests, in his ending summary, that the major religions will soon come to grasp the importance of these studies and, by doing so, will transform there long held tenets such that they come to embrace reincarnation. That will never happen! We have centuries of Jewish, Christian and Islamic dogma that have been created on a basis of having rejected the concept of multiple lives at their early beginnings. They certainly are not about to reform their stances based on meta-physical studies no matter how convincing they may be. There is nothing that is more slow moving than the forward progression of archaic church dogma, and that includes evolution.While I do advise the reading of this book to also include a bit of caution, I do advise that it be read. The case studies, alone, are worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Cics Command Level Programming","review":"I, had to becomes a CICS expert in a couple of days.

Being placed in a position where I had to assume responsibility for an existing CICS system with no formal training or other assistance in the applications programming area, I found the book to be a rather clear and concise presentation of CICS applications programming and a definite aid in understanding why the production application was structured the way it was. The book relates to an actual production application and presents the fundamentals quite well. The screen development and interaction between screens and a Cobol processing program are understandable and presented rather well. I did find the index way too short to use as a quick reference. I finally created my own which solved the problem. Unfortunately the figures and examples are too often presented on different pages resulting in paging back and forth. Having them on opposing pages would make the refrencing of examples and text a lot easier. I would also have liked if the examples of code printed would have had the sequence numbers included."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"OK. So you what to know about the final weeks of the Petersburg Campaign during the War Bewteen the States. This book gives an in-depth picture of what General Lee had described the previous year as &quot;a mere matter of time.&quot; The piece is well-documented, which you would expect from the head of the park (the author) where the Federal forces broke through Confederate lines. And there are lots of good maps to follow the action. But, in my opinion, the prose is VERY pedestrian, resulting in a narrative lacking any sense of drama, and therefore is far less than an exciting read."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"I did not have any histories on this last phase of the Petersburg campaign, so I picked up this study. The maps are decent---the best part of the book. However, what just puts me to sleep is Greene's prose. Better take some appropriate medication prior to cracking this one if you want to stay awake! The facts about the campaign and battle are there, but, in my opinion, the read is as dry as dust. This, in turn, renders the book a bore for this reader."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"Excellent book! If you've liked Gordon Rhea's books on the Overland Campaign then you'll want to add this to your collection. Wilson Greene writes that the final battles of the Petersburg Campaign were not the &quot;done deals&quot; as most Civil War students seem to think. Even though we know the eventual outcome, the story itself is very suspenseful. Even the footnotes provide valuable information on modern day roads and other books I might have overlooked. The book is filled with details,(including many excellent maps), but never bogs down. I've lived in the Petersburg area for several years and this book has given me a new found appreciation for the area and its history."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"Will Greene's latest work is absolutely spectacular. He addresses a chapter of the Eastern Theater which has been glossed over for years. Too many people jump from the Crater to Appomattox without taking into account the long and difficult maneuver campaigning which occurred during the intervening 9 months. Greene addresses this in exceptional fashion with in- depth discussion of each of the events and how it impacted on the Army of the Potomac's Sixth Corps' preparations for the culmionating assult on April 2, 1865. It is exceptionally well researched and written and a delight to read. The notations are very illuminating and provide the reader an explanation of where the 1865 battlefield fits on the road networks of 2000. A great read and a must have."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"An excellent study on the final union thrusts at Lee's defenses at Petersburg that culminate not just with Sheridan and Warren's combined collapse of Picket at Five Forks but the final break through with the VI corps punching a hole in A. P. Hill's defenses that virtually cause a hemorrhage in the Petersburg defenses only staved off by the heroic defenses at Fort Gregg and a line of artillery giving time for Lee to organize the final retreat. Petersburg was a very complicated campaign that contains a series of modest to large battles as Grant constantly moves forces west to cut off supplies and avenues of escape. As Greene describes well, Lee constantly parried with creative engineering and counter attacks. Greene provides a detailed account of all these battles that stretched over one time farms and wilderness outside of Petersburg. Petersburg was a very complicated campaign and just driving the roads today around Petersburg to some of these still remote sites makes you appreciate the effort of Greene's work. The final break through is at the center of Pamplin Historical Park for the Civil War Soldier where Greene is the Chief historian and CFO. Read the book then visit Pamplin Park, and see the extraordinary well preserved trenches where the final break through occurred and walk the trail that leads to the Union jump off point and then follow it right into the Confederate trenches where it leads right to the unique vulnerable spot of the line where the union attack punched through. It is well worth seeing park with its living history, historic headquarters, outdoor exhibits and a great modern museum. An excellent book for the serious Civil War student."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"For a variety of reasons, the successful Union assault upon the Petersburg defenses on April 2, 1865, has been largely ignored in Civil War histories, barely getting a passing mention as an incident just before Lee's retreat to Appomattox. But the battle of April 2, as Greene ably demonstrates, was a crucial military action. It was, quite simply, the battle that broke the backbone of Lee's defenses and necessitated the immediate evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond. The story is told largely from a Union point of view, not because of any innate bias on Greene's part, but due to the very pragmatic reason that there are few Confederate primary sources dealing with this stage of the fighting. He crafts an rapidly moving, but comprehensive story of the military struggle, illuminating it with vivid details of incidents and personalities. I count it as a first-rate addition to any library of Civil War titles.The above is a review of the original edition of this book, published in 2000. A revised edition has now been published (2008) and I would repeat exactly the same things. The new edition has some minor corrections and expansions, but for the most part these are aimed at updating the text to reflect the current status of development and battlefield preservation in the Petersburg area and to ensure that references to Civil War era roads correlate to 2007 route designations (\\"The Final Battles of the Petersburg Campaign\\" is an invaluable guide for anyone wishing to trace out the activities of late March and early April on the actual ground). The most evident change from the original edition is the improvement of the maps for clarity and detail.The perfect complement to this volume is a visit to Pamplin Historical Park southwest of Petersburg which preserves the earthworks successfully overcome by the Union attackers as described in \\"The Final Battles\\". (And even better is to have the good fortune of visiting around the anniversary of the battle and being able to participate in a pre-dawn battlefield walk to actually see the ground in question at the appropriate season of the year and time of day; such was my own good fortune.)For several years, Wilson Greene's book has been among my very favorite Civil War history volume, and this new edition even makes it better. This book is an absolute necessity for anyone wishing to understand the closing weeks of the Civil War in the East, the end of Lee's army, and the final triumph of the Union Army of the Potomac."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"The style of writing reminds me of a detailed battlefield tour with the Park Historian and other senior personal. The details, perceptive insights and clear overview of the fighting are what you find in this type of tour. The sixteen years the author worked for the National Park Service and being President of Pamplin Historical Park may have contributed to this feeling. Personally, I like this style of battle history. It is detailed, covers how the terrain affects both the attack and defense, lays out the problems and results. For me, it conveys the reality of Civil War combat in an understandable informative manner. I have never found this style of writing a boring read.The Petersburg Campaign lasted for months. Expect for the Crater and Five Forks, most of it is covered in a paragraph or two. The standard is an explanation of the North extending their line to the West until the South broke. The siege of Petersburg did not end at or because of Five Forks nor was extending the North's lines west a simple matter of marches. The moves and counter-moves from February to April 2, 1865 is the story this book tells. The author prepares a solid foundation of about one hundred pages that place the armies, identify the major players and define the conditions of the armies. The image of starving almost naked southern soldiers is not completely a myth but it is embellished. The author shows how poorly the men were fed and clothed and how well they managed to work within the system to make up this deficiency.Hatcher's Run, Fort Sedman, Jones's Farm, McIlwaine's Hill and Lewis' Farm are not battles that most of us know about. They were important steps in breaking the siege in 1865. Each of these battles is covered with one or more maps and place within in the campaign. The critical days from March 31 to April 2, 1865 have 175 pages and 18 excellent maps. This keeps the reader fully in the picture with the ability to understand the importance of each action. In addition, we understand the magnitude of the disaster that Robert E. Lee and his generals face. While the area is small, the numbers are not. Thousands of men and hundreds of guns fight in areas of two miles.The VI Corps Break Through is excellent writing. This is the critical piece of the battle usually lost as authors cover Five Forks. Except for A. P. Hill's death, the perfunctory treatment of this critical action robs readers of a complex tactical battle fought with great courage on both sides.The author takes the time to detail how the defeats at Dinwiddie Court House, Five Forks, the Break Through, Fort Gregg and Fort Whitworth build into the total defeat that surrenders Petersburg and Richmond. The book abounds with small personal details and accounts from major and minor participants. This is much more than the 12th Whitsitt lines up to the left of the 75th you know. The richness of the details, coupled with clear writing produce a compelling complete story.Documentation is important in detailed histories. The book has over 200 pages of appendices, Order of Battle, notes, Bibliography and index. This is an impressive history that is a must read for anyone trying to understand the end of The Army of Northern Virginia."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"I was very impressed with the depth and scholarly treatise of this work, and I only wish the author would endeavor to write another two volumes on Petersburg during 1864 to completely cover the campaign. Frankly, there isn't much for me to add to the other 5-star reviews who cover the ground rather well.To the reviewers who gave this book less than five stars, I would suggest that history sometimes does not always lend itself to writing that is exciting, compelling and gripping as in mystery novels. Especially when a campaign was so grueling as this one. It's hard to make desertion rates and leadership blunders thrilling, and readers should not expect scholarly, historical works to always be captivating. Yes, the writing could have been better, but I will always rate scholarship and accuracy more highly in history than tight and interesting prose. If the reader wants a story rather than accuracy, read Shelby Foote's three volume set, \\"The Civil War.\\" Or watch Ken Burns's Northern propaganda piece for TV, \\"The Civil War\\" that was woefully deficient in scholarship and could almost be classified as a polemic. They are entertaining, but hardly rise to a level that attracts an historian's interest.That being said, even this volume contains elements of analysis that are very attractive to the historian. The Federal command situation was far from satisfactory, as Meade repeatedly demonstrated an inability to command effectively, particularly with Grant looking over his shoulder. One wonders how the campaign would have gone if Grant had swapped Meade to Lee in return for Longstreet or Gordon. And at the corps and divisional levels, the Federals were generally staffed with less aggressive and decisive leaders than Lee's generals. Yet when it came to the end game, Sheridan, Wright and others rose to the occasion. Picket and Rosser enjoyed a shad bake instead of attending to business at Five Forks, and as a result, the dominos began to topple. The drama is there, if only a little slowed down due to the details of interest to the true historian.In short, I recommend this work without qualification. And yes, the maps are the best of any work on the Petersburg campaign."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"I was surprized by the depth and freshness of coverage of this fast flowing account as the last days of Lee's power unfold. A good well balanced narrative.Greene is right up there with top civil war historians in my estimation. A hightlight for me was the touring infomation he provides on the battlefild sites. Last summeer I spent two days trying to cover as much of the Petersburg Battle and Appomatix retreat as my time allowed. This book would have made my trip much more effective.

Wilson Greene, a longtime National Parks historian in Virginia and currently the president and CEO of the Pamplin Historical Park and the National Museum of the Civil War Soldier in Petersburg, Virginia, it is perhaps the definitive account of the last days of the siege of Petersburg.The author briefly covers how the armies came to be there, gives short biographies of the generals commanding the brigades, regiments, divisions, and corps, discusses each side's strategy, and examines the armies themselves, setting the stage for the intense fighting at the end of March. He then covers the positional moves and subsequent fighting on a day by day basisWhile most people are familiar with the Battle of Five Forks on 1 April, it was probably the all-out assault ordered by General Grant against the General Lee's thinly held rebel entrenchments on 2 April that was the decisive event of the campaign, particularly the attack by the Federal 6th Corps that broke through the Confederate lines and was only stopped from moving directly on to Petersburg by the thinnest of margins. Mr Greene provides information and anecdotes from both sides of the fighting, and clearly shows each step of the attack and defense and the desperate attempts by both sides to win the day.In hindsight, by April 1865, the Confederate cause was clearly doomed. Grant had pinned Lee down behind entrenchments, and Lee was unable to do much other than to react to Grant's moves. Sherman was rampaging through the heartland of the confederacy and preparing to move north to add his strength to Grant's armies and surround Lee. Most importantly, Abraham Lincoln had been re-elected the previous November, and he was determined to see the war through to Union victory. But, to the men attacking and defending at Petersburg, the issue was far from settled. The author puts all of this into its proper context, and does an outstanding job in describing why the battles were fought (for Grant, to cut off Lee's supply lines and try and destroy Lee outright if he could, or if not, to least force him out into the open to be destroyed, while Lee wanted to keep Petersburg and Richmond defended and supplied, while retaining operational freedom for his armies), as well as the battles themselves.The writing can occasionally be a bit on the dry side, but this is a scholarly analysis of the battles and tactical description of the fighting as much as something to be read for entertainment, so it's not a problem for me. There are plentiful maps and some photos from the time, which were useful in following along with the fighting.In my opinion, these battles have not received sufficient attention from the public or even historians, who often seem to skip from Cold Harbor to the Battle of the Crater to Appomattox. But if Lee had managed to hold on at Five Forks and defeated the assaults against his entrenchments, the end of the war would have looked very different. The Union still would have won eventually, mind you, but this Union victory undoubtedly shortened the war, and should be receive more attention than it does.I highly recommend this book to those with an interest in the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion","review":"Excellent reading, diligent with references to facts but kind of a synopsis of the action.

My colleagues and I consider a child oppositional and defiant when the child demonstrates a pattern of three types of behavior:\\"1. The child fails to start doing what you ask within one minute after you make the request (or one minute following the point at which you say the child has to do what you ask, such as after the cartoon he is watching is over).\\"Good heavens.

Don't ask how many times my husband has to ask me to do my taxes, in an average year. Well, on we go...\\"2. The child fails to finish what you've asked her to do. Some children may get up and start making their beds as requested right away, but then they run off to do something more appealing in the middle of the chore.\\"Well, THAT'S certainly not normal. I mean, if it were, we'd have a whole nation of people checking their Facebook pages or thinking about their vacations or talking about last night's episode of Lost, or even SHOPPING ON AMAZON, when they SHOULD be WORKING!!\\"3. The child violates rules of conduct already taught. Does your son know that swearing is unacceptable in your house, but he does it anyway? Does your daughter understand the rule, 'no snacks without permission,' but constantly take food from the refrigerator without asking?\\"Oh, for pity's sake.

I was beginning to believe she had no conscience at all. We had a three week wait before we could get in to see the child psychologist. This book helped us understand what was going on, that her behavior wasn't our \\"fault\\" but that we were a factor, and that we could actually influence her behavior - which at the time seemed impossible. The process Barkley recommends seemed slow at the time, but looking back, it worked amazingly quickly! We didn't get through all 8 steps; just steps 1-3 made such a difference that we didn't need to. The psychologist we saw, while he hadn't read this book, said it seemed to be very much in line with current clinical practice, and encouraged us to use it. A year and a half later, we do have to go back and make sure we give our child her \\"special time\\" (one of the steps) or she slips back into some of her bad habits, but we are actually enjoying being parents now. This is not just a \\"self-help\\" type book, though it does give self-tests to help you evaluate your situation. It has a lot of substance, and discusses clinical differences between ADHD, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, and Conduct Disorder in a clear, professional way."},{"Title":"Your Defiant Child: Eight Steps To Better Behavior","review":"The author, eminent in his field and writing from many years of clinical experience and research, has produced a state-of-the-art book on dealing with defiant children. The book is particularly useful in stressing the fundamental importance of taking a positive approach to the child's misbehaviors--focusing on praise and coming up with effective incentives to promote better behavior, rather than continuing with criticism, punishment and the kinds of misguided parental discipline that (with these types of children, at least) serve to worsen both the problem and the child's already impaired self-esteem.The book elaborates on a program that requires a great deal of discipline on the part of the parents to carry out. But it really is &quot;the ticket&quot; for reprograming the child to change behaviors that are both problematic and potentially very serious to his/her healthy development.It's simple enough. All kids adopt and change behavior based on basic principles of reinforcement. This book clarifies just how to reward the behaviors that are wanted and successfully discourage or even eradicate behaviors that are so troublesome. This book should be a &quot;godsend&quot; to parents who have felt totally inadequate to deal with the challenges of such a temperamentally difficult youngster."},{"Title":"Your Defiant Child: Eight Steps To Better Behavior","review":"I read the book in 2001.

But what is love concretely? It is an attention. It is the time that we spend with the kid. But how to spend the time effectively? It is not by controlling him/her. It is by giving him/her the freedom to enjoy the time spent together.I have not followed exactly the methods provided in the book, but the concept has been very useful for me to deal with my child."},{"Title":"Your Defiant Child: Eight Steps To Better Behavior","review":"I have recommended this book umpteen times.

I really appreciate that he first teaches the parents/care providers, to catch the child being good and working on increasing the frequency of those observations. He then has one focus on how to target behaviors that need modification and goes through how to set up a clear system of expectations and consequences. The use of a token system allows a visual for the child to monitor his/her progress. All of us do better if we have something to work for, even a paycheck, so providing a list of incentives/rewards for children struggling to behave is no different.Parents, teachers, and othe childccare providers will all benefit from learning these techniques in the order that he has presented them."},{"Title":"Your Defiant Child: Eight Steps To Better Behavior","review":"I'VE READ MANY BOOKS ON CHILDREN AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM.

Admirably, the textbook hammers home the concept of cultural identity through its coverage of many different periods and peoples. This is not the only theme it highlights, but also attempts to give significant space to other sorts of \\"significance\\" of historical events--giving students some interesting perspective beyond the facts and figures.Unfortunately, it offers poor explanation of the details, revealing an ignorance of current scholarship (one need not talk like a scholar for a textbook, but should reflect the best scholarship). We used this textbook in a course on Western Civilization, for which I was a Teaching Assistant. My own specialty is in Christian origins. Thus I noticed inaccuracies in that area. For instance, Jesus is described as the \\"founder of Christianity.\\" Rather than discuss the pastoral and occasional nature of Paul's letters, the textbook states that his letters \\"articulate key doctrines of the Christian faith--doctrines that helped divide Christianity from Judaism.\\" The description is generally unhelpful and the term \\"doctrine\\" anachronistic (implying a later \\"system\\" of doctrines). Students get an image of Jesus founding a new religion from scratch and Paul making certain that the two (supposedly distinct) religions are clearly divided. These things may have happened much later, but is inaccurate regarding the first century situation.My fellow Teaching Assistants noted similar inaccuracies and missing data in their own fields, such as Ancient Greece and Rome. We noticed that much data is missing in favor of more explanation of \\"significance.\\" It is my opinion that a textbook like this should provide a firmer foundation of data.Furthermore, the book fails in terms of its basic \\"tools\\" for students. The index is spotty, missing out on important terms (the Egyptian concept of Ma'at, for instance), and sometimes even incorrect pagination. The glossary of terms is quite weak in its selection of terms. For example, out of the sixty or so terms required of students in one course on Western Civilization for their exam (*central* names and events), less than ten appear in the Glossary. The boxes offering lists of dates often miss important events in the timeline. Such weaknesses make exam study for students very difficult.I have not used many other textbooks on Western Civilization, but Civilization in the West by Kishlansky/Geary/O'Brien (same publisher) is a much better option (even if its maps are not quite as attractive as Levack)."},{"Title":"The West: Encounters & Transformations, Volume A (Chapters 1-11) (MyHistoryLab Series) (Chapters 1-11 v)","review":"This textbook is not only written in a conversational tone which holds the reader's attention, but it brings in art, personalities of historical figures, and other tidbits to enhance a student's learning experience.

History should be exciting as evidenced by this book!"},{"Title":"The West: Encounters & Transformations, Volume A (Chapters 1-11) (MyHistoryLab Series) (Chapters 1-11 v)","review":"This book was used for a History class I took. I was looking forward to the class, however, I must admit that history is not my strongest suit. It starts by explaining how to learn history, and that one should really strive for the method that asks the following questions: Who, what, where, when, why and how. I would assume this to be a fairly obvious point, however, the authors made a point to not only explain that this process is needed, but also explained each and every single one...in detail.I think I would have probably been able to have learned better from a more linear book. What I mean is to start at the start and work your way through history, and by utilizing the 'who, what,..., how' method. However, this isn't the way this book was written for the most part. I found that it would explain a topic that would happen later in the time frame of that particular chapter, and then later (almost, it would seem, as if time was catching up with how the authors wanted to write) it would be brought up again, yet now more detail is given. I understand that to make a point you might sometimes have to refer back to something else or even refer to a later topic, however, most of the book was written this way.I am just writing this review as an honest person that isn't strong with learning history. I think I would have been better off with a more linear book rather than one that jumps from one topic to another with GREAT frequency, and sometimes to the point of near confusion to me.I hope this review helps, and I kind of wished I would have focused more on others' reviews I read rather than being all giddy about taking the course and learning about our past. If I would have, I definitely would not have taken the course that utilized this book.Good Luck to all as you decide and may you have a wonderful and blessed day!!!"},{"Title":"The West: Encounters & Transformations, Volume A (Chapters 1-11) (MyHistoryLab Series) (Chapters 1-11 v)","review":"Bought this for my Humanities I class.

In his own native Italy he is given lip service,the worse form of praise. Why this is, reveals more about the limits of criticism than of literature itself.No one questions the talent of Bacchelli, for he was a very gifted writer; it's just that his work does not fit in the usual framework of Italian fiction. He was not a neorealist, not a Marxist, nor did he frequent the usual literary circles in Rome or Milan. He was, all in all, a historical novelist. His occasional dips into contemporary scenes did not quite come off: his erotic novel, A Conjugal Passion, seems a chip off Moravia's novel Conjugal Love. Both had a certain cache in erotic fiction, but no more.The essential problem, though, is that Bacchelli became known as a one-novel author. That is, One Famous Novel Author. Though he wrote a dozen other novels, most readers don't remember them. The Famous Novel, of course, is The Mill on the Po. Like Gone With the Wind, this long historical novel is a good read, well written, and encompasses a historical period--in its case, from the Napoleonic wars to the Great War of 1914-1918.First published in 1939-40 in three volumes, the novel was almost an instant bestseller (and later got on the Book of the Month Club list in its abbreviated English translation). The story focuses on the adventures of the Scacerni family, whose son Lazzaro becomes involved in the industry of the mills on the Po River, boats that used water current to grind grain. The broad sweep of the novel encompasses political and social events, and its characters are credible and sympathetic.American readers may find the mise-en-scene a bit strange, but Bacchelli's emphasis on the human factor welcomes readers to his world. None of the actors in the novel seem alien or bizarre.Bacchelli's other historical novels dealt with the Roman world and that of St Francis of Assisi. None became as well known as his Mill on the Po book. In fact, there is a sad ending to Bacchelli's career. In his old age he became destitute, and his friends had to call on the city of Milan to provide support for him. Under public pressure the city fathers came to his aid. Indeed, a movement rose to pass a national law that would call on the state to support poverty-stricken artists. Called \\"the Bacchelli Law,\\" it was passed and is now on the books by that name.It is, in its own way, a happy ending to the career of the so-called One Famous Novel Author."},{"Title":"Let's Go to a Show: How to Win Ribbons & Have Fun Too","review":"Hi,I love this book.

Shakespeare was trying to entertain, not necessarily make extreme sociological statements regarding the status of women in England and/or Italy! (Do we condemn The Three Stooges for their promotion of violence, or do we recognize that they were merely trying to make us laugh with their shenanigans?) Other than this, the commentary is very helpful in helping us understand the flow of the plot and the ideas Shakespeare is communicating....the 1500s were a long time ago, and a scholar giving us some insight is a big benefit in translating the language.Speaking of \\"translating\\": for someone reading the play for the first time, or for the first time in many years (as we did recently), a \\"modern\\" translation would be helpful--but not as a replacement of the original text.

Nouwen's messages of love, self-sacrifice and servant-leadership come alive in these selections. Definitely worth it.I do have to wonder, though, how many compilations of Nouwen's work can be put out before the effect is diluted. Those who are in charge of his estate may need to think about easing back on re-releasing his work, and let what he has stand on its own. Otherwise, it can get rather repetitious, as some of what was in this book I have read in other books already."},{"Title":"Jesus: A Gospel","review":"For me this book shined a powerful light on how the gospel affects those who truly receive it."},{"Title":"Sent for You Yesterday","review":"From www.thetasteland.blogspot.comSent for you yesterday, and here you come today.It only makes sense that one of the main themes of John Edgar Wideman's Pen/Faulkner Award winning novel, Sent For You Yesterday, should find expression in a song. Any novel written with the musical lyricism and jive, stream of consciousness language Wideman employs is attempting to bridge the gap between music and literature. Wideman takes the blues out of the jazz clubs and places it squarely on the page for the readers' benefit. Sent For You Yesterday is a marvel to read, not only for its eloquent exposition of urban African American culture, but also simply for the beauty of Wideman's words.If James Joyce had been born in inner city Pittsburgh instead of Dublin, his writing would most likely have sounded much like Wideman's. Wideman shifts flawlessly from one characters' thoughts to the next, detailing the exclusion felt by the albino Brother in an all black community, to the lunacy of Samantha, a mother of over 10 children who loses her mind when one of her children burns to death. World War II clouds over this novel in the same way World War I is the ever-present unmentioned in Woolf's To The Lighthouse. Wideman draws on the modernists, but in a completely original manner. The lives he shows us are real and hard, their importance obviously apparent but unbearably tragic. Through it all, Wideman's characters persevere, suffering through life, even as they acknowledge it will only get worse. In their brave embrace of life, there is a profound sublimity. One consolation is music - it is also their heritage for people otherwise without possessions.Any discussion of the characters in Sent For You Yesterday must begin by first acknowledging that the Pittsburgh area of Homewood is the main character. Though he is wanted by the police for sleeping with a white woman, Albert Wilkes' has to return to Homewood. The place draws him back. He has traveled for seven years but only in Homewood does he feel at home. His re-arrival in Homewood frames the novel's first section, while the rest of the book focuses on Lucy Tate, the narrator's Uncle Carl, and Lucy's surrogate brother called only Brother, and their relative inability to leave Homewood at all. The gravity of the town seems to possess the work's human characters. Homewood exerts a force originating out of its inescapable history; even as its houses crumble, its people drink and drug themselves to death, and poverty comes to dominate like a despot, Lucy, Carl, and Brother stay fixed, attached to each other, but more so to the place. The only of the self-termed \\"Three Musketeers\\" who figures out a way to leave Homewood is Brother and he does so through suicide, symbolically mauled by the town's lone link to the outside world, a freight train.Wideman presents his characters not as emblems pleading for our sympathy, but in a matter of fact manner that seems to say: take them as they are or don't take them at all, either way, your opinion isn't going to mean much to them. Even as he chronicles the socioeconomic decline from one generation to the next, his characters never turn to external factors to lay blame for their misfortunes. As Carl eloquently recalls about his temporary drug addiction, he enjoyed crack and shot up because of the pleasure. It was his choice, no one else's. There was no coercion, just as it was his decision to stop. While the oppressive presence of white people hangs over all, penetrating the character's psyches as if by osmosis, Wideman doesn't succumb to angry finger pointing. Wideman suggests that the horrendous level of disrespect with which white people treat African Americans has bored into the black mind to such a degree, that the residents of Homewood have internalized and eventually accepted the idea that they are somehow lesser than. It has become so second-hand, the idea isn't even perceptible anymore. It's just a part of life, like Carl's pot belly or the shared affinity for Iron City beer. And it is the subtlety of this presentation of the ramifications of segregation and racism that makes it so effective. How can characters ask for empathy when they can't even realize they would ever deserve it? The bluesy expression \\"been down so long don't even know what's up,\\" floats between the lines of Sent For You Yesterday like the lingering echo of a melancholy piano chord.Wideman justly won the Pen/Faulkner Award for Sent For You Yesterday. His innovative utilization of \\"authentically black\\" language provides the dialect and characters with a respect they never afforded themselves. Wideman takes the tuneful acoustics of street slang and transforms the speech into high art. Not since Faulkner has a specific time and place been depicted so accurately and with such heartfelt compassion. Wideman has saved a culture and past from oblivion by rendering it as adeptly as he manages in this novel. In a present when Snoop Dogg and 50 Cent are the most ubiquitous signs of black culture, Wideman reminds all Americans that African Americans have existed and will continue to do so as an incredibly cohesive community and one that we should honor with more than Senate apologies. Wideman illustrates an unshakeable integrity pulsating in a dereliction few of us have or will ever be forced to witness. Whether Homewood's characters comprehend it or not, they are resilient, and far from pity, should receive only our admiration for not bowing to life's burdens. As for Wideman, he should continue to receive praise, as an achievement such as Sent For You Yesterday, like the world it defines, must never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Sent for You Yesterday","review":"Wideman's constant changing point of view and temporal setting and reminds this reader very much of James Joyce Ulysses; this work is a tour of the consciousness of an entire American Black community spanning several generations in the mid 20th century. The vivid poetry of Black American English speaks immediately of characters predicaments, desires, and dreams. If white folks want to begin to understand black folks, they might take a sip of this fine wine."},{"Title":"Sent for You Yesterday","review":"I chose this book at random while looking for literature for my students.I found the book brilliant. The author's use of imagery is captivating and the story teaches you its style as you go along. In the beginning the lack of quotation marks is frustrating but then you fall into the rhythm of the voices and you cannot stop reading. By the last third, I was snarling at people who dared to try to interrupt me while I breathlessly pawed through page after page of lyrical poetry and metaphor disguised as a prose work."},{"Title":"Sent for You Yesterday","review":"What I love the most about Wideman is the way in which he evokes the sense of time and lost. His writing style reminds me of a cross between Jean Toomer and Fyodor Dostoeyevski, also two of my favorite writers. This novel takes place in the town of Homewood, PA. It is a predominately black working class neighborhood. Wideman makes Homewood feel so alive and yet slowly dying at the same time. If you've ever had a sense of lost time, lost experiences, lost something but you don't know what, than this is the book to read. No other writer has been able to evoke those feelings within me more than Wideman. (p.s.- As if Wideman wasn't good enough, be on the look out for his multi-talented daughter Jamila in the future!)Best Wishes,Rodney Mitchell"},{"Title":"Red Earth: A Vietnam Warrior's Journey","review":"There's been a lot written about Vietnam vets and post traumatic stress, but I've never read any author who portrays the pain and anguish as well as Red Eagle. Then he portrays the healing. But to understand it you must enter a different skin. The skin of a people not held to standard conventions; where time has a different meaning and visions and dreams are an important part of life. I have never read an author who managed to accomplish this, but Red Eagle does. Even Alexie, an author I greatly admire, still leaves the reader on the outside looking in. But with Red Eagle you are truly taken inside.I am an avid reader who usually consumes one book after another. However, when I finished this book I couldn't start another one for a couple of days. It has that kind of effect on you."},{"Title":"Red Earth: A Vietnam Warrior's Journey","review":"Red Earth provides healing for those people who have experienced war firsthand, and for those people who have felt the impact of war indirectly through their friends and loved ones. Stories are intended to heal and provide guidance--a purpose that has been mostly forgotten by modern society. Indigenous people realize the importance of the story, and this book emphasizes this importance. Philip Red Eagle's book is a welcome and needed addition to the broad spectrum of Vietnam War literature."},{"Title":"Red Earth: A Vietnam Warrior's Journey","review":"I have taught this book alongside classic works of Native American (such as Leslie Silko's &quot;Ceremony&quot;), alongside exceptional works of Native philosophy (e.g. Vine Deloria's &quot;Red Earth / White Lies&quot;) and alongside some of the most popular contemporary Native writing (Sherman Alexie, among others). Red Eagle's &quot;Red Earth&quot; holds its own in all these contexts, and has been the favorite of many students in my classes.&quot;Red Earth&quot; is a magical pair of stories dealing with the trauma not only of Vietnam, but American colonialism."},{"Title":"Red Earth: A Vietnam Warrior's Journey","review":"Philip Red Eagle is an amazing writer! There have been many exceptional books written about PTSD and the reality of the warzone. What makes this book different is the mind, body and spirit approach that Philip Red Eagle expresses so well. He not only takes you there with him,but shows you a way home through the pain, distrust and loss and to the strength of your heart and spirit. For anyone who wants to help a vet who is struggling to regain his or her spirit, this is the book you've been looking for! This is a way home."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I bought this book hoping that I could get started with yoga on my own. As a beginner's introduction to yoga, it is rather unsuccessful in that it uses terminology without defining it first and has photographic illustrations that do not show the key points of the yoga positions as clearly as the drawings in &quot;Yoga for Dummies.&quot;The author clearly is knowledgeable and passionate about his subject, but I don't think that these attributes serve him particularly well in an introductory text of this type."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I think the book, Yoga for Men, is a great value in terms of content, modest cost, and considering it also includes an audio CD. Not bad!!! The focus is on men, but many of the concepts are applicable to women as well. This book is not only beneficial to men but to all the women who love them. Recommended as gifts from women who have husbands, partners, fathers, brothers, sons and male friends."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I was never a yoga kind of guy, but after reading this book I actually had the courage to go to a class. I'm still going and loving it. Yoga For Men does a great job of making yoga seem less of scary 60's hippie thing and more just a great way to stay in shape, mentally as well as physically. I know many people have hang ups about yoga, especially men, so this book was sorely needed. It's a great value too, fully illustrated and with a companion CD included."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I think this author had good intentions--trying to title yoga postures with names that suggest the business world, and I guess in his opinion, that's where the men are who need to learn basic yoga. But, there are SO many tons of other books out there that do such a better job of introducing yoga to newbies. Maybe the problem seems to be that men are shy of yoga so they need an apparently macho introduction, but guys, go with the tried and true titles out there, or DVDs from Rodney Yee, Rod Striker, etc. The photos are poor, the model (who may be the author) is NOT a good example (OMG his handstand is completely weird) there are misspellings and misinformation. Don't worry about whether you're doing macho yoga--any old yoga is great, whether the teacher is female or male--just do some research and spend your money on a really good title--even Light on Yoga by Iyengar."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would give me more yoga poses to work on. I have to say that the poses in the book are basic at most and that I learned more yoga in high school then in this book. I like yoga because it makes me more relaxed. I was hoping the book would help with more issues that men have with yoga like flexibility and relaxation in the upper shoulders, back, and the groin area. These areas are typical for men to carry a lot of tension and stress. I did give it a three star because of the meditation sections. But this book didn't differ from a regular yoga book so I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Yoga For Men Workout For Body Mind Spirit","review":"I am always looking to do something different but this is not for me. I give this a 4 star becuase there is good stuff here. I don't have the patience for all this when I want to lean up a little. The everyday guy who does not know about fitness will get alot out of this if you take the time. It amuses me how people will spend money on sports stuff and never use it. If you buy this book even if you are 400lbs and apply it. It will work but you can't eat McDonalds everyday at lunch anymore.

Weather you are going from the novel to the compainon or visa versa. I am speaking from the point of view of someone very familiar with LOTR having read it numerous times over the last 30 years.And somewhat familiar with Silmarillion.I assume someone seeking this sort of information and\\\\or back story would have at least a minamal knowledge of the novel. Evan assuming no knowledge I believe you would quickly find your way around.I found the information to be accurate,as far as my knowledge could be trusted to check such things.One thing I've truely enjoyed is just reading random passages. I find myself reading page after page in this manner. I was just begining Unfinished Tales when I found this book and am anxious to begin reading LOTR again and make use of Reader's Companion.I would also add that the book itself is very nice. It is well made.The pages are made of nice paper with a great feel.Overall I am quite pleased and can find nothing negative to say. Again this is my first review and I hope someone finds it as useful as some of the reviews I have found helpful in the past."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"This is one of those books that you feel you must read because there will be little gems hidden throughout the multitude of pages. The authors were really hung up on the calendar and moons, which I don't care about one way or the other.

It just took lots of patience to find them."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"This made an ideal gift for my brother who has been a Tolkien fan for over half a century!

I had a book of annotations to my side and was struggling to understand chapter 3 of Stephen Dedalus's adventures on the Sandymount Strand in EireThis book is rather like that book, but I think its more of a joy to read. Although this book is not for a person who has never read the Story (it will probably give away the ending for a start!) I think its pretty worthwhile for a person whos read the \\"trilogy\\" (of SIX Books! in three Volumes!) more than onceIf you've read Lord I think you'll really enjoy this. Its engrossing, and (to be honest) too much in depth (I don't really care to know what words mean in Elvish!)So this book works well but you don't have to read EVERY bit. Tolkien was in love with words, names of places and people had to mean something. His pose was as a translator of the work into Westron, the Common Tongue, so you get (for example) Samwises real name in the original text as BanizirSo I can think the attention to detail can get overwhelming (what Samwises name is in Sindarin, etc).I think its a great book, but it can get overwhelming. Tolkien created a history for the work, and as great a book as this is (its the best book I've read on Tolkien, up there with Lord of the Rings actually) it might be best if you just take it in small doses. Listen to the Lord of the Rings on audio cassette and read along with this bookAgain, it helps if you're intimate with the Lord of the Rings. Its not unusual for people to read Lord every year. If you have read it a few times, I think you will really enjoy this book, as its an intelligent, in depth study of the workI mean, its 900 pages of annotations, and it has a nice \\"dip in\\" quality, and it is an absorbing readJust make sure you've read the Lord of the Rings a few times first though, otherwise you might end up throwing the Companion aside in frustration, just because of the attention to detailSee, Tolkien worked out phases of the moon, dates, and so forth; after Books 1 & 2 (which comprise The Fellowship of the Ring) it becomes convoluted, with Book 3 starting off with Aragorn speeding up the hill of Amon Hen (on February 26) and ending with Pippin riding with Gandalf to Minas Tirith the night of March 5/6 - with different characters at different times throughout that particular Book. By contrast Book 4 (with Frodo and Sam's Mission to Mordor) starts in median res (in the middle of things) at February 28 and ends with the capture of Frodo by old Sauron on late March 13th, a full week later than the end of Book 3 (so the time periods to each book are not always concurrent - that is, starting at the same time and ending at the same)So to keep track of moon phases, dates, meanings of words in one huge tome is quite something. Clearly the Lord of the Rings is a matter that got out of hand rather quickly (original drafts of early chapters of Book 1 had the Black Rider originally being Gandalf, comically surprising the hobbits in the Shire - in the comic vein of the earlier book The Hobbit, to which Lord was a sequel; this incident became much darker with Gandalf turning to a Black Rider STALKING the hobbits before they even left the Shire!)This book keeps track of events, words (lot of archaic words need to be defined - and not everyone knows that a league is 3 miles!)As brilliant a book this is (I've read it once thus far, all the way through) I do have to wonder who its for... As I've said, you can't just pick up this book if you're not really familiar with the Story as you'll get rather cross and fling it aside because you'll be confused about references to Westernesse (aka Numenor) and so forthBut I think it would help if you had a familiarity with The Silmarillion, even if just reading about it in the excellent Tolkien for Dummies bookI think reading the Silmarillion might be too much for some people (I found it tedious and not as engrossing as the Lord of the Rings). I do think it would help that you read the Lord of the Rings a least a few times before picking up this work, because it really helps if you know the Lord well. Otherwise this work might be too frustrating a read, and you won't know the world"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":".\\"...has left the path of wisdom.\\" -- GandalfIf you'd like to ruin Tolkien's beautiful and exciting story for yourself, I can't think of a better way than this excessive scholarship.Lest \\"ruin\\" seem an extreme term, it means, in this context: remove the LotR from the realm of great story-telling, and enter it needlessly into the superfluous arena of pedantic academia.I admit that I only got through a few pages before disposing of it, and that I fail utterly to understand what's meant to be gained from turning a tale that's merely meant to be enjoyed (for reference to this, I highly recommend The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien) into \\"study.\\"The only reason I'm writing a review in the first place -- I can't be bothered to add one for every volume of the baffling collection of rough drafts called the History of Middle-Earth -- is to counter, for curious minds, the other reviews that call this book \\"indispensable.\\" It is not. By all means, dispense with it, and retain your sense of wonder for the story itself.Those who would argue in favor of literary critics (and the like) accepting the LotR as worthy of \\"merit\\" because of publications like this should ask themselves: \\"Who cares? Do I enjoy Tolkien's stories or not? What does the approval of my tastes by others matter?\\" Seems a rather superficial aim to me.I offer four stars nonetheless, because anything less strikes me as needlessly rude, in light of the sheer effort. The labor must have been massive.But Tolkien would have been horrified."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"I will not belabored this point, I have read all the previous reviews and I can say with total certainty that they are pretty much on the mark. This book will definitely give you a greater understanding of Lord of the Rings and the author's intentions. I would have to say that its just about mandatory supplemental reading material in truly understanding Tolkien's work. It will amazed any reader how much, how far and from within, Tolkien gathered his materials to write his masterpiece. It will also surprised any reader how Lord of the Rings had been altered bit here and bit there over the various publications. So please read many of the reviews written before me, some of them are quite insightful and informative. Then if you are truly interested in Lord of the Rings as a literature, buy this book.(This book probably could be read side by side while reading Lord of the Rings but reading the book as a whole could be bit difficult. After all, there are hundreds upon hundreds of pages, nit-picking and explaining Tolkien's words, phases and all that. Nice place might be your bathroom if you take my meaning.)"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"It is amazing that it has taken 50 years for a book like this to come to Tolkien's readers, but at last and with great scholarly authority, comes annotations to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"Make no mistake, this is a scholarly book and its pretty dense and at times it will push the average LOTR reader. It is full of (appropriately) word origins and possible source info, word meanings and linguistic notes. Still, because of Tolkien's own linguistics background and motivations, this is a must to have at the core of the book and there is plenty of other types of info as well to add roundness and variety to the content.Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond obviously read and write about LOTR in a way that the casual reader cannot and their considerible knowledge and resources (such as Christopher Tolkien himself) come into play. The book can be used as a side-by-side volume or can be read on its own chronologically.

Hammond and Christina Scull are among the most authoritative of scholars researching the literary creations of J.R.R. Tolkien. In The Lord Of The Rings: A Reader's Companion, they have surpassed even their previous masterpiece: J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator. (As a matter of full disclosure I should mention that I met Christina Scull some years ago in London, and I have maintained a friendship with her and her husband Wayne G.Hammond ever since. Three articles I wrote for the Mensa Tolkien Special Interest Group's newsletter \\"Beyond Bree\\" have been referenced in A Reader's Companion, and I am also among those Wayne and Christina thank in their Preface. Even without these connections I would still be highly impressed with this work!)This Reader's Companion consists of annotations to The Lord of the Rings. The length of Tolkien's masterwork, which is often mistakenly called a trilogy, made the normal method of including annotations alongside the text impossible, and so this separate volume has been produced. The annotations illuminate some interesting and sometimes obscure sections of the book and assist readers in interpreting Tolkien's rich but occasionally (to modern and American eyes) puzzling vocabulary. Tolkien readers and scholars will find it almost as fascinating as the book itself and many will probably read it straight through not once, but many times.In addition to the annotations, A Reader's Companion also contains a wealth of material, including Wayne and Christina's own history of the writing of The Lord of the Rings. This is in itself a fascinating description of the many forms the story took over the years from 1937 to the early 1950s, and the many vicissitudes Tolkien endured as he \\"niggled\\" away at the writing and rewriting each chapter required. Besides this history the authors have included several fascinating discussions of chronologies, maps, and other matters like dust jackets which might with a lesser author be deemed unworthy of notice, but which in Tolkien's case illuminate the painstaking care he took with every detail. Also included is a portion of a previously unpublished letter in which Tolkien describes The Lord of the Rings as a part of his larger literary/mythological work, and the Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings which Tolkien created to assist translators, and which has been published (incompletely) only once before.As befits such a fine work of scholarship, A Reader's Companion is beautifully bound with a dust jacket which makes use of Tolkien's own designs. Although the book with its index runs nearly 900 pages, it is comfortable and pleasant to hold. The typeface, though it can be small at times, is clear. The page references are easy to interpret and can be applied to whichever of the many editions of The Lord of the Rings the reader may possess.It seems likely that at least some future editions of The Lord of the Rings will include A Reader's Companion. First time readers will probably prefer not to read the annotations until they have become more familiar with the text. Once they have been swept up in the story they will find A Reader's Companion enhances their experience. Those of us fortunate enough to have read The Lord of the Rings not just once but many times will immediately recognize A Reader's Companion's value and will cherish it as well."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"The content of this book looks like superlative scholarship. Something that might be overlooked, however, but that deserves applause, is the publisher's use of sewn signatures for the book's binding. Very few books are made this way any more, as far as I can see, being instead bound just with glue; but a book made with sewn pages is likely to last longer and look better. The publisher is to be commended for this extra care, and encouraged to continue to use this method in subsequent printings - - especially while holding the price down so remarkably. Even at full price rather than Amazon's discount price, this book is very good value for they money."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"Two of the foremost Tolkien scholars, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull have managed to produce in this volume one of the most essential books in any Tolkien library. A READER'S COMPANION carefully annotates, line by line, chapter by chapter, Tolkien's great masterpiece.When the revised version of THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT came out in 2002 with Douglas A. Anderson's annotations, I was thrilled, as the original from 1988 was out of print. The way they handled THE HOBBIT was a large, oversized hardback, with the main text printed on wide sheets but only taking up the half closet to the binding, with the annotations on the outer edges of the sheets. The book is beautiful to hold, and it was very enlightening during rereadings of THE HOBBIT. It also noted all revisions, and gave original readings, including the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter, which has been out of print for over fifty years. The natural question, of course, was when would LOTR get similar treatment? After all, LOTR had been in print for over fifty years, and such a publication has been long overdue.Although the method described above worked well with THE HOBBIT, it proved unfeasible for LOTR. For one, LOTR is a much, much longer book than its prequel. So Hammond and his wife opted for a separate volume, and what a volume it is.Due to the size of LOTR, the way READER'S COMPANION is broken up to cover each chapter in the book. Each annotation is proceeded by the first few words of whatever paragraph the two scholars are analysing at that point. This makes A READER'S COMPANION very easy to use, and to locate in your copy of LOTR the passage in which they are discussing.As with THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT, there have been a very concentrated effort on the part of the Tolkien Estate to publish the more accurate version of LOTR as possible. Scull and Hammond, along with Christopher Tolkien, spearheaded this enterprise. READER'S COMPANION gives extensive details on how Hammond and Scull, with cooperation from C. Tolkien, set about making the definitive text on LOTR in 2004 and 2005 for the fifthieth anniversary edition. All future subsequent editions will be based on this edition, and is considered the most accurate text now available of Tolkien's work LOTR.The book annotates all major changes made to LOTR's text in its fifty years of publication. It gives extensive details on how Hammond and Scull, with cooperation with Christopher Tolkien, set about making the definitive text on LOTR in 2004 and 2005 for the fifthieth anniversary edition. All future subsequent editions will be based on this edition, and is considered the most accurate text now available of Tolkien's work LOTR. It examines rare and archaic words and gives information on Elvish linguistics. Hammond and Scull deftly analyse different plot elements, elaborate and clarify obscure points in the text, and bring to light both real inconsistencies within LOTR and perceived contradictions. Tolkien very carefully organized and created precise chronologies and time tables, including the cycles of the moon, and every time the text mentions a new day had arrived, or said something of the moon, the book tells you the precise day this event is occurring.The companion gives extensive information on time frames and maps. It covers and annotates the forward to the second edition as well as the prologue. There is information about the original 1955 dust jacks, how the title pages were handled, and a number of other publishing matters.As far as rare and otherwise unpublished original material by Tolkien, A READER'S COMPANION is notable for its inclusion of three pieces.1. It contains the original forward to LOTR, which was published in the first edition in 1955 and was deleted in 1965 by Tolkien himself, who replaced it with a much longer forward. Tolkien said of the original forward that it confused \\"personal matters with the machinery of the Tale\\" and was a \\"serious mistake\\". Tolkien was only too happy to delete it. Still, it makes for interesting reading.2. The second highlight is the previously unpublished summary of LOTR that Tolkien wrote in his letter to Milton Waldman in 1951. This letter was first published in LETTERS OF TOLKIEN, and likewise appears in new editions of THE SILMARILLION. However, the LOTR summary was omitted from these publications, and is published here for the first time.3. Thankfully, A READER'S COMPANION includes Tolkien's essential, and rarely published before now, \\"Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings.\\" Previously published n 1975 in Jared Lobell's A TOLKIEN COMPASS, Tolkien prepared this document for his publishers, Allen & Unwin, to send to any translators who were translating LOTR into another language. As LOTR is largely a linguistic work in both foundation and inspiration, this gives a lot of insight into Tolkien and how he felt his work should (as well as emphatically should not) be translated, and what Tolkien considers fair treatment of the material. Essential stuff.Ultimately, A READER'S COMPANION succeeds in being one of the essential reference works for Tolkien studies and fans. The dust jacket is beautiful, the binding (sewn!) is top notch, and, as any reference work must, you can easily locate any passage or annotation you are looking for. All the annotations are pertinent and enlightening, all textual changes and revisions to the text are accounted for, and with the previously unpublished or rare Tolkien material included, Hammond and Scull have produced the single best resource now available to us on Tolkien's masterpiece. They have proven themselves as two of the foremost Tolkien scholars in the world.For those looking for additional resources to Tolkien's hobbit cycle, the best way to study them is to have THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT revised and republished in 2002 (the definitive version of that work), buy the fully corrected 50th anniversary text of LOTR, which is the most accurate typographical version ever published, and buy this volume.Bottom line: If you are a casual fan or very much into Tolkien, buy this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"As the authors point out in their own introduction, publishing an annotated edition of The Lord of the Rings, complete with the text, was a practical impossibility. Thus was this \\"Reader's Companion\\" brought into being. Perhaps not so intuitive and casual to use (as is, say, Douglas Anderson's \\"Annotated Hobbit\\") with a separate copy of LOTR, but at nearly 1200 pages, and with this Companion running over 900 pages, you can easily see why Hammond and Scull and their publishers chose to go this route. As a single volume such a thing might be used to stun a Warg!As a guide, index, and explicatory text, LOTR: A Reader's Companion excels and exceeds expectations. It is very nearly exhaustive, without being exhausting (as such a book might easily have been). Rigorous and of real use to the serious scholar and academic, but readiy accessible and fun to read for the general Tolkien reader who takes pleasure in going deeper into the story, the backstory, and the life of Tolkien and his greatest tale.LOTR: A Reader's Companion is as well a clear and well organized accesory volume. Much easier to use than most supplemental guides, it is keyed chapter-by-chapter, and page-by-page to the main text (I have 7 editions of LOTR, paper and hardcover, single-volume and sets, and finding the passage referred to in this Reader's Companion is quick and easy in most cases, as is finding appropriate entries in the RC while reading LOTR and coming across an item you want to know more about). I strongly recommend this book to any reader who has or will read LOTR more than once. It is addictive and fun to read all by itself, and deeply informing when read side-by-side with its source.The book itself is a sturdy, handsome, well put together piece of publishing. A nicely utilitarian, simple, but still elegant cloth binding, with bright foil stamped spine, and a jacket with a plasticized lining, which will make it stand many more hours and years of handing and reading than most paper backed jackets. The paper is excellent stock, of moderate weight in a very pale cream tone. The print is crisp, dark, and thoroughly consistent throughout (which is becoming something rare even in quality hardcovers recently), and the type is a pleasing traditional serif face of good size, and easy to read. Not certainly a self-consciously \\"fine\\" or \\"collector's\\" edition, but as definately a book that will last and put up with use, and nonetheless has been designed with care and concern for the craft of book-making.I own it, and I recommend this \\"Companion\\" to all interested readers and their libraries, small and large. With Foster's \\"Complete Guide to Middle-earth\\" and Christopher Tolkien's \\"History of Middle-earth\\", Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull shall have an equal position (to say: even somewhat superior as regards LOTR in particular, where the other two authors' work is more widely focused on the entire legendarium and body of JRRT's work). My only cavil, and I think it slight, is the absence of photos, drawings, publishing ephemera, and other graphicals, which were so prominent and vital in Anderson's \\"Annotated Hobbit\\". But: Buy it! Read it! You'll delight in it! It will enlarge your understanding and pleasure each time you read LOTR, whole or part."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"This extensively researched and painstakingly organized reader's companion to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is itself a masterpiece, as time will show. In over 400 pages, it contains a wealth of information for both new and seasoned readers, going far beyond just the characters, plot, and language used by the author (reflecting not only the English at the time but also the language as imagined by the author befitting of the book's characters).Reading this companion, I realized just how much thought Tolkien put into his work, writing, rewriting, and editing parts over years of dedication. When reading a work of fiction, it's easy to be taken hostage by the plot and rush through the story just to see what happens next. Little things, like words that may not make sense, or titles whose significance is not entirely understood, may not get a second thought. And names, of which Tolkien's story contains so many, from characters to places, may appear as names only, but this book reveals the meanings and reasons behind chosen names. Not to mention all the folklores and other literature that Tolkien referenced in his story and expected his readers to know. Which is why I find this book so helpful -- it deliberately slows me down, making me understand the meaning and symbolism contained in the chapter's title and a place's name as much as it helps me fully appreciate the culture of the book's characters. The Shire and elvish country, for example, just come to life with the researchers' analysis.It's no summer beach reading, but if you're fascinated by the world of Lord of the Rings, you know it's not enough just to know the plot or Heaven forbid, only watch the movies. This will help you get to a new level with Tolkien's masterpiece. Go chapter by chapter and page by page with this companion, and there's also a convenient index to help you with names you may have forgotten. Do you remember Belfalas, Dwarrowdelf, or Caradock of Llancarfan? Want to know more about Celeborn the Elf, Boromir, or the effects of elvish song on humans? Did you spot the proverbs that Tolkiens quoted in his work? Read this companion to the Lord of the Rings and find out."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"This is not a book for the casual reader, or even for those enthusiastic readers of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" who are not interested in that work as a literary creation or in its sources. I suspect that most readers of this volume are persons who have Christopher Tolkien's \\"The Making of Middle Earth\\" series of books. In the present volume, Hammond and Scull discuss and correct hundreds of errors that have crept into \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as printed over the decades; most of these errors are minor (one word inadvertently substituted for another or perhaps capitalization changed), occasionally a sentence was omitted from the manuscript. In addition, obscure word origins are examined for their roots in Middle Earth languages. This is an excellent, even necessary, reference book for the student of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" who wishes to delve deep into its development."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"For the LoTR afficiando, this book is a must read. It goes through the books chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph, explaining many things that to the first time reader can be a bit perplexing. Archaic words are defined. Construction of some of the Elvish languages seen in the books is discussed in easy to understand language. Insights into Tolkien's thinking are explored through letters written by him. It is just rich, rich, rich with information that any Tolkien student would like to know."},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings about once a year, and have for a while. Even so, there is much that I don't know and a lot of background that I wish I knew.I just bought this book, and am reading it while I re-read the LOTR. I'm reading a chapter of LOTR and then read the chapter's notes in this book. THe world of Lord of the Rings is expanding hugely for me because of the vast amounts of background information this book provides.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion","review":"Length:: 0:24 MinsThe Lord of the Rings - A Readers Companion - 2008 revised - paperbackI remember when I was at college, struggling to read Ulysses by James Joyce. I had a book of annotations to my side and was struggling to understand chapter 3 of Stephen Dedalus's adventures on the Sandymount Strand in EireThis book is rather like that book, but I think its more of a joy to read. Although this book is not for a person who has never read the Story (it will probably give away the ending for a start!) I think its pretty worthwhile for a person whos read the \\"trilogy\\" (of SIX Books! in three Volumes!) more than onceIf you've read Lord I think you'll really enjoy this. Its engrossing, and (to be honest) too much in depth (I don't really care to know what words mean in Elvish!)So this book works well but you don't have to read EVERY bit, like the Ulysses Gifford guide. Tolkien was in love with words being a philogist, names of places and people had to mean something. His pose in the work was as a translator of the work into Westron, the Common Tongue, so you get (for example) Samwises real name in the original text as BanizirSo I can think the attention to detail can get overwhelming (what Samwises name is in Sindarin, etc).So I do think its a great book, but it can get overwhelming. Tolkien created a history for the work, and as great a book as this is (its the best book I've read on Tolkien, up there with Lord of the Rings actually) it might be best if you just take it in small doses. Listen to the Lord of the Rings on audio cassette and read along with this book for to start.Again, it helps if you're intimate with the Lord of the Rings. Its not unusual for people to read Lord every year (like me). If you have read it a few times, I think you will really enjoy this book, as its an intelligent, in depth study of the work, page by pageI mean, its 900 pages of annotations, and it has a nice \\"dip in\\" quality, and it is an absorbing readJust make sure you've read the Lord of the Rings a few times first though, otherwise you might end up throwing the Companion aside in frustration, just because of the minute attention to detail.See, Tolkien worked out phases of the moon, dates, and so forth; after Books 1 & 2 (which comprise The Fellowship of the Ring) it becomes convoluted, with Book 3 (Two Towers is comprised of Books 3 & 4 - 4 dealing solely with Frodo and Sam's mission to Mordor) starting off with Aragorn speeding up the hill of Amon Hen (on February 26) and ending with Pippin riding with Gandalf to Minas Tirith the night of March 5/6 - with different characters intercepted at different times throughout that particular Book. By contrast, Book 4 (picking up Frodo and Sam) starts in median res at February 28 and ends with the capture of Frodo by old Sauron on late March 13th, a full week later than the end of Book 3. So in few, the time periods to each book are not always concurrent - that is, starting at the same time and ending at the same timeSo to keep track of moon phases, dates, meanings of words in one huge tome is quite something. Clearly the Lord of the Rings is (in Tolkien's phrase)a matter that \\"got out of hand\\" rather quickly. Original drafts of early chapters of the first book had the Black Rider hunting for the Shire hobbits originally being Gandalf, comically surprising them while leaving Hobbiton - in the comic vein of the earlier book The Hobbit, to which Lord was a sequel; this incident became much darker with Gandalf turning to a Black Rider STALKING the hobbits before they even left the Shire!This book keeps track of events, words (lot of archaic words need to be defined - and not everyone knows that a league is 3 miles!)As brilliant a book this is (I've read it once thus far, all the way through) I do have to wonder who its for... As I've said, you can't just pick up this book if you're not really familiar with the Story as you'll get rather cross and fling it aside because you'll be confused about references to Westernesse (aka Numenor) and so forth. (Westernesse is the land lost by betrayal by Sauron at the close of the Second Age when the king took up arms against the Valar in the West.)I think it would also help if you had a passing familiarity with The Silmarillion, even if just reading about it in the excellent Tolkien for Dummies book, which touches on the Ages previous to the events of the War of the Ring (at the close of the 3rd age)I think reading the Silmarillion might be too much for some people (I found it tedious and not as engrossing as the Lord of the Rings) so perhaps finding a synopsis would be best. I do think it would help that you read the Lord of the Rings a least a few times before picking up this work (this IS a review of the Readers Companion); it really helps if you know the Lord well, to sum up. Otherwise this work might be too frustrating a read, and you won't know the world"},{"Title":"A Drum Calls West","review":"I recently met Bill Gulick in Spokane, WA., at my first WWA convention....that's the Western Writers Association. The other writers there seemed to hold Bill in very high esteem, so when I got home I found one of his old westerns in a used book store, A Drum Calls West....and I just finished reading it last night.Wow! This guy can sure write....I've been reading tons of Louis L'Amour books, and certainly enjoying them, and Bill's writing reminds me a great deal of L'Amour, same kind of good attention to detail, lots of color, excellent action, great characters, good setting, tight plot...just a darn good read in all regards.I understand a number of his books were made into movies...which makes plenty of sense. The exciting thing for me is that I've discovered a new author whose writing I really like, and an author who wrote quite a few books. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on as many of Bill Gulick's westerns as I can find...and reading every one of them. Honestly, check this guy out...Gulick's a great writer!"},{"Title":"The Girl From Hollywood","review":"This attempt by Burroughs to reach beyond his Tarzan and sci-fi stories largely fails because while the plot touches on the serious issues of drug addiction and sexual exploitation, his thinly-drawn characters and melodramatic contrivances remain at the &#34;pulp&#34; level. However, Burroughs' style remains highly readable, despite the clunky dialog, and he offers a diverting look at an unsavory fringe of the silent-movie industry."},{"Title":"Thunder in the sky","review":"Fifteen-year-old Sam works on a barge sailing across the English Channel to resupply Allied forces fighting in France in the early years of World War I. The barge sails at any time and in any weather, as soon as its cargo is loaded or unloaded, and the book movingly evokes the thrills, terrors, and grueling work of carrying flammable cargo past bomb-dropping dirigibles and outrunning the fire of German sympathizers. Through Sam's interactions with his older brothers Manny, who is serving as a soldier in the trenches, and Gil, who is unwillingly drawn into espionage, and through his observations of life in England, where stay-at-homes grow prosperous working in war factories, and France, where the ports to which he delivers goods are perilously close to the battle lines, we watch as Sam moves from a simplistic, hero-worshiping view of war and soldiers to a more complex and mature understanding.Peyton is one of the few novelists to write well about the experience of \\"flow,\\" that mindless yet pleasurable absorption in demanding and satisfying work described by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and this books contains some wonderful passages concerning the pleasures of sailing the English Channel through weather both beautiful and bitter. The characterizations are not as complex and nuanced as in some of her later works for young adults but the book is intended for a slightly younger audience and remains a richly satisfying read.According to the back cover, the book was originally published in 1966 and was recommended by the British Library Association as one of the outstanding books for young readers published that year."},{"Title":"To Love and to Cherish","review":"wow. anne hodgson's premiere novel arrives with a bang and leaves the reader salivating for more. the characters are complex and well-presented, and the storyline is plausible yet unpredictable. the reader is drawn to the heroine, whose innocence and honesty are well-tempered with unmatched strength of character and conviction. i found myself alternately laughing and crying, but always cheering for the beautiful Brianda as she searched for the meaning of love, loss and new beginnings. a definite 'pick-me-up' for readers who have lost their faith in the power of love and perserverance in a world that's not always fair. five stars!"},{"Title":"To Love and to Cherish","review":"This book is so well written.

It rates high because it is timely and actually gives a plan to cut back on the tremendous waste of time and money in our system of choosing a President. Strong medicine sweetned with wit and style. Worth reading."},{"Title":"No Way to Pick a President","review":"In his 1999 book entitled No Way to Pick a President, Jules Witcover barely disguises his disgust at the downward direction in which American politics appears to be spiralling. Whist he levels his attacks at most aspects of the American political scene, his main vitriol is saved for what he calls \\"money and hired guns\\"--the soft money and professional political campaign managers that are now required to secure that seat on the Hill. Witcover, a journalist and columnist of some fifty years, is able to bring much to the table when discussing politics.Cutting his political teeth while reporting Eisenhower's presidential campaign, he has witnessed the business of politics transforming itself into what he regards as some kind of corrupting chimera. He laments that the days of off the record chats with presidential candidates are well and truly over. He cites the long lens camera, the ferreting into ancient police reports and general dirt digging as rules of the presidential game. Adding insult to political injury, all this is overseen and orchestrated by highly paid, self-seeking professional campaign managers whose eyes are more on how a victory would look on their company's sales literature, than how their employer would fare as president of the United States of America. Witcover seems to feel that presidential campaigns have been transformed into a presidential war game with all runners engaged in long drawn out trench warfare and mud slinging. And he may well be right.Witcover's book was definitely informative, but perhaps it was the strangeness of the 2000 presidency that makes one question the book's usefulness in explaining current politics. Accusations of misuse of both soft and hard money did abound at the start of the campaign, and candidates were obviously groomed by consultants in matters ranging from \\"earth tones\\" to the most effective way to wave their hands. However, these matters did not appear to be the core issues one read about or listen to people discussing. Distrust of motives, candidates' insufficient experience, speech impediments, and accusations of dishonesty by association; these were the concerns in a campaign conducted in an issues desert. In the book's defense, Witcover does provide useful historical facts, which in part explain the progression of politics since the days of Washington. However, a valid viewpoint may be that what is occurring today is merely a natural progression in the government of a modern society, not a degradation of politics or politicians. The Wordsmyth Education Thesaurus defines politics as \\"the use of strategic maneuvering within a group to obtain power or control\\", and this is exactly what has occurred during this and recent campaigns. The difference today is that politicians use every modern media weapon at their disposal to achieve that power or control. Mr. Witcover may well just have to accept that times have changed since the days he shared a beer with Kennedy in the back of the campaign bus. Not only has the price of beer risen since then, but so has the cost, financial, moral and personal, of running for President."},{"Title":"No Way to Pick a President","review":"There has been much debate about the propriety of retaining the Electoral College, designed by the Constitution's framers, in the wake of the controversial 2000 presidential election, in which Albert Gore won the popular vote but George Bush, following the Florida recount controversy, emerged as winner by obtaining more electoral votes.Since Jules Witcover's &quot;No Way to Pick a President&quot; came out before the 2000 election, and devoted much attention to the subject of the Electoral College and why it should be abolished, was the author a psychic? The answer is that he did not need to possess psychic powers to see the importance of the topic. He had a long background of political professionalism and has seen our system deteriorating for some time. As well as covering the topic of the Electoral College, Witcover devotes much time and attention to the evolution of what it has become. He is highly critical of a system increasingly taken over by public relations and advertising pundits offering snappy one-liners and spin control at the distinct sacrifice of broad discussion of the major issues confronting America domestically and internationally. Witcover cites the diminishing numbers of voters who cast ballots in presidential elections, along with the complaints of citizens indicating how turned off they have become with the system.Witcover scrutinizes the role of the political consultant in the system, giving a historical analysis of the phenomenon, its roots, and where it has taken us. He cites the success record of pioneers in the field, the team of Spencer and Roberts in California. Witcover explains how they conscientiously boosted the image of former motion picture actor Ronald Reagan, carefully cultivating a positive image that took him initially to the governorship in California, then the presidency.The author, a veteran of many presidential campaigns,provides both an overall perspective and possible reforms to make the system more wieldy and palatable to voters. Witcover has co-authored several books with Jack Germond about presidential campaigns they have jointly covered."},{"Title":"No Way to Pick a President","review":"Based on the titles of his other books it looks like some of the chapters of this one were plucked right out of his other work. Oh well, the book was good with interesting comments and some common sense points being brought up. The author basically takes the reader through all the issues he thinks are causing problems with the current presidential election process. From the fund raising process, the primaries and the Electoral College. The last item being the most interesting to read after the 2000 elections as the book was written in 1999 and it hit on the problems with the Electoral College. What was pleasing to me is that the author did not just provide examples from the last few elections but dug into history to bring out examples that detailed that the state we are in has been progressing this way for years.I was also pleased to find that I could not detect a major bias one way or the other. His comments seemed to take on both parties and were grounded in common sense and fair play. I was also amused by the section on picking the Vice President. He really let Bush 1's VP Dan Q. have it. The author's insight comes from his many years in the political reporting field and makes the book an enjoyable read for political junkies everywhere. I found I enjoyed this book far more then Drew's \\"What went wrong\\" which covered many of the same topics, but was not as well written. Overall the book was entertaining and offered some interesting insights. Given the topic it may be best suited for political junkies."},{"Title":"Tomatoes for Everyone: A Practical Guide to Growing Tomatoes All Year Round","review":"This is THE book for anyone who wants to know virtually everything about what rates as the world's most popular vegetable among home gardeners.

Charles Cullen may have murdered repeatedly, but more grueseome is the author's grisly butchering of the english language. I can't imagine this actually passed under the nose of anyone who seriously calls themselves a copy editor (truly about a glaring mistake in punctuation, syntax, or grammar per page), and I have no idea why even the most obscure subsidiary/branch of Penguin would put their name anywhere on this disaster. Yet another mystery is why Barnes & Noble continues to display this dreck so prominently on their \\"New Releases\\" display. I mean, T.V.

This book is, simply put, an embarrassment for the publishing industry. Mair writes at a sixth-grade level, and either \\"edited\\" this book himself or had an equally inept editor. Obviously written to capitalize on the Cullen story while still fresh, the 100-page book fails to provide any insight as to why Cullen (and similar murderers employed in healthcare) committed the crimes to which he had confessed, or to adequately address the shortcomings of the system that allowed him to get away with his killing for so long.

It took me so long to slog through the grammatical and spelling errors, the disorganized, redundant chapters, and the obviously slapped together &quot;bibliography&quot;, that I wondered how George Mair had the gall to offer this mess to a publisher, and moreover, why I was wasting my time attempting to get any sense out it!

For example, the menu arrangement described in this book for inserting a module sheet is different if you use Excel '97. The dialog sheet is used here for designing dialog boxes, a method replaced with UserForms in Excel '97.

Probably John Walkenbach's &quot;Microsoft Excel 2000 Power Programming&quot; is more useful, but unfortunately at a more advanced level."},{"Title":"Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications","review":"This is the only Visual Basic book I have seen which allows users to program in VB without first learning the intricacies of the language. Which makes this book the only convenient source (that I have found; after repeated trips to book stores and libraries) for anyone who is attempting to make useful programs in Excel. While it was written for Excel 7.0 the applications (amazingly) still work in Excel 2000. I would recomend this book to anyone who works with computers and wishes to save some time by avoiding tedious data entry."},{"Title":"Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications","review":"I am always amazed at how hard it is to find a book that teaches someone to program in Visual Basic. There are thousands of books that go through lists of objects, properties, and controls, but very few that teach classic programming fundamentals using the VB language. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning Visual Basic, not just those doing Excel macro programming.This book has an excellent treatment of basic (no pun intended) programming concepts and is the only truly useful and usable text I've found for teaching VB inside or outside of the Excel environment.My only question is when is Ms. Boonin going to update this book or release another one? I'm teaching a community college class and would like to use this as a textbook but the version of Excel this book is based upon is out of date."},{"Title":"Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications","review":"I needed a quick course in Visual Basic for Excel. This book did the trick. I was tired of reading others' macros and trying to figure out what meant what. With a college course in Fortran77 providing me the basic framework of how to program, I found this book easy to follow and easier to learn from.I don't know if someone with absolutely no programming experience would find it as helpful, but it was an excellent book for me. I can now create my own code without having to use the recorder, and I can figure out other's complex code with the foundation the book provided."},{"Title":"Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications","review":"This is a very good book to begin programming in Excel VBA, but not to end if you will. The book sort of gives you a push and YOU! have to then take the ball and run with it. The book is analogous to how a mother bear chases her cubs away once they are big enough to take care of themselves. The cubs, though with enough skills to survive, are still left with new and open possibilities before them. The reason why is that most of the examples are too easy, making them too unrealistic for the real world. The other is that the book is based on an older Excel version. This book is really great for those people who are scared of programming and want to make the transition, but are not sure of what road to take."},{"Title":"Using Excel Visual Basic for Applications","review":"After floundering for some weeks trying to use the Microsoft manuals, I purchased the Que book &quot;Using Exel Visual Basic for Applications,&quot; (ISBN 0-7897-0325-4) by Eliabeth Boonin.

The only constructive criticism I can offer for the future would be another paragraph or two of clarification on &quot;Displaying Your Dialog Boxes.&quot; I didn't find the explanation complete as to where code should be located for displaying a custom-made box while protecting the sheet on which the box was created.

I attended one of his first U.S. workshops about five years ago as a frustrated twelve- handicapper and the techniques I learned from Croker turned my game around. The book is a no-nonsense explication of Peter's principles. The Push-Action swing that Croker advocates is easy to learn, and many of the innovative drills can be practiced away from the golf course. Traditionalists may balk at a swing model based on the idea of pushing the clubhead through the ball with the hands, arms, and body-- in other words, a 'hitting' rather than a 'pulling' action-- but my experience with this method has been very positive."},{"Title":"Peter Croker's Path To Better Golf: The Revolutionary Swing Technique for Power, Control, and Consistency","review":"I bought this book in 1994 when it was titled Natural Golf &#34;The Hit.&#34; I understand the title had to be changed do to the fact the Moe Norman method had the patent on the name &#34;Natural Golf.&#34; This is without a doubt one of the best books written on the subject of golf swing technique. I say, one of the best, because it may or may not be the technique for you. Personally, I've never been able to make what would be deemed the traditional golf swing work...ever. By traditional, that would be a method of pulling through the shot. As Mr. Croker states, any instruction that teaches &#34;your body&#34; begins the downswing is teaching pulling. His method of pushing through the shot from a quiet body is reveloutionary. If you're struggling with obtaining a golf swing that repeats itself, this book is definitely worth the read. Everything he states in this book makes total sense to me. Mr. Croker also states, he's not advocating that this is THE method of hitting a golf ball, but rather a simplistic method that anyone can obtain.Does it work, yes. Does this swing look different from a traditional swing, absolutely not, your golfing buddies would never know the difference."},{"Title":"Peter Croker's Path To Better Golf: The Revolutionary Swing Technique for Power, Control, and Consistency","review":"Most golf instruction is like chiropractic. The \\"instructor\\" moves your body into unnatural positions and tells you that \\"everything is going to be better\\". Nothing gets better, but you give them money.Mr. Croker's method is different. I would suggest first reading the chapter that explains why all of the truisms of \\"regular\\" instruction are wrong.This book will be particularly welcome for those golfers who used to be able to play but have lost their swings. This book will take you back to the way you swung \\"naturally\\", and better, as a kid. Back to the days when you just hit the ball.Professional athletes seem to like to convince you that what they are doing is rocket science and a profound mental exercise. Probably makes them feel smarter. This book tells you that the correct way to think about hitting a golf ball is simple.

I used to be on the Akins diet and lost weight but could not maintain it. With this program I have lost 23 pounds in just over three months and have kept it off."},{"Title":"Lose Weight Feel Great Without Sacrifice or Willpower","review":"I have used weight loss tapes for several years to get back into my weight range. When I use them, they work, but after I do not use them for a while, I slack off. I have lost much weight with hypnotic tapes and I am trying to get back into my weight range. This particluar hypnosis tape differs from some of the others--and I am looking for variety to help. This completes my search. Some 90% of people regain all of the weight and put on even more after 5 years of the loss some experts say, and I have not gained back much of anything except for maybe 5% of what I lost over about 6 years of time.So, I am going at it again to try to lose the rest of it once and for all. Some people have said that hypnosis tapes are not a good way to go because they are a &quot;mind control&quot; fascination. However, I feel that they release me from &quot;mind control&quot; of the subliminal junk food ads and the negativity of the news media and other areas that cause(d) me to gain weight. I stop using the hypnosis tapes and after a few days of TV watching, I go for the junk food, etc. I usually do not watch much TV, but I have spurts when I do and yucky...I find them to be the wholesome, easy approach to lose weight.I once ate quite a bit when I would sit at a computer and just type, but then I listened to a hypnosis tape while using the computer and I do not chow down during or after computer use anymore.This particular hypnosis tape differs from the others I use because it offers meditation techniques and positive messages relating to good eating habits and exercise whereas the others I have may be more powerful but they use unrelated allegories and tales to help with weight loss and stress.I find this tape works so far and I will add to this review after using it for several months."},{"Title":"Lose Weight Feel Great Without Sacrifice or Willpower","review":"Having tried several diets unsuccessfully , this tape was the only tool that helped me loose a significant amount of weight .In less than a week ,my appetite was reduced significantly without even thinking about it.During the past 6 months of not using it , I gained back a few pounds ,but will start again today .

I can't say as if King David himself were reading the Psalms, for that isn't as accurate as the former, for the reading is clearly one spoken with eloquence fit for any hearer, even King David. High praise, are those remarks, and this collection of The Psalms are worth such praise.The style of the reading is clear, musical without musical background but punctuated by musical notes between readings. The imagination given by Michael York, and there is that high praise again for this reading of 150 Psalms, comes through for these are rich and moving readings that involve the listener. I have had a set of these tapes for many years, given one set as a gift only to discover that they are to be found only among the used category for sale. Sadly, there will be a time when the set may go out of print. This is my second set of this collection.As a note of comparison, there is a collection of readings of the King James Version of the Bible's New Testament read by Gregory Peck. Like Mr. Peck, Mr. York has a distinct voice that shows he is a noteworthy voice of merit and offers an understanding of what he is reading, without getting in the way of the words or the text. To say that he is a man with a trained voice and excellent diction, like Mr. Gregory Peck, is to my way of thinking and listening accurate.I have a number of \\"recorded\\" readings of Biblical material, including Gregory Peck, Sir Laurence Olivier, Alexander Scourby, and the out of print \\"The Bible\\" (the Old Testament in King James Version) read by numbers of actors with excellent voices. Michael York's reading of The Psalms is certainly a central part of my collection of such audio recordings, and his voice is as distinct and memorable as any, if not more so. Hear him say, \\"Selah,\\" and you will know there is quality to both the recording and his interpretation.For a complete, unabridged reading of the King James Version of The Psalms, one can be pleased to own and listen to this understandable and distinguished recording where Michael York reads memorably and so well these wonderful words of The Psalms.Peter Menkin -- Pentecost"},{"Title":"The Book of Psalms","review":"The Book of Psalms ranks as some of the greatest spiritual literature ever written.It is a beautiful guide for relating to God in good times and dark times in your life. I find the Psalms especially helpful when I am experiencing deep pain and suffering and I am in need of inner calm and comfort.

My only criticism is that if you are using the 'text to speech' mode (of course in public I would be using an earpiece or reading) on the kindle, then the orator also reads out the number of the verse, which can be very distracting when you are focusing on the message and it breaks up the sentence.However, if you're NOT using the 'text to speech' mode then GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Criminal Justice System and Women: Offenders, Prisoners, Victims, and Workers","review":"I have seen many textbooks in my lifetime but this was, by far, the worst I have ever seen!

They have updated the edition numbers but not the facts and stats that are used. Unless you are required to have this book for a class, don't waste your money on this.

The meaning of alienation and its consequences are described. Buy, buy, buy, have, have, have... This is the motto of our age. Buy whatever you can. We are all forced to be buyers and consumers. Almost nobody tells us to be and describe how to be.I think the advertisement sector is the new priest of the new religion. Most of us think that we are Christian, Muslim, or any other religion. However, there is an inner, secret religion that most of us are not aware of: Our society is worshipping the idols that we created by our hands. The new priests of this religion are calling us to buy and consume using the advertisements.The advertisements are the new holy books.Marketing people are the new priests.Commodities are the new idols.People are running to have new things like donkeys running after carrots.God created the human being and the human being created fake gods.// G&ouml;khan Koak"},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"There are common threads to all the great religions, although often they get lost in or overpowered by the 'having' part of life. Fromm explores the fundamentals of a life centered on 'being' and, basically, comes up with a rational basis for the fundamental objective of the great religions.Few of us today have the chance to avoid involvement with the 'having' part of our society. To succeed in 'being' is a daily battle, but we have to do it, for our beings as well as for our children.It might be interesting to compare the ideas in 'Bobos in paradise' with those in this book!

In Amazon ranking terms it starts out as a 3 and ends up as a 1 in lack of a smaller number. I hate not finishing books and I had to push myself not to abandon this one.The worst part of the book is the ending, which is Fromm's suggestions for a &quot;sane&quot; society. Ironically, his described world (even though an impossibility) sounds tremendously more nightmarish and &quot;sick&quot; than anything Kafka ever dreamt. How is it that Fromm got to write an afterword for 1984 and at the same time completely miss the point, is beyond me.It never fails to surpise me how certain people come to believe they have a solution to the world's problems. I believe that as time goes by, this and other Fromm books will become an example of things to avoid. In this respect, reading this book is not entirely useless, for it will increase your arsenal of arguments against similar artificial solutions proposed by similarly big-headed individuals."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"To have or to be?Well... to be, says Fromm.In response to the materialism of our century and our propensity to reification, psychoanalyst Erich Fromm proposes a mode of living that he argues is the way out of our psychospiritual conundrum.Within the pages of this book, one of the last before his demise, the author of the bestseller _ The Art of Loving_ describes the two modes possible--that of having and being. 20th century culture he says has developed into employing and relying on the having mode--of appropriating things and even humans for oneself. Even love has been turned into an object, when in fact no such thing exists. Only the act of loving is possible.In contradistinction to having is being. It is a mode of active participation in life. While the misnomer 'falling in love' is touted by the world as the norm, Fromm argues that true loving is an effortful activity. While accumulating knowledge is the way of having, the being mode of knowing is a process of understanding.Although written nearly three decades ago, Fromm's worldview continues to be the ideal. This work of his is a timeless caveat against the dehumanization of society."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"I have already read twice this book in the past three years and consider re-reading it again soon. It has become part of me; everyday I remember key sentences from the book which help me make sense of my own life, attitudes, and ideas. Two notions (a) the &quot;being&quot; way of life as opposed to &quot;having&quot;, and (b) &quot;matter is in constant flux&quot; help me let go, relieving me of my attachment to things material. Paradoxically, they also give me the courage to experience life in a more proactive way, and to accept and appreciate life as it is without trying to force events. It's a truly spiritual and healing book."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"Fromm is one of the classics - along with Freud, Jung, Adler. He studied psychology, philosophy and sociology, received his PhD at the age of 22, became interested in Zen Buddhism at the age of 26. One of the true geniuses.This book was written in 1976. Fromm debates that there are two possible modes of living: one of having and of being. He points out the differences between the two and of a person living in the having mode to the one living in the being mode. He shows the differences in behavior and attitude between the two in many life's areas and experiences: studying, remembering, talking, reading, faith, love, handling authority. The less you are oriented on having, the more you are being."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"Fromm describes, in very understandable terms, the eternal conflict between the desire to &quot;have&quot; and the desire to &quot;be&quot;. He outlines logically that most problems humanity has is the strive for materialism. He compares things to be had as dead and qualities to be as living. Some of his insights are drawn from the Bible and show that God Himslef, by his very name, is the supreme &quot;being&quot;, whose wish it is that man becomes like him. Fromm warns against the perils of &quot;have&quot; based societies, and conclusively demonstrates that &quot;be&quot; oriented individuals have one of the major keys to a better and more satisfying life."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"Seriously, if you are opening this book, be prepared to use your brain for real or spare yourself the trouble. First, to paraphrase a foreword from a non-English translation, you need to be aware that Fromm is the analyst, and not the sweet-sounding visionary. So, the last part of the last chapter is best served by skipping it or browsing with the smile, remembering that even great analysts sometimes can't resist the temptation to 'envision' a 'recipe'.The rest of the book, or should I say the actual book, is pure gold, but in order to reach it you need to be prepared to simply trust the author for the duration of the book. Then turn around and if you don't start recognizing things he's talking about in real life - feel free to debate him - during the second reading. If you jump to debate him every time he crushes something you consider 'sacral' you'll just waste your time. Consider this a test of your own brain - is it really working or just being busy filtering the uneasy information.Also, be prepared to read the book twice, even if you don't feel like debating it :-) The reason is that pretty soon you'll want to quote something from the book but you won't have an easy one-liner. To quote Fromm, you'll need to quote the idea, and ideas take a few paragraphs or even pages to be 'painted' and understood properly.Last but not least, be aware that Fromm himself was aware of the fact that the one who is discovering or telling a new thing doesn't actually have the vocabulary to express it, so be prepared to fill in and consider it normal if some words don't sound precise or modern. For example, Fromm didn't have the vocabulary of the communication theory so he couldn't spell out loud the role of communication in human relations, but he did use the word 'affecting' in ways that will allow you to see the intrinsic human need for communication.That is another reason why you need to be able to both trust the author on the first read and keep your own brain ready to use. It's only after you finish the book that the whole picture will start to form and connect apparently missing pieces - and you will read it the second time."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"The traditional question review and update by Fromm's mastery. As part of his constant and insistent understanding of the world, this book points out again that, the &quot;to have&quot; approach leads to first unexpectable sidedamages. It is important to understand that, a Society that put emphasis on &quot;to have&quot; will promote scarcity and misery. Read to believe."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"The author argues how the industrial society organized around the captitalistic framework has promoted a culture to want more and more and relies on people wanting more and more for achieving what it thinks is progress, disregarding in the process other wholistic goals such as true joyfulness of being, well-being of the total mankind, environment etc.Marxism as implemented by communism is no better again due to its emphasis again on having &quot;stuff&quot; for every one (the author seems to think Marx essentially had it right but it is the followers such as Lenin messed up things; I personally think fundamendals of organizing a society based on equal conditions is essentially flawed; there is a far cry between equal rights and forcing equal conditions on everyone).Another theme which the author talks of is how underdeveloped, non-white societies and cultures are different and place more emphasis on being rather than having mode. As some one who was born and brought up in India and who has lived for more than a decade in US, I think the author is a little outdated here, if he ever was right on this aspect. I can assure you the having mode is universal across the board, may be due to spread of capitalism and globalization (though I doubt it; I think even in prehistoric times, man was a hoarder of things rather than an altruistic animal living always for the good of the society)Anyway, this book is about changing one's attitude towards how to live meaningfully without getting carried away with having and wanting more and more things .. this ultimately is the essense of being spiritual and humansitic without getting carried away with any particular formalized religious framework.Eric Fromm writes well and you could do worse than read this book."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"First published in 1976, Erich Fromm\`s To Have or to Be could easily have been written in 2009 as it is extremely relevant to our situation today.Fromm\`s main goal is to explain the two prevailing modes of human existence--the having mode and the being mode. The book opens up with an elegant comparison between the poetry of Tennyson and Basho (and their synthesis Goethe) through which Fromm powerfully reveals the dichotomy between the two modes. He then proceeds with describing how people in the being mode learn, remember, read, talk, love differently than the people in the having mode, thus further elucidating the fundamental characteristics of the two character orientations.I personally find the chapter on Religion, Character and Society the most insightful and profound summary of the human condition in the 21st century--profits as the ultimate objective, unsustainable and destructive, mass and pathological consumerism alienating human beings from each other and themselves, inability for critical thinking due to advertising propaganda and brainwashing. Fromm is either prescient, or all this was going on, albeit on smaller scale, back in 1976.I cannot emphasize the value of this honest,warm and humanist book enough. Its originality is truly amazing. Besides its precious message, I thought that one can get several dissertation ideas out of it. Fromm\`s application of the having and being mode to analyzing poetry, his argument that as a result of the possessiveness of the having orientation, the tendency to substitute nouns for verbs has grown dramatically, his interpretation of the original sin and Adam and Eve\`s expulsion from Paradise are all fascinating.There are numerous valuable references to other sources of interest such as E.F. Shumacher\`s \\"Small is beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered.\\" And Marx, yes, Marx, whose ideas, Fromm claims, have been grossly perverted; D.T. Suzuki\`s Buddhist texts. All these are on my to read list now.Let me finish with one of the many beautiful insights of the book: \\"As long as everybody wants to have more, there must be formations of classes, there must be class war, and in global terms, there must be international war. Greed and peace preclude each other\\" (p.5)."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"will you fall into the Western, mechanistic, and capitalistic mode of Having, or evolve into the perennial Being taught by those whom Fromm calls the Masters of Living? Bearing mind that the two can overlap (one has only to think of Jesus' advice to possess as though one possessed nothing), Fromm sets out the polarity well for purposes of psychological study. Ought to be taught in school..."},{"Title":"To Have or to Be?","review":"I read this book, in part, for my dissertation, which is questioning psychotherapy as a commodified practice and revealing how profiting works as a guiding force in clinical practice. Like many of Fromm's other works, To Have or To Be exposes how, in the having mode of being, our phenomongical experiences are reduced to commodified experiences. Thus, we experience others as commodities, as embodiments of exchange value. Although I do not agree entirely with Fromm's thoughts in distinguishing between the Having and Being modes of existence, To Have or To Be is an invaluable resource. I suspect that the criticism of this work is not so much about the merits or realism of Fromm's position on Having and Being and his suggestions for change, but more of a matter of deflection from the anxiety produced from challenging one's way of being-in-the-world, from having-in-the-world. Of course, I could be wrong."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was easily the best thing I read in all of 2002, and I read a lot. Though this was written 50 years ago, the writing still seems fresh and modern, and the characters are as alive today as they were when they were written. A heartbreakingly good coming of age story.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this book by accident in the tiny library of a summerhouse on the Maine coast. I read it in one day, and I loved it so much I actually took it home with me! The characters in this book are so well developed that you feel like you know them.The story is so real and so beautiful. You can identify with Cassandra as she deals with life, and the people who surround her. I read this book at least once a year, just to stay in touch, and i never, ever get tired of it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The first feeling is one of total surprise. I really did not expect such an entertaining modern book. Although this is a book that was published, as I understand in 1948, it is very modern and refreshing and seems to be dealing with issues relevant to young women in any time and place.What is mostly refreshing is the writing of Cassandra, the 17 year old narrator. Cassandra would like to be a writer one day and therefore writes this account. She writes candidly, vividly and with no need to impress herself or others. Cassandra is totally true to herself and the fact that the Dodie Smith chose this mechanism of diary writing as her narrating tool allows us to see Cassandra grow, mature and understand the world in front of our eyes. The descriptions are real, alive and very detailed. The story, which can be very simply described as a sort of love story is interesting due to the lovely characters. Cassandra which the reader knows inside and out, a person that likes human beings and nature alike. The beautiful rural English view comes alive through her eyes as well as the behaviours of the people surrounding her. Cassandra has an eye for detail and a natural way to catch all gestures (an example for this would be Cassandra's description of her sister Rose drinking the green Menthe drink which she chose on purpose as it matches her hair). We also have Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, beautiful and looking for a way to escape her poverty life, Thomas their younger brother, Stephan a servant son who has been living with the family, the father, a writer who does not write, and their stepmother, Topaz, a model for artists, full of good will and kindness. All these characters are presented as round figures, we see their good and bad qualities and this mixture, together with further characters makes this a superb book. Pure entertainment."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain lives a life of poverty is a crumbling castle in England. Her family consists of her father who was once a critically acclaimed author but hasn't been working in years; her eccentric step mother, Topaz; her dramatic and romantic sister, Rose; her younger brother, Thomas; and Stephen, who helps maintain the castle for free and is infatuated with Cassandra. Cassandra begins, one cold evening, sitting in her kitchen sink, to write a journal in order to teach her self how to read. The events that follow this decision will change her life forever. Her family meets the Cottons, two wealthy men from America named Simon and Neil. When Rose becomes attracted to Simon she begins to come up with a plan that could bring the Mortmain family out of poverty. What is she marries Simon? As the book progresses Cassandra deals with all the issues of growing up: love, trust, finding faith, and learning to understand her family and friends.I have to admit the only reason I really read this book is because of JK Rowling's commentary of it on the cover. I learned quite quickly that I Capture the Castle was much different from Harry Potter. Written by Dodie Smith (who wrote 101 Dalmations which has been made into two movies by Disney) in the 1930s, I Capture the Castle manages to capture a young, charismatic narrator that you will fall in love with right away. Cassandra begins this book very much as a child but by the end she has not only &quot;captured the castle&quot; but has grown up into a sophisticated young woman. I very much enjoyed this book. There are a couple twists near the end that even I didn't expect to see. The characters are fascinating and very well drawn and it's written extremely well. I would recommend this novel to both the young and the young at heart. It's a very good book. I highly recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just finished reading this book and came to Amazon in hopes that some of her other adult titles were in print--no luck there.

I did this book for an ISU because i liked it so much"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; by Dodie Smith is like a beautiful painting of words. It's about 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain and her family, who live in an old ruined castle in England. Her father is a writer with severe writers block, but who wrote an obscure book, which was one of the most important books of that generation. This book is about her experiences, going from poverty to wealth, from loneliness to love, from complete estrangement from her father to a daughter again. Written as a sort of journal, it chronicles her life for what seems to be about a year. It is written beautifully, very expressively, and to me seems to have an ethereal quality. Some characters are well thought out, and necessarily deep, whereas some, such as Mrs Cotton, are just small, sometimes comedic, sometimes more sombre, pencil-sketches.Cassandra lives through desparate poverty, her father's mood swings, her sister's love affair, falling in love herself, her step-mother's odd habits and rituals, the &quot;hired&quot; help's love for her, and records all of it in hindsight, often with amazing insight and maturity, while maintaining the voice of a 17 year old.This book, to my mind, brings back images of the novels I read when I was young - narrative, and with seemingly no other deeper messages to convey. It is the type of book that I can imagine a mother giving a daughter to read. It is wonderfully innocent, and yet delightfully ravishing to the senses. It is timeless, and creates the English country village scene without any real reference to year or generation. It was a joy to read, and I hope that others find the same pleasure in it that I found."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book has everything a good book should have: memorable characters (Cassandra is one of the most lovable narrators I've ever stumbled upon, and I wanted to meet in person everyone in the story!), substance, romance, humor, and the ability to keep the reader thoroughly happy! I did not want this book to end. I felt I was part of their 1930 English countryside world and didn't want to come back to 2002 (there's just no &quot;class&quot; in the world anymore!)

Cassandra is the second daughter of what would be called today, a one hit wonder, a writer whose only, and only moderately successful book was followed by a period of writer's block which lasted for many years. She lives with her father, elder sister, younger brother and step mother in a 14 th century castle, a mouldering ruin with crumbling brick work and damp walls which looks romantic and like something from a fairy tale but is, in reality, far from comfortable in any way. The family lives in poverty with barely enough to eat and only a few items of clothing left on their backs. When the new owners of the castle return from the US to take up their inheritance, the family plots to marry off the elder and prettier sister to the heir to the estate, as they are literally starving and prepared to resort to any means of getting money.

However, please dont let this deter you from reading it. I thought I would really dislike the style, but you will hardly notice it once you start the book. The book has a good pace to it, its definitely a leisurely summer read. The main character is Seventeen-year-old Cassandra. Throughout the book she has do deal not only with her crazy family, but also first love. My favorite thing about the book is that it really goes against the perception of many young girls today that all your problems get fixed if you get married, but it doesnt rub your nose in it either. Cassandra's sister is one such girl, and its a nice comparison to see how Cassandra handles her problems compared to how her sister hopes to handle them.

The library didn't have it but amazingly I found it on Kijiji for $2.I was very excited about this book and this is why I am so disappointed. I've been reading patiently, waiting for the story and not just descriptions of minor events, and finally, at the end of the second of Cassandra's journals something happens. Great, here we go, I thought relieved (I really wanted this book to get good as I had already invested some time in it). But no, that event sort of implodes, and looks like we're back to more descriptions of Cassandra's strange (and not very likeable to me) family. I don't know, maybe I am five pages away from something happening again, but I don't care anymore. I don't even like Cassandra all that much.

Narrator/diarist Cassandra (I know she isn't really Romola Garai, but it's nice to think she is) is quite a wit and a talented young writer, courtesy of her eccentric father. Her stepmother and older sister, according to her, are both great beauties - nothing wrong with that. Each of them is admired by several men, always a good sign. And the several men are in turn variously chased by the (mostly) chaste women. If this sounds a bit like a soap opera, as some of the less enthusiastic reviewers have written, perhaps it is, but one of a very high quality, one with many surprises, picturesque settings, and at least one great car - played by a GP Bugatti in the movie. A very enjoyable diversion, despite a rather slow start."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just loved I Capture The Castle. What a charming book!Set in the 1930s in a rural English town, the novel tells the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl living with her family in a run-down castle. Cassandra's family is highly eccentric. Her father is a tortured writer, her stepmother a free spirit and great beauty and her sister Rose is her imaginative best friend and confidante. The story revolves around the love triangle that ensues when two wealthy American brothers move into a nearby estate and begin courting the Mortmain sisters.Smith's writing style is languid and lushly romantic. The novel is a pleasure to read. While Rose and Cassandra's romances are very much mired in old fashioned conventions, the emotions involved are quite accessible to modern readers. Cassandra comes across as a vivid and believable character and it's easy to care for her.I have to say that I was disappointed in the ending. Not because it didn't work, but because I'd been hoping for a different outcome. I actually thought about it for days. That's the power of a good story!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mortimer Adler (How to Read a Book) recommends reading a book three times to delve deeper into what an author is trying to say through their story. I just finished reading this for the first time. This really deserves a closer read now that I \\"get\\" what happens with Rose at the end. (No spoilers here).I'd seen the movie a while ago and it didn't really do anything for me. I watched the movie again last night and still didn't like it. Sure, the movie was OK, but I don't think it really got to the heart of the story.I feel the author is really trying to say something here that is summarized at the end during the discussion between Simon and Cassandra about her father's book. This book is a puzzle in itself on purpose. It is not just about a love story, or a child growing up. Dodie Smith is trying to say something about the creative process itself. It will take effort on the reader's part to tease out all the meaning that is layered into the story."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Sometimes when as a modern reader you read books from the early part of the 20th century or before they can feel... stale or dated.\\"I Capture the Castle\\" may have been written in the 40's but it feels so very and amazingly moddern.

I thoroughly enjoyed the old language in this book, and I could picture the scenes perfectly in my head as I was reading. (I still remember many of the scenes of this book -after a whole year and many, many books later!)It is a great story, and the ending will surprise you.

I even have castles on my checks! And, since I'm an Aglophile, I gravitate towards books from Britian. Anyway, I get a lot of ideas for books from AMAZON'S marvelous 'lists' and when I saw something that said, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE, my curiosity got the best of me. And then, reviewers were comparing the author to Austen and Bronte and the heroine to Jane Eyre or Elizabeth Bennett. Since these people are referring to my all time favorite books, I immediately ordered this one. The cover of the book has a castle on it and the back has a recommendation from J K Rowling, another favorite author! WOW! I couldn't wait to start this book.Well, despite not seeing any similarities between the above authors to Dodie Smith (who also wrote the classic 101 DALMATIONS) or my beloved heroines to the seventeen year-old Cassandra Mortmain, this is still an enthralling read.This novel was published in 1948 but takes place in the 1930's. James Mortmain has written a very successful novel called \\"Jacob Wrestling.\\" He makes quite a bit of money and then, years later is sent to prison for 3 months for dramatically brandishing a cake knife at his wife during a family picnic (a neighbor 'tells'). When he returns from his incarceration, he has writer's block that spans decades. He also impetuously signs a 40-year lease on a ramshackle castle that is hundreds of years old. He promptly hides out in the tower all day, every day to read novels (while his family thinks he is writing). Cassandra, an aspiring writer, tells the story through her detailed journals.In addition to the father and Cassandra, the family now consists of the beautiful and selfish older sister Rose, a brother Tom, and an eccentric and free spirited Topaz, the beautiful stepmother (their mother has died years before of natural causes). There is also a young servant boy, Stephen (who is madly in love with Cassandra). Since the dad is useless, the family sells not only the furniture but also personal belongings to buy food. Stephen tends the garden and volunteers to get another job to support the family that should be paying him. To add drama and romance, the handsome and charming Cotton brothers move into the manor adjacent to the castle. Mr. Mortmain is supposed to be paying rent to the owner of this estate (he doesn't).One can really imagine what is going to happen from just reading the paragraph before this one. Yes, this book is a tad dated and predictable but trust me, there is a delicious twist at the end to satiate all of us romantics who love the fairy-tale ending. Cassandra is absolutely charming and we really pull for this young lady. I loved reading this novel; it was so easy to get into and easy to follow. The story was sweet (if you ignore the slattern father and bratty sister) with nice language and no $*x.........very classic. And of course, the other star of this tale is the wonderful castle!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading the latest reviews on Amazon I felt obliged to write my own review.This is a wonderful book.

All the characters are enjoyable and life like.Of course, this is a book for younger readers. I still feel it is a very good read for any age. I read it in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I have since re-read it twice and I still love it.I have heard that this is also one of JK Rowlings favorite books as a child, and that it inspired her to write.High praise indeed.Please read it for yourself and don't let those without imagination turn you away from it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I absolutely love this book! I say it a lot, and it's always true. My mom gave me her copy when I was twelve, she'd found a first printing copy in a box of books her father recieved from the book of the month club, read it, and fell in love. So she passed it on to me and I adore it every bit as much as she does. This is beautiful story, it sucks you in. You care about the people and it is definatly not a brick wall happy ending. I still wonder what happened...how Cassandra's life turned out, not to mention her sister rose's. This is the story of a young girl and her family living in an old castle in rural england. Her sister detests poverty (unfortunate, since they are extremely poor), her father is a has been writer who's work is still studied in colleges in england and america, but brings in little to no income (he hasn't written a word in years) and her step mother is an eccentric (to say the least) painters model who communes naked with nature and finds the castle wonderfully romantic. Everyone in this book is human. they have flaws...selfishness, lazyness...insecurities, and their flaws only make them more endearing. When Cassandra's sister Rose meets an American millionair come to stay at a neighboring estate (actually, he's their landlord) she determines immediately that she will marry this man, Simon Cotton, whether she loves him or not. I wont say too much about the plot, because I don't want to ruin it, but suffice to say that this story is above all real. I can relate, just as my mother could, and anyone who has ever been in (unrequited) love will be able to relate. It's touching without being mushy, and trust me, you don't know how it's going to turn out, even if 2/3rds of the way through you think you do. On top of that, it's funny! you will be laughing out loud. Green hands, naked step moms, and ackward situations abound (there's a scene involving rose and a bearskin coat that is a classic) so don't expect it to be preachy. Just entertaining, touching, and fun."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I cannot think of a book which has made me laugh, cry, daydream, and fight the urge to finish reading instead of savoring each word as long as possible. The book works on so many levels, but I won't bother mentioning them. Mostly, it shows Cassandra developing her writing skills and maturing into a lovely sensible young woman. The descriptions are sometimes so breathtaking that I reread them and just closed my eyes to visualize what this place must be like. While I wish there were a chance that a movie could be made about it, so much would be lost without the words Cassandra writes.

Furthermore, my mother was forty-five, and she loved it just as much as I did. And, now that I think of it, so did my grandmother (sixty-eight, I believe).&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is an amazing novel set in the thirties, near the town of Godsend, somewhere in England. The book is told in the form of a journal; seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, whose best poem was written on top of the henhouse (and it wasn't a good one at that), has finally given up on rhyme and meter, and has decided that the best way to train herself into &quot;good writer&quot; position would be to keep a journal in her own very unique shorthand.Cassandra, her broody father, her eccentric stepmother Topaz, her older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen (who helps with the gardening and things) all live in a large house -- well, mostly castle, but a bit house as well -- with very little money and not much hope ... until two strangers show up at their door after their car has been stuck in the mud, claiming to have seen some spirits dancing around atop the battlements.Smith's style is whimsical at times, dead serious at others, but all the time managing to capture the reader's attention, as she captures the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first found this book in England and have read it twice since then.

Her lovely sister Rose,&quot; a pinkish person&quot;, is desperate to be married off, her father has become strangly antiscocial after his days as a best-selling author, and Topaz, her stepmother, is the very embodiment of eccentric. Cassandra herself is intelligent, dreamy and sometimes sarcastic, loved by Stephen, &quot;eighteen now, very fair and noble looking but his expression is just a fraction daft,&quot; who gives her plagiarized poems, but in love with someone else.

Dodie was born and raised in England (rather evident from this tale!), but wrote I Capture the Castle in the '40's while living in America. For some reason, ICtC has been out of print for many years. I join many of the literary populace in their cheers of gratefulness for the recent re-printing!I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen-year-old aspiring writer, who lives with her family in a rapidly deteriorating castle in the middle of the English countryside. ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a story, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her comments about the people in her life kept me constantly in stitches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published author; a man who everyone considers to be brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother-- though young enough to be a sister. Topaz is a nude modelist for &quot;great&quot; paintings and is invariably eccentric, down to her midnight romps &quot;communing with nature&quot; out in the country. Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, is a lamentable character; and Thomas, the brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen- the family man-of-all-work, and the Cotton Brothers- a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh unto impossible!If you want something light, humorous, and quick, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a very good time with I Capture the Castle.

Sometimes I think I can even smell the musty, dank hallways of the castle.

Most everyone agreed that it is one of the most beautiful, enjoyable novels ever written, but I was spurred to write this review after discovering a review by someone who ACTUALLY gave it two stars or something equally pathetic. Their reason: because \\"no book could ever live up to Lord of the Rings,\\" which they had just finished. For the record, this is not a book to be compared to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The differences between the two are astounding, one being that tLOtR is, albeit a well-done history and fantasy novel, stale and boring, especially compared to a book like ICtC, which really enchants the reader from start to finish. I read Tolkein's trilogy and enjoyed the imaginative goings-on, but I had to force myself to finish, to read the long boring passages saturated with history.Everyone should read the Lord of the Rings, and everyone should read I Capture the Castle.

In truth, though, it appears more vividly in the imagination that it ever could if it were made of mere stone. Seldom has a title of a book been so apropos.I would say more about Dodie Smith's portrayal of the characters but others have done so.

As it is, I will have to satisfy myself only by telling you that the first sentence is \\"I am writing this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" A more auspicious beginning I cannot imagine.A great part of what I enjoyed about this book was the humor. Cassandra's family gives new meaning to the term \\"dysfunctional\\" and her descriptions of the various members and their escapades are hilarious. But I appreciated the book equally for its serious parts and for the sensitive touch with which the main romance was unfolded. Cassandra's soul-searching is insightful and touching, and her rendition of the traditional teenage unrequited crush and subsequent angst is fresh and honest. Towards the end of the book, I started to get a little worried that the book's original light-hearted tone had gone forever, and that the book would end on a downer, but I was relieved to find that I was wrong. Speaking of the ending, it was neither complete nor entirely without a note of sadness, but I thought it exactly appropriate. It ended with hope, even if you're a cynical reader, and if (like me) you're a shamelessly sentimental reader who can squeeze a happy ending into even the tiniest crack given the chance, it ended with considerably more than hope. Thematically, the ending was perfect.For some reason, I keep wanting to say that Cassandra Mortmain is Anne Shirley for post-moderns, which I don't think is exactly right, but it's close. She did strike me as a character that many Green Gables fans will identify with. I Capture the Castle deals with a lot more complicated issues, especially in the interpersonal relationship department, whereas Anne's stories (and relationships) are much simpler and more straightforward. Cassandra is called upon to examine herself and others much more deeply than Anne ever does while Anne has more opportunity for innocent whimsy. Anyway, I think that people who identified with Anne as teens will identify just as strongly with Cassandra a few years later. I did, at any rate."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am not sure when first I read \\"I Capture the Castle\\". I believe I might have been in High School. I do know when I got my own copy of the book: in 1975, when I was twenty-five years old. That was 31 years ago...and I have read it every few years ever since I've had the joy of it's presence on my bookshelf. I shared it with my daugter when she was in High School, and it's one of her favorites, too. That is not to say this book is a \\"girly\\" book, or even a \\"romance\\". It's something altogether different. Ethereal, yet heart touchingly real. Imaginative, yet grounded and honest. It really is, very much, a journey of a young soul into self awareness, truth, and ultimately, spiritual and moral triumph. All this accomplished through a journal written by 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain, documenting the sometimes humorous, sometimes embarassing, sometimes touching and sometimes painfully profound events that occur during seven months in one momentous, and pivotal year. This is no \\"fairy tale\\". The image of the crumbling castle, and it's eccentric and complicated inhabitants isn't a careless or gratuitous one. Like in the fictional book \\"Jacob Wrestling\\", that the father of our heroine wrote years ago as his \\"one hit wonder\\"...there is a reason for everything in this book. The image of a \\"bear\\" \\"attacking\\" sister Rose, the \\"dead shoes\\", the \\"Shape\\" seen at a Midsummer's Eve observance. the pennies coming out of a 'phone in answer to \\"prayer\\"; the green of a liqueur against beautiful hair, a bowl and pitcher glimpsed in a window: all of it together forms a pattern that is crafted to imprint the book's message indeliably into a receptive reader's mind. Yet..it's all done so charmingly that one hardly realizes one has just had one's consciousness elevated. The reader may think he's merely being entertained....I am with those who believe \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a modern classic. The very fact, from the time I read it first, some 40 years ago, that it's images and charm has haunted me to this day is testament to it's validity and value. I will find myself somewhere, in some circumstance, and suddenly a correlating scene from the book pops into my head. As Cassandra's passage into womanhood leaves first one childhood dream, then another, behind...my heart squeezes with pain at the losses we all endure in our journey into adulthood. Yes, this is a wonderful book for a young person. But it's also for all ages, even someone old, like me. That is why I must go back to \\"The Castle\\" every few years, as I travel this road of life...and with every visit, I spot something new, learn something else, grow a little more...."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This intelligently written, playful, and all around delightful novel, set in mid-20th century England, was the answer to my prayers oh so long ago, when I was in the throes of teenage angst. Although it was written before I was born, it never struck me as being outdated or inaccessible. The heroine, Cassandra Mortmain, lives in a derelict medieval castle in the English countryside, with a motley assortment of family members. Hers is a distinctly bohemian, if not to say eccentric, household, but to me she seemed as real as my fellow classmates in New York's Greenwich Village. The frequently hilarious, frequently touching moments in the life of Cassandra and her circle--her father, a once-famous writer, her beautiful, dissatisfied sister Rose, her artist's-model stepmother Topaz, her precocious younger brother, and the family's faithful \\"servitor,\\" the incredibly handsome, lovelorn Stephen--make for entertaining reading of the best sort. Enter two wealthy, half-American brothers, one of whom actually owns the castle and the land it stands on, and the stage is set for romance (both requited and unrequited), misunderstandings, comedy, and Cassandra's own poignant coming of age. Dodie Smith, the author of \\"101 Dalmations,\\" combines wit with a sprightly prose style to produce an almost cinematic flow of imagery in the mind of the reader. For young women, age 13 and up, who have not grown hardened and blase on a diet of \\"Gossip Girl\\" type literature, this book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With blurbs from authors like J.K. Rowling and a huge following I was so excited to read I Capture The Castle. It promised to be a romance from another time, filled with whimsy and spunk and all that other good stuff they had in the mid-thirties. There was even an old-castle and a, possibly haunted, tower! All of the ingredients seemed to be there. Unfortunately I think I built my expectations up a bit more than I should have. It wasn't that I hated this book, in fact there were things I really loved about it. Let's start with those shall we? First of all I loved the style it was written in. The story is told through our main character, Cassandra's, journals. Her genuine and lovable voice lends itself well to the story as she describes her life living in a crumbling old castle with her eccentric family. Although she has seen years of poverty and neglect thanks to her writer father, she loves her family and enjoys life at the castle. Cassandra starts out as such an up-beat character. She sees the good in life and strives to see everyday as a new adventure. Along with Cassandra, there is an entire cast of lovable, if flawed, characters. There's her father, who hasn't written a word in 12 years but continues to lock himself away in his office each day, her stepmother (who insists her given name is Topaz and likes to dance naked in the rain), her older sister Rose, who is the definition of a drama queen and the two new Americans who have moved into the mansion down the road bringing an air of mystery and suspense along with them. The first half of the book was full of adventure and intrigue with these characters and I ate it up. I was sure that I would love them forever and that this would be a favorite book. Then things got messy.Now, I'm not talking about conflict. There's plenty of that from the beginning. Mostly what I'm referring to are the love triangles (yes multiple). I could have tolerated one, but everyone seemed to be in love with the wrong person and this was the main plot device for the majority of the book. Not only was it confusing, it was frustrating as hell. Everyone was going around being as selfish and stupid as possible with no concern for anyone or anything else and I just sat there wanting to throw the book at my wall. By the time I got to the ending I was so exhausted and upset that I didn't even really care what happened. No, that's not true, I did still care, but then Dodie Smith had to go and make sure that no one ended up where I wanted them too. I realize that Ms. Smith didn't do this as a personal affront to me, but it sure felt that way. I won't say that I hated this book, because I didn't. I could have even loved it if it weren't for so much nonsense in the middle. I could have dealt with the ending too, but I was so worn out that all I felt was frustration. So I'm giving this one three stars because the setting, characters and the beginning were all great. It just didn't quite live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoy reading historical fiction and England is one of my favorite places to read about. Throwing a castle in was just icing on the cake. Well written and engaging."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a reputed classic, which it took me some effort to land on the Kindle. It was reputedly revised endless times before publication, and is supposed to have been the Great Hope of its author. It is well-written, if well-written = very smooth, fairly clear transitions, strong narrative voice, memorable setting and characters. The central trope, the Young Girl's Bildungsroman, has been around since *LIttle Women* and *What Katy Did*, and it seems rather obvious that the writer has gone for Oddest Version of the Young Girl Possible, a competition very evident in some of the (English) YA i've recently read - Joan Aiken's Dido Twite, Eva Ibbotson's Countesses, for-ex, but happening in a lot of other places too. If your Young Girl isn't odd, it seems she isn't interesting.Cassandra Mortmain certainly comes across as odd, from her opening sentence, written ostensibly sitting in the kitchen sink, but then her whole family appears odd, from her reputed genius novelist father to her supposedly gold-digging sister, and their Castle is even odder. There's another recent narrative solution present - the arrival before an impoverished English family of some Rich, Young, Handsome Americans - Pride and Prejudice for the Post-War Period. *Castle* does present the husband-chasing of at least one Mortmain girl more unabashedly than Austen did, though of course, that turns out to have been a mistake, and she actually elopes with somebody else, while the protagonist/narrator (sort of) captures the main matrimonial prize.Cassandra's whimsical voice, poverty-stricken circumstances and general comedy of weirdness are taking generally, but I'm glad the ending has an unexpected twist, because by then I was thoroughly out of charity with the book over its treatment of the other Competing but Utterly Ineligible Suitor. This is the young Englishman who's been living with the family, trading his orphaned lack of hearth or kin for playing general dogsbody while mooning after Cassandra. It's made plain from square one that he is Not Suitable - a sudden and very ugly extrusion of classism that is startling in this context.Unlike Simon the Gooseboy in Aiken's Willoughby Chase books, however, Stephen never apotheosizes into a nobleman and discovers an ancestral heritage. Instead, after attempting to serve Cassandra as devotedly as a dog, he's treated like one. He's very handsome, so eventually a fast lady photographer takes him off to photograph (and possibly seduce) and then introduces him into filmdom. Whereupon the Mortmains let him pack up his little chest - given to him but a non-Mortmain - leave his squalid little Castle room, and, despite his even having travelled clear up to London to help Cassandra in extremis over her American, walk out of their lives without so much as a Thank you, let alone any more concrete keepsake.I personally was so angry over the way Stephen was treated, by both characters and author, that this book went very close to bottoming out on my review scale. Classism is to be expected in Austen (who seldom shows it because the really Lower Classes never behave like humans in her work) but what's it doing in somebody writing after WWII? Especially as blatant and unremarked as this lot.Wherefore, so far as I'm concerned, Miss Cassandra Mortmain may have captured the castle but all she captured from me was a large helping of disgust."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Now that I've reread this, I can honestly say I am still in love with it. I first read I Capture the Castle when I was about Cassandra's age, and it spoke to me on such a deep, personal level. Years and years have gone by since, but a new book club gave me the opportunity to read it again... and I shall be forever grateful.Dodie Smith created such a magnificent piece of wonder when she wrote this. Being (much) older than the first time I read it, I feel like I can sympathize more with Rose and everything she goes through... and causes to happen. I think I remember hating her for being such a heartless wretch of a human being during my first read. Now, I can commiserate with her despair and wanting to help out her family, even at the cost of marrying someone she doesn't love. Stephen, on the other hand, remains a character I feel kind of sorry for. He's so devoted to Cassandra. When he finally realizes she doesn't and will never love him the way he would want her to, he is devastated, but he accepts it eventually. He just wants her to be happy, even if that means she ends up with someone else. Stephen really shines at that point, in my opinion. He finally takes control of his own life and makes decisions for himself. I know I definitely prefer this Stephen over the lovesick puppy hoping for attention. Topaz also shone more the second time around. I fear I felt she was just a silly woman with no real substance to her at first. She really is a strong and brave character and she is quite selfless, though a little eccentric. I did find myself getting quite upset with Mr. Mortmain. It made me angry that his loving family was being practically ignored and forced to live in such horrible poverty. I believe he should have sucked it up and helped support his family... taken responsibility for their misfortunes. Stupid man.During the book club, it was much talked about and despised that nothing really resolved itself. Cassandra didn't get to be with Simon. Rose and Neil got a happy ending, but still. Does Mr. Mortmain ever finish his book? Does Stephen go on to be a famous actor? Does Simon ever get over his heartbreak, forget Rose and embrace Cassandra? So many questions, but only an open-ended story to tease you. Frankly, I love the open end. I know full well what I imagine happens to these characters and I think the author was quite right in giving the reader an opportunity to create it. I suppose it would have been nice to have confirmation, but then it wouldn't feel genuine, in my opinion. Cassandra is more or less content with where her story ends, so why shouldn't we, right? I mean, not everything gets tied up in a neat bow in real life. Cassandra, being the intelligent, brave girl that she is, knows this.Also during our book club meeting, there were complaints about too much scenery talk. Personally, being an extremely visual person, I loved it. I guess I'm just a different kind of reader from those in my group. Also, I thought it went well with the format of the novel. Cassandra wants to be a writer and she's writing a journal as a way to practice. Naturally, she is going to write about what she knows, hence why there is so much about the castle itself. You can also see her mature through her writing so much of what surrounds her. Our heroine really does find her voice and is able to \\"capture the castle\\" quite perfectly.I Capture the Castle is a beautifully written coming-of-age story that is sure to continue to be as relevant today as it has been since its publication in 1948. I simply love this novel!A favorite quote: \\"The thought came to me that perhaps it is the loving that counts, not the being loved in return - that perhaps true loving can never know anything but happiness.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It certainly isn't a bodice ripper.

I finally picked it up a couple of days ago and could hardly put it down at all. It is delightful! But oh, I wish it would have continued. I wish there was a second book to continue Cassandra's story. This is a lovely, lovely, laugh-out-loud book that touched my heart so much!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a classic coming of age story with a memorable, loveable heroine. If I'd read this when I was fourteen I would have grown up loving Casandra Mortmain just as much as Jo Marsh or Elizabeth Bennett. Her first-person narration is both laugh-out-loud funny and innocently heartbreaking at the same time. A bit Jane Eyre and a bit Pride and Prejudice, Smith uses the elements of both the gothic novel and the comedy of mannors to unique effect. The subtle criticisms of modern art and literature that are woven throughout the story are both funny and true. More importantly, I couldn't put this book down and was sorry when it was over. The characters are memorable and their world is enchanting. It's feminist and romantic at the same time. And the ending, without giving anything away, is absolutely perfect. This is the rare book I've read as an adult that feels as if it's always been a favorite. So glad to have discovered it now!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Warm, wise and witty, a lovely (and quite funny) story of young love in a crumbling English castle.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wow- I loved this story from the very beginning to the last page. Cassandra is one of those great characters and I loved reading her journals. The story begins with Cassandra's family in poverty, her father wrote an important book many years ago and has not written anything since. The family is out of money and hope when they get a new owner to the castle they rent. The new owner, Simon, is a rich, handsome young man who comes to visit the family with his brother Neil. After a bad start the brothers come to enjoy spending time with Cassandra's family and Simon falls in love with Cassandra's beautiful sister Rose.The story follows Cassandra through many difficulties including dealing with Stephen, the boy who has loved her for a very long time, helping her father get through his writer's block, supporting her sister, and finding her own way through the feelings of first love. It is a delightful story told with humor, insight, and love by a very intelligent 17 year old girl.The setting of the old, crumbling castle is perfect and the characters are entertaining. Cassandra's father gives a whole new meaning to the word eccentric! I would highly recommend this delightful coming-of-age story, it was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this Brit lit coming of age story more than the 2nd half. The unique narrative voice of the character Cassandra is very intelligent and charming throughout. The resourcefulness of the Mortmain family living in poverty and need in a crumbling castle was related in a humorous way. However, the fact can't be ignored that they are living in poverty and want because their one-hit wonder author father has not produced any source of income in quite some time, and appears to have no motivation to do so. Although most of the characters are flawed in some way, some of the father's flaws are a bit darker in nature.The book was written at a time when women had few options to make their way in life, and some of the character's motivations and attitudes reflect that. From a more modern perspective, some of the character's attitudes were a bit grating at times. This is especially true of sister Rose's desperation to marry for material security, and her utter lack of any other skills other than singing or looking pretty.There was at least one part that I found laugh out loud funny involving a foiled attempt to evade a social encounter, some old beaver and bear furs, a case of mistaken identity, and a pitchfork. That alone was worth the read."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This charming, old-fashioned novel is by the author of &quot;101 Dalmations.&quot; I enjoyed it greatly and feel that it would be most appreciated by romantic teenage girls and ladies who remember it from their childhood. It is a sweet tale of a family very similar in nature to the family in George S. Kaufmann's &quot;You Can't Take It With You.&quot;However, I did find the plotline regarding the lovelives of the sisters to be trite and taken directly from the melodramas of the 1930's and 40's. It is a sweet book, but there isn't anything new or unexpected in the story."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thought this book was truly wonderful, even if the ending was a bit sudden.

That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy. I can't say that I'm really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiriting-- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that wasn't a very good poem. I have decided my poetry is so bad that I musn't write any more of it.&quot;So opens &quot;I Capture the Castle,&quot; an absolutely delightful story by Dodie Smith, who is also the author of &quot;101 Dalmations,&quot; popularized by Disney's film adaptations. Dodie was born and raised in England (a fact that is rather evident from this tale!), but wrote &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; in the '40's while living in America. For some reason, ICtC has been out of print for many years. I join many of the literary populace in their cheers of gratefulness for the recent re-print!&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen-year-old aspiring writer, who lives with her family in a rapidly deteriorating castle in the middle of the English countryside. ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a STORY, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her exceedingly truthful comments about the people her life kept me constantly in stiches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published-author; a man who everyone considers quite brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's excentric step-mother, though young enough to be a sister. She is a nude modelist and engages in all sorts of interesting romps, including &quot;communining with nature&quot; at midnight, also in the buff! Rose, Cassandra's sister, is a lamentable character, and Thomas, her brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen, family man-of-all-work; and the Cotton Brothers, a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh impossible!If you want something quick, light, and humorous, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a VERY good time with &quot;I Capture the Castle.&quot;"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this based on two or three articles in the press and was somewhat hesitant about it on that basis -- after all, hype is never trustworthy.

I enjoyed particularly Casssandra's father, although I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed his books!

The Mortmains live in England in a drafty old castle, without any source of regular income. In her witty and wonderfully colorful diary entries, Cassandra bemoans the horrible meals, the awful clothes and the bitter cold that they all must endure. She writes with bravado and style, and she is a most endearing heroine. Her family is not ordinary. James Mortmain, her father, is a formerly successful author who wrote one book and then abruptly stopped writing. In spite of his family's extreme poverty, he refuses to put pen to paper. Cassandra's stepmother, Topaz, is a former artist's model who is still gorgeous and occasionally outrageous. Cassandra and Rose decide that Rose, the older sister, must marry someone wealthy in order to escape their wretched impoverished state. Fortunately, two brothers, Simon and Neil Cotton, come into their lives and the inevitable romantic entanglements ensue. Most of the book is engrossing and funny. However, the book is a little too long. The last fifty to seventy-five pages drag a bit. All in all, Smith has created a delightful heroine, whose fresh and irreverent voice is a breath of fresh air. I recommend this book as a light and entertaining diversion."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading a glowing report of this book's reissue in my newspaper and the raving reviews of other readers on this website, I was dying to read I Capture the Castle. And I enjoyed it at first--I loved Cassandra and could definitely identify with her. But it all fell apart for me when she fell in love with Simon. Maybe it's because I don't like that name, maybe it's because I couldn't get the image of his ugly beard out of my head even after he shaved it off, but I think the main reason I was disappointed was that I never quite understood what she liked about him in the first place--he seemed nice and benevolent and all, but hardly desperately attractive. I'm disappointed to be disappointed though!!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was not terribly impressed by this story. It was well written with wonderful character development of the narrator, Cassandra, however the overall plot was dull. I think what really threw me was the very beginning of the novel, when Cassandra and her family describe their overwhelming poverty, and then they all come to the conclusion that not a single person in the house can go out and work to make money. Why not? What are they doing with their time? Cassandra daydreams and writes in her journal, I have no idea what Rose is up to, Thomas goes to school, Topaz keeps house, the father does crosswords and mopes all day about not being able to write, and the only person who does go out to make money is the orphan serving boy who shouldn't even be giving the family money in the first place.Instead of self sufficient pluck to get the family out of poverty, the plot revolves around her sister Rose snaring a rich man, which in turn leads to the family's fortunes turning around (and a lot of other stuff happens).It reminded me a lot of \\"A tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" but what made that such a wonderful read was the tenacity of the family, never giving up to pull themselves out of poverty through hard work and determination and not waiting around for things to be handed to them."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What I enjoyed about the story was mostly how it evoked other favorites of mine - this tale of a girl coping with poverty, an eccentric family, and her own budding sexuality is a little Wuthering Heights (without the melodrama) meets Pride and Prejudice (without the social satire) meets Judy Bloom (without the happy ending).I found the story to be sweet, entertaining, and well-told, if not particularly memorable. Like a slow walk through the English countryside on a summer day, the narrator is in no great rush to tell the story, taking time to wander down lanes that don't ultimately contribute much to the story (Cassandra's flirtation with religion, the history of castles, psychoanalysis, etc.) but that are scenic enough.However, as much as I enjoyed the stroll, the impatient American in me longed eventually to arrive at some destination. Instead, the narrator leaves us at a fork in the road, watching as Cassandra looks longingly down the path she yearns to take and then down the path she ought to take. Not sure if it's the author's attempt at realism, or symbolic of Cassandra's emerging maturity/wisdom, or just a British thing - but did find the ending a little unsatisfying. Not enough, however, to entirely detract from what was, in the main, a pleasant and worthwhile journey.(See, Cassandra, just how useful metaphors can be?)"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Cassandra's lovely prose far transcends her age in the book.

It's one of those books where you feel a little sad once you reach the end because you've become attached to the characters. A lovely book"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wow. I have read this book twice and it only gets better. I am only 14 but this is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It explores the life of 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain through her diary. It is a coming of age story as Cassandra learns what it is to love and to hate. Her life changes over this period of a year. She is put out into the real world (she lived a sheltered life in a castle in the countryside of England) and forced to rethink her semi-naive ideals of life. I really identified with Cassandra when I read it. She wants to become a writer, just as I do. There are some absolutely beautiful passages in this book about what it means to write, and the stumbling blocks, which are totally true. It also explores the mishaps and adventures of love, and how you can lose your head, and hurt others as well as yourself. It has an extremely poignant message about true love and also the affects of fooling yourself into love for the begiuling riches. Dodie Smith has written a masterpiece, a classic, in my opinion. I think that every young woman should read this book and learn the lessons it has to teach about love, friendship, strife, and life in general. I don't want to sound Cheesy at all but that's what it is. If there was one book that I have to say influenced the way I looked at life and my writing the most, it would probably be this one.GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of the owner of Bookhampton in East Hampton, NY for my 14 year old daughter.

Tonight being that date I told a friend about this treasure, and am amazed to find it actually in print and available. I have read of Cassandra's adventures since I was her age through my own now (31). Each time I read I am struck by the forcefulness and poignancy of the writing, at how we as readers watch Cassandra grow into her strength as a writer and into her pain as a young woman. The scene in which Cassandra sits in the church during a storm (&quot;I am a chaos inside a stillness inside a chaos&quot;) and ponders the relation of spirituality and human-kindness I review my own sense of spirit and self. Details, such as the color of the liquers, the shadows of the castle, the green die in the tub, the packed lunches for Mortmain in the castle, illustrate the power of Smith as a writer of tremendous force-- most powerful in her ability to have these details grow from Cassandra's pen (or pencil stub). I gave my first copy away to a good friend for her graduation, then received another used copy from a good friend on my first birthday away from home. I have never known a world which I wish to share more than that of the castle, England in the 30s, the world of I Capture the Castle."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Most of these reviews sounds as if they're written by teenagers -- let me sign in -- I'm 72, first met the book when I was 25, totally enchanted.

Once I did, once I read that fantastic first sentence, I was hooked. Since then, I have read it at least once every year, and my mother and her friend Polly and I have amused ourselves for many hours casting the movie we'd like to make of it (Gabriel Byrne for Mortmain, Sean Bean for The Swain . . . ?).It is a charming, clever, intelligent book, with a heroine who is three-dimensional and extremely sympathetic. Its cast of characters are the family and friends you always wished you had, its love story satisfying in its open-endedness.If you know a smart, literary teenaged girl (or if you are or were one), buy the book.

Cassandra, the main character, becomes like a dear friend as you read the three journals through which we see her life.

Her charm and her romantic view of the happenings surrounding her and her family draw one into this beautifully written book. When you're through, you'll want to have a Midsummer's festival, just like Cassandra.I try to read this book at least once a year- it is one that you will never tire of, and one which you wish would continue long after it is over!

It started out a perfectly beautiful little escapist story, filled with scrumptious images and a romance with life....The problem came when the author tried--exceedingly heavyhandedly--to turn it into a life lesson. The reader is driven up through luscious scenery to the top of a mountain, made spectator to a breathtaking sunset, and then dropped off a cliff. If you do insist on reading it, go back after you've finished and write a new ending."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle is the story of an English family living in poverty in a castle that was leased due to the long ago success of the patriarch's novel, Jacob Wrestling. It is written in diary form from the point of view of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. Their lives get turned upside-down with the arrival of the American Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, the new owners of the property. Cassandra chronicles the changes within the family and home for the next six months.Initially, I loved the story. I found Cassandra's narrative to be extremely charming, and I felt the book was well written. As it was written in 1948 and set in the 1930s, a lot of the subject matter in the book was extremely progressive, i.e. Cassandra's musings on whether she is an atheist or not. I cannot seem to recall a book I've ever read from that time period that was so candid about such a controversial topic, which I really appreciated.I also loved all the characters in the book. I felt that they were flawed in a very natural sense, very much like people that one would know. My favorite character was Stephen; he was like a knight in shining armor for the Mortmain family.The things I didn't really care for was the way Cassandra turned about halfway through the book. The story got convoluted and started becoming trite, with subplots that really didn't seem to make sense. Cassandra goes from being an interesting, intriguing character that I really wanted to know more about to a character that is simpering, insipid, and contradictory. Having said that, though, one forgets that she's seventeen, so her wishy washy, over-romanticized nature con be slightly forgiven. Only slightly.The ending is ambiguous and may leave some people thirsting for more of a story; however, as it is a journal, there will be some loose ends. It is unpredictable, which I appreciate.While things didn't go the way I wanted or expected, this was still an excellent story with excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Along with the rest of the literary world, I recently rediscovered this classic after it was republished having sat in obscurity for years. And was promptly blown away. For any lovers of Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, or even The Age of Innocence, this is a must-read. The plot is Austen's, the characters Montgomery's, and the setting and bittersweet flavor Wharton's. Written as the journal of a cynical but essentially dreamy 17-year-old, it depicts the turning point in both her life and the lives of her family, as they spiral toward decay and complete poverty, the only hope of redemption being offered by the arrival of wealthy, good-looking neighbors next door. Don't expect to find any Mr. Darcys in this book - the Cotton brothers are much more thinly sketched and truth be told despisable heroes than that famous character, but the book rides on the wistful, witty, breathtakingly clear voice and character of Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine who burns in the memory long after the book has been put down, and as such the book is more than worth reading. Doesn't quite achieve the peak of lofty classicism of other more famous books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice, but a lovely story which skitters on the edges of childhood, romance, heartbreak, and growing up with grace and near-brilliance. For a book to be a true classic it must contain 1)intensely vibrant, complex, and individual characters, particularly the main one 2)a well-constructed and finely drawn plot, that brings nothing extra in and 3)that extra spark, of style or vision, that lifts a book into something that appeals on some level to all humanity. I Capture the Castle has a good dose of all three but not quite enough. On the first charge, while Cassandra herself fits the bill as nearly as a 17-year old can(unfortunately by the very nature of the age given to her she doesn't quite have the maturity or decisiveness of a woman) most of the other characters feel either over-the-top(her family) or under-drawn(Rose and the Cotton brothers). On the second, there is such a thing as too much detail, and Dodie Smith falls into that trap. On the third, she nearly, nearly reaches that level, particularly in the brilliant ending scene, but not quite; the wider emotions - hate, fear, and the deeper vision, is missing. So, in the end, while this remains a minor classic - the story of a year or so in the life of a girl - it's a brilliant and heartbreaking one. \\"Three more lines left. I love you.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Cassandra keeps a journal as an exercise to practice writing and she records the events that occur over the period of about one year. She is a 17-year-old girl who lives in a rundown, but romantic castle in England with her family. Her father, James Mortmain wrote a novel years ago that was wildly successful and earned alot of money, but he hasn't written anything since and now the family is impoverished to the point of hunger. Cassandra is kept company by her older sister Rose and her eccentric stepmother Topaz while her younger brother Tom makes infrequent appearances because he is mostly in town at school. And then there is the servant Stephen, an extremely good-looking young man devoted to Cassandra. He so hates to see her hungry that he takes a job to contribute his earnings to the household. However, the father discourages any interest Cassy might have in Stephen because he is from a different social class.The real excitement starts about 100 pages into the book when the Cotton family arrives at the nearby Scoatney estate. Neil and Simon are wealthy Americans and Rose sets her sites on Simon because he is the heir. Anyone who has ever been poor can somewhat relate to the girls predicament. Rose's desire to marry wealth would not only ensure enough to eat and buy pretty new clothes for herself, it would ensure the same for her family (since her father shows no signs of changing and Simon is kind and generous).I think young adults would enjoy this book because the rest of the novel is about young love. The relationships lack real depth and the ending is somewhat open ended which some will like and others will find disappointing. I can't really imagine being 17 or 20 and being as nave about boys as Cassy and Rose, but I suppose things used to be very different. The real charm of this novel is the enchanting atmosphere of the castle as depicted through Cassandra's rose-colored glasses. Most of the characters seem shallow and we didn't see enough of Stephen, the only person I actually admired, but somehow Cassy's rendering of the whining characters makes them likeable."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a &quot;small&quot; book.

Her father is an writer, of real reknown in literary circles (think Joyce), but hasn't written anything in a very long time. A wealthy American family moves into the castle's main house and their lives change profoundly.The book was originally written in the early 20th century, but its insights about a young girl and her observations of the world and people around her are timeless.This is a lovely book that was well-deservedly reissued and I recommend it to everyone.

Writing in her beloved journal, Cassandra, an aspiring writer, creates a clear picture of her castle home and her brilliantly bizarre family; genius novelist father James with a case of intense writer's block, sweet, bohemian stepmother Topaz, elder sister Rose and servant boy Stephen.The novel picks up pace when the wealthy Cotton brothers move from America to their English estate, very close to Cassandra's castle. This sets life into hectic motion for all the family, particularly Cassandra and Rose. As Cassandra chronicles the goings on, she gradually, gracefully grows up. Ultimately, this is a story about the joy and pain of love, particularly when that love is unrequited.While there are moments when characters behave, well, randomly (why in the world DOES Simon kiss Cassandra?), the book has a quirky, lovable charm and beauty. Cassandra's voice is fresh and unaffected, and the characters and surroundings are finely sketched.

My co-worker had it on the library reference desk. She said it was the next book in her book discussion group. After she told me a little about it I decided to read it. Then, I had second thoughts. So, I read reviews of it on Amazon. I still wasn't sure if I wanted to read it when I read that people said it was like Jane Austen would write if she was around today. Even though I'm a former English major and a librarian, I will commit the great heresy and admit I don't like Jane Austen. She's too hoity-toity for me. But, then, in a review I read the opening couple of sentences: &quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.&quot; This is such a great and intriguing opening that I had to know what was going on. I'm glad I decided to read it. It is a delightful novel, especially describing the poverty the Mortmains experience living in the castle. (You don't associate living in a castle with poverty! That, right there, makes the book different.) I have to admit, it does rather read like a modern Jane Austen and yet I didn't mind all the talk about who loved whom and who was going to marry whom. I also enjoyed sharing the challenge of getting James Mortmain to go back to his writing. It's a very good read with interesting characters, including the castle itself.

Cassandra, the narrator and protagonist of I Capture the Castle takes the same approach with her description of the Cottons, who are visiting from America.

She lives here with her sister Rose, her brother Thomas, her father James, her stepmother Topaz, and the family's live-in helper Stephen Colly. They live a life of genteel poverty, quite often not having enough income to feed the family. James Mortmain has a more-than-serious case of writer's block having once traveled and lectured on his critically aclaimed book. Now the family has no other income than that contributed by the hard working Stephen who would gladly hand over all that he owns to win Cassandra's favor. In the opening scene, Cassandra discusses the family's poverty and the fact that they have sold off nearly every stick of furniture in order to make ends meet. As the family sits down to tea, Cassandra writes of the unexpected treat of having eggs. She exclaims, &quot;I was only expecting bread and margarine for tea, and I don't get as used to margarine as I could wish. I thank heaven there is no cheaper form of bread than bread.&quot;This book is told in first person and is the journal that Cassandra keeps over the course of a year. We learn her fears and dreams, and we get to know her family through her eyes. When two handsome, wealthy, and exotic Americans show up to claim their birthright, Cassandra and Rose are both thrown into their first encounter with romantic love. Cassandra tells a sweet and touching story woven through with a great deal of humor which keeps this story from becoming dull and whining. We literally get to read Cassandra's march from being an awkward girl to developing into a charming young woman making her mark on the world.As trite as it might sound, this is truly an enchanting book. I kept thinking that the author was doing such a remarkable job of creating an authentic atmosphere with the dialogue, clothing, and current events of the time. Then I found out that the book was originally written in the 1940s which isn't a far leap from the 30s setting of the book! This is also penned by the author who wrote One Hundred and One Dalmations. I recommend this for anyone who has no problems reading books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. While this is certainly less stuffy than the &quot;classics,&quot; it is nonetheless a treat to read.(reviewer: mellion108 from Michigan)"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the nicest, sweetest, loveliest books I have ever read. Absolutely charming...and I haven't finished it yet! Like any good book, I am torn between not wanting it to end and wanting to do nothing but curl up with it.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was recommended to me and I am forever thankful that I bought it. Through the diaries of a teenage girl named Cassandra Mortmain, the reader has the opportunity to discover the Mortmain's style of living in their old, broken-down castle. James Mortmain, reknown author of Jacob Wrestling, suddenly stopped writing and spends his days in the gatehouse, reading detective novels. After Cassandra and Rose's mother died, James decided to marry a woman who was at the same time excentric, peculair and overly obsessed with nudity: Topaz. Topaz posed for artists', but did not really enjoy it and rarely received any money for posing. With no income whatsoever, it would take a miracle for the Mortmain family to continue living.However, thing slowly changed: Stephen, the Mortmain's servant and Cassandra's admirer, received a job at Four Stones. This gave the family a bit more financial freedom, but nothing major happened until they met the Cottons'. Simon Cotton took possession of Scoatney Hall, and, in this case, the castle, since the Mortmain only had a 40 year lease on the castle. But Simon didn't mind that the Mortmain's couldn't pay their rent; in fact, he was so honoured of meeting James Mortmain that Simon frequently came to the house to talk to the family. Neil Cotton, Simon's brother, was also there, but less present then Simon was.As the story unfolds, things seem promising for the family: Rose is engaged to Simon. However, things suddenly go wrong, as first love often does. A surprising ending, with a witty and lovable narrator and a perfect length for the book. What more can a reader ask for?I find this is a great book for teenagers and prepares them for the often deceiving ending of their first relationship. It was very well written and inspired me to start a journal, just like Cassandra did. It makes readers who have never experienced love realize that it is not as beautiful as is often perceived to be in fairy tales. With a zest of rustic, mediaeval feel snd a modern twist, this book is something that will be cherished and passed on from generation to generation."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Here is a book you can &quot;live in&quot; and enjoy all the tears and laughter right along with this wonderful family.

I was unprepared, however, for how deeply I felt about it. This is a book to savor, although I found it hard to pace myself. Smith's book is as satisfying as a Jane Austen novel and as funny as the Adrain Mole diaries by Sue Townsend."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Have you ever had lots of people tell you that you *have* to see this great movie, only to go and wonder what they were talking about? That's how I feel about this book. My expectations were so high after reading the reviews here, that I was expecting this to be one of my favorite books of all time. And although it did not live up to the hype, I still thoroughly enjoyed this engaging book -- I just didn't *love* it.The story takes place in a more innocent time, in a lonely and dilapidated castle in England, where the impoverished Mortmain family lives. The narrator is the younger daughter of a once-successful author, and one of the sheer joys of this novel is the narrative voice -- it is charming and youthful, and wise yet perplexed in a way that intelligent young people can be -- remarkable since the author was in her 50s when she wrote it! This was also playwright Dodie Smith's first novel; often a playwright has trouble capturing the natural flow of conversation and description, but Smith accomplishes both here.Another strength is that the author, like Alfred Hitchcock, does not *tell* so much as *show*. Related as diary entries, and therefore more intimate than straight narrative, illustrative anecdotes immerse the reader in the state of mind of the narrator, Cassandra: we are as confused by her father's peculiar behavior as she is, we do not know whether or not sister Rose really loves her fiancee, we do not know whether or not Stephen would be a desirable beau for our heroine. Late in the book, Cassandra's father develops a theory that readers create and discover as they read, and Dodie Smith has ensured that we experience this as well as read about it.The Mortmains are complex -- stepmother Topaz is hard-working and kind, if a bit shallow; Rose is dramatic and moody, but also brave. Other characters, particularly the two American brothers who inherit the castle, are not as three-dimensional, and we are never as interested in them as we are in the English characters.The ending is lovely -- no neat resolution here. Instead, the reader is left to conjecture about the future of the Mortmain family based on what we know about them, and thanks to the talents of the author, we know a great deal and care enough to wonder."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is about a 17 year old girl in England living with her eccentric and impoverished family in a castle that her author father bought when he received money from writing an acclaimed novel called \\"Jacob Rising\\".However, since the death of their mother, Cassandra Mortmain and her siblings, Rose and Thomas, have lived with their father and stepmother, Topaz, in poverty. Their father, Mr. Mortmain, is down on his luck and seems to have writer's block or possibly have suffered a nervous breakdown. Whatever his problems are nobody in the household works and they are selling off the furnishings and artwork from Belmotte Castle where they live.New neighbors move in to an estate near the Mortmain estate and soon Rose Mortmain is engaged to on of the American sons. The Mortmains are soon receiving monetary aid for their predicament from the Cotton's.Cassandra Mortmain chronicles the Mortmain's life in her journal. Her chronicles make up the book, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" and the story is fairly tedious at times. The story kept my interest since I wanted to find out how Rose and Cassandra handled their lives and also what would happen with their father. The ending was unsatisfactory for me. I did not find this quite as enchanting as other reviewers did."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is sort of a Gone With The Wind type. I loved it so much, and the end was so heart-breaking and wonderful at the same time.

I cry even thinking about this book. It's like you become Cassandra, and feel the way she does about Simon. This is the most wonderful book of all time."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I kept reading this book hoping it would get more interesting. I rarely give up on books but after 120 pages I HAD to send this one to Goodwill!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I finished reading I Captured the Castle, I couldn't get it out of my head. The characters came to life in the 1930s of the English countryside.The narrator is a precocious 14-year-old. Perhaps I felt something for this kind of strong female pubescent lead character. Cassandra Mortmain narrates her family's travails in her notebook and keeps a journal to chronicle the eccentric activities of her father, the essential paper tiger. A one-hit-wonder with an obfuscating literary book published many years ago, Cassandra's father fails as a breadwinner and the females in the family conspire to generate household income. Their best option is marrying off Cassandra's older sister to the new rich American neighbor.This premise doesn't reveal the surprise and ambiguous ending to the tale, and it is all about the means towards a better end that makes it a fun and light summer read. What lingers long after the reading is the way Dodie Smith wrote about the confusions of first loves and how one loves another who doesn't return the affection and how another loves you and you can't reciprocate. Confusing? She captures that female whirlspinning sensation remarkably and it seems so timeless.The male characters are three-dimensional and Cassandra's younger brother Stephen wins my heart. So too the young male servant orphaned into their family; Cassandra is not taken with his godlike beauty and finds him a bit daft.The father character is so fantastic that I won't give much away. He is a portrait of so many tortured writers who will never be authors. A widower, once accused of threatening to kill his wife with a butter knife and sent to prison, he remarried an aesthetic muse in Topaz, a beauty whose images adorned the walls of museums. But he hasn't written a second book. He doesn't do anything but read cheap detective novels all day long. Now a penniless country bumpkin instead of a London diva, Topaz cannot arouse him to write. It is the American widow who arrives and intellectually stimulates him to change his behavioral oddities and replace them with other peculiarities.I am reminded of the same kind of writing agility of Willa Cather in her depiction of the professor in The Professor's House. The skill required to convey the gender and age and human frailties of these men is impressive for any writer. Each character has a distinctive voice and personality.Cassandra and her brother conspire with insights derived from the new fangled theory proposed by Freud to make their father work. Cassandra can't help but want to free her sister from a loveless marriage to support the family because she has fallen in love with her sister's fiancee. If only her father would make a living!It's Parent-Trap meets Petticoat Junction on a Monty Python set. Hilarious."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read this book many many years ago (hate to tell you how many) because I'd read a blurb somewhere that the movie was scheduled to be made with Hayley Mills (I can only imagine if that fabulous film had ever come to fruition). It never materialized, unfortunately--but the book itself almost made up for it. I've probably reread it 100 times over the years and it still remains one of my favorites--not only because of the lyrical, descriptive prose but the beautiful images of England it conjured up in my mind.

Cassandra Mortmain chronicles each event at Godsend Castle with such a distinct detail. Her narration of her exciting life is very readable and enjoyable. Dodie Smith obviously had a strong connection with this wonderful character.The plot should not be discussed in too much detail because it takes so many turns. Cassandra's descriptions of the characters in her life and how she interacts with those characters is as delightful as her situation. A seventeen year-old girl living with her older sister, eccentric stepmother, and unusual father in a dilapidated castle in pre-war England? How could I resist such a romantic setting. Cassandra's story gives us a very unique look at the people in her life, and what unique people they are! The American Cotton family, the bashful Stephen, the mysterious father. We are given a thoughtful look into her life. Instantly, I won Cassandra's attention. I took interest in her thoughts and experiences. Her voice is wonderful, her experiences are unique, and her story is delightful. I was glad to have met her. I am not yet fifteen, and I heartily congratulate the reissue of this gem of a book.

I read it as a girl in the 90's. Through three generations, &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; has been--and still is--our favorite book. I am overjoyed to see that it has been brought back to print. It has been long, long overdue."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Plain and simple: I ADORED I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith. I fell in love with the unusual and artless Cassandra. I fell in love with her entire eccentric family: her selfish writer-father; her beautiful artistic stepmother, Topaz; her shallow sister, Rose; and her little brother, Tom. I fell in love with poor but gorgeous Stephen. And I most definitely fell in love with the decrepit castle in the remote English countryside. But then I'm a romantic.I think part of the reason that I Capture the Castle charmed me so much was because certain elements of it reminded me of two of my favorite books and their heroines: Anne of Green Gables and Pride and Prejudice.I Capture the Castle is set in England in the 1930s. Cassandra's family has been living in the moldy castle for many years without having paid any rent. They have no income coming in because no one works. Sometimes there is a royalty check from the publisher because Cassandra's father once wrote a highly acclaimed and important novel which is still being taught in universities. The problem is, he hasn't published anything since. He has been shutting himself off in his room to supposedly \\"write\\"; everyone indulges is strange behavior because they're hoping for more of his greatness to come forth. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, does her best to take care of everyone, but a life of poverty is a far cry from when she used to be an artist's model in London. Rose hates the castle and having no money and is determined to get out being poor by any means possible.Cassandra, ironically, is writing up a storm. While her famous father is blocked, she fills notebook after notebook about her family and her sharp and lyrical observations of their lives. You might think that living in such isolation with so little wouldn't have much cause for her to write but some of the funniest sections have to do with how they try to make do with what they have. However, things soon take an exciting turn when two American brothers stumble upon the castle and its peculiar inhabitants.\\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring--I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that isn't a very good poem. I have decided that my poetry is so bad that I musn't write any more of it.\\"Characters fall in love but not with those whom they should; hearts are broken and there are no neat and tidy conclusions. All throughout, Cassandra's pure voice chronicles every occurrence with such candor, heart, and insight that reading I Capture the Castle was a magical experience.The 2003 movie is wonderful and does capture the book very well. Plus the one and only Bill Nighy as Cassandra's father is perfect casting!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a fun, charming little book, written in a sort of loose diary format from the perspective of a girl living in 1930's rural England. Most of its appeal is in Cassandra's voice, which is very strong, and its portrayal of a coming-of-age story that's enjoyable and lighthearted, but without being dumb or shallow in retrospect.Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, and they've been sinking into poverty since her author-father hasn't written anything for years. Much of the book focuses on the romantic escapades of Cassandra and her older sister Rose, when two eligible young American men move in nearby. But the book isn't a romance; it's a story about growing up, and Cassandra wrestles with her relationships with family members, her (lack of) religious beliefs and her writing skills--she's keeping a journal as practice for writing a novel, which neatly explains the inclusion of scenes and dialogue in someone's diary.The book starts out a bit slowly, but gets going after about 50 pages and is an entertaining read. \\"Charming\\" is probably the best word for it. Cassandra stands out for her mix of intelligence and navet&eacute;; she's quite perceptive about people, but doesn't know much about life. She feels real and authentic (minus one problem that I'll get to later). It's interesting to see all the other characters through Cassandra's eyes, because several are not very nice and yet everything we hear about them is filtered through Cassandra's deep-seated affection for them. The book makes excellent use of voice and perspective and never forgets who is telling the tale. And the writing style is good, but believable coming from a 17-18 year old girl. Some episodes are downright amusing, and the book does a good job recalling what it's like to grow up.My biggest problem with the book was that I experienced a lot of dissonance regarding Cassandra's (and Rose's) actual age. Cassandra is 17-18 and Rose 20-21, but both felt 3-4 years younger. A lot of that is probably cultural and as a historical fiction reader I should be used to this, but I think the fact that the book is set in relatively modern times actually made this worse. There's the way people around Cassandra infantilize her--their constantly referring to her as a \\"child\\" (even her significantly-older love interest does this, which is creepy) and, for instance, asking if she's old enough to attend a dinner party (why wouldn't she be?) had me picturing her as about 12. And then, neither she nor Rose seems to have any future plans; Cassandra has no thought of leaving home; neither has any work experience or marketable skills; neither has ever thought herself in love or so much as kissed a boy. (Rose, whom we're told is beautiful, \\"first realizes\\" her power over men during the book. I know they live in a remote area, but surely she'd encountered male attention before?) So, Cassandra's experience of being 17-18 felt more like my experience of being 15. Which surprised me a bit, because we think of ourselves as growing up slowly in the U.S. these days. On the bright side, though, the fact that I can relate to Cassandra's experiences at all speaks well of the book.Possibly I just read this book at the wrong age (mid-20s). It's probably best read by either teenagers a few years younger than Cassandra, or adults decades removed who want to look back nostalgically on their teen years. One of the things Smith does very well here is write a book that can appeal to both kids and adults; perhaps because it was written before the \\"young adult\\" genre was born, it's appropriate for young readers without ever feeling patronizing or whitewashed."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle has been sitting on my to-read pile for years...ever since my aunt gave me a copy and told me I'd love it.

She wants to live in a 50/50 mix of a Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte novel, so you can guess how the story progresses when a rich family moves in nearby!

With consummate skill, Smith presents us with the journals of young Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra at seventeen possesses both sense and sensibility; the novel is both a coming-of-age tale and a love story. Cassandra looks at the world through clear eyes; she is kind and loving to everyone in her life, and completely honest with herself. Yet at times we are transported into the romantic fantasies of a young girl experiencing first love. Like the best novels of the 1940s--a golden period for women readers-- this one is wisely written and emotionally satisfying, with insights into the hearts of the central characters. It would make a good book club selection."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just finished reading I Capture the Castle for the first time and I am left with wonder at the depth and artistry of Dodie Smith.

I loved their quirks and their problems.As I flip through others postings, I'm rather shocked to read that many believed/hoped that 'I Capture' was a romance. It isn't. The ending isn't accidental or vague. (Yes it leaves possibilities... But that is part of the point.) This is a book about \`choosing to feel', not about \`falling in love.' Reread the portion about Miss Marcy's work with the children, the Vicar's work with the church, and Cassandra's thoughts on embracing their choices or walking past. (And the reason she gives for why she chooses as she does.) Reread (and figure out) what the father's strange writing was about.To all the scoffers, I loved the ending. She was true to what she'd learned and what she believed, and that was more important than romance. (Although, I'm not a romance basher. Love it actually.)I can't recommend this book enough.

I put off reading it for more than a year! Now I could read it over and over and over again, and it would still be great! The book starts off slow, really, but after sitting down in a nice, quiet room, and taking in every word I began to like it. I found as I began reading that the book grew more and more interesting. (Once you getting a feeling of the book) The storyline flows and it's so well put that you feel like you're sitting in Cassandra's kitchen, that you're right beside her while she writes in the kitchen sink. Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, which Cassandra absolutely adores. The book is about Cassandra Mortmain, and her daily life in that castle, set in the 1930's; her hardships with her family, her battles with love and the every day comedy's of life.Dodie Smith really makes Cassandra and the other Mortmains come to life. Cassandra is one of the most likeable characters I have ever \\"read about\\", she is stubborn, funny and dislikes anything involving romance,[ in the sense of romance between to people.] Quirky and perceptive, Cassandra will always keep you smiling. Then there's beautiful Stephen who's in love with her, who she thinks of as a brother, her sister Rose, who attracts boys where ever she goes, Topaz, Cassandra's step-mother who's a part-time nude model and her eccentric father, who's been having writing block...for twelve years. Cassandra's younger brother Thomas plays a lesser role in the book, but he does help with some of Cassandra's schemes. I do have some qualms with the ending though, it was a strange ending- but at the same time, I loved the ending! I capture the castle is a delightful book....go out and buy it!!

Seventeen year old Cassandra, along with her unusual family, lives in a chilly dilapitaded English castle. Though they live in poverty, the strength of their imaginations, wit, and sense of fun, prevents one from feeling their lives are lacking. Many scenes are infused with a subtle otherworldliness, as are some of the characters. The tale is filled with the tricks ones mind can play on itself when in love and even Cassandras sister Rose, so determined to marry her way out of poverty, finds she cannot ignore the real thing when it comes along. Though she tries. Oddly, as a female, I had a lot more empathy for the male characters. Especially the gentle love-sick Stephen. The characters, while not sophisticated, are something finer, more brilliant, and fresh. Nothing new or original is said about love in this story, but it does take the essence of coming of age, longing, and struggle, and infuses it with a pensive magic.

Reading this book reminded me of reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. The characters were just as likeable (or unlikeable) and the result was a story that shimmers like a fairy tale. My only complaints are as follows: a. The second half of the book gets a bit melodramatic at points, and you'll probably find yourself longing for the lighthearted wit from the beginning of the novel. and, b. The book is now over and I can't read it again for the first time.Read it once. Believe me, you will fall in love with Cassandra.

Reading it is such a delightful and enjoyable experience!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I started this book around midnight and read for the next four hours straight. And then for some godforsaken reason, this book gave me an urge to go for a very early morning jog. I came home refreshed after my run and you know what I did then? Picked up the novel and resumed reading. This book was a breath of fresh air, it really makes a person hopeful. Cassandra Mortmain is witty and funny and makes you feel as if you are literally there with her in the castle. Some people may think it moves too slowly, but I think that is part of the charm. Every detail is \\"captured.\\" This has become one of my favorites! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE was recommended to me by an acquaintance when it became available a few years ago, in print after a long absence in the United States. It has become one of my favorite books not for it's depth or subject matter but for the shimmering state of existence it captures- that of a precocious girl becoming an intelligent young woman. Don't let the recent film adaptation prevent you from reading the book because its charm lies in the first person narration (something never captured in film) of Cassandra Mortmain. She chronicles her family's life in an old castle where her beautiful elder sister Rose chafes at her isolation and poverty, her father, the once promising author, continues to suffer from writer's block, his artist's model second wife, Topaz, makes the best of it, and the solid Stephen helps the family without pay. Their world is inevitably changed by the arrival of new American landlords and eligible bachelor brothers Simon and Neil Cotton.However what could become a trite romance or standard coming of age story is carefully avoided by the thoughtful honesty of its narrator tempered by the comedy of the situations and by a hint of the sadness that accompanies all change. I confess I have purchased eight copies of the book and given them to friends because of the transitory feeling it so accurately grasps. Set in the 1930's, the narration still feels fresh even if the social codes have changed. This is unlike Dodie Smith's famous work, 101 Dalmatians, though, it is perhaps more like her plays, indeed, she even wrote a stage version of I CAPTURE THE CASTLE. It is an imminently readable and enchanting book."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12 and since have been unable to find a book that would be as captivating and enjoyable as Dodie Smiths I Capture the Castle. I can read this book over and over without tiring of it and I only wish they had it for my kindle so that I can take it with me everywhere without fear that it will rip!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had seen the film version of this on cable several years back and remembered enjoying it. The first line of this novel, \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" often comes up on various book trivia lists. So my interest was already piqued when I picked up a remainder copy of the movie tie-in edition at Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. I was interested to discover that it was out of print for many many years and was triumphantly celebrated by the critical media upon its return to publication.17 year old Cassandra Mortmain is a charming and entertaining narrator. She is writing in a journal, but as it is practice for being an actual writer she tries to write her entries as she would a novel, with all dialogue recorded and true honesty when it comes to all the characters in her story, herself included.She attempts to \\"capture\\" the story of her family as they live in poverty in an old ramshackle castle in the English countryside during the 1930s. There is love, and bohemia, and mystery, and adventure and confusion and hilarity and a little sadness too. I really felt for these characters and was dreading the end of the story when I would have to leave them.I adored this book. I know I will reread it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read the book, and watched the movie. I loved the book more. It is definitely worth your time. I read a long time ago, but I am still writing a review encouraging others to read it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When it comes to literature, I am a very critical person but I capture the castle was a wonderful read. It is one of the best books and it is really a rare gem you will find. The character is a sharp, intelligent narrator who writes in a diary, telling the readers of her family life and problems.The scenes are very well written and they paint a very good picture for the imagination. it was not a book I could just breeze through. The only thing I didn't like was when the character at some point got confused in love matters and showed an interest in her sister's lover. So while the book was really wonderful, the ending I feel could have been different. All in all, it is definitely worth a try and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love this book so much that I've probably read it a dozen times-at least once a year.I will caution that it is not a happy-go-lucky book. It's full of some self aware teenage angst, and that's part of why I enjoy it. It's a book I love to read when I want to feel bad with someone else, about someone else's problems- the main character, Cassandra's. But it's not a tragic book, and while you may cry a time or two (or possibly, I'm just one of those people who cries over books) you'll enjoy doing it.Two thumbs up, and five stars. Fully recommend buying a copy!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have heard a lot of chatter recently about this book and I have been meaning to read it for quite some time now. I'm so glad I took the opportunity to purchase it and I am saddened that I did not read this book when I was younger because it has so much youthful hope for life and the ending shares with readers the beautiful transformation of a young girl into a young woman.The story is told through seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain who lives with her family in a crumbling castle in the English countryside. Her father wrote one popular and widely acclaimed novel but has not managed to write a second follow up. Needless to say the family is struggling to get by and has sold most of their furniture and other household items in order to survive. Cassandra and her older, beautiful sister Rose have fun comparing themselves to the Bennett sisters in Pride and Prejudice or characters from a Charlotte Bronte novel. To the family's surprise and delight two American brothers inherit the property next door and the relationships between the families lead to changing within the walls, first love and the discovery of self.Like Cassandra, I wish I could find the right words to describe how much I enjoyed this book but I know that I will never be able to capture all of the emotions and feelings I had while reading it. Cassandra fills up three journals with funny, witty and poetic observations about her life and the people she knows and lives with. She is a wonderful and fascinating heroine and I enjoyed every word she wrote. At first I had some reservations about reading this book because it is written as journal entries but I after reading the book I feel that this gave me such a connection with Cassandra. She becomes a wonderful and endearing character and as I got to watch this period of her life along with her I begin to learn so much about her and ultimately myself. Her assent into first love is so touching, sweet and sad that I begin to fear for her feelings and wellbeing almost as if I was experiencing falling in love for the first time again myself.At first, I found myself a bit disappointed with the ending because I wanted things to turn out well for her but looking back I realized what a wonderful ending to Cassandra's story it is. Be prepared, it is sad, but what Cassandra choses to do is so in tune with the woman she becomes I admire it and appreciate it more. It has been such a long time since I read a book that made me feel like a teenager again and affected all of my emotions. I know that I will be reading this book again many times in the future and it ranks up at the top of my list of my favorite books."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"J.K. Rowling says \\"this book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met\\"* which certainly influenced me to buy the book because I don't think I've ever seen a J.K. Rowling blurb on a book. However, it was a blog post by Elizabeth Bluemle \\"Characters You'd Let Your Daughter Date\\" (http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/shelftalker/?p=1503) that moved I Capture the Castle from the shelf to the \\"to-be-read\\" pile. I was curious about this Stephen character and his marriage potential. But that is just what caused me to pick the book up, there is SO MUCH more to love about it.First, it has one of the best first lines I've ever read: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" If that doesn't want to make you read on, I don't know what will. Second, the narrator is utterly charming. She is captivating, innocent yet serious, she knows who she wants to be but recognizes the challenges that lay ahead of her. She confronts first love head on and survives when both parties end up disappointed. She wants to be a writer and she invites the reader into her deepest thoughts, wishes and dreams and you love her for it. She's smart, funny, sarcastic and dramatic as she attempts to \\"capture\\" the castle.I'm neither the first person to say it nor will I be the last, Cassandra and her family will absolutely capture your heart. Here are few other of my favorite quotes:\\"I was wandering around as usual, in my unpleasantly populated sub-conscious...\\"\\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"\\"I only want to write. And there's no college for that except life.\\"\\"...I have noticed that when things happen in one's imaginings, they never happen in one's life, so I am curbing myself.\\"*this quote was taken from the back cover"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It really kept my interest and I could not wait to get to read it any chance that I had.The author did a great job sharing Cassandra's adolescent issues in the first person. In fact, it was disturbing at times to be reminded of how difficult it was to be that age. A lot of the story and situation was far fetched but it portrayed an atypical dysfunctional family very well and I felt the frustration I feel when I see dysfunction in real families, including my own. It wasn't really a happy ending and I definitely prefer happy endings. In fact, as much as it kept my interest, I feel mildly depressed just having finished it.It's not \\"classic\\" material but it is definitely bestseller quality."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love this book--this is my second time reading it and it is just as wonderful as the first. It is rare for a novel to transport me into its world as thoroughly as this one does. When I read this story, I am Cassandra Mortmain--I see what she sees, I feel what she feels. On every page, the author captures a moment or makes an observation that resonates with such authenticity that I am taken back to similar moments in my life and I remember that, yes, they are just like she portrays them. And what the author portrays so vividly is the agony of being a young girl in love for the first time. It's that awkward phase between girl and woman, the pains, the embarrassments, the enthusiasms--Ms. Smith puts them all on the page for us to relive and recognize. It's wrenching at times, but so absorbing that when I reached the end, I immediately turned back to the beginning so I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Cassandra and the Mortmain family.The story is told through Cassandra's journal entries, and I love how the author effortlessly guides the reader in out of the journal. For long stretches of time, it's easy to forget that we're reading Cassandra's diary. But then we dip back into it as Cassandra tells us she's tired of writing or notes how long it's taken her to record a particular event--and even in one case, how she waited too long to record an event and can only give us general impressions of it. The author has a masterful way of using the journal format to her advantage and never letting it limit the story. And I love how, even though the story is told exclusively through Cassandra's viewpoint, the author is still able to show us things through Cassandra's eyes that Cassandra doesn't necessarily see.The 101 Dalmatians, also by Dodie Smith, was one of my favorite books as a child, but I didn't discover \\"I Capture the Castle\\" until adulthood. I'm sorry I didn't have the pleasure of reading this as a girl, but I doubt I could have loved it any more than I do now."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The Mortmain family were once financially well off. James Mortmain had written a wonderfully successful novel, but that was a long time ago. Years have now passed and James has not written anything! Over time, his wife died and he was left with three children. However, he did find a new love with a beautiful and exotic model by the name of Topaz. When times were good, James had leased a castle for his family. A romantic endeavor, but now the family are very poor. The castle is terribly run down and over the last few years any furniture of value has been sold. James can't or won't write another story. His fans want another book and no one can understand why James can't produce one!Topaz dearly loves her husband and does her best as a step-mother. The children seem to have a good relationship with her. The daughters are Rose, who at twenty-one is quite beautiful, and seventeen year old Cassandra who is a wonderful and colorful character. Thomas, the only son is still in school, but anxious to grow up and see the world. A young handsome eighteen year old boy by the name of Stephen also lives with the family. His mother had been the family's maid during better times. After her death, Stephen has stayed on and worked for the Mortmain's doing any chore that was requested of him. He is extremely fond of Cassandra and she worries about what might become of him.The story is set in the 1930's and told by Cassandra. She's absolutely charming in her observations and descriptions of life. She records the happenings of daily life and analyses everything and everyone she interacts with.When the Cotton's, a very wealthy family inherit a neighboring estate, life changes for the impoverished Mortmain's. The girls are dazzled by their new American neighbors, especially Simon and Neil, the two very interesting sons of the family.One note of interest, the author, Dodie Smith also wrote the children's story, The Hundred and One Dalmatians."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Last year, my daughters (ages 12 and 14) and I went to Disney World. I had picked up a copy of this book at a bookstore on the way to the airport. As soon as I started I was hooked. Forget Splash Mountain, swimming, fine dining- all I wanted to do was read. Within the week, my girls had both read it. We continue to talk about it- and give it to friends. The BEST!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I saw this book in a flyer for a bookstore. I'd never heard of it before, but the title captured my imagination. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I identified so much with Cassandra, it was almost scary... I felt like someone had been inside my head and written down some of my thoughts. I so enjoyed this book that I didn't want it to end. I hope this book is discovered by many people. It is so touching, heartwarming, and real. It was a true joy to read."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a sixteen year old girl, I found Cassandra very easy to relate to. A lot of the thoughts and emotions mentioned in the book really hit home with me, as I'm sure they did and will with other readers. Dodie Smith's writing style is amazing; I was never bored once, always turning page after page to find out where the characters would end up. If you love a touch of romance, a slice of comedy, and a lot of truth, this is the book for you. I Capture the Castle was a fantastic read, one that I will gladly repeat again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Rereading this book after 25 years might have been a disappointment, but it was as good this time and as a more mature reader. Dodie Smith wrote an ageless tale that any woman will find to be poignant, touching and unforgettable. I'm so happy that it is back in print. It will be a top gift choice when I select holiday presents for my friends of all ages. I'm confident that they will remember the characters, as I have, for many years to come."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. It belonged to my aunt and I often wondered what became of her copy. Every summer I was sent to her farm for a 3 month visit and since she had no juvenile books, I got an early start on E.

Thank you for reminding me about it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first heard of this book when Entertainment Weekly gave it an unheard of A+ rating, and thought it sounded fun. After reading it, I became a D. Smith ADDICT and quickly read everything else (unfortunately, thru the library as they are mostly out-of-print) she'd written. The comparisons to J. Austen are apt, but Smith has her own idiosyncratic style. Cassandra Mortmain is a heroine for all times, though and I can well imagine that I too, will become one of the book's devoted fans who will read and re-read and re-read this book for years to come. Yes it really is that good!! As one reviewer put it so succinctly, &quot;What Chanel is to perfume, Dodie Smith is to charm.&quot; Do yourself a big, big favor and discover this utterly delightful book for yourself!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just read this book for the first time, and it is a definite great. I can't think of a better story about young girls confronting the complexity, wonder, and pain of growing up. I would put it in the ranks of Anne of Green Gables, and Little Women.

A wonderful story of a teenaged girl in 30s England.

Dodie Smith perfectly contrasts English mannerisms and etiquette with the American way of doing things, hits the mark even all these years later. She also beautifully portrays the bevy of emotions a teenager goes through when falling in love for the first time. The book is written in diary form, which allows for deeper insight into the musings of Cassandra, the lead character; the effect is to make her very real and believable. In fact all the characters are very believable; with exceptionally varied roles for the women. It's interesting that the unique diary form of the book while effective in adding realism and depth to the plot and characters also tends to make things a bit tedious as Cassandra records her daily happenings and thoughts, some of which are rather insignificant. It was a nice read but seems more appropriate for school \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'll be honest. When I first came across this book in Barnes and Noble a number of years ago, I dismissed it as something I wouldn't like (literally, I judged a book by its cover, shame on me). I re-discovered this book a few months ago, and now I'm wondering why, oh why, didn't I read this book earlier.I Capture the Castle is the diary, kept over a six-month period, of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, who lives with her unconventional family in a decrepit, crumbling castle. She keeps the diary in order to strengthen her skills as an author. The novel is written not so much as a diary; rather Cassandra writes it very much as a story is written (aside from mentioning the month, she doesn't date her entries).Cassandra's strength lies in her recreation of her family members and the people in the small country village in which they live; even the dog has a personality. All of the characters have depth; take, for example, Cassandra's stepmother Topaz, a former model who is more complicated than she appears at first. Cassandra narrates this story with a great amount of humor; especially funny is the story about the bear. Cassandra and her whole family are charming, and I absolutely fell in love with all of them. I think if I'd read this book when I was seventeen, I would have loved it; but it's no less funny and poignant ten years later. It's a great coming-of-age story, especially since Cassandra's coming of age happens so imperceptibly over the course of the novel."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm a person who finds classics a bit intimidating because sometimes I find the language a bit rough to get through. So, I was a little apprehensive when I first picked up I Capture the Castle. Still, I figured a good introduction to the classics genre (I've only read a few) would be a classic young adult novel and I was right. I Capture the Castle is one of the most beautiful books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.I noticed that in other reviews, people stated that I Capture the Castle was really slow to get into at first. I didn't find it that way at all. From page one I was enchanted with Cassandra and her life at the castle. Cassandra is just so sweet and funny that you can't help but love her. Due to her flaws, she's also extremely real. I got annoyed at her when I read who she was in love with and at some of the things she did and then I remembered that most teenagers act illogical sometimes when they are in love. Cassandra wasn't really a heroine that was glorified. Because I Capture the Castle is written in the form of Cassandra's journal entries, we see her at her absolutely best, yet we also see her at her absolute worst.Cassandra wasn't the only charming character in I Capture the Castle. I found myself falling in love with not only Simon, but with Neil, and especially Stephen (poor, poor Stephen. I just wanted to hug him throughout the whole novel). I also absolutely loved Topaz and the way she was prone to dramatizing certain situations that she felt needed a bit of \\"drama\\" to be romantic. As for Rose, it was heartbreaking what she was willing to do in order to save, not only herself but her family, from poverty. I found my feelings varying from dislike to pity for her.The thing that I loved most about I Capture the Castle was the progression between how Cassandra was at the beginning of the novel up until the end. You truly see Cassandra grow up and become more of an adult. However, the feelings you get in regards to that are mixed because while you know she could use some growing up, you really don't want her to change from the enchanting person you met when you first started the novel. But I guess it really was necessary.I definitely recommend I Capture the Castle to everyone. It was an amazing classic novel that is still surprisingly relevant today despite that it was written so long ago. You can still relate to Cassandra and her problems and feel for her. You are charmed by her through every step of the way as she captures the castle and our hearts. Tremendous novel that I no doubt will read again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I, too, wish I had read this book when I was a teenager rather than my early 20s, but it is still a charming book that many women would probably appreciate. The narrator is likable, interesting and complex, and experiencing her first love, which is always an interesting thing to read about. Smith is able to keep the interest up until the very last pages - in some books the action is over too soon and the last chapter seems \\"tacked on\\", but that is not the case here. Cassandra's development and maturity really is the most interesting thing about the book overall.The other characters are also interesting, but realistic. Smith's commentary (via Cassandra) on the father, who is a post-war experimental writer is particularly interesting. As a scholar myself, I think it's always interesting to read about other scholars, whether fictional or historical, especially in a field like creative writing, where \\"genius\\" is a highly subjective thing.All in all, this was an enjoyable and rich book - but I think I won't be re-reading it until I have some daughters to read it too!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Remember when you were a kid, and reading a book felt so alive? You wanted to read it all the time, but you didn't want it to end? I don't get that feeling much anymore, but Dodie Smith delivered. The story is equal parts Bronte sisters and Jane Austen (as the narrator herself says) with a large dose of Little Women and some Shakespeare comedy thrown in for good measure. The narrator is as appealing as all get out, and then there's the pleasure of observing gentile poverty and the English weather and class system. Maybe a dash of Agatha Christie? And in the midst of all this sheer delight, a sensitive coming of age, sexual awakening story. I can't imagine a woman who wouldn't love this book, and maybe some men as well."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The author pulled me to the English countryside when romance was still romantic. I loved the characters and the castle. The Mortmains live in poverty for no reason except their eccentric father has writers block. The girls fall in love with wealthy brothers.

This is a fun book."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it. It is impossible not to love and admire the main character, and the story is impressively original, considering how stereotypical its plot appears at first glance. I could hardly put it down!

It is a fantastic/appropriate read for both teens and adults, and I recommend it so much that I have had to buy several copies over the years - unsure of who has my last one when I find myself recommending it to yet another friend.I'm ordering two more copies today.The main character, Cassandra, is my favorite narrator of all time. She is witty, yet not overdone, and tells the story with an honest teen perspective. She is humiliated when a normal 17-year-old would feel so, and finds herself in completely realistic situations, rather than overly dramatic versions of reality. And yet there is SO much to laugh at, and feel agony over. The balance of wit and angst is perfect in my opinion.The ending is as surprising as any in literature, and still so real. It is not at all a novel where the story is wrapped up with a neat red bow, but rather one which makes you smile and say, \\"Ah, Cassandra, you are going to go places, my dear friend.\\" That is exactly how I feel about Cassandra - she is a dear friend who I wish could have told me story after story as her life progressed!This was a book that could have had many exciting sequels, but apparently wasn't as appreciated in its day as it should have been.Hooray for Dodie Smith - I wish she would have written 101 more novels :)"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book!

Dodie Smith perfectly contrasts English mannerisms and etiquette with the American way of doing things, hits the mark even all these years later. She also beautifully portrays the bevy of emotions a teenager goes through when falling in love for the first time. The book is written in diary form, which allows for deeper insight into the musings of Cassandra, the lead character; the effect is to make her very real and believable. In fact all the characters are very believable; with exceptionally varied roles for the women. It's interesting that the unique diary form of the book while effective in adding realism and depth to the plot and characters also tends to make things a bit tedious as Cassandra records her daily happenings and thoughts, some of which are rather insignificant. It was a nice read but seems more appropriate for school \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an odd little book.

I felt as though her depression was emphasized without a real purpose.I'm really quite torn on what to rate this and whether to recommend this!

Oh, it's well-written and pleasant to read, with the usual assortment of eccentrics that only English authors seem to be able to create. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get interested in what happens to the characters in the story, even though I tried very hard. It's a good book to spend some quiet time reading, and it will relax you with its language and languid pace. Perhaps it's finally showing its age, being over a half-century old, and seemingly rooted in another world and time entirely. Don't be put off by what I say; read it and make your own determination.

The Mortmain's are poor and hungry, though they live in a castle; it is mostly empty because they had to sell most of their belongings for money. Cassandra's father became famous for a brief time in the past with the writing of his book, but has since then stopped writing and acquired very strange behavior. Cassandra's mother passed away when she was very young.One day everything changes when two young men come to the castle. Rose takes a great interest in one of them, Simon, and he eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Cassandra knows, however, that her sister is marrying him for the wrong reasons: she only wants the money, for herself and for her family. Cassandra becomes quite upset and it is soon learned that she herself is in love with Simon!This book is written with wit, beauty, and the words flow so easily.

I admit that it was the simplicity of the cover that caught my attention. The writing style was wonderful and I always enjoy a book written in the first person narrative. The main character, Cassandra, was easy to listen to. A girl on the verge of womanhood, she showed wisdom, insight and sensitivity beyond her years. Considering that she lived in such a dysfunctional family, it was miraculous that she turned out to be so well-adjusted.The writing style was beautiful-not too wordy, but allowing for crystal-clear descriptions of the family and their surroundings. I did find that the plot was alittle predictable and events that should have taken time to evolve, happened at a whirlwind pace. At times I thought that months or years had passed, until the narrator indicated that it was actually the next day ( I just don't think that the kind of events described happen that fast in real-life).In general, I found this to be an enjoyable and pleasant book. No sex, no drugs, no violence - just the likable story of a girl coming of age.P.S. Men might not find this story as compelling as a woman might-it's definitely a \\"girl\\" book."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is one of a kind. It really captures you into the time of story, no matter where you are reading and what mood you are at when you are the reading the book. The young girl, Cassandra who takes us through part of her life, maybe the most important part of her life is very charismatic in a way, she puts everyone's problems on her shoulder, and in the it was all payed back, but I felt realy sorry for her. I thought maybe she deserved better than the way she was treated, and even at the end, no convincing apologies were made. Not even by the people who really hurt her at times, when she didn't even realize it. The ending was really realistic. In most stories the girl and the guy get together after all they have been gone through, but in the end this doesn't happen though in thier hearts you feel some connection between them, each don't want to admit and they seperate. It is kind of sad, but you realize, that's how most of the world function.

Growing up in South Africa without television also strengthened the reading habit. My first encounter with &quot;I capture the castle&quot; was as a serialised version on the radio and I couldn't wait for the next installment. Of course I subsequently read the book - five times.

I also loved the fact that Dodie [the author] had written 101 Dalmatians. To be honest I did have very high hopes for the book. While it was written with wit and wisdom I was bothered at finding the usage of the same extraordinary rare words over and over. I thought the story started out wonderfully; a girl loving where she is and loving who she is and being content while wanting so much more. It is the life of a young girl who wants only the best for her father, sister, brother, step mother, and friend/hand-boy. It was no surprise and I knew it was coming ... that she would fall for the wrong man which was disappointing. I hoped that there would be a better end; that somehow for once an author could actually pull it off. As the author had our young main character put it ... she loved a book that \\"left you wondering.\\" Some just do not care for the way it is done, I being one.

That was enough for my husband to quit reading it. Several of my book club members could not get past the fist sentence! As you read on, however, you find that the story gets better as it goes. There is so much drama between the two sisters in this book! It makes it really good! It has some laughs and some serious parts. There were some parts in this book that my book club members disagreed about as far as what Smith was trying to get across to the reader.

Since then I've read it AT LEAST every two years; you do the math. I've probably given out twenty copies, always telling the prospective reader that she will be hooked after the first page, if not the first sentence. You can imagine my delight when the book was rediscovered and republished several years ago. There is a British version of the paperback that includes fascinating background information on Dodie Smith. She had moved from Britain to California with her husband, a screenwriter and a pacifist, in the early days of WWII. She longed for \\"home\\" and the innocent time before the war.

The movie version is not half-bad, but the book is ten times better!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Not many people know that British writer Dodie Smith produced more than children's beloved \\"101 Dalmatians\\". \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is probable her second most famous book -- although one may wonder if it doesn't deserve the title of her most famous work. Largely known as narrative produced for young girls, this one goes much beyond its target reader. \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a book that may be read and appreciated by women and men alike, no matter how old they are.A romantic comedy, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" keeps the light tone most of the time -- albeit it flirts with the Gothic novel sometimes. After all, the main characters have an old and abandoned castle in their backyard. The castle is as Gothic as it could be with gargoyles and towers falling apart.But Cassandra, the witty nave narrator, never leaves the castle to be the center of the action. Dutifully she is the raison d'tre of the book. She is a young girl, daughter of an ex-famous writer that hasn't produced anything since his first novel. She lives with her father, stepmother, older sister and Stephen -- the son of their deceased maid --in a house adjoined the castle. They lead a poor life -- actually a money, food and joyless one. Until the day two young and handsome heirs arrive. They come to claim the castle that once belonged to their grandfather.But don't expect the ordinary from Smith's quills. Contrary to the \`natural' order, Cassandra's family do not battle against the heirs for the castle. Again, against all odds, the stepmother is not the incarnation of evil -- actually she is a good friend of the two girls. The writer only brings to the novel ideas that would unfold in a clich&eacute;d way and then subvert all of them.This is the biggest pleasure in reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\". The book is a narrative of sweet subversion -- so is the young narrator. A delightful voice, Cassandra has been praised as one of the best young female narrators ever (J. K. Rowling seems to agree). Extremely well developed, one may take this novel for an autobiography sometimes, rather than fiction. Her moral, intellectual and romantic dilemmas are real and interesting.With \\"I Capture the Castle\\" Smith produced a novel of touching and tender subversion -- funny sometimes, sad other times, but real all the time. Something that is already a reason to praise a book."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I first found this book I was on vacation, looking for something to read. I was drawn to the book, maybe by its interesting cover, or the fact that it has been praised by the author of my favorite book series, Harry Potter. After picking up the book and reading the back cover I thought, why not, sounds good enough.I started reading the book and yes, it was a little slow at first. But usually once I start a book, even a seemingly boring one, I try to finish it. I can't be exactly sure when I really started getting into the book, perhaps it was the introduction of the Cottons, but soon after I couldn't stop. After I finished, I recommended it to everyone I knew.Cassandra is a character, in my opinion, many girls can relate to; mainly being in the shadow of an older sibling, and living in a castle was a fantasy of everyone at some point or anotherI highly recommend this book to teens and old alike.

Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving.

I sat down and devoured it in a day or two. Cassandra is a teenage girl growing up in England in the 1930's. Her family has moved to a ramshackle castle, where they live in poverty, or near to it. The story is her enchanting diary, in which she records her thoughts, hopes, and wishes candidly and clearly. Cassandra is a very likeable character, as she is by no means perfect, and is honest about her imperfections; at the same time, she keeps trying to be the type of person that will make her family proud.

And I was very impressed! Smith's character Cassandra captures the castle and the people living in it with cleverness and thoughtfulness that I could only hope to possess. She is a wonderful heroine - maybe not beautiful like her sister Rose, but she knows what she wants (at least in the end) and has a way of talking right to the reader so you can identify with her. Simon and Neil Cotton characters bring more humor to the book and bring out the Mortmain family, as seen from outsiders. Another strong point besides the characters was the foreshadowing that keeps one wanting to read on and on without stopping. Some parts, especially the &quot;life lesson&quot; at the end, were a little predictable, but that doesn't take very much away from this excellent story.

That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is the depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring -- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. \\"This is the story of the Mortmain family, in all their wonderful eccentricity. It is told by Cassandra Mortmain, youngest girl of the family, and aspiring writer, as she tries to \\"capture the castle\\". She lives with her family in an old English castle. The father, known only as Mortmain, was a famous writer. His one novel, was very successful, especially in the United States. But he has been suffering from writer's block every since....and is a tad bit on the crazy side. With no income for years, the family is basically dirt poor, having sold off all their valuable possessions just to have enough food to live on. They live with Mortain's second wife, Topaz, an artist's model and extremely free-spirit who exists only to be her husband's muse. And hasn't been able to accomplish it. The eldest sister, Rose, is self-centered at best. She hates being poor. Hates it with a passion, and would do just about anything to marry someone with money. Youngest child, Thomas, is just a schoolboy, but remarkable insightful. And rounding out the motley bunch, is Stephen. Stephen is the son of their former housekeeper. When she passed away, Stephen stayed on with the family. He's exceptionally handsome, though Cassandra finds him a bit \\"daft\\" (of course, he thinks the sun rises and sets on her!)Things change very little in the Mortmain castle until the day the Cotton's move into Scoatney. The Cotton's are Americans who have inherited the estate, and with that become the new landlords to the Mortmains. Simon, as the eldest brother, is the actual heir to the land and in essence, the \\"wealthy\\" one. Neil, the younger more carefree brother wants to return to America to become a cattle rancher. Rose, in her desperation to get out of the poverty that has struck her family, decides that she is hopelessly in love with Simon and will do just about anything to get him to propose to her. And since Simon is rather scholarly, he and his mother are taken with Mortmain. Fans of his writing, they try to get him over his writer's block.The story is told in journal format by Cassandra, who is sweet and gentle and kind. She's also smart as a whip and devoted to her family. Cassandra, in a word, is delightful! I usually tend to root for the more brash characters. But there is just something so endearing about Cassandra. \\"And that was all she ever did talk about it -- that was almost the worst part of the gloom, our not talking naturally. Never have I felt so separate from her. And I regret to say that there were moments when my deep and loving pity for her merged into a desire to kick her fairly hard. For she is a girl who cannot walk her troubles off, or work them off; she is a girl to sit around and glare.\\" \\"That evening of the row was our lowest depths; miserable people cannot afford to dislike each other. Cruel blows of fate call for extreme kindness in the family circle.\\" Cassandra is level-headed and wise beyond her years. She is charming and refreshingly honest in all her writings.Rose drove me crazy though. She is vain and self-centered and annoying. And even though she tried to justify that her marrying Simon would help the family as a whole, she really was in it only for herself. She was obnoxious and the type of woman that sat back waiting for someone to give her something. The Cinderella waiting to be rescued by the Prince, instead of the Belle, who was out there doing the rescuing. And that just drove me crazy! But, in truth, it's how the character is written and Smith definitely did a great job in making me dislike her immensely!Each character was so thoroughly fleshed out. It's like you actually knew the people that were being written about. And you cared what happened to them. I can't remember the last time I was so taken with the characters in a book. And I can't even begin to pick a favorite. Aside from Rose, each character has some strange but endearing qualities. And I loved them all!! A timeless story that will last forever, this is one book that I'm truly a better person for having read! A 100% definite 5-Star Rating!!! Will surely land on my list of favorite novels!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I probably read this book 5 times while I was a pre-teen and teen-ager.

While reading the book you fall in love w/ or get annoyed with each character. You want to be them, meet them , or just become friends with them. For me it kept me guessing till the end. Does she love him? Will they get together? What will happen to them? You soon feel like you know the charachters personally. I admit after finishing the book I was a bit frusturated. It seemed it didn't end how I wanted it too. But after going over it in my head multiple times I sooned realized why it makes it so good.

As World War II broke and rumbled on, she longed for London. Writing this book was an expiation of her nostalgia.The novel's title is the triumphant declaration of the book's narrator, dispossessed wannabe writer Cassandra. In fact, it is author Smith who \\"captures\\" the angst of her young heroines, class warfare, tension between Transatlantic neighbours and especially of the England of the 1930s that she missed.Apart from the luminous romance, two of the characters are concerned with writing. Young narrator/protagonist Cassandra ambitiously works through her story in ever-more-expensive notebooks. By contrast, her unproductive father cannot reproduce his early creative form.It's a good story in the Jane Austen comedy-of-manners tradition, with a little sexiness of DH Lawrence mixed in, and the down-at-heel feeling of, e.g., Cold Comfort Farm\\". The compulsive beginning immediately establishes Cassandra, the writing motive, and engages our sympathy: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.

The Mortmains have been living in poverty in a castle in England, because after Father was released from a three-month stint in jail, after the \\"cake-knife incident\\" in their neigborhood, he wanted to live in the country. They had been living on the profits of his first and famous book, \\"Jacob Wrestling,\\" but he has a serious case of writer's block, eccentricity, and questions are raised about his sanity. With little income, their home is falling apart, many of their belonging have been sold off for food, we watch their fortunes change when Neil and Simon Cotton move in next door. Cassandras's sister, Rose, her brother, Timothy, stepmother, Topaz, and the lovesick Stephen all live in the castle, interesting people all. Throw in the wealthy Cottons who move in next door, and we add love and engagements, Simon loves Rose, Rose doesn't love Simon, Neil hates Rose, and Cassandra of course, loves Simon. There are many more interesting characters who do not overshadow the plot while we watch Cassandra change during the course of her journal.

We explore sibling relationships, parent-child relationships and the powerful feelings associated with first love.Filled with a cast of well drawn characters who are both down-to-earth and sublimely eccentric, I was captivated from page one by Cassandra's charming innocence.

The J.K. Rowling blurb on the cover gave me pause (was it a children's book? ) as did the old-fashioned cover and unknown author name (to me). Well, I absolutely adored this book and its characters--laughing out loud at the bear coat scene and crying inconsolably at the last words the narrator writes. Others here have said more about the plot, but all I can say if you love Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, Little Women or any books that feature strong-willed, quirky girl-women, you will adore this book. Give it to your friends, too. And I hope it's true that they are making a film of this, since it should revive interest in the book. (Although after what Hollywood did to Land Girls and Cold Comfort Farm, I'm afraid for this little gem.) Cassandra's journal entries capture the castle perfectly as well as the heart of her readers. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Well, everyone in the other reviews has done a good job of decribing it, but would just like to say that this is the best book I have read since last summer. I am ashamed to say that i have fallen in love with Stephen, if it's possible to fall in love with someone who doesn't exist. Read the book and see what I mean!

Her unique, spiritied family, the Mortmains, struggle daily with poverty, having little to eat.There's her eccentric father, James, an hermit-like ex-writer who has a huge case of writer's block. There is Cassandra's sister Rose, a vain beauty who longs for riches and something more in her life. Then there is her stepmother, Topaz, a towheaded artist's model who likes to play her lute and commune with nature (walk around outdoors naked with the elements). Lastly, there is the god-like beauty Stephen (but Cassandra says his expression is \\"a bit daft\\"), who helps around the house and is totally in love with Cassandra.Our heroine records events with wit, honesty, and cozy warmth. The Mortmain family meets the sons of the late Mr. Cotton, the rich landlord, Simon and Neil Cotton. Soon Cassandra's life and the lives of those around her begin to change. Rose becomes engaged to Simon Cotton. But does she actually love him? Rose had once told her sister that she would do anything to help her family out of the poverty they are in.Cassandra is a wonderful girl coming into her own, witty and likeable up to the very last word. I really identified with her, as a teenaged girl. This book may not deliver your standard happy ending (we never know who Cassandra really ends up with relationship-wise), but will certainly deliver a wonderful reading experience. It is a good book to simply curl up with."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith was an excellent book.

I personally do not enjoy reading a book written as a diary. I like to feel a part of the story and not on the outside as an observer. If you are in the mood for a romantic story, choose Pride and Prejudice. The characters in Castle were not well-developed. I never cared about any of them. The ending leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm reading I Capture The Castle now and I'm trying to like it, I really am, unfortunately it's an uphill battle.The father is tiresome and is not written with sufficient charm to inspire me to care and sympathise with his plight.The man is arrogantly neglectful of his childrens well being and is luckier than he knows to be married to someone like Topaz who will treat those kids like her own and be a parent to them...FAR more than Mr. Genius ever does.I also take exception to the treatment of Stephen. I mean, this is a noble young man who worries that the drab sounding Cassandra is hungry!He takes it upon himself to SUPPORT this family and is gorgeous to boot what IS Cassandra's problem?Okay, okay, he doesn't sit around reading Jane Austen or the Brontes but for Pete's sake...he feeds this worthless crew...even the blasted FATHER!!The section where Stephen describes how as a very young child his mother told him not to approach the Mortmain girls because they were \\"young ladies\\" while he was the son of a maid brought tears to my eyes.He's so worth ten Mortmains put together.I shall fight on to the end but I do wish that Stephen and Topaz would run away together and leave the rest of them to snap and snarl over the carcasses of those Cottons.I fear I shall finish this book, toss it aside and just say...\\"So?\\""},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the film (usually a pointless exercise, anyway).

He's better playing extroverted characters."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Smith's telling of the day-to-day experiences of young Cassandra reminded me of Jane Austen, but the plot was of no comparison. I just couldn't buy into the wealthy American brothers falling in love with Rose. I just don't think it would have happened, or perhaps not enough premise for this to happen was presented to the reader.However, while not as sophisticated, the book was much more compelling than Jane Austen, as popular fiction should be, and I forced myself to not peek at the ending - thankfully, for Cassandra's finale was wonderful.And, several scenes were so well told - the furs incident & the bathing incident in which the brothers make their appearance were hilarious, and several other episodes (especially between Simon and Cassandra) were a pleasure.Jagged edges in the plot, but still a delight for fans of British lit."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great \\"compare and contrast\\" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they \\"don't know how to do anything\\". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are \\"eccentric\\", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The setting of the book is wonderfull I was quickly absorbed in the story a MUST buy."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have rarely read a book that I found so entrancing--one of those that I really didn't want to end!

I am anxious to pass it on to friends to see if they fall head over heels with her as I did.I want more by Ms. Smith, but it doesn't sound as if her other novels are in the same arena as this one.

The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door, it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parentsI served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I absolutely adore this book. Everything Cassandra narrates I can vividly see in my mind. A strong voice and wonderful usage of words, makes it an even more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I got this book based on the recommendation of a classmate, and immediately fell in love with the narrator. All the characters are intriguing, and I couldn't put it down. I must read for anyone who loves very British stories."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"So much of this quirky, beautifully-written book is wonderful that I am sorry to have come away from it rather disappointed. After an excellent first half, it gradually descends into a morass of puppy-love.The picture that this book \\"captures\\" of the social possibilities for girls in the 1950's is devastating."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra, a 17 year old girl living in a decrepit castle in England in the 1930's. It's told through her journal entries, which she writes not so much to tell the events of the day, but more to practice her writing because her author father (who hasn't written in years) was highly critical of the last piece that she showed him.As the reviews on the cover of the book claim, Cassandra is a very charismatic narrator. It is difficult to dislike her, though there were several points where I did truly want to. Her excitement for things is infectious, as is the romanticism of the castle in which she lives. Her endeavors to improve her writing lead to a very interesting and sometimes moving story.The main problem that I had with the story was actually something that was done well. The characterization was excellent, making it very believable that it was a young woman writing about family and friends that she has known for some time. They were well fleshed-out and seemed like real people. The problem that I had was that they seemed like real people that I just didn't like and at times that detracted from my reading pleasure.While I did find I Capture the Castle to be enjoyable for the most part, my dislike of the characters hampered that enjoyment. I found Rose to be very shallow, as was Cassandra, and I honestly wanted to see them foiled in their quest for husbands. I have little tolerance for people who are upset about their circumstances but don't do anything to change them, so the constant moping in the Mortmain household grated on my nerves after a while. I know that it was a different time, and perhaps that was more appropriate action then, but it was annoying to see all the women there so weak and unable or unwilling to do anything to improve their situation.The plot was also so much based around their desires to improve their situation that I had a small bit of trouble with it as well, but it was cleverly done, and there were enough side plots that I wasn't too overwhelmed by Cassandra and Rose's attempts to improve their position through marriage.I did find this book to be an interesting look into a different time period. I enjoyed reading about the idiosyncrasies that Cassandra focused on, as well as things about the village life and the castle itself. I also found the attempts to get Cassandra's father to write to be highly entertaining, particularly the last way they tried. I also enjoyed the characters that, for the most part, weren't involved in the husband-fetching scheme.Really, Cassandra was charismatic enough that she made up for most of the flaws in the story with the way that she told it and in the end, I did enjoy the book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about that time period."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this novel. It seemed less like a novel than a real journal, where I could explore the life of a very interesting, astutue young girl on the cusp of first love. Cassandra and her family are funny, sad and infinitely real. I love the dialogue and also the descriptions of English country life. The first scenes of being down-and-out in a huge castle are beautiful and comic. But the novel moved me most in its moments where Cassandra finds herself desolate and heartbroken, asking God for comfort. This is an exquisite, gentle book. I will pick it up again soon."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was extremely well-written, and quite entertaining. Though at some points in was a little bit boring, for the most part it was very enjoyable. I would not reccomend this book to people who crave action and fast-moving scenes; it is more for people who enjoy quite yet engaging books. I did enjoy Cassandra's charactor a lot, though I also loved that of Simon. A great read for a Sunday afternoon or a rainy day."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle, by Dodie Smith, is really a story about a girl coming of age in a rundown, old English castle in the late 1940's after World War II. Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl, from a poor, eccentric family is trying to polish her skills as a writer by keeping journals. She tries to capture the personalities of those she interacts with and in doing so we get a sense of her own journey to maturity as well as her family's. As different people enter and influence the Mortmain household, it gives reason to reflect on the impact people and new relationships can have on any person.I thought I Capture the Castle was a thoughtful exploration of character. The plot wasn't very fast paced and only possessed, what I would consider, a few major highlights throughout the story, but the intricacies that were given for each character that developed over the course of the book were enough to keep me interested. The way Cassandra's character portrays the world around her is very poetic at times, and also very witty and comical as well. The heroine is instantly likeable and interesting and her personality and her family's personalities keep you turning the page with their sometimes unpredictable and boisterous behavior.My absolute favorite thing about this book is that the author is able to put the simplest, yet sometimes hardest things to describe, in writing. She captures those simple joys and wonders that we all posses and is able to put them in words, which is what made the main character so relatable in the story. One instance of this is when she is day dreaming, or imagining things, like she often would; She said she made herself stop imagining too far because the things you imagine happening usually never come true. Another, smaller example which I thought showed this was when she was recounting a dinner party with some new, wealthy friends. \\"I went through the whole evening - it was almost nicer than when it was actually happening...\\". I appreciated the honesty that the character was able to have because it was a journal; it made the experiences more real throughout the story.This book was written in around 1948, which I believe is one of the causes that the writing style is a little different than most of the contemporary novels that are being written today. This book is beautifully written, but if people are not used to slower moving plots, with heavy emphasis on descriptive passages, I would suggest that this book may not be the best for you. It isn't what we would consider a fast, easy read, but if you can get through it, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My husband would call this \\"another book about British people with repressed emotions.\\" He is basically right--this book is very much in the spirit of Jane Austen (as the characters point out at several points in the story). The plot is completely character driven and, while interesting, lacks the grandeur of Austen.Though it wasn't neccessarilly a bad book, I was left with the feeling that I would have rather spent my time rereading Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think the perfect time to read this book is when you are about 13, but I re-read it a few years ago, and still loved it. I bought the book most recently for my 13 year old niece. The narrator of the story is a teen-age girl who lives with her siblings, her brilliant but disturbed father and wonderfully eccentric step-mother in a crumbling castle in 1930s England. The family is on the brink of really going under, financially and emotionally, when two handsome brothers move into the near-by manor house and everything changes. I certainly found the characters and the plot totally believable when I was 13, and it really seemed to all still ring true when I re-read it as an adult."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In the 1930s teenaged Cassandra lives in a dilapidated old castle in the English countryside with her older sister, Rose, her younger brother, Thomas, her eccentric father, Mortmain, and his bride/muse, Topaz, and of course, the former maid's son, Stephen. The supposed romance of living in a castle is quickly debunked and the reader sees all is not well - the father has not even attempted to work for years and the family is on the verge of starvation. The action really starts when their landlord dies and ownership passes to his two young and handsome American nephews.This novel is told in the form of Cassandra's journals, and very endearingly conveys her experiences trying to deal with her constricted existence, her bizarre family, and first love. I could not put this down and thoroughly enjoyed it... however, I could not help the occasional thought that another author would have made this story side-splittingly funny."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable story of two families in rural England in the first half of the 20th Century. And I agree with the cover quote from J.K.

Cassandra is undoubtedly a character that belongs in the same category as Jane Eyre and Elizabeth Bennet: all three women are strong and not easily \\"broken\\" by money, men, or influence. Cassandra is intelligent but not pompous, reserved but unafraid to be blunt and direct. She has a sense of duty to her father and to her sister which I very much admire.This would make a great gift for a girl who is around 16/17. It's a very, very good book.Writing: 5/5Characters: 5/5Plot: 5/5"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just finished this - thought it was great.

There are a ton of surprises in store, and the novel ends quite modernly. I did feel there were a few weaknesses, however, mostly in explaining relationships between characters that came out of nowhere. All the same, the book was great, and I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a fantastic book. Touching, funny, realistic...a depiction of first love that probably anyone can place themselves in. One of the best books I've read in a long time. I checked it out from the library, but I know I'm going to buy it. This is a book I could read probably every year, and I have to REALLY like a book to want to do that! Even if you are older than Cassandra (I'm only two years older than her now, but I'm referring to people even older than that), you can really feel with her and relate to her experiences. Excellent. A must read for anyone. This is somewhat what I imagine Jane Austen would have written had she lived in the 1940s."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life in the castle for Cassandra Mortmain has been a hard one lately since no more money is coming in from her father's only bestseller. When two young American boys inherit the mansion neighboring the Mortmain's castle, Cassandra's life and her sister Rose's will change drastically. Dodie Smith uses seventeen-year-old Cassandra's journal for the narrative perspective that creates a fresh, but sometimes cynical view of life. Ms. Smith utilizes foreshadowing in the beginning of the novel as Cassandra hoists her sister up to try to wish on the gargoyle high up above one of the castles windows. The reader never finds out exactly what Rose wishes for, but one can assume it is for a better life or just good fortune to come to her and her family. Rose's wishing foreshadows that the Mortmain's lives do take a turn for the better when the neighbors move in. The Midsummer Rights ceremonies that Cassandra and Rose perform symbolize their immaturity and innocence, as time goes on in the novel, the reader notices changes in the ceremonies as the girls get older and those changes show how they're characters have aged and matured. The castle in which the Mortmains live represents their unique lifestyle. Ms. Smith places the Mortmain family in a castle because without this unique setting the Mortmain family would not be half as intriguing or interesting. I enjoyed this book very much and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys coming of age novels that have a fresh view of the world and that let the reader enter the novel as if the reader were truly there in the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful coming of age story! It is the story of the Mortmain family, as seen through the eyes of 17 year old Cassandra, as she chronicles her and her family's life in a series of journals. The family is one step from poverty, living in a falling down castle, when Neil and Simon Scoatney arrive from America. The Scoatney's live in the manor down the road, and actually own the castle Cassandra's family is leasing. Once they arrive, things begin to change for the Mortmains. Rose, Cassandra's sister, is determined to marry one of the brothers, hopefully to lift her family out of poverty. The Father of the family, once a brilliant writer, is reclusive and non-communicative, until Mrs. Scoatney gets a hold of him! Topaz, the girls' step-mother, is beautiful in an unconventional way, plays the lute, and communes with nature in the buff. As Cassandra chronicles the goings-on of life in the castle, she tries to &quot;capture&quot; her life and her family on paper, in hopes of understanding who she is and what it means to be a part of her family. The author's rich descriptions of the castle and the surrounding countryside are so vivid and lush, I felt as if I was there, in the story, with Cassandra."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Don't be fooled by the cliches. There's a lot more going on in this book than &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;charming.&quot; It's a brutally honest tale of a 17 year old girl coming out of that self-involvement phase and getting a good first look at the world around her. And it tackles the concept of understanding and portraying beauty in a very effective manner. Her father's puzzle exemplifies the puzzle of the novel....you have to pace through the book with Cassandra to get from point A to point B. There's no flipping straight to B for enlightenment. You must take the full journey.But it's a quirky, charming journey nonetheless. :)"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This has to be my very favourite book. Cassandra is really easy to relate to, at the end of the book you are left longing for more of her thoughts and witty observations. This book captures its characters so well, that you could walk straight into the book and feel quite at home!The cover of this book does really not do it justice. I bought a different copy which had a picture of Cassandra writing her journal by the castle in the evening light, with warm orange colours, this is perphaps more suited to the magic and warmness of the book.Okay, so living in a castle and having rich guys come round bringing money with them seems a little convient and unrealistic, but the fantastic way in which this book is written persuades you that this could be a true story, with all its characters being believable and lovable.Face it, we all hate one romance after another in a book, with more mood swings then you can count, but Dodie Smith has exactly the right balance of romance, comedy, and emotion. It does have you crying in parts of the book, but nothing else is expected when you become so involved with the each of the characters.It is set at a time that isn't too far back that we cannot realate to it, but is far back enough to have a touching innocense, that creates a pleasant enviroment for its reader that modern stories simply do not have.Overall, I would say this is an excellent read, the best thing about it being its characters, and warmth. Read it as soon as you can, this is certainly a timeless book that should not be missed."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a delight of a book. Written in the form of a seventeen year old girl's journal, over the period of six months during which her life and that of her (rather unusual) family change dramatically, this novel introduces us to one of the most likeable voices in fiction. Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring writer, keeps the journal to hone her skills; she ends up, rather, getting to know herself and her surroundings better. Smith manages to keep her reader's interest effortlessly (or so it seems, though the hints given by Mr. Mortmain's struggles may indicate otherwise), through a carefully rationed supply of surprises, small suspenses, and the sheer curiosity she has created about the future of the Mortmain family. The most frustrating (though perhaps most amusing for Smith) part of the thing is that Mr. Mortmain is an author himself, the highly regarded author of a book of fiction, poetry, experiments, called &quot;Jacob's Wrestling&quot; that figures in &quot;Capture,&quot; but we are given tantalisingly little information about it. I expect Smith enjoyed doing that to us; i know i would. Though it has the feel of a juvenile book (the narrator is seventeen, it's about [among other things] first loves), this is an adult book; though teenagers can read and enjoy it, more will be discovered by the active adult reader."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the most incredible book--it is an example of the way a book should be written. It is very hard to say something that hasn't already been said . . .this book has been receiving accolades for nearly half a century, and rightfully so. As a fan of Jane Austen, I found myself thinking throughout the book that if Jane were alive in the 1940's, this was what she would have written. It has everything--adventure, romance, humor, and a little bit of philosophizing thrown in for good measure. It is one of those books that when you finish it, you find yourself sad that it ended, and wanting to open it right back up and start again. If you are looking for a great rainy Sunday afternoon in front of the fire novel, a great reading on the airplane novel, or a just plain great novel, pick this up. You won't be sorry you did."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of those books that you can just &quot;fall into.&quot; The observations of Cassandra are insightful and delightful. The setting in time and place is a joy. The characters are, for the most part, well-drawn and interesting. My only complaint is that the ending came too fast. This is one of those optimistic books that you never want to leave. Try it as an antidote for the daily news.

To him, it was a bargain; to me, it was magic. It is a wonderful tale, filled with charming eccentrics. One of the things I like best about it is that that the characters aren't static. Not only does the story develop, but so do the personalities in it.

How wonderful that it has been reprinted so that my adult children can discover this enchanting tale for themselves."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this book, having chosen it for its title, and it's one of the best coincidences that's ever happened to me. I devoured it in two days and was then stunned to discover that it was written in the first half of the last century; it could have been written today.The author deftly combines wit, humor, and empathy to deliver a well-developed picture of the narrator Cassandra's life. Cassandra is wonderfully real and insightful as she tries to \\"capture\\" in her writing the events that take place around her. It's a book about family, love, and growing up, and I don't think it will ever grow outdated."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first heard about I Capture the Castle a few months ago, when it kept showing up on people's \\"favorite\\" lists. Interested to see what all the fuss was about, I bought a copy for myself...and was not disappointed.The book is written from Cassandra Mortmain's point of view...actually, the book is her journal. We see through her eyes her very eccentric family, which includes her odd and lazy father, her free-spirited stepmother, self-serving sister Rose, and stoic brother Thomas. Also living in their home with them is their \\"servant\\" Stephen. They all live in a crumbling old castle that is romantic as well as slightly creepy. They live very isolated, and on the brink of financial ruin when the rich Cottons move next door--two bachelor brothers and their mother from America.The descriptions of the ruined castle and the surrounding English countryside are superb, and my favorite part of the book. I also thought the author did a great job of seeing things through Cassandra's eyes.One thing I'd like to comment on--and other reviewers have mentioned this as well--is that at times the characters can get on your nerves. Rose in particular doesn't have many redeeming qualities, and (in my opinion), Mr.Mortmain had none. Even Cassandra acts supremely selfish and immature through out the book--I often felt she was 14/15 instead of 17/18. But, I kept reminding myself that things were different back in the 1930s, and didn't let it detract from my love of the book."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read this book because it is in the BBC big read list, and I loved it.

Even thought I usually dont like books that doesnt tell me exactly what will happen to the character, but this one is an exception because it made me always think of the charatcters and what might happen to them.Casandra is a really special character and you just feel like you are living with her when you read the book, she was just like a friend to me whom I have known for ages.I would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoy reading diaries and romance. Their are also many parts that will make you laught.I would say get it and have fun reading it. You will love it!!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a gem of a book! &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is a magnificent coming-of-age book, which reminded me of the best of the Brontes, &quot;Little Women&quot; and Jane Austen. It is just so good...Cassandra, the 17-year old heroine, lives with her well-born family in near poverty in a castle in England. Her father, a true English eccentric, once wrote a bestseller--but that was a long time ago. Her sister, Rose, is a beauty with ambition--to marry well. Her stepmother Topaz, a kindhearted and beautiful soul, trudges into London to pose nude for artists and bring income into this colorful crew.Cassandra dreams of becoming a writer. When two rich American brothers and their mother move in next door, well she believes that she has found her heroes and her story. And so indeed a story, actually several stories unfold into wonderful tales of adventure and romance in 1930's England. You see the world of well-born bohemians, subtle class snobberies, interwar London and lots of romance through the eyes of the young Cassandra. You also see-and feel-Cassandra maturing and growing into a woman through her experiences.I would recommend this book highly to individuals (most likely women) who enjoy coming-of-age stories, romances, and English life tales in the interwar period. A warning: this book is very well-written, but well-written through the eyes of a 17-year old. That may not be your taste--other reviewers have found it a young person's book. Yes it is--but you don't have to be young in years to enjoy it."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The thing about this book is its unique voice. Tied up in the first person narrative of a seventeen year old girl keeping a journal so to hone her writing skills, \\"capturing\\" dialogue, character and action is a groundswell of comedy, cultural satire and dramatic irony, not to mention some sharp insights about love and coming of age. There are whiffs of a number of literary forebears and contemporaries such as Nancy Mitford, William Dean Howells, Shakespeare, P.G. Wodehouse, Stella Gibbons, and Jane Austen, but thanks to the inimitable voice of Cassandra Mortmain, this reads as if it were the first story about mixed up love or sisters whose once well-established family has fallen on sore times.The plot, so much as can be easily and fairly revealed: between the wars in rural Suffolk, the Mortmain family lives in a 13th century ruin of a leaky castle that was somewhat fixed up in the 17th century, with some remuddling by the Victorians. The father is a one-book genius who after an unfortunate moment with a cake knife, the humor of which escaped the judge, entered into writer's block. There have been no residuals from the book in some time. The household he is not supporting also consists of Cassandra's bohemian stepmother Topaz, Cassandra's older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen, the orphaned son of their former maid who has a crush on Cassandra and is also the only one in the household who is capable of producing the slightest income. The women troop about in odd costumes made from disintegrating wardrobes. For Cassandra, this is simply the way it is, and for Rose, it is a horror from which to escape. Enter the wealthy American heirs of the recently deceased landlord, two brothers and their family dynamics. A number of plot lines take off: Will both Rose and Cassandra find true love and with whom? Will father write again? Will Cassandra figure out what makes people tick, an essential component to writing? The plot complications are endless.This is smart, unsentimental, and often very funny. The secondary characters are well-defined and a hoot, too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My friend recommended the movie, and I went to the web and found its website, which intrigued me into finding a used copy on amazon.com. I also did investigations into the other writings of Dodie Smith, and was entranced to know that her fame came largely from \\"101 Dalmatians\\".Well, my trade paperback copy arrived and I immediately plunged into the tale of the crazy family of Cassandra Mortmain, the story teller, and their state of poverty of the upper class in England. Actually, it is amazing that her father, James, a one book author now stymied by writer's block, should submit his second wife and three children to such an austere life, one that is supported by the son of a now deceased housekeeper that the family took in during better times.Cassandra's sister, Rose, plots to marry the property's rich owner, which leads one into an examination of the truth of intentions: money over poverty in the guise of love. And the seduction of Simon Cotton, landed gentry with American background, gives Cassandra quite a tale to tell.Cassandra is the love object of Stephen, the serving woman's son. And she dodges his determined suit, though touchingly receiving his gifts. His dedication to the Mortmains and to Cassandra in particular parallels a knight who serves the damsel in tales of old.There is remarkable strength in the character of lively Topaz, James Mortmain's second, and much younger, wife. She truly holds the family together, and the three Mortmain children seem to respect her as a step-mother who is not much older than they. In fact, the whole Mortmain family is oddity personified; yet, they are deliciously quirky and enjoyable. The setting of Scoatney Castle and the remains in which they live, horribly cold in winter, lacking light and adequate food, but rich in spring and summer, is as much a character as any of the cast.And the American heirs, the Cottons, contrast with the very English Mortmains in social customs and income. The lavish circumstances that Rose enjoys with Simon's family once they go to London gives off visions of a lively between-the-wars British society in dazzling costumes of the 1920's and '30's.I am so glad that I ordered this book. It kept me reading day and night for a couple of days. It swept me into Cassandra's world and into a vivid period of her coming of age. The honesty of its telling made it even more delightful.Now, I am ready to see the movie. I only hope it holds up to Dodie Smith's original book. If it fails, I still have my personal vision of the novel to satisfy me.

A year later, I can close my eyes and see myself as Cassandra, performing my Midsummer's Eve rituals.This book is utterly charming, without becoming drippy. The characters are gritty and real enough to keep from falling into stereotypes. On the one hand, the story is a conventional fairy tale of marrying off daughters to handsome, moneyed boys and solving the poor family's financial crisis, but on the other hand it is completely UNconventional, allowing the narrator to have very un-fairy tale-like thoughts and experiences.I am delighted to see this book back in print!

The narrator, Cassandra, is a girl on the brink of womanhood in the middle of a sad and terribly amusing dysfunctional family.

It is beautifully written with an amazing sense of place, atmosphere and character. Who couldn't fall in love with Cassandra with her quick wit, intelligence and unconventional outlook? I have rarely read such an unpatronising, accurate and positive account of a girl on the brink of adulthood. Read ICTC for the cleverly constructed plot.

(If you want a taste of author Dodie Smith's ability to write funny characters, bear in mind she is also the author of \\"101 Dalmations\\").Two wealthy American brothers move in next door; although they are initially blinded by sister Rose's classic beauty, eventually one of them (I won't say which) sees the depth of character behind the narrator, the more sincere and thoughtful Cassandra.Cassandra is an enchanting narrator (the book is a series of first-person entries into her journal) - she is witty, self-effacing, and completely authentic. The reader will absolutely believe she is a real, irreplacable person.I was so enamored of Cassandra that at first I worried for her when she fell in love - I was worried about a too-convenient fairy-tale ending. But happily the \\"happily ever after\\" is replaced by a more intriguing end; Cassandra's final decision is perfectly consistent with her chracter.I only wish I had read this when I was, like her, a teenager - it would have meant a lot to me to meet a character so ambitious, energetic, lively, funny, who still clearly has romance in her future."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring author, is keeping a journal in which she chronicles her life in a ramshackle old English castle. Life is not easy for the Mortmains. Most of the family's possessions and furnishings have been sold off, they do without electricity, and there is barely enough to eat. In spite of all this, the family keeps a cheerful outlook and manages to get by, thanks in part to the generosity of the wealthy American Cotton family who has inherited the estate upon which the castle sits and who have taken the Mortmains under their wing.The Mortmains are an offbeat family. Cassandra has flights of fancy and unusual schemes that often have unexpected results. Father, an eccentric and innovative writer, is suffering from severe writer's block and can no longer support the family. He spends his time holed up in the gatehouse reading novels. Stepmother Topaz is a flighty artist's model who enjoys roaming the estate in the buff. Cassandra's older sister Rose is tired of living hand-to-mouth, and she decides to find a way to marry the landlord's wealthy grandson. Handsome Stephen, a hired hand who stays on with the family even though the Mortmains cannot afford to pay him, has difficulty hiding his unrequited love for Cassandra.First published in 1948 and set in the 1930s, the story has an old-fashioned feel to it, especially on the subject of courtship and marriage. It also highlights the cultural differences at that time between the Americans and the British. Possessing a wisdom and maturity beyond her years, Cassandra spends much time analyzing the people and events that surround her and then recording her observations. &quot;Contemplation,&quot; she says, &quot;seems to be about the only luxury that costs nothing.&quot; Through her journals, Cassandra's voice is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always endearing as she describes her concerns, her hopes, and her first love. &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; is recommended for both young adults and adults as a warm coming-of-age story.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After I read a very short synopsis of this book, I knew it was a MUST HAVE. The only dissapointment was that it was not long enough. Cassandra Mortmain makes you want to be seventeen again.

It is a story about growing up, getting on, and making do. The fact that it is set in a ruined castle on the English countryside just drags the reader in deeper and deeper into Cassandra's realm.I read the book in two sittings, then I passed it on to my best friend.

It may well have been the last reference to the comfort of religion which my friend read, which is felicitious; for she reminded me much of the main character in her views on God and religion.I am grateful to be granted the grace of giving my friend the pleasure of such an enchanting \\"last novel\\".

I've heard people criticize the ending, which certainly does not tie it all up in a neat resolution, but to me, that's a strength of the book: you feel that the characters can continue beyond the last page, because their futures are in doubt, and you can conjecture to your heart's delight about what might happen to them."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Dodie Smith may be best-known as the author of The One Hundred and One Dalmatians, but she was the author of many hit West End plays and several best-selling books.

Will Mortmain ever write again? Will Cassandra's swain kiss her in the bluebell wood?

I really don't think \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" could be improved upon in any way.And it gets better from there.I accidentally saw the movie first- which you should NEVER do. Seven-eighths of the charm of this story is in the first-person narration. The plotline itself is not all that impressive. In fact, when I explained the basic gist to Josh, it sounded a bit like a trashy grocery-store novel. Which proves, I guess, that you can never judge a book by its outline.It is the diary of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra's author father got a 40-year lease on a crumbling old castle in the English countryside, because he felt its romantic essence would spark his dried-up creative juices. On the contrary, his writer's block stretches over two decades, and the family's income dwindles to nothing. Cassandra and her sister Rose spend most of their time imagining their lives differently, until, one day, two wealthy brothers move into a nearby mansion.The ensuing drama unfolds in a predictable manner; but you won't mind, because the telling is so delicious. Cassandra's perspective brings so much whimsy and honesty and real-life-ness to an otherwise cliched and lachrymose tale. Each gleaming insight, every subtly hilarious description, along with the book's vaguely silly characters, adds up into an artfully winsome experience- a bittersweet yet somehow enormously enjoyable read.

During the spring, summer, and autumn months spanned by the story, she pens a diary that describes her first adult lessons about love, sisterhood, and friendship. Although the voice is believably adolescent, the lessons Cassandra learns are completely adult.\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is beautiful in every way a book should be. It's gentle without being sappy, humorous without being mocking, gorgeously (although a bit painstakingly) written without digressing into flights of narcissistic prose. The narrator is both an ordinary child and an extraordinary woman, and her greatest strength as a character is the believability of her weakness. The other characters are interesting and unusual and completely human. The setting, a barely-refurbished medieval castle, is very nearly a character in its own right, and it informs and interacts with the story in a way I've rarely seen outside of the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The book, with all of its lyricism and innocence and wise optimism, teaches a gentle and almost invisible lesson. It's about learning to love fairly and accept love gracefully, about being faithful to your friends even when it hurts, about who constitutes a family and how one goes about caring for them, about how growing up is not the end of a the road but the beginning. It's not a new lesson, but it's one we all need to learn a little more.But \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is more than a beautiful book, and more than a lesson. It's an experience. It's as if Jane Austen had been reborn 130 years later and rewritten \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with a compassion and magic her original work missed. Or as if \\"Little Women\\" had been written for adults: just as so many little girls start their own \\"Pickwick Papers\\" and take to eating apples in attics after reading Alcott's book, after reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\" I wanted to find a ruin in Britain, fit it with indoor plumbing, and spend the timeless days of summer sitting in the tower and penning a journal of my own days and dreams and loves."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you like Roahl Dahl or Stella Gibbons, then you will most definitely like this book.

I like novels written as journals, because the characters and their stories become so much more personal. Cassandra's journal makes me want to write."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain has asked for very few things in life: that her family would never reach that point known as abject starvation, that her father rouse himself enough to pick the pen up once again, and that no one turn them away from that tumbledown heap of ruins called the Castle (and more familiarly known as \`home'). Even if they are practically *un*paying tenants.Sensible, fiercely affectionate towards her beautiful (if slightly temperamental) elder sister, Rose, and aware of the infinite magnanimity of the world as compared to the transience of one person's existence, she takes each day as it comes and never lets herself become *too* jaded as another dusk unfurls into another dawn, their family's fortunes seemingly not ever showing signs of taking a turn for the good. There is simple joy to be had in finding a spot atop Belmotte Tower, with a view of the wheat field spread all around glinting drunkenly from the sun's rays, and jotting down into her journal both the curious and innocuous happenings in her and her family's life.It is, however, with the somewhat surreal introduction of the brothers Simon and Neil Cotton that tumble Cassandra's relatively peaceful existence into disarray.As coming-of-age novels go, I would admit to not immediately seeing \\"I Capture the Castle\\" as one. In some respects, I was more riveted with the bits of quirks inherent in the story. There is the paradox of the cold isolation and the elegant deterioration of the Castle itself. Half-standing walls vie for the same space as ivy creepers which lend the estate a sedate kind of beauty. Mists that come out of nowhere can enshroud the ruins like something out of a gothic tableau, while the next sunny day bathes those same walls with a warm, comfortable glow.The characters themselves are a walking contradiction. The elder Mortmain sister, Rose, while blessed with looks, is filled more with bitterness for their dismal state of affairs. Their scrumptious stepmother, the glitteringly-named Topaz, has nocturnal forays atop the ramparts clad only in her nightgown, her \`commune with nature' an oddity that is aptly fitting with *her* own nature. And yet she has managed to keep this family from totally unraveling.Cassandra's father, who long-ago wrote a novel considered a masterpiece by the literary community (the contents of which are tantalizingly never fully disclosed), has now hit a wall and refuses to budge. He passes his days more like a hermit, his head up in the clouds, while his family is sunk deep in the ground with poverty. The only times there's a hint of animated life in his eyes is when he is quizzed by outsiders as to when they should expect his next novel.His response is a snarl.Simon Cotton is born in England but bred on the other side of the Atlantic, the resulting strange accent befuddling Cassandra at first. And if that were not enough, the jarringly peculiar and menacing dark beard he sports is at odds with someone his age, oftentimes preventing people from noticing how generous and kind he really is. His younger brother, Neil, is the full-blooded American. Jocular at one second, and brooding in the next. His American bent obvious in the sometimes faintly jeering attitude he has towards anything English. And yet he is quick to seek pardon if he thinks he has caused offense.Cassandra's encounter with these Americans and their ways of thinking would almost always rattle her, compelling her to remark silently that \\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"Then there's our young narrator. On the whole, content with her lot in life, yet she would not shirk from any opportunity that might just turn the fates in their favor. She is even-tempered and more tolerant than most, her vow to be a good writer (or, at least, a credible chronicler of the Mortmain family drama) making her an exceptional observer of events. On the outset, she knows her family more than, it seems, they know themselves. And yet, as the novel unfolds, she would find herself wondering just how much she might have misread the people around her.And, perhaps, even herself.Subtly engaging, unexpectedly poignant at times, and even witty with its bouts of one-liner maxims, Dodie Smith carves out a heroine worth adoring. Cassandra is on that ambiguous threshold of being a young girl who should have had so many teenage thrills as befits someone growing up, and being swayed headlong into full womanhood, as evidenced by the unnerving introspection she has had on occasion to indulge in. She can laugh and lark about just like any young, carefree kid, but she is also highly-sensitive of the feelings of others and is often crippled with annoyance with herself and with another person if they should cause her discomfort for being concerned over *them* in the first place.Unquestionably proud of her family, she could also be thrown into pits of despair and mortification when one of them commits a faux pas in front of \`sociable' company. More than once she has had to be the mature one among her relatives, while, at the same time, inwardly shaking with trepidation or embarrassment.And it is with the unfurling of the first seeds of romantic love that she realizes the depths of her passion. She discovers a side of her nature that would cause her joy as well as grief. She may look unchanged on the outside but within there brews a turmoil the likes of which just might shake the very foundation of all that she has held eternal.And what she fears most is the uncertainty of *who* might emerge by the time this havoc settles.A tour de force, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" would ensnare one's attention with a quietly plucky heroine. There are no high-blazing action scenes or spine-tingling suspenseful moments in this novel, but the unhurried exploits and simply clever insights in life make this a veritable treasure."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a great story narrated by a teenager, Cassandra Mortmain, who sets out to capture the crumbling castle she lives in with her family in a series of notebooks. Also living in the castle are Rose, her sardonic older sister, Thomas, her brother, her father, a writer whose first novel, Jacob Wrestling, is followed by years of writer's block, her step-mother Topaz, a flighty former model and Stephen, the eighteen year old son of their former maid who had nowhere to go when his mother died, now does odd jobs for the family and has a crush on Cassandra.The family becomes involved with two brothers from America, Simon and Neil, who inherit the castle they live in and the surrounding estate. They court the two sisters and through her involvement with them, Cassandra comes of age.Dodie Smith gives Cassandra a really unique and authentic voice with a strong personality and witty and somewhat innocent outlook on life. The story and the characters are charming with a very humorous cast of eccentric English characters. I was a bit sorry to see Rose, the older sister, lose her acerbic and hopeless attitude when one of the Americans begins courting her. And the ending was a little bittersweet with some desires left unfulfilled when Cassandra reaches maturity and gains the wisdom that comes from experience. Both the characters and the castle were great fun to be around."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Even if you've seen the film, please take the time to read this charming novel.

Dodie Smith, more famously remembered for her children's classic 101 Dalmatians, has humorously assembled an eccentric cast of characters living in less than genteel poverty in a crumbling castle in England. The story is revealed through 17-year old heroine in the making and aspiring writer Cassandra Mortmain in a series of journals, an she attempt to improve her skills as a ticket out of her dire circumstances. Her sister Rose will use more avarice means to free herself from her parent's neglect by setting her cap for their wealthy new landlord Simon, and easily succeeds. Less of a schemer, Cassandra is attracted to his younger brother Neil and is hopeful for her own romance. As the wedding plans proceed, Rose's vain and selfish nature blossoms with her newly elevated social position causing conflict. Cassandra, left out of the plans and Simon, who Rose is treating as an annoyance are drawn into their own romance. Rose, on the other hand, is drifting away from Simon and secretly into the arms of his brother Neil. An elopement will cause a family panic, a change of heart and an unusual ending.Filled with allusions to Pride and Prejudice, this coming of age story is more a gentle nod to Austen's style than a copy of her novel. Witty and moving, Smith connects with readers through perceptive observation played against dry wit resulting in a moving and memorable story. It's what makes for great literature, and also what Austen is valued for today.

Whenever I need a book gift for a child I do not know very well, I give GOODNIGHT MOON to young children, and I CAPTURE THE CASTLE to older children. It is loved by both girls and boys alike.

This is one of my favorite books; I, too, have read it over and over. I don't quite understand why I love this book so deeply. Yes, it's beautifully written, with a very real main character and a story that both celebrates romantic convention and twists it into some surprising knots. It's a strange and wonderful combination of psychological reality with a wildly improbable plot and some very weird supporting characters.

I ordered a copy and thought it might please me, although I thought it would never compare to Jane Austen or Fanny Burney. I began to read it, and was shocked at how well it was written, and in first person journal form. I immediately fell in love with the style of writing, but also with the main characters. This book has a little bit of everything, despair, romance, a coming of age story, a dysfunctional family, lies and deceit, pain and loss, mental illness, different settings. I read it twice, and then told all of my close friends to read it. I went on amazon and ordered copies and had them sent to my friends across the country. I couldn't believe that a book written by the same woman who wrote 101 Dalmations could be this good of a coming of age story for teens and adults.

In beautiful England! With an eccentric family! With handsome, mysterious, new neighbors?? Perfect!! I am saving my copy for my daughter so we can read it together one day!"},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my book club. The glowing reviews on amazon captured my imagination and did not prepare me for the disappointment ahead. I think the book might be truly appealing...if you are younger than sixteen. For a middle-aged mother of college students, the love-starved 17-year old Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine totally at the mercy of her heart, left me untouched.The author did a wonderful job of capturing teen-age angst over unrequited love, but none of the characters were what I would call appealing, or even mildly sympathetic. Cassandra Mortmain, the heroine whose journal we as readers are privvy to, lives in an ancient castle with her father, step-mother, brother, and sister. The family is now dirt poor thanks to a writer father who was a one-hit wonder and does nothing now but hole up in his private gatehouse. The sister is busy batting her eyelashes as she really wants to marry a wealthy man who will save her from her life of poverty and the brother is never completely developed, though we do get inklings near the end that he may be the most normal of the family. Only the stepmother has any desire to help herself. While the rest of the family consider themselves too good to do an honest day's work, the stepmother travels to London and earns money as an artist's model. The others had rather sit home and munch on old bread crusts while bemoaning their plight. It was really hard for me to empathize with such a group.The book is very reminiscent of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" though it is set later, in 1940's England. It is very much a coming of age story of a young girl who, through the course of the novel, finds love, loses love, rejects love, and yet \\"captures\\" all the feelings and characters around her as she spends hour after hour writing in her journal as an exercise in teaching herself how to write.In the opening pages, Cassandra tells the reader that she will capture all the conversations, feelings, and characters in her life. That she does, but for this reader, it was a disappointing story that failed to interest me."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I devoured the beginning and couldn't wait to finish. The characters were eccentric and amusing; I found myself easily caught up in wondering what it would be like to meet the bohemian Topaz, sturdy Thomas, bold Neil, and innocent Cassandra. The descriptions were also marvelously evocative of a madcap family amidst a quaint life of genteel poverty. But then Cassandra's journal writing started getting bogged down since the imagery was written at an adult level, but the entries moved from descriptive passages to an adolescent emotional level. It was understandable because Cassandra was so naive but I believe I might have enjoyed it more if I were able to identify with or be interested in all the angst of who loved whom and who was doomed to disappointment in the maze of Stephen loves Cassandra loves Simon loves Rose loves Neil. Mainly I was VERY dissatisfied at the ending since there was no closure and I thought the last chapter was missing. What happens to Cassandra? What about Stephen? What about Simon? What about ...?Simon to Cassandra, \\"Because it's the essence of an enigma that one must solve it for oneself.\\" Very apt."},{"Title":"I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While enjoyable, this book is overrated.

The narrator/main character is twee, irritating and too dominant when drawing out the other characters in the book. Her voice is never lost. There are a few nice passages but they often seem coloured a bit too brightly and don't quite hit the mark.Of all the varied books I have read in the last 5 years, this has to be the worst. It may stand as a \\"piece of its time\\" but there are other better books out there. I won't outline the ridiculous \\"intersecting love triangle\\" plot as it's described well in other reviews.

He uses visual education by making the letters into animals and people that the letter resembles. And he also uses good repetition after introducing the letter by using phrases that have the perticular letter in it and he highlights the letter used to make it stand out for the child. This book makes learning the alphabet fun and easy. It is original and playful, but what book with curious george isn't?"},{"Title":"CURIOUS GEORGE LEARNS THE ALPHABET","review":"In H. A. Rey's Curious George Learns the Alphabet, the man in the yellow hat teaches George how to read. George learns each of the letters of the alphabet as the man in the yellow hat relates both the upper- and lower-case letters to an object it resembles, starting with the letter. So, \\"A\\" is the open mouth of an alligator, while \\"a\\" is a piece of an apple; \\"M\\" is a mailman and \\"m\\" is a mouse; \\"R\\" is a rabbit and \\"r\\" is a rooster. Each letter receives a two-page spread. The illustrations are typical Rey drawings with a great deal of personality; within the object representing the letter, the form of the letter is easily recognizable, superimposed on the object with thick black lines. Some of the letter-objects are a little peculiar, but children who are just learning that letters represent sounds and objects will delight in the wacky illustrations of a spotted \\"J\\"-bodied jaguar, a man with an \\"n\\" for a nose, and the \\"q\\"-headed quarterback. The narrative lessons on letters are interrupted a few times with interludes for George to play football and buy doughnuts. Beneath the illustrations, each time the featured letter appears in the text (whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the word), it is highlighted with color. In the story, George and the man in the yellow hat helpfully model the instructional process. Although focused on letters and their shapes, because this book also tells a story, Curious George Learns the Alphabet offers a good way to first introduce the concept of letters, sounds, and words to children who are not yet focused directly on the alphabet. More advanced readers will also be able to focus on letter sounds and letters in the context of words and sentences."},{"Title":"CURIOUS GEORGE LEARNS THE ALPHABET","review":"This is an excellent learning tool for young children to learn to read ABC.

My 3 year old daughter is a special needs child but identifies with the little monkey's enthusiasm and ability to get into trouble.I as thrilled when I found this book because it is a favorite character that can keep her attention. She loves to look at the pictures as I read it and this one is a little longer than some of the others but the author took the time to make each letter into animals, plants, or objects that begin with that sound.This book wasn't just educational and breaks the letters into phonetics but fun. :)"},{"Title":"CURIOUS GEORGE LEARNS THE ALPHABET","review":"This book is different from the rest of the classic Curious George series, because it is primarily devoted to introducing each letter of the alphabet by transforming the letter into an animal or other object. This device makes the letters memorable, and many of the letter-pictures are accompanied by sidebar-style scenes and commentary in the margin. There is just enough humor to help retain interest, as George takes breaks to make up silly words, play football, and go out for doughnuts (mischievously changing the Man in the Yellow Hat's note from \\"One dozen\\" to \\"ten dozen.\\") But this is really an alphabet lesson disguised as a story, and might not be a big hit with children who aren't ready to learn the alphabet.One nice feature is that the authors have made sure the letter in focus appears frequently in the explanatory text, and have used color to highlight each instance of it. This makes the text a bit contrived, but it does help the fledgling reader see how the letters he or she is learning are used to create the words of the story.While this book shouldn't be the primary introduction to the letters of the alphabet, it is a good supplement for an alphabet lesson, especially for children who have enjoyed the other Curious George books."},{"Title":"CURIOUS GEORGE LEARNS THE ALPHABET","review":"Make sure to read this full review.It's a bit long for a curious george story.

At age 34, Ballou seemed destined for a distinguished political career. A talented lawyer in sympathy with the anti slavery Republican Party, he had already served one term as a state legislator and made an unsuccessful run for statewide office as attorney general. Shortly after the outbreak of war, Ballou volunteered for a three year term of duty defending the Union. With 20 years experience in the state militia, he received a commission as major, third in command of the Second Rhode Island Volunteers. Young follows the course of the regiment's recruitment, training and movement to Washington in the late spring and early summer of 1861, drawing heavily on documents of the time. As the crisis grew, it was soon clear to everyone that the federal army would soon invade Virginia, and the Confederates would resist. On July 21, the armies met along Bull Run, a broad creek near Manassas. Early in the action, Ballou was rallying his troops from horseback when a cannonball struck him. Evacuated to a makeshift hospital in a nearby church, he underwent amputation of a leg as the battle raged. When the beaten Union army withdrew, Ballou, (along with other Union wounded) was taken prisoner. He died a few days later. The vast amount of material about Ballou's times, his career, his death and the fate of his widow slowly accumulates to create a broad canvas of mid-19th century America as well as a searching portrait of a tragic victim of war.An emotionally focused tale enriched by a remarkable level of detail.

The background information on him and his wife certainly adds to the poignancy of the famous letter and makes you understand where all those tender feelings stem from.This is an excellent primer on the antebellum and war time eras; lots of information on custom, mores and traditions.

It is a book to enjoy very much and on various levels.

Within each chapter are bounteous treasures tucked in by way of nuggets of information not normally discovered in such work. Loey Sanchez"},{"Title":"For Love and Liberty: The Untold Civil War Story of Major Sullivan Ballou and His Famous Love Letter","review":"The book is indeed \\"exhaustively researched.\\" It should have used exhaustive editing. Much of the first part of the book is dedicated to the Ballou and Shumway families - and really have nothing to do with Sullivan Ballou or Sarah Shumway Ballou, except that it gives background to the two of them. This background certainly has little to do with their personal relationship, and strikes me as \\"filler.\\" Having said that, if you are interested in the geneology of these people, basic Rhode Island history, or antebellum mores, then this book is for you.If you are interested in the letter itself, I would mention that the author does not even reach the point at which Ballou joined the Union army until chapter ten, and much of chapter ten is dedicated to Ballou's thought process in making the decision to join (the chapter begins on page 229, and Ballou does not accept his appointment until page 251). Discussion of the letter read in Ken Burns' Civil War is not reached until page 367, although the letter is printed in its entirety in the introduction. While this does make some sense, in that the letter was not written until a week before Ballou's death, it is staggering to realize that the book is 782 pages long (text only), and the letter is introduced halfway through. This is because the author spends several chapters on troop movements of the Battle of First Manassas, and then uses many pages to tell what happened to the family after Ballou died, again getting bogged down in minutiae and unimportant family connections.Much of the background on Sarah and Sullivan Ballou's relationship is strictly speculative, and based on the author's language, she realizes this. The author would have ended up with a better (and certainly more succinct) product had she left out some of the speculation.I would not recommend that anyone purchase this book. It is slow and painful to read as it gets bogged down in minutiae. Unfortunately for me, I purchased it and immediately loaned it out (to someone who thought it was so bad, they did not bother to finish it), and so it is too late for me to return it."},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"Louis Drax is an intelligent and articulate 9 year old child but he has difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction, a \\"reality problem\\" as it is described by his psychologist Marcel Perez. Louis and his parents Pierre and Nathalie decide to go on a picnic in the Auvergne one April afternoon. But a row occurs between Pierre and Nathalie because the former considers that Louis is allowed to consume too many sweets. Subsequently, Pierre accuses Nathalie of badly educating their son and menaces to take him to Paris to his mother's. The boy runs away and is chased by his father when he suddenly falls into a ravine. With the help of the gendarmes, Louis is found dead and there is no trace of his father. Two hours later the boy and his distraught mother are brought to Vichy General Hospital, Louis miraculously comes back to life but remains comatose in Dr Philippe Meunier's ward. After that he is transferred to the Clinique de l'Horizon in Provence and placed in the hands of neurologist Dr Pascal Dannachet who specialises in PVS patients (Persistent Vegetative State).Soon Pascal is puzzled by the circumstances of Louis's accident. Not only because his mother is the only witness but also because she now claims that Louis didn't fall into the ravine but was pushed by his father, an alcoholic pilot with Air France. Then two menacing letters are sent to both Nathalie and Pierre in a childish handwriting and signed \\"Louis\\". How could a comatose child write these letters, let alone post them? Is it a trick played by his father Pierre? But this possibility is soon ruled out when Pierre's body is found by a group of speleologists in a cave not far from Louis's accident.A fine mystery story in which Mrs Jensen shows that a mother's feelings for her son can be ambivalent, swaying between love and hatred, perhaps because a son is never quite like a mother wishes him to be."},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"This was a charming book about a little boy.

And the ending, if not predictable (I won't give away who done it, but it's not that hard to figure out), was then a series of boring epilogues.

The main character's life is one deep, dark, tragic secret after another, and there's barely a break in the misery. Somehow, this book manages to avoid becoming bogged down in all its negativity.

We read his thoughts, and we follow the actions the the doctor into whose care he has been placed.

He is a precocious, emotionally disturbed French nine-year-old who is oddly different from other children. He has been a victim of frequent life-threatening accidents since the complications of his birth. His Maman warns him that he is using up his nine lives faster than a cat, and she is frantic to protect him. But on his ninth birthday, while on a picnic with his parents, he falls off a cliff and his Papa vanishes without a trace. Maman claims that Papa pushed Louis off the cliff and has gone into hiding. Although pronounced dead, Louis somehow begins breathing again, but is in a deep comatose state. He is transferred to Dr. Pascal Dannachet's coma clinic while the police search for Papa.The story is narrated alternately by Louis within his coma and by Dr. Dannachet. In a disturbing and eerily askew voice that calls to mind Christopher Boone from \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" Louis tells his life story to a mysterious bandaged man who lives in his head. Through the voice of the doctor, who becomes obsessed with Maman and talks with the police, the reader is presented with different perspectives on the severely dysfunctional Drax family and Louis's near-fatal accident. As the two narrative voices converge, the truth of Louis's past slowly emerges.I found the book unsettling, haunting, and full of constantly shifting truths. Yet I also found it riveting, freshly original, and full of twists and surprises. Louis is presented in a quirky and endearing fashion, and his narrative mixes humor with angst. In spite of the darkness, there is a thread of hope. Once I understood all the facts of his life, I felt like rereading the beginning of the story to give his words their proper interpretation. This is not an easy read, but it is a rewarding one.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"An imaginitive story about a little boy who literally falls into a coma and the doctor who tries to save him from himself and his dysfunctional family. This book is so hard to put down and is such an easy read! The character's are compelling and even the \\"bad guy\\" characters have a dimension to them which allows you to empathise with their position.

A nine year old boy lies in a coma after a terrible fall. His mother is the only witness to the incident which she blames on her husband, claiming he pushed their son. Problem is, the husband has vanished, and the only other person who can tell what happened is buried deep in the catacombs of his mind. The book is wonderfully suspenseful with gothic overtones, and enough tension and human drama you'll want to finish in one or two sittings. I also appreciated that for the most part it kept me guessing up until the very end."},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"Although a relatively small book, and one that will compel you to finish it once you open the cover, this book is not an easy read. Oh you'll fly through the pages easily enough, but the story of young accident-prone Louis Drax is not a happy one.This dark psychological thriller may be unsettling to some, particularly if you are a protective mother of an only child, and you may find yourself trying on the shoes of Natalie Drax, said shoes being pretty uncomfortable to live in.Few readers can escape unmoved when being told of a child who has escaped death eight times in eight years, only to fall off a cliff on his ninth birthday, under suspicious circumstances, to his apparent death.Miraculously, Louis lives to fight another day, but this time he's in a coma, in a special clinic, \\"talking\\" to us through an imaginary and gruesome companion. Always a difficult and precocious child, the comatose Louis still manages to stir up trouble for not only his mother, but also his doctor and one-time psychiatrist, and the police find themselves dealing with something quite out of the ordinary.Certain conclusions can be drawn quite early in the book, but do not detract from the clever story telling. This one grabs your attention and holds it until you reluctantly turn the final page.Amanda Richards, November 13, 2005"},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"This is a great book- it has a dynamic plot, fascinating characters, an intriguing mystery, and excellent characterization by Liz Jensen. Although it's similar to the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, this book is more of a mystery and has two narrators, the precocious but highly disturbed youngster Louis Drax, who narrates while in a coma, and his doctor, Pascal Dannachet, who desperately tries to understand the events that led to Louis falling off a cliff and into a coma. I found the ending to be fair and I look forward to rereading the book again to see how well it holds up and if I can catch clues which I may have missed before. Although highly recommended, there are a few minor mistakes in the text, and one scene in which a character is referred to by the wrong name! However, this does not reflect on the quality of this enjoyable and ambitious book, and I can't help but think that this book would make a fine movie, if handled appropriately. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"When I opened this book, the first thing I thought was \\"Oh no, not another precocious young narrator!\\" I had recently read \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" and \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,\\" so the smart-and-perceptive-little-boy gimmick felt a bit old. However, gimmick or not, the author manipulates both the cutting intuitions and the wide-eyed fragility of little Louis to wonderful effect. The suspense in this novel is centered around two basic premises--that Louis has mysteriously picked up on, but then completely detached himself from, certain emotionally traumatic experiences in his family's past--and Jensen's Louis very convincingly plays both sides of this equation.Three characters--Louis' troubled parents and a high-minded but overly Romantic doctor--try alternately to save and destroy him, the reader never knowing which is sincere and which simply a hypocrite. The psychology of all three, like Louis', is elaborate and glorious: they are three-, even four-dimensional, realistically complicated to the extent that it seems Jensen must know them personally--they can't exist only on paper.Aside from her convoluted and fascinating characters, Jensen's work is good, but not outstanding; the Gothic tone of the novel adds to its suspense, but the plot is a little wild to be believable, and nothing real--aside from dirty secrets--is illuminated or resolved. The characters are all in a worse mess than when they started. It is her idiosyncratic and self-involved characters that make this book worth a read."},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"I picked this up at work (I'm a librarian) and didn't expect to like it. The storytelling method hooked me more than the initial story, but I soon needed to know and understand what had happened to Louis to place him this precarious position. The characters are multidimensional, and the plot (though somewhat predictable) moved well given the mutiple narrators. I was left with a feeling of hope and redemption, and a curiosity about the characters' continuing lives."},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"Louis Drax is a nine year old French boy, definitely a difficult child, and prone to horrible life-threatening accidents, at least once a year. This year his estranged parents take him on a family picnic, but guess what--he has an accident and falls to his death. Or near death--because to everyone's surprise, he starts breathing again (remaining in a deep coma).Dr. Pascal Dannachet is a somewhat troubled middle-aged man with marital problems who works in a coma clinic. Occasionally his patients recover. His methods, of course, are a bit unorthodox.Natalie Drax is Louis' overprotective mother--a beautiful, seemingly vulnerable waif who has a strangely powerful effect on men. Often to their downfall.Well, the plot brings these three and other interesting characters together to reveal some strange discoveries about each other and the mysteries of life. I won't tell you what happens of course. You'll have to read it for itself.Author Liz Jensen writes beautiful, evocative prose. She creates such a powerful French atmosphere for her story that I had to look and make sure this wasn't a translation. In the beginning I found the little boy, Louis, oddly appealing in his insights--something like a very dysfunctional version of Adrian Mole. However the charm dissipates as the plot grows more absurd and unbelievable. This was not an easy book to finish. The suspension of disbelief simply couldn't be sustained--for me--enough for the story to work. I can recommend it with reservations. Reviewed by Louis N.

Liz Jensen, a Brit who has written other novels, deserves to be read!"},{"Title":"Ninth Life of Louis Drax (Radio Collection)","review":"Liz Jensen is an English novelist, born in 1959. She worked initially as a journalist, before moving to France to become a sculptor. She wrote her first novel, Egg Dancing, in 1995 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature ten years later. The Ninth Life of Louis Drax was her fifth book, and was first published in 2004.Louis Drax is nine years old, and has got to be one of the unluckiest people on the planet. He has, over the years, survived a variety of diseases and accidents - meningitis, botulism and a tumble onto Lyon's metro tracks. His mum, Natalie, has mentioned that if Louis was a cat he'd have used up eight of his lives by now - one life for every year he has lived so far.It's maybe no surprise that Louis doesn't expect to make it into adulthood; nor is it any real surprise that he doesn't quite see the world in the same way the rest of us see it. (For example, he's had a series of hamsters - all called Mohammed - who he's killed if they live beyond two years. Apparently, he subscribes to a secret rule of pet-keeping called the Right of Disposal). He's an intelligent kid, but he has no friends and is disruptive at school - where he's been nicknamed Wacko Boy. At his father's suggestion, Louis had been having weekly appointments with a psychologist. Those sessions came to an end with his most recent - and quite possibly his most spectacular - accident. On a family picnic in the Auvergne, Louis fell into a ravine and died; his father also disappears, leaving his mother, Natalie, alone to deal with the aftermath. However, several hours later, Louis somehow comes back to life - although he's trapped in a coma. The boy is sent to a clinic in Provence, to be treated by Dr Pascal Dannachet.The book alternates between Louis and Dr Dannachet, each telling their own story. Louis, trapped within his coma, shares his head with Gustave - a rather macabre character who's own head wrapped in bloody bandages. Louis' arrival, however, is the beginning of a whole bundle of trouble for the good Doctor : the police are still investigating the circumstances of Louis' accident, and Dannachet doesn't even know half the story of Louis' past. Then, there's the ethical problem of his overwhelming attraction to Louis' mum...I'd picked this book up largely on the strength of \\"The Rapture\\" - which is also well worth reading, by the way. Although not exactly what I was expecting, I enjoyed \\"The Ninth Life of Louis Drax\\" thoroughly : things aren't quite as simple and straightforward as they seem, and Dannachet is central to solving the mystery of Louis' life. Louis himself only drip-feeds us information and, being so young, doesn't always know the full story. (Jensen has written very convincingly as Louis; you'd believe his sections of the story were really being told by a nine year old child). Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Design Is in the Details: Kitchens","review":"This is a great book with gorgeous photos.

The action is fast, surreal, and exciting. With each new character that comes flying out of the tear gas toward us, we expect to find one of the familiar stereotypes that we've learned to recognize from watching CNN. Kern doesn't let that happen; the closer each person in her tale approaches, the more we see the typecasting begin to fall away. Kern doesn't let us pigeonhole anyone. All of these people emerge whole and complex. This is most likely due to Kern's long firsthand experience living in Hebron and her intimate contact with the Israel/Palestine conflict and its players.Short non-fiction \\"Interludes\\" between each chapter and written by Kern and a handful of others (from an Israeli human rights lawyer to a Palestinian poet) give us a look at the real life on which Kern's novel is based.

Debunks many &quot;Hollywood&quot; misconceptions, such as the myth of the &quot;we who are about to die salute you&quot; salute and the &quot;thumbs down&quot; signal."},{"Title":"Emperors and Gladiators","review":"This book, by author Thomas Wiedemann, is a penetrating look into the processes of the gladiatorial, or spectacle games, of the Roman era. I can agree to some extent with the previous reviewer who stated that this book is difficult for beginners. The only reason I got so much out of it is that I've been reading heavily on spectacles and games. Once you've covered a few of these books, it gets much easier, as most of the same citations and quotes appear in every account. In other words, once you recognize Martial, Tertullian and historians such as Dio and Tacitus, things become much clearer.Wiedemann touches on almost every aspect one can think of in this book. Background information on Republican games is covered well, and the Imperial aspects of the games are also given liberal treatment. Wiedemann discusses the political content of spectacle as well as the decline of the games in the later Roman Empire. Interesting treatments of the role of myth in the games appears here, as does the paradox of the gladiator (Romans considered gladiators the lowest of the low socially, yet idolized them at the same time). Wiedemann sees the gladiators as symbols of Roman virtu, slugging it out in the arena in order to show Romans what it means to be Roman and to teach important lessons on death and rebirth. Wiedemann's discourse on opposition to the games is especially noteworthy. Wiedemann shows that not one aspect of Roman society opposed the games on humanitarian grounds. There was no ACLU in these days. Philosophers opposed the games on the grounds that it brought forth dangerous emotions in man while denying the rational mind. Even Christians didn't make a stink about the dehumanization of the games. They opposed the games because the lessons of rebirth the games taught were an error. Rebirth comes not from receiving mercy from the people and the emperor, but from acceptance of Christ and the sacraments. Actually, the death and destruction the Christians suffered in the arena could be seen as a boon; the huge amount of martyrs created by the games bolstered Christianity by providing important examples of the serenity and power Christ could bring to the faithful.This is a very good book and very helpful to me as I attempt to write a paper on the political role of the games. I do wish Wiedemann could have been a little more organized in his approach. Oftentimes, he seems to be all over the place with his discussions. Some of his claims, while interesting, are somewhat shaky. Wiedemann writes that the placement of the arenas, on the edge of towns and cities, were a symbol of the games themselves, specifically the fight between civilization and nature as best expressed by the animal fights (venatio). I'll buy this civilization vs. nature argument, but not the placement of the arenas. Not all arenas were on the outskirts of towns. Alison Futrell showed that many were tied to local religious sites. In the East, many games were held in pre-existing theaters, which were not necessarily on the outskirts of town. Like all things Roman, uniformity is hard to find. This is one reason why Rome was so successful in holding things together for so long. The Romans were willing to accept many local customs and traditions if they could throw a veneer of Romaness over them. Despite a few inconsistencies, this book is a valuable contribution to the often misunderstood Roman spectacle."},{"Title":"Emperors and Gladiators","review":"This is a very thorough, meticulously referenced book with a tremendous number and variety of facts about Gladiators, BUT it is not well organized for easy reading.It is NOT recommended for someone with casual interest in Gladiators and other Spectacle Entertainments among Romans."},{"Title":"Emperors and Gladiators","review":"As the author himself states, if you are interested in learning about the different kinds of gladiators or getting a vivid picture of the arena, you would do better to turn to one of the popular surveys such as that by Michael Grant. This book is a study of the role the games played in Roman society -- how they arose, what purpose they served, and why they ultimately disappeared (not, as you might think, because of some new humanitarianism accompanying the rise of Christianity). The author frequently broadens his scope to include the wild-beast shows as well. Much documentary and monumental evidence is discussed. Although scholarly, the book is written in a very readable style and should be of interest to anyone who wants to know more about how the Romans thought."},{"Title":"Emperors and Gladiators","review":"For a book entitled Emperors and Gladiators it certainly features very little of the former. The focus of the book is entirely on the gladiator and on the Roman games (munera). It might seem a small thing but the title says a lot about a book. When it is poor or inaccurate it inevitably skews the perception of those reading it. Given the actual subject matter a title dealing with gladiators and Roman perceptions would have been a better choice. The thesis of this book is that the purpose of the gladiatorial games was to give Romans an acceptance of death. A good portion of the book is given over to what amounts to psychological speculation about the meaning that gladiators had to the Romans. To Wiedemann the entertainment value is secondary to their importance as a way for the Romans to come to terms with their mortality. The survival of a gladiator is seen as a redemptive act, allowing a return to life for one who is brave. A gladiator who fights and survives is thus resurrected. Making an argument about the purpose of an event based on the perceived emotional reactions is fraught with peril. He certainly includes a good deal of data but none of it really proves anything. If you accept his basic conclusions then the data fits in with it but if you do not then there is nothing that disproves the more obvious theory that gladiatorial shows were intended for entertainment in the same way as sports are today. After all, gladiatorial combat is usually placed (even by him) within the context of other forms of entertainment such as theatrical exhibitions and chariot races. Why does it need a deeper meaning when neither of those do?Connected to that is the way in which the Christians viewed gladiatorial fights. As he points out the Christian intolerance of munera were the exception, not the rule. They tolerated chariot races and even plays (for a while). That they singled out gladiatorial fights suggests that there was something about them particularly that offended Christian sensibilities. There are several possible explanations beyond the one he mentioned. Given the number of martyrdoms in amphitheatres it is not surprising that Christian authors should have a negative view of them. The Christians might not feel much sympathy for the criminals but they would certainly disapprove of the audience watching such a spectacle. While humanitarian concerns for the victims may not be the motivating factor he has provided enough evidence in the rest of the book that even pagan moralists could disapprove of the way in which the matches affected the audience. The idea that Christians would not wish for people to cheer for men who were seen as unclean and base is not a great stretch. His view that Christians did not like the idea that a man could be cleansed by violence is tied in with his views of gladiatorial combat as a redemptive act, but it is not necessary to go as far as he does for an explanation. Clearly Christians would not like the idea that men could earn their freedom through bloodshed. That was pretty much the opposite of their beliefs. If a man sinned then he should be punished. To get out of it through violence in no way allowed a man to return to society.All of this leads to the question of what he leaves out. While he mentions other authors' beliefs that there were Romans who disapproved of the games on humanitarian grounds he rarely explains what evidence they use to argue it. An analysis of the evidence used to back up their thesis would have been most useful. What he does do is set up a pair of German historians from the Nazi era as straw dogs for him to take down. This leaves one with the impression that all historians holding to that view are as mad as they were, which is patently untrue. During one of his rare slip ups he mentions that Josephus did in fact object to gladiatorial bouts on the grounds of their cruelty. That he barely even mentioned this bit of data leaves one with the impression that he is skipping over any arguments that do not bolster his case. This definitely seems like a case which calls for an explanation of where his colleagues are coming.His section on Roman perceptions of justice was very enlightening. The view of cruel and unusual punishment as a positive thing is not one that comes easy to modern minds. Yet the fact that the ancients thought that way makes it important to understand their perspective. That they did think in that way is shown in their documents and unlike the popularity of gladiatorial fights this question really does need an explanation. Wiedemann's explanation is as good as any and views them as reassuring reminders that justice will be served. It does seem however that he is so focused on justifying Roman values that he fails to consider those of their contemporaries. Since he explains their views on justice as being due to a preindustrial view of the world it seems that it would be important to compare Rome with other such civilizations to see whether such attitudes towards punishment were universal or unique to the Romans. As with so much of this book he is so intent on justifying the Roman's actions that he does not consider the alternatives. He presents the situation as if there are only two alternatives: the Roman way, or the modern way. Needless to say that is not the case. A full comparison of morality is not necessary, but a few examples from contemporary cultures would really help his case.It was nice to see that Wiedemann did not feel the need to push his own theories on the thumbs up/thumbs down issue. Too many books on gladiators feel the need to either push their own theory or else denigrate the opposing one. His comments were brief but covered the issue well without spending too much time on the arguments for either side. The image of a man giving what would later become a Christian symbol of forgiveness suggests a radically different use for that symbol and a possible explanation for ancient evidence. The work as a whole does well in examining the varying perceptions of gladiators but is perhaps too speculative in explaining Roman motivations. His efforts to make the Romans seem less cruel come across more as trying to find excuses for what they did than trying to explain them. His efforts to avoid judging them harshly have led to him judging them too lightly when perhaps the best approach is to not judge them at all. When he sticks to that his work is a success."},{"Title":"Emperors and Gladiators","review":"This 1992 book is a scholarly review of the religious, social, cultural, and entertainment values of the Roman Ludi (festivals) and Munera (funeral rites). Thomas Wiederman separates executions from gladiatorial exibitions and explains the legal and cultural significence of each. Christians are certainly thrown to the lions, crucified,and used as human torches but so were many other catagories of 'criminals'. These criminals had no opportunity for self-redemption and ultimate victory. The gladiators, on the other hand, were warring in honor of a recently deceased Roman noble. They were socially beneath contempt, but sometimes adored by their fans (think Dennis Rodman). This book is an intellectual challenge but dispenses with the Hollywood glitz and methodically takes the reader through the mores of ancient Roman times with a cogent explaination of gladiators in purely ancient Roman terms. This book does a wonderful job of avoiding 21st century values in explaining how the 'games' arose and why they persist to this day in the form of bullfights. Hard work, but worth it. Highly recommended. ..."},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","review":"Grieving is a part of life, but it can be grieving for an aged parent who has lived a long and fruitful life or it can be grieving for someone who died an untimely death early in life. The first kind of grief is healing, looking back with honour on a long life well lived. The second kind can be earthshattering, as it not only looks backwards, but tried to look forward into what would have been.Bill Valentine's book speaks of the second kind of grieving: that for a life-partner who died an untimely, accidental, but brutal death. In speaking of Joe Lopes, he makes Joe come alive for those of us who never knew him. The best works of fiction or non fiction are those that can actually make a character live on the page. After reading the book, I feel as if I knew Joe, and (incidentally) Bill. This is living writing that jumps off the page.Many of us will suffer such grief, and Bill takes us through his grief, not clinically, but as he lives it. The slow cleaning out of Joe's closet, the mundane details of settling debts, cancelling credit cards, and changing names on mortgages are things that we never think about until they have to be done. We cry with Bill as he goes over the what-if's that would have saved Joe from death in a plane crash in November 2001 over Jamaica Bay.This isn't a how-to book. It's too immediate for that. But reading it will help those who are even now going through grief at untimely death, and will inspire those who haven't yet gone through such grief. I'm so glad I read it."},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","review":"Grief for the loss of a loved one is not a new topic for current literature. Such luminaries as Joan Didion, Mark Doty, Andrew Holleran, and Michael Cunningham have addressed the grieving process in novel form, poetry, memoir, and homage. And new author Bill Valentine steps into that realm with a brief but richly detailed examination of death, of memory, of residual, of extended family - all of these ingredients and more that underscore the fact that perhaps the loss of his beloved Joe Lopes, his life partner of 21 years in the tragic crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in November of 2001, has provided him with a new window and a new life as a writer of obvious talent.Valentine presents his story of the 'other AA crash' that occurred in November of 2001 too soon after the 9/11 event to elicit the worldwide attention of that tragedy as a starting point to remember and recreate a relationship of such rare beauty that reading about it is staggeringly impactful. Valentine very wisely does not emphasize the mourning he endured (although his retelling of that aspect is understated and deeply touching), but instead takes the path of the 'ending' to reminisce about not only his meeting and formation of a relationship but also about the backgrounds of both him and his partner, an exceptionally quiet and private sanctuary that allows us the reader to better appreciate the aura of both men.Some write about grief and mourning in a manner that seems to dig a hole of self pity, and that is most assuredly not the direction Valentine takes. He does not avoid for a second the impact of every detail of the loss of Joe - dealing with family, with the cremation, with friends, with pets, with things shared by the couple that suddenly become the responsibility of one partner, with the 'I' that replaces the 'we' - and yet what he offers us is a warm embrace of survival technique, a memoir as lovely as any that has been written. Valentine steps quietly into the arena of artist with the publication of A SEASON OF GRIEF. Grady Harp, February 07"},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","review":"I believe it is safe to say that as Valentine dreamed of a writing career, he never once imagined that he would be writing an exploration of his grief journey following his life partner's death. This book is much more than a memoir of loss. It is a beautiful love song, a testament to the love shared by a couple who worked hard for their relationship.As a bereaved grandmother, I found Valentine's descriptions of loss to be achingly accurate. Even though each person grieves differently, there is commonality to the emotions. The book opens with Valentine's eulogy, and moves easily back and forth between the time before Joe's death and after. The story of their relationship is an example of life fully lived and of love honored and respected. Valentine handles his grief by facing it head on. He says that the only way to transform the pain is to go through it. He shows us that writing and talking and thinking about the impact of Joe's death is a positive way to cope with the pain. Sharing not only grief but the story of their love is a marvelous memorial to Joe. Now that I've met Joe, I will never forget him."},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","review":"I just finished reading \\"A Season of Grief\\" by Bill Valentine. This story really touched me. The reality of \\"raw and unapologetic\\" grief was so poignant throughout this book. The beauty that was Joe and the relationship that they shared was described in a way that was both heartwarming and heartwrenching at the same time. The raw emotion that Bill felt at this tragic loss was so beautifully expressed page after page - with anger, tenderness, incredulity, compassion, and sheer outrage. The writer portrays a beautiful relationship cut short by a tragic airplane crash - and the aftermath that he has to deal with. Not just the huge emotional and physical void created by Joe's absence, but the challenge of the everday tasks that need to be done upon the death of his long term partner, Joe. Valentine writes of the frequent reminders of Joe that on any given day would cause feelings of such great pain, or feelings of overwhelming solace and comfort. The constant reminders of the beautiful relationship that Joe and Bill had were so very moving. Anyone who has suffered a loss will relate to this book on every level - gay or straight. And anyone who reads this book who has not suffered such a tragic loss will certainly start to appreciate all that they have even more. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Season of Grief (Southern Tier Editions)","review":"I knew Joe, many years ago.

It is meant for the advanced undergraduate (and even graduate) student. The book states it assumes you know the 1st year of calculus and how to solve some ordinary differential equations. It would help if you took one more upper division math class, as to be familiar with the proofs.In a nutshell, this book is great! I used it to study for my PhD Quals in physics. It has a nice portion on Green's functions. The book is 'mathematical' but the backdrop on the topics are based on physical problems. The historical notes are great, and act as a complement to the physical problems (I'm not a big fan of history in textbooks, but this book does a nice job of integrating it).Lots of problems are given, though no solutions are given for any of them. It would be a nice compliment to at least show the start, a tid bit in the middle, and then the solution. The solution at the very least. There are other books that do provide solutions to the types of problems listed here, but it would be nice just to carry around this one when learning boundary value problems.A must for anyone that works on any problems that have ODEs, PDEs, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Boundary Value Problems and Green's Functions.

I can say truthfully that it has expanded my knowledge of book idenification"},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"As other people have said, this is the definitive guide for identifying first editions that is easy to carry and use in thrift stores, garage sales, etc."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"McBride has figured out how to cram a lot of information into a small space while still making it easy on the eyes and easy to use.I find this book essential."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This is a wonderful little book that has saved me from several mistakes in identifying first editions. It fits in my purse so is easy to have with me at all times."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"Excellent reference guide. Contains brief information to help instantly identify first editions of most publishers. Truly pocket size, easily slips in your pocket or purse. Hard to beat simple guide for collectors of first editions. My only complaint is that not all publishers are listed."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"There are a lot of book collectors who invest time in garage sales, estate sales, etc. to find something else for their own personal library. Everyone (yes, everyone) really thinks they will find a signed first edition in the 50 cent bin. Not likely, but this book is small enough for pocket or purse to check quickly a book that just may come close to the prize you are after. Well, worth the investment."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"Excellent book. Information is very clear. I have recently become involved in collecting first edition books and this pocket guide is invaluable in helping me make my choices. I would recommend it to anyone involved in this endeavor."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black. The information was totally ho-hum. Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book. Then there's the cost!!!!! $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping. The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents. Needless to say I returned it ASAP."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying \\"But McBride's Books Say\\". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This book is a very necessary and handy reference for any book collector, whether novice or expert. A particular advantage to this book is the compact format for information on a wide variety of publishers.Other books will have information about current or expected values (such as the Ahearn books, but before you get to the value determination, you will need to know whether or not you have a true first edition. That is the entire focus of this book. And, this is a true &quot;pocket&quot; guide in that it is compact, yet well cross-referenced. About the size of a daytimer calander.I carry this with me on many business trips where I use it at used and rare bookshops around the country. It is comprehensive in the information, but not bulky or awkward to carry.The first section contains information about general edition identification circumstances which will clear up a lot of confusion as to whether you have a book club edition, a second printing, or a true first - although it does not list any specifics about a particular book and the points identifying a first of the specific book. The next section is an alphabetical listing of publishers with a key to the listings (abbreviations) located in a handy spot inside the back cover.I highly recommend this book as a &quot;portable&quot; resource for your book hunting trips."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"I owe quite a lot to Bill McBride and his A Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions. When I started collecting books in earnest over a decade ago, I knew very little about first editions [more correctly 'first printings']. My first education in 'firsts' came from a 3rd Edition of this handy little book. I always carry it [now the 6th Revised Edition] when I'm doing the used bookstores somewhere [the urban counterpart to the rock collecting I do in the outback] and many times Mr. McBride's little book has saved me from buying a book misidentified as a 'first' and has helped me find a few bargains when a long sought 'first' was not identified as such. Before you challenge the used bookstore circuit [my favorites are in San Francisco, Berkeley, and the Los Angeles/Orange County area] or, braver yet, the yard sale/estate sale/swap meet/Goodwill circuit, make sure you have a copy of Mr. McBride's little book in your hip pocket."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"The introduction gives a solid background on first editions in general. The bulk of the booklet -- and it is a booklet to carry with you -- is a 100-page list of about 3600 publishers, large and small, famous and obscure. For each publisher, the typical first edition clues are given. Indispensable and affordable.For the details of well-known true firsts, itemized title by title, see the author's other book, Points of Issue."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"I bought this after about 5 years as a bookdealer thinking it might help me out on the road. It did not. Most of first edition identification is common sense, and I just didn't find this booklet very useful. It is concise and accurate and comprehensive, so no taking away from the other reviewers. If you have never worked in the used book business, this would be a very good book. But if you are very serious, consider the Zemple guide from Spoon River Press."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"I can't function without this booklet. The best I've come across so far. If you're a book seller/dealer or a book collector, this is what you need to help identify First Editions. It has the Publishers'names and how to identify each Publishers'First Editions. And, small enough to carry with you everywhere. I highly recommend this booklet, the knowledge it gave me is priceless."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This little book in a nutshell clears up any questions you may have if you're having trouble telling if your old book is a first edition or not. As a book lover and collector AND seller of books online, I found several books in my possession that I had doubts were first editions. I searched my book and found they WERE First Editions. Without this little book, I would have never, ever known.A Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions is a little expensive, but in the end, you'll get your money back!"},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"Anyone seriously, or casually, collecting books should have a copy of the Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions by Bill McBride with them whenever they are on a book hunt. This little book has more information, organized by publisher, about first editions than any other book I have used.Whenever someone asks me questions about editions, print runs, or how to identify a BCE (Book Club Edition) after answering I recommend the consider purchasing this guide. I have had every edition since the 3rd and would not be without it."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This is a great resource if you want to try to determine if that book you've just picked up is really a first edition. I can't give it five stars however because I think that it's overpriced. It has a fairly thin paper cover and is bound with staples."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word \\"book\\" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book."},{"Title":"A pocket guide to the identification of first editions","review":"This little book does only one trick, but it does it well. If you have a need to quickly identify first edition books, you need this book."},{"Title":"VSE/ESA JCL: Utilities, Power, and VSAM (IBM McGraw-Hill Series)","review":"As a consultant, I was in desperate need of a book that could serve as both tutorial and reference. I have been very pleased with this title, as it goes far beyond the POWER spooler and writing usable JCL. The coverage of LIBR, DITTO, SORT and IDCAMS on VSE/ESA has been invaluable to me. This book also goes on to describe many of the smaller DOS utilities that I wasn't aware of. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Venture Capital Collection: The 10 Best Selling Books on Term Sheets, Deal Terms, Raising Capital, Compensation Structures, Exit Strategies, Venture Capital Laws & Documents & More","review":"These are &quot;the&quot; books every vc has on their bookshelf.

(Graphic Novels))","review":"I love this series better than the anime itself because while the anime is focused with the cards, it cuts the real story off at the knees. I enjoy watching Yami as he fights for what he cares for most... his friends. To me, the card game seems just like a back story and to read the tenderness this small boy has is touching. He reminds me of how we all feel going through that big world known as &quot;High School.&quot; Everyone later admits that, whether popular or not, High School was one interesting adventure. We all feel stupid and outcasted at times there. Yugi draws the audience back to those awkward days and reminds us that inside we could be just as weak as any but if we strive for what is right and just, we shall conquer all. That, to me, is the real reason behind Yami and Yu-Gi-Oh and these books really show the reader that reason."},{"Title":"Yu-Gi-Oh!, Vol. 5 (Yu-Gi-Oh!

If you love romance and like history, then I am sure you'll love this!"},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"Although this isn't Dickens' Tale of Two Cities or Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, it is a funny and heart-warming book.

By now I am on the sixth book of the series, and still as entertained as with the first. The characters are well developed and lovely, and the story, though predictably is fun and engaging. This is the perfect read for a cold wintry day, where you just want to stay home and relax. I highly recommend it, and the others of the series."},{"Title":"Lady Fortescue Steps Out (The Poor Relation)","review":"I had read a couple of Marion Chesney books to date, before reading this one. I had come to the conclusion that she is creative in coming up with unique situations, and that her romances are short quick reads (which can be nice sometimes), but that that her characters lacked depth. However, I obviously liked them well enough, as I have continued to seek our her books!Lady Fortescue Steps Out was very entertaining, and in this one, I did feel like I knew the characters better!. (I think that to develop them any more would not have been possible, as the book IS short.) I REALLY liked this one a lot.
