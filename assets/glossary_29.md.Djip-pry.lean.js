But World Cup soccer champion and Olympic gold medalist Brandi Chastain has a solution. In It's Not About the Bra, Chastain draws on lessons learned in her phenomenal career and in her experience as a parent to illuminate \\"the beautiful game\\" and provide creative answers to the challenges that face young athletes and their parents. Chastain emphasizes the importance of developing leadership skills, finding (and becoming) role models, and giving back to one's team and community. She offers a blueprint for kids and parents alike on how to play fair, win (and lose) with grace, and, above all, have a good time doing it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gZ4nDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The haunted showboat (Nancy Drew mystery stories)","description":"Nancy and her pals are off to New Orleans to solve the mystery of a haunted riverboat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6rDKjgEACAAJ&dq=The+haunted+showboat+(Nancy+Drew+mystery+stories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became Its Most Influential Justice","description":"Sandra Day O'Connor, America's first woman justice, became the axis on which the Supreme Court turned. She was called the most powerful woman in America, and it was often said that to gauge the direction of American law, one need look only to O'Connor's vote. Then, just one year short of a quarter century on the bench, she surprised her colleagues and the nation by announcing her retirement. Drawing on information from once-private papers of the justices, hundreds of interviews with legal and political insiders, and the insight gained from nearly two decades of covering the Supreme Court, Joan Biskupic examines O'Connor's remarkable career, providing an in-depth account of her transformation from tentative jurist to confident architect of American law. The portrait that emerges is of a complex and multifaceted woman: lawyer, politician, legislator, and justice, as well as wife, mother, A-list society hostess, and competitive athlete. To all appearances, she was the polite lady in pearls, handbag on her arm. But in the back rooms of politics and the law, she was a determined, focused strategist. O'Connor was the feminist who, rather than rebel against the male-dominated system, worked from within -- and succeeded. As Biskupic demonstrates, Justice O'Connor became much more than a \\"first.\\" During her twenty-four-year tenure, she wrote the decisions on some of the most controversial social battles of our time. O'Connor's tie-breaking opinions on issues such as abortion rights, affirmative action, the death penalty, and religious freedom will have a lasting effect far into the future. O'Connor also cast one of the five votes that cut off the Florida recounts and allowed George W. Bush to take the White House in the 2000 contested presidential election. With an eye to the American people and a keen sense of public attitudes, she worked behind the scenes to shape the law and transform the legal standards by which future cases will be decided. From O'Connor's isolated upbringing on the Lazy B ranch in Arizona through her time as a state legislator to her rise as a justice -- along the way confronting her own personal challenges and crises, including breast cancer -- Biskupic presents a vivid, astute depiction of the justice -- and of the woman beneath the black robe. In so doing, Sandra Day O'Connor also provides an unprecedented look inside the exclusive, famously secretive High Court.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EGCUAnmISLIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cockermouth Mail (Regency Romance)","description":"The Cockermouth Mail by Dinah Dean released on Jun 23, 1989 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nc6axRPRV0YC&dq=Cockermouth+Mail+(Regency+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East","description":"Offering fascinating insights into the people and politics of the ancient near Eastern kingdoms, Trevor Bryce uses the letters of the five Great Kings of Egypt, Babylon, Hatti, Mitanni and Assyria as the focus of a fresh look at this turbulent and volatile region in the late Bronze Age.

Leuci reminisces about cops both celebrated and notorious, like Frank Serpico, Sonny Grosso, and Frank King from the French Connection case. Also here are politicians, Mafia figures, corrupt defense lawyers, and district attorneys, including a young Rudolph Giuliani. Leuci reveals the dark side of the criminal justice system: the bitterness, greed, cruelty, and ambition that eventually overflowed into the streets, precinct houses, and courtrooms of the city.

With brilliant insight, drawing on a vast range of primary sources, Alex Danchev tells the story of an artist who was never accepted into the official Salon: he was considered a revolutionary at best and a barbarian at worst, whose paintings were unfinished, distorted and strange. His work sold to no one outside his immediate circle until his late thirties, and he maintained that 'to paint from nature is not to copy an object; it is to represent its sensations' - a belief way ahead of his time, with stunning implications that became the obsession of many other artists and writers, from Matisse and Braque to Rilke and Gertrude Stein. Beginning with the restless teenager from Aix who was best friends with Emile Zola at school, Danchev carries us through the trials of a painter tormented by self-doubt, who always remained an outsider, both of society and the bustle of the art world. C zanne: A Life delivers not only the fascinating days and years of the visionary who would 'astonish Paris with an apple', with interludes analysing his self-portraits - but also a complete assessment of C zanne's ongoing influence through artistic imaginations in our own time. He is, as this life shows, a cultural icon comparable to Marx or Freud.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tv15LAAACAAJ&dq=Cezanne:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peanuts: A Golden Celebration: The Art and the Story of the World's Best-Loved Comic Strip","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SpihSl6UnzIC&dq=Peanuts:+A+Golden+Celebration:+The+Art+and+the+Story+of+the+World%27s+Best-Loved+Comic+Strip&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sophisticated Gourmet: Quick & Easy Recipes from a Renaissance Man","description":"This cookbook from the passionate baker is  a pleasure to read . . . an unpretentious, cheery collection designed to  convert fear-filled nonbakers to experts.

Silvia Dom nguez argues that these immigrant women parlay social ties that provide support and leverage to develop networks and achieve social positioning to get ahead. Through a rich ethnographic account and in-depth interviews, the strong voices of these women demonstratehow they successfully negotiate the world and achieve social mobility through their own individual agency, skillfullynavigating both constraints and opportunities. Dom nguez makes it clear that many immigrant women are able to develop the social support needed for a rich social life, and leverage ties that open options for them to develop their social and human capital. However, she also shows that factors such as neighborhood and domestic violence and the unavailability of social services leave many women without the ability to strategize towards social mobility. Ultimately, Dom nguez makes important local and international policy recommendations on issue ranging from public housing to world labor visas, demonstrating how policy can help to improve the lives of these and other low-income people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uVoTCgAAQBAJ&dq=Watching+Rape:+Film+and+Television+in+Postfeminist+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Parasitology","description":"A parasitology text for biology and/or zoology students at the undergraduate level.

Through gorgeous photography, this book celebrates these unique and magnificent beacons and their history. The construction of lighthouses began as this new nation s first public-works project in 1789 and established the United States as a maritime world power by making ports safe for navigation. These structures many still active and serving their original purpose even in the era of global positioning systems are living museums, yet they often prove difficult to access for visitors due to their necessary remoteness. From Maine s West Quoddy Head on the easternmost headlands to the iconic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, and the West Coast lighthouses from New Point Loma to New Dungeness and Michigan s Grand Haven Pier Lighthouse, the images here will delight both the armchair traveler and those who have taken the back roads or trekked across sandy beaches to visit these special and often artful buildings. This is a great gift for lovers of lighthouses, boaters, and those who live or dream of living on the seashore.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ddAxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Lighthouses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy of the Prophet: Despots, Democrats, and the New Politics of Islam","description":"The World Trade Center bombing, suicide attacks in Israel, the slaughter of tourists in Egypt and innocents in Algeria. One of the world's great religions, Islam has become identified today with senseless bloodshed, its followers branded as irrational fanatics with a penchant for violence. Ours is the era of the \\"Islamic threat.\\" But another story remains to be told. Beyond the headlines, a transformation is under way in both the style and message of Islamic politics at the end of the twentieth century: a startling shift from militancy to democracy with vast implications for the West. Drawing on his years of reporting in more than a dozen countries of the Muslim world, Anthony Shadid charts the striking way in which the adolescence of yesterday's Islamic militants is yielding to the maturity of today's activists. Through interview and travelogue, he chronicles a new generation-in Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey and elsewhere-that is finding a more realistic and potentially more successful future through democratic politics. A crucial element of this change, and of Legacy of the Prophet , is his exploration of the failure of militant Islam in countries like Sudan and Iran, defeats that ironically may help make way for an alternative, democratic future. The transformation promises a better future for a region long ruled by soldiers and despots. For the West, it offers a compelling opportunity to find common ground with the Muslim world. But to do so, the book argues that we must make the difficult choice of supporting the emergence of democratic Islamic movements, possibly even allowing to come to power governments that, as it stands, have no love for the West. Legacy of the Prophet promises to redefine the debate over the future of political Islam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gB9KZEcjU2gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The seven Lady Godivas,","description":"A tongue-in-cheek reworking of the legends of Lady Godiva and Peeping Tom, in which the seven Godiva sisters vow not to wed until each has discovered a new Horse Truth of benefit to all mankind","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hgUPAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+seven+Lady+Godivas,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celebrations of the Heart","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9r8wAAAACAAJ&dq=Celebrations+of+the+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Diary from Dixie","description":"The original diary of Mary Chesnut, an important work that was repeatedly quoted during the famous television documentary The Civil War, provides an insightful look into how the war affected the daily lives of the people of the South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dGgbAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Diary+from+Dixie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vocation of man,","description":"Contents: Translator's Introduction Selected Bibliography Note on the Text The Vocation of Man Preface Book One: Doubt Book Two: Knowledge Book Three: Faith","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=70sxEXuw60MC&dq=The+vocation+of+man,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of the Public Land Policies (Land Economics Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vta5AAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I and Eye: Pictures of My Generation","description":"Chronicles the life of photojournalist Peter Simon and shares photographs of the causes, people, and events that defined the baby boomer generation, from his college years in Boston to his visit to Woodstock '99.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VKtrQgAACAAJ&dq=I+and+Eye:+Pictures+of+My+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen's gift","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eJizvgEACAAJ&dq=Queen%27s+gift&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Trials: Scientists, Investors, and Patients in the Quest for a Cure","description":"Over fifty million people suffer from some form of autoimmune disease-multiple sclerosis, arthritis, lupus, and other afflictions in which the body attacks itself-none of them with a lasting cure. Susan Quinn has investigated the worlds where new autoimmune drugs are being developed: the research labs, the drug-company boardrooms, and the clinics where patients become \\"subjects\\" in the search for new medicines and treatments. Her exciting story is one of real people: fiercely competing scientists, ambitious venture capitalists, and, above all, anxious, sick human beings. She takes the reader inside these otherwise closed worlds, into the lead investigator's diaries, the tense closed-door meetings with investors, and the hopeful or heart-rending encounters in doctor's offices. Hers is the archetypal story of all medical research: the roller-coaster trip from the lab bench to the medicine cabinet, in which only a very few new drugs and treatments survive. Susan Quinn, author of the acclaimed biography Marie Curie, catches the hopes, triumphs, and crushing failures, the greed and the idealism in these dramatic human trials.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8C-khy10iQgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering (Computational Intelligence)","description":"Neural networks and fuzzy systems are different approaches to introducing human-like reasoning into expert systems.

In a clear and accessible style, Kasabov describes rule- based and connectionist techniques and then their combinations, with fuzzy logic included, showing the application of the different techniques to a set of simple prototype problems, which makes comparisons possible. A particularly strong feature of the text is that it is filled with applications in engineering, business, and finance. AI problems that cover most of the application-oriented research in the field (pattern recognition, speech and image processing, classification, planning, optimization, prediction, control, decision making, and game simulations) are discussed and illustrated with concrete examples.

This work is a comprehensive resource for patients with autoimmune disease. The primary focus is on the specific environmental factors, including heavy metals, hormones, organic solvents, medications, and infectious agents, that lead to autoimmune disease and that make the symptoms worse in genetically susceptible individuals. Sections of this work describe the immune system, the natural courses of disease for the various system-wide and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, and genetic factors and lifestyle influences associated with AD.

Just as the Pentagon Papers laid bare the secret American decision making behind the Vietnam War and changed forever our view of the nation's political leaders, so too has The Tiananmen Papers altered our perception of how and why the events of June 4 took the shape they did.

Buckley Jr. wrote as the dedication of his monumental work a compendium of knowledge that still resonates within the halls of the Ivy League university that tried to cover up its political and religious bias. In 1951, a twenty-five-year-old Yale graduate published his first book, which exposed the \\"extraordinarily irresponsible educational attitude\\" that prevailed at his alma mater. The book, God and Man at Yale, rocked the academic world and catapulted its young author, William F. Buckley Jr. into the public spotlight. Now, half a century later, read the extraordinary work that began the modern conservative movement. Buckley's harsh assessment of his alma mater divulged the reality behind the institution's wholly secular education, even within the religion department and divinity school.

But his writing was magic. No one captured Chicago like Mike Royko. No one wrote with his honesty, his toughness, his passion, and his humor. In this, the first comprehensive biography of one of the most important Chicagoans of the century, Dick Ciccone, a long-time colleague and editor of Royko's at the Chicago Tribune, captures Royko at his best and at his worst. We see Royko on his tenth drink of the afternoon. We see him sweating over columns minutes before deadline. We see him romancing his wife and torturing his legmen. We see him barbequeing ribs and riffing on politicians. Mike Royko was a man of the people. With his keen sense of justice and his murderous pen, he became the most widely read columnist in Chicago history. His column was syndicated in more than 600 newspapers across the country. With 7500 columns spanning four decades, Royko's writing reflects a radically changing America. Royko not only tells the story of one of America's greatest newspapermen, but also explores the dramatic changes in journalism over the course of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pOeES8HTUFcC&dq=Royko:+A+Life+in+Print&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"18 Miles From Earth : Stories From Barber Shops, Front Porches and Supper Tables","description":"Stories from barber Shops, Front Porches and Supper Tables By Wayne Bristow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FMXnswEACAAJ&dq=18+Miles+From+Earth+:+Stories+From+Barber+Shops,+Front+Porches+and+Supper+Tables&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outdoor Rooms: Designs for Porches, Terraces, Decks, Gazebos","description":"Presents examples of a variety of outdoor spaces including decks and porches and some of their furniture and accessories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IvoWvgAACAAJ&dq=Outdoor+Rooms:+Designs+for+Porches,+Terraces,+Decks,+Gazebos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The River Has Never Divided Us: A Border History of La Junta de los Rios (Jack and Doris Smothers Series in Texas History, Life, and Culture)","description":"Not quite the United States and not quite Mexico, La Junta de los Rios straddles the border between Texas and Chihuahua, occupying the basin formed by the conjunction of the Rio Grande and the Rio Conchos.

Both underline the continuing relevance of this foundational text in the study of popular culture. What is popular culture? How does it differ from mass culture? And what do popular \\"texts\\" reveal about class, race, and gender dynamics in a society? John Fiske answers these and a host of other questions in Understanding Popular Culture. When it was first written, Understanding Popular Culture took a groundbreaking approach to studying such cultural artifacts as jeans, shopping malls, tabloid newspapers, and TV game shows, which remains relevant today. Fiske differentiates between mass culture  the cultural \\"products\\" put out by an industrialized, capitalist society  and popular culture  the ways in which people use, abuse, and subvert these products to create their own meanings and messages. Rather than focusing on mass culture s attempts to dominate and homogenize, he prefers to look at (and revel in) popular culture s evasions and manipulations of these attempts. Designed as a companion to Reading the Popular, Understanding Popular Culture presents a radically different theory of what it means for culture to be popular: that it is, literally, of the people. It is not imposed on them, it is created by them, and its pleasures and meanings reflect popular tastes and concerns  and a rejection of those fostered by mass culture. With wit, clarity, and insight, Professor Fiske debunks the myth of the mindless mass audience, and demonstrates that, in myriad ways, popular culture thrives because that audience is more aware than anyone guesses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XXJeBwAAQBAJ&dq=Understanding+Popular+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curassows and Related Birds","description":"For review see: Fran?ois Haverschmidt, in Ardea, jrg. 62 (1974); p. 140-141.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jOkPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Curassows+and+Related+Birds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Short Story: The Reality of Artifice (Genres in Context)","description":"The short story is one of the most difficult types of prose to write and one of the most pleasurable to read.

Like Russell Baker's Growing Up, Jill Ker Conway's The Road from Coorain, and other classic literary memoirs, Clear Springs takes us back in time to recapture a way of life that has all but disappeared, a country culture deeply rooted in work and food and family, in common sense and music and the land. Clear Springs is also an American woman's odyssey, exploring how a misfit girl who dreamed of distant places grew up in the forties, fifties, and sixties, and fulfilled her ambition to be a writer. A multilayered narrative of three generations--Bobbie Ann Mason, her parents and grandparents--Clear Springs gracefully interlaces several different lives, decades, and locales, moving from the industrious life on a Kentucky farm to travels around the South with Mason as president of the Hilltoppers Fan Club; from the hippie lifestyle of the 1960s New York counterculture to the shock-therapy ward of a mental institution; from a farmhouse to the set of a Hollywood movie; from pop music concerts to a small rustic schoolhouse. Clear Springs depicts the changes that have come to family, to women, and to heartland America in the twentieth century, as well as to Bobbie Ann Mason herself. When the movie of Mason's bestselling novel In Country is filmed near Clear Springs, it brings the first limousines to town, even as it brings out once again the wisdom and values of Mason's remarkable parents. Her mother, especially, stands at the center of this book. Mason's journey leads her to a recognition of the drama and significance of her mother's life and to a new understanding of heritage, place, and family roots. Brilliant and evocative, Clear Springs is a stunning achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OrB5YLXUj9cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lipstick And Other Stories- P","description":"Lisptick and Other Stories has won an American Book Award for 2002, the first book by a Hong Kong author and the first book from a publisher outside the United States to be so honored.

Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZfQ3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun with a pencil","description":"Andrew Loomis (1892-1959) is revered amongst artists - including comics superstar Alex Ross - for his mastery of drawing.

On national exams, almost 40 percent of fourth graders are reading at \\"below basic\\" levels, and in international contests in math and science, our seventeen-year-olds score near the bottom. In a shocking expose of the Educational Establishment, Martin L. Gross describes how the typical teacher is academically inferior and trained in dubious \\"educational psychology\\" and faddish \\"whole language\\" methods. Indeed, most teachers and administrators come from the bottom third of their class and are outscored on the SAT tests by their own college-bound students. The curriculum is so weak that only one in five students ever take trigonometry, physics, or geography in high school. The usual remedies-from smaller class sizes to federal aid-fail because the Etablishment is intent on maintaining both control and lower academic standards. Lucid, persuasive, and meticulously researched, The Conspiracy of Ignorance asks- and answers--the questions educators are afraid to ask. This book is desperately needed if American schoolchildren are to prosper in today's competitive world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aitpxs2Qm8IC&dq=The+Conspiracy+of+Ignorance:+The+Failure+of+American+Public+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Visual C#(TM) .NET Step by Step (Step by Step (Microsoft))","description":"Your hands-on guide to Visual C++/CLI fundamentals Expand your expertise and teach yourself the fundamentals of the Microsoft Visual C++/CLI language.

An essay on the meaning of the comic.","description":"2014 Reprint of Original 1912 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. \\"Laughter\\" is a collection of three essays by French philosopher Henri Bergson, first published in 1900. In a short introduction, Bergson announces that he will try to define the comic, but he does not want to give a rigid definition of the word; he wants to deal with the comic as part of human life. His ambition is also to have a better knowledge of society, of the functioning of human imagination and of collective imagination, but also of art and life. Bergson begins to note three facts on the comic: 1] the comic is strictly a human phenomenon. A landscape cannot be a source of laughter, and when humans make fun of animals, it is often because they recognize some human behavior in them. Man is not only a being that can laugh, but also a being that is a source of laughter. 2] laughter requires an indifference, a detachment from sensibility and emotion: 3] it is more difficult to laugh when one is fully aware of the seriousness of a situation. It is difficult to laugh alone, it is easier to laugh collectively. One who is excluded from a group of people does not laugh with them, there is often a complicity in laughter. Thus the comic is not a mere pleasure of the intellect, it is a human and social activity, it has a social meaning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VG4qrgEACAAJ&dq=Laughter.+An+essay+on+the+meaning+of+the+comic.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philosophers Toolkit: A Compendium of Philosophical Concepts and Methods (CourseSmart)","description":"The second edition of this popular compendium provides the necessary intellectual equipment to engage with and participate in effective philosophical argument, reading, and reflection Features significantly revised, updated and expanded entries, and an entirely new section drawn from methods in the history of philosophy This edition has a broad, pluralistic approach--appealing to readers in both continental philosophy and the history of philosophy, as well as analytic philosophy Explains difficult concepts in an easily accessible manner, and addresses the use and application of these concepts Proven useful to philosophy students at both beginning and advanced levels","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=COq8DAEACAAJ&dq=The+Philosophers+Toolkit:+A+Compendium+of+Philosophical+Concepts+and+Methods+(CourseSmart)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Exam 70-296 Study Guide and DVD Training System: Planning, Implementing and Maintaining a Windows Server 2003 Environment for a MCSE Certified on Windows 2000","description":"MCSE Exam 70-296 Study Guide & DVD Training System: Planning, Implementing and Maintaining a Windows Server 2003 Environment for an MCSE Certified on Windows 2000 is a one-of-a-kind integration of text, DVD-quality instructor led training, and Web-based exam simulation and remediation.

In this bold and exhilarating mix of memoir and master class, Melissa Febos tackles the emotional, psychological, and physical work of writing intimately while offering an utterly fresh examination of the storyteller s life and the questions which run through it. How might we go about capturing on the page the relationships that have formed us? How do we write about our bodies, their desires and traumas? What does it mean for an author s way of writing, or living, to be dismissed as  navel-gazing  or else hailed as  so brave, so raw ? And to whom, in the end, do our most intimate stories belong? Drawing on her own path from aspiring writer to acclaimed author and writing professor via addiction and recovery, sex work and academia Melissa Febos has created a captivating guide to the writing life, and a brilliantly unusual exploration of subjectivity, privacy, and the power of divulgence. Candid and inspiring, Body Work will empower readers and writers alike, offering ideas and occasional notes of caution to anyone who has ever hoped to see themselves in a story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4zeBzgEACAAJ&dq=Work+and+Body&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of the \\"Old Colony\\" of New Plymouth, 1620-1692","description":"History of the colony up to when it became a part of Massachusetts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2iUXAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+story+of+the+%22Old+Colony%22+of+New+Plymouth,+1620-1692&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artist on His Island, a study in self-reliance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t9ktAQAAIAAJ&dq=Artist+on+His+Island,+a+study+in+self-reliance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government--Saving Privacy in the Digital Age","description":"If you've ever made a secure purchase with your credit card over the Internet, then you have seen cryptography, or \\"crypto\\", in action.

He also examines the life and legacy of his cousin, Lucy Partington, who was abducted and murdered by one of Britain s most notorious serial killers.

Charles B. Gatewood (1853-96), an educated Virginian, served in the Sixth U.S. Cavalry as the commander of Indian scouts. Gatewood was largely accepted by the Native peoples with whom he worked because of his efforts to understand their cultures. It was precisely this connection between Gatewood and the Indians, and with Geronimo and Naiche in particular, that led to his involvement in the last Apache war and his work for Indian rights. Realizing that he had more experience dealing with Native peoples than other lieutenants serving on the frontier, Gatewood decided to record his experiences. Although he died before he completed his project, Lt. Charles Gatewood & His Apache Wars Memoir is an important firsthand account of Gatewood's life as a commander of Apache scouts and as a military commandant of the White Mountain Indian Reservation. Louis Kraft presents Gatewood's previously unpublished account, complementing it with an introduction, additional text that fills in the gaps in Gatewood's narrative, detailed notes, and an epilogue. Kraft's work offers new background information on Gatewood and throws the manuscript into new relief as a fresh account of how Gatewood viewed the events in which he took part.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uGdpzAEACAAJ&dq=Gatewood+and+Geronimo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical Experiment Design and Interpretation: An Introduction with Agricultural Examples","description":"Statistical Experiment Design and Interpretation concentrates on the practicalities of statistical analysis for anyone involved in agricultural research.

Statistical techniques include the t-test, analysis of variance, basic regression analysis and non-parametric techniques. Assumptions inherent to these techniques are clearly identified (bearing in mind the principles and aims) without losing the reader in statistical theory.

From struggling war refugees to monks, intellectuals to sex workers, his characters are both linked and separated by their experiences as modern Asians and Asian Americans. In styles ranging from naturalism to high-camp parody, Leong goes beneath stereotypes of immigrant and American-born Chinese, hustlers and academics, Buddhist priests and street people. Displacement and marginalization ? and the search for love and liberation ? are persistent themes. Leong?s people are set apart, by sexuality, by war, by AIDS, by family dislocations. From this vantage point on the outskirts of conventional life, they often see clearly the accommodations we make with identity and with desire. A young teen-ager, sold into prostitution to finance her brothers? education, saves her hair trimmings to burn once a year in a temple ritual, the one part of her body that is under her own control. A documentary film producer, raised in a noisy Hong Kong family, marvels at the popular image of Asian Americans as a silenced minority.

Has America lost its traditional values? Many politicians and religious leaders believe so, as do the majority of Americans, based on public opinion polls taken over the past several years. But is this crisis of values real? This book explores the moral terrain of America today, analyzing the widely held perception that the nation is in moral decline. It looks at the question from a variety of angles, examining traditional values, secular values, religious values, family values, economic values, and others. Using unique data from the World Values Surveys, the largest systematic attempt ever made to document attitudes, values, and beliefs around the world, this book systematically evaluates the perceived crisis of values by comparing America's values with those of over 60 other nations. The results are surprising. The evidence shows overwhelmingly that America has not lost its traditional values, that the nation compares favorably with most other societies, and that the culture war is largely a myth. The gap between reality and perception does not represent mass ignorance of the facts or an overblown moral panic, Baker contends. Rather, the widespread perception of a crisis of values is a real and legitimate interpretation of life in a society that is in the middle of a fundamental transformation and that contains growing cultural contradictions. Instead of posing a problem, the author argues, this crisis rhetoric serves the valuable social function of reminding us of what it means to be American. As such, it preserves the ideological foundation of the nation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kUeVAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sting (Pro Wrestling Legends)","description":"CHBiographies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=psdbAgAAQBAJ&dq=Sting+(Pro+Wrestling+Legends)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linux and the Unix Philosophy","description":"Exploring the \\"way of thinking that is Unix\\" this guide explains why Linux is a superior implementation of this highly capable operating system.

This fascinating study of his philosophy illuminates the originality of his methods and shows how his thought radically alters the landscape of philosophical inquiry. In Beyond: The Philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas Adriaan Theodoor Peperzak shows Levinas's thought to be a persistent attempt to point beyond the borders of an economy where orderly interests and ways of reasoning make us feel at home - beyond the world of needs, beyond the self, beyond politics and administration, beyond logic and ontology, even beyond freedom and autonomy. Peperzak's examination begins with a general overview of Levinas's life and thought, and shows how the issues of ethics, politics, and religion are intertwined in Levinas's philosophy. Peperzak also discusses the development of Levinas's relations with Husserl and Heidegger, demonstrating thematically the evolution of both Levinas's anti-Heideggerian view of technology and his critical attitude toward Nature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w9y4LAWCStEC&dq=Emmanuel+Levinas+(Studies+in+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinvara Affairs","description":"It is 1936 and the children of Kinvara are growing up.

In Achieving Market Integration the author demonstrates the interrelated nature of these and other imperative problems, and sensibly reduces them to their common fundamental principles. Beginning with an in-depth examination of best execution in today's multiple-market environment, the book moves logically into an examination of market structure and the problems of achieving genuine integration. The book makes the case that order interaction is fundamental to addressing each of these issues, and develops a unified regulatory approach to achieve true market integration based on intermarket linkages and a cross-market best execution policy. This unique approach culminates in a coherent set of policy recommendations and an innovative framework for assessing the effectiveness of future policy proposals. *The first book on this important subject for the finance community *Explains the aims and proposes solutions to the difficulties of establishing a stock market that integrates the diverse national exchanges around Europe *Provides a discussion point for those lobbying the European Commission on formulating regulation for an integrated European capital market","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hgOnb75T2wYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here A Novel","description":" The novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump s authoritarian appeal.

Los Angeles Times Named a Most Anticipated Book of the Year by Entertainment Weekly, Vulture, Harper's Bazaar, Buzzfeed, Ms. Magazine, Lit Hub, The Millions, and Electric Literature In the bustling streets and cloistered homes of Lagos, a cast of vivid characters some haunted, some defiant navigate danger, demons, and love in a quest to lead true lives. As in Nigeria, vagabonds are those whose existence is literally outlawed: the queer, the poor, the displaced, the footloose and rogue spirits. They are those who inhabit transient spaces, who make their paths and move invisibly, who embrace apparitions, old vengeances and alternative realities. Eloghosa Osunde's brave, fiercely inventive novel traces a wild array of characters for whom life itself is a form of resistance: a driver for a debauched politician with the power to command life and death; a legendary fashion designer who gives birth to a grown daughter; a lesbian couple whose tender relationship sheds unexpected light on their experience with underground sex work; a wife and mother who attends a secret spiritual gathering that shifts her world. As their lives intertwine in bustling markets and underground clubs, churches and hotel rooms vagabonds are seized and challenged by spirits who command the city's dark energy. Whether running from danger, meeting with secret lovers, finding their identities, or vanquishing their shadowselves, Osunde's characters confront and support one another, before converging for the once-in-a-lifetime gathering that gives the book its unexpectedly joyous conclusion. Blending unvarnished realism with myth and fantasy, Vagabonds! is a vital work of imagination that takes us deep inside the hearts, minds, and bodies of a people in duress and in triumph.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sKZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Vagabonds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6mYSQAACAAJ&dq=Cambridge+Preparation+for+the+Toefl+Test&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Script Book, Season Two, Volume 3 (v. 3)","description":"Giles (to Buffy): \\"What did you sing about?\\" Buffy: \\"I, uh...don't remember.

She has become our most important critic, while her brilliant novels and short fiction are, at long last, getting the recognition they deserve. Sontag is above all a writer, which is only to say that, though the form may differ, there is an essential unity in all her work. The truth of this is perhaps more evident in A Susan Sontag Reader than in any of Sontag's individual books. The writer selected a sampling of her work, meaning the choice both to reflect accurately a career and also to guide the reader toward those qualities and concerns which she prizes in her own writing. A Susan Sontag Reader is arranged chronologically and draws on most of Sontag's books. There are selections from her two novels, The Benefactor and Death Kit, and from her collections of short stories, I, etcetera. The famous essays from the 1960s--\\"Against Interpretation,\\" \\"Notes on Camp,\\" and \\"On Style\\"--which established Sontag's reputation and can be fairly said to have shaped the cultural views of a generation are included, as are selctions from her two subsequent volumes of essays, Styles of Radical Will and Under the Sign of Satury. A part of Sontag's best-selling On Photography is also included. It is astonishing to read these works when they are detached from the books they appeared in and offered instead in the order in which Sontag wrote them. The connections between various literary forms, the progression of themes, are revealed in often startling ways. Moreover, Sontag has included a long interview in which she moves mroe informally over the whole range of her concerns and of her work. The volume ends with \\"Writing Itself,\\" a previously uncollected essay on Roland Barthes which, in the eyes of many, is one of Sontag's finest achievements. This collection is, in a sense, both a self-potrait and a key for a reader to understand the work of one of the most imporant writers of our time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WnoOBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Desert Giant (Hardy Boys, Book 40)","description":"The disappearance of a wealthy young industrialist leads Frank and Joe to Mexico","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=syuttu6q4JkC&dq=The+Mystery+of+the+Desert+Giant+(Hardy+Boys,+Book+40)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Spiders","description":" Nero Wolfe towers over his rivals...he is an exceptional character creation.

In addition to being a boon to those adventurers who are tempted to search for lost mines and buried treasures, it will be an important basic research tool for historians, geologists, geographers, anthropologists, archaeologists, and folklorists, and it will be useful in identifying the man treasure hoards and mining claims all the way from the Lost Adams Diggings in Arizona to the Stagecoach in Wyoming. The information given in this important bibliography was acquired through perusal of an unusually large number of books, newspapers, magazines, unpublished manuscripts, deposits in private and public libraries, holdings of various historical foundations, and governmental records and archives. The task took Mr. Probert three full years of steady, patient work. Many of these stories of lost mines and buried treasures have resulted in the discovery of some that are rarely acknowledged, largely because, as Mr. Probert points out, \\"those who have been so fortunate as to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow have deemed it wiser and much safer to keep their own counsel\\" -- Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H5XfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Arizona+Highways,+September+1958+(Santa+Cruz+County)+(Vol.+34,+No.+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chelation Can Cure: How to Reverse Heart Disease, Diabetes, Stroke, High Blood Pressure and Poor Circulation Without Drugs or Surgery","description":"3. Chelation Therapy, how it works, where to seek help Chelation Therapy has been in medical use for decades to treat the patients intoxicated with heavy metals like lead, mercury, arsenic and many others. The procedure involves use of FDA approved chelating agents like ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is another chelating agent used for the treatment of lead poisoning in children. However chelation therapy has not been approved by FDA for anything other than removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless Alternative medicine practitioners frequently use chelation therapy for helping patients with Heart disease. Hardening of arteries reduces the flow of blood through them thus affecting the much needed nourishment and oxygen to different parts of body. However administration of EDTA intravenously has proven time and time again effective against reversing the hardening of arteries and improving the blood flow. The treatment is almost painless. You simply lie down or sit up hooked up to a I V drip , read your book, sip on water, or simply relax and watch TV. The process takes about an hour and a half per sitting, depending upon your dosage. I am told 3 grams is full dose (bag)and one can start with half of that(half bag). You are encouraged to take a drink of water frequently as you would make a trip or two to empty your bladder to flush out the toxins. The procedure is conducted and supervised under a qualified medical practitioner. Your doctor will normally order blood test for you before and after few treatments to check your kidney function. Also your doctor will decide the total number and the frequency of these treatments depending on your situation. So basically the chelating agent like EDTA binds with the deposits and heavy metals in your blood and thus slowly flushing them out in your urine. Hence the importance of drinking water. Introducing Integrative Medicine. According to ACAM integrative medicine combines conventional care with alternative medicine to improve patient care. Rather than practice one type of medicine, integrative physicians will often combine therapies and treatment approaches to ensure the best results for their patients. ACAM physicians do not shun western medicine, in fact they practice western care every day. These physicians are unique in that they incorporate appropriate and proven alternative treatment options. Introducing ACAM-American College For Advancement In Medicine. ACAM organization located in Irvine California, trains and certify all licensed healthcare providers, including M.D's, DO's, ND's, Phd's and DC's and many more in integrative medicine. Chelation Therapy is one example. They maintain a list of certified Chelation therapists around the world. Contact ACAM in USA at 1-800-532-3688. Monday-Friday 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM Mountain Time or click on to this link http://acam.site-ym.com/search/custom.asp?id=1758 Click on Health Resources and select Physician+ link. Then select from Specialties \\"Chelation Therapy\\" from drop down list. Select country, and hit continue. You should have list of doctors certified by ACAM. (Note: In some countries you may not find any doctor). Note: Some of these treatments may not be covered by your medical insurance. Important Note: Readers are advised to be careful about using Oral Chelation products. Research shows that it may take a very long time, months or years in some cases to see any desired benefits. However intravenous Chelation Therapy many times is able to achieve these required benefits in days. Unfortunately IV therapy could be expensive as it may not be covered by your medical insurance. In that case Oral Chelation would be a alternate choice. Reported Benefits of Chelation Therapy: * Lowers Cholesterol * Helps lower blood pressure * Helps getting rid of cramps * Curb the Hair loss and even grow new hair * Reduce insulin dependence. Great for diabetics * Improve eye sight and avoid cataracts * Even post surgery cataract patients will enjoy fully restored sight *Sharpen memory and mental functions * look younger with less wrinkles and healthy nails * Avoid cold feet and hands and improve physical energy * Improved sex life * Reduce allergies * Improve cardiac health * Excellent cure for Alzheimer's disease *Helps maintain ideal weight *Reduces pain from arthritis and the list goes on. The Chelation Process Before actual treatment is scheduled your doctor should run your necessary lab reports for blood, urine and kidney functions. Also should check your blood for metal toxicity and go over your medical history including blood pressure and blood sugar. This would help your doctor to adjust your EDTA dosage and frequency of treatments. Your doctor knows best. Just follow his/her advice. If your primary doctor has covered some of these tests very recently you should take copies of these reports to this doctor, if you can. However I warn you if you will ask your primary doctor about Chelation therapy, most probably he will not approve it. You see main stream medical practitioners do not believe in these treatments. However when it was their own health involved these same doctors in several cases have opted for Chelation. According to National Institute of Health, over 800,000 patients opted for Chelation therapy in the United States in a single year! Kindly note this process is also advisable for heart patients who have already gone through the bypass as chances are the vein grafts used in bypass do get clogged again within next year or two. The chelation has been successfully used even for patients over age 90, hence age is not a issue factor normally. The process itself is painless. It is intravenous prick with a needle to start the EDTA drip. Though you are tied to IV equipment, mostly on wheels, you are free to move or use restroom as your arm is properly secured with tape. You can also simply sit with pillow supporting your back or lie down. You are free to move about, talk to other patients undergoing the same treatment, read a book or do your office / paper work, or watch TV or bring your kindle to read books like these. It is always a pleasant atmosphere. Trust me I have personally taken 12 treatments in year 2000 and now at age 75 I am planning to take few more treatments soon. One of the reason I have generated this kindle publication is to let people know that I am talking from my own experience as well. As they say it is better to die healthy when you are very old than to die young and unhealthy. Normal duration of this treatment is between 1-2 hours. You will start seeing some benefits after 4 to 5 treatments. Ten to 30 treatments are common depending upon your personal medical issues. You can also ask your doctor if you are a good candidate for a lower dosage (or half a bag) treatments saving you time and may be money. Make sure you communicate well with your doctor, if Chelation makes you feel dizzy or uncomfortable, weak or lethargic due to low blood pressure possibly. 99% of the times I believe you will have no side effects. EDTA is a mild diuretic and if you have frequent visits to bathroom consider that as a good sign. Drink plenty of water to help flush your kidneys. Average cost for Chelation treatments Costs vary from clinic to clinic but would run approx. around $100-$150 per treatment. Most of the insurance providers do not cover the cost. If you have time and patience and money you can fight the insurance provider and plead your case. I believe insurance pays if the chelation is for removal of toxic metals. Check with your doctor. Almost 12 years ago when I took the treatments my insurance company finally paid half of the cost. May be we should approach AARP group, here in USA, to fight for us. They have a strong voice for seniors. Let us now examine some actual case histories These case histories are collected from several sources as described below: Source: \\"Everything You Should Know About Chelation Therapy\\" by Dr. Morton Walker and Dr. Hitendra Shah. This is a great book to read. 1. R. H. is blind in his left eye as a result of a childhood accident. unfortunately he goes blind on the other eye as well. His doctor told him, there is nothing that can be done for him. However after 7 Chelation sessions his vision returns and at the same distance he reads better than his doctor! 2. Stewart F. an assembly-line foreman, was at the point of losing his gangrenous big toe. However 20 Chelation treatments saved his foot. 3. Harold W. H, M.D., was genetically predisposed to die early from a heart attack (like his father and grandfather and many other family members). He was advised to give up working as a doctor, as the stress involved aggravated his condition. After a first early heart attack, he received a classic combination of Chelation treatments and improved his diet and lifestyle. He returned to full health and was able to resume his duties. 4. John H. M.D., Clinical Professor of Surgery, has given over 16.000 Chelation infusions to his patients. He uses EDTA Chelation on himself. At the age of 70, he is still operating 15 hours a day. 5. Ophelia , 79, had a series of strokes. She was no longer able to walk alone. After more strokes she was hospitalized for the second time, then sent home, where she suffered yet another stroke, which paralyzed her so that she couldn't swallow anymore. Her children prepared for her death, but the old lady hung on to life for another three weeks. Her ankles were swollen and fluid was in the base of her lungs. She could not hear. She was semi-comatose - slipping in and out of sleep. Then, one of her sons arrived with news about Chelation therapy. Her doctor could not promise the family anything, as their Mamma was so far gone. She received the therapy, and improved steadily. The paralysis left. She re-learned everything she had lost: eating, drinking, talking coherently, moving around first with a walker, then without. Her first Chelation course consisted of 21 infusions. Later she took 20 more, at intervals of several months between series of 5. She is now well and carrying on a productive life. Her hearing has returned, and her appetite (that she had lost) is so good the family says she eats anything put in front of her, including Italian wine and sausage! 6. D.D. head of three corporations, found himself unable to function. Not only his brain failed, also his heart and his eyes. He was lucky to find the clinic of Dr. Evers , who gave him a special diet, exercise and Chelation therapy. After this treatment, D.D. was back to normal life. 7. A 46 year old woman from Texas, was brought to a Dr. Deiter because she was suddenly absolutely demented. She failed to recognize her husband or her grown children or her friends. A hair analysis found her to be super- saturated with mercury. After just a week of daily Chelation, she regained her senses. 8. A 58 year old attorney was legally blind from macular degeneration. School medicine had tried their standard procedures but could not halt the progress of the degenerative process. He decided to improve his diet and administer Chelation therapy. After less than 4 months he could read and even drive again. 9. C.C., a police officer, had three coronary artery blockages, one of 85%, one of 80%, and one of 75%. His cardiologist told him that he was beyond surgery - he was a goner! He decided to fight, and arrived in Dr. Evers' hospital in a wheelchair. After 7 weeks of Chelation treatment he went back to his job, which included picking up 200-pound drunks off the street. 10. Dr. Leon Anderson, doctor of osteopathy, had a Parkinson's type of tremor in his right hand. He took 30 chelation infusions, but the tremor already responded after the 5th. His health was restored and he could continue to work as a doctor. 11. Nick J. was hit by a series of unusual problems following a car accident. He suffered intense chest pains, and spells of unconsciousness. Within two years, he received 117 Chelations, his symptoms cleared up and the blackouts disappeared. 12. Warren M. Levin, M.D., used Chelation therapy on his patients but also on himself, as a prevention, having lost his father at the age of 56, without having any pressing need of his own. He noticed a very remarkable improvement in his memory functions. 13. Dr. R. H. a chiropractor, whose gangrenous diabetic legs were saved from amputation by only 15 Chelation infusions. 14. Paul M. a car assembly supervisor and chain smoker, had a whole list of complaints based on bad blood circulation. Hypertension, chest pain and muscle cramps were among them. 20 Chelation sessions gave him his health back. The blood pressure returned to normal after the 4th. 15. Alfred was told by a surgeon that he was in dire danger of death. He needed open heart surgery to correct his angina, but the mortality risk for him would be 50%. Aubrey agreed to the operation, but was not a fit enough candidate, was refused the operation and sent home to die. After receiving a course of Chelation therapy, he was again fit enough to walk four miles daily before breakfast. A new test found his heart good and his lungs clear, he was no longer a cardiac patient. But Medicare, his health care organization, refused to pay his bill in the amount of $364. The operation together with the hospital bill, amounting to $ 75,000, would have been paid, but as the treatment that cured him was \\"experimental and not tested\\" and \\"not considered the usual and customary treatment\\", he had to pay for it out of his own pocket. 16. Lester I. doctor of osteopathy, had an early warning and Chelation recommendation by a colleague, that he ignored. Only after his near-fatal heart attack 5 months later, where he needed electric shocks to bring his enlarged heart back to life, did he start the first 30 chelation infusions. He returned to full health. Source: Forty Something Forever-A consumer's guide to CHELATION THERAPY and other Heart-Savers. Harold & Arline Brecher. 1. 61 year old patient was suffering from peripheral vision due to diabetic retinopathy and could not drive. Dr. Michael Schachter (New York) started him on Chelation therapy. After just four treatments there was 50% improvement in his vision. His ophthalmologist was astounded! This patient almost legally blind now could drive his car again. 2. This 82 year old lady could no longer read, knit or watch TV and suffered great depression and anger due to her limitations. She started Chelation treatments out of desperation. After her fifth treatment she happen to glance outside her bedroom window and noticed her neighbor's dog running across her front lawn. Eureka! she screamed with joy and thanked God and ran outside to see the flowers, blue sky and started shouting with joy to a pleasant surprise of her neighbors! 3. 86 year old man in Texas, could not recognize his wife any more after 61 years of marriage. Dr. Fox cured him with Chelation treatments and this man was normal to celebrate his diamond wedding anniversary. 4. This 68 year old lady almost had lost her mind. She could not remember things. She would go upstairs to get something and forget the reason. She would go to mailbox and open the letter just put there for mailing. Family decided to seek legal advice to declare her incompetent. They were afraid she might hurt herself. Then a neighbor suggested to try Chelation. For next three months with this treatment she gradually started to come out of her condition till she recovered fully with her memory intact and became the loving person she was! 5. James had a terrible memory loss and even could not remember his own name. After just six Chelation treatments his mental faculties were fully restored. He began giving lectures about Chelation benefits to his fellow retirement village residents. 6. 1980 study undertaken by swiss scientists from institution of radiation therapy and nuclear medicine at the university of Zurich comes to a dramatic conclusion: Chelation with EDTA cuts the incidence of Cancer by 90%. My personal story: Recently I took 6 additional EDTA Chelation treatments. One a week. I had amazing positive results. I was on 50 mg of Losartan for B.P. and 20 mg of Lipitor for my Cholesterol before the treatment. After the six treatments I quit my BP medications and it has been two months now my BP is normal. I reduced my Lipitor to 10 mg per day. My Lipid profile was excellent after the Chelation. My total Cholesterol dropped from 187 to 140 and Triglycerides dropped from 199 to 119 and LDL bad cholesterol dropped from 92 to 72. I am amazed I am off the BP prescription. My primary doctor does not know about chelations I took. However he was very happy with my lipid Profile and BP. P.S. You may get a laugh at what I am about to tell you. However there is more truth to this than you may know. I read some where monkeys do not have heart problems. The secret is practice walking on your four like the little kids do before they learn to balance on their feet and learn to walk. So walk or crawl on floor inside your house over the carpet areas, including going up the stairs few times a day as an adult on your two feet and two hands. At first you may be out of breath if you are a older person but stay with it and slowly practice it daily. Apart from getting a laugh, You will benefit. ?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ni4UBgAAQBAJ&dq=Chelation+Can+Cure:+How+to+Reverse+Heart+Disease,+Diabetes,+Stroke,+High+Blood+Pressure+and+Poor+Circulation+Without+Drugs+or+Surgery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basel in the Age of Burckhardt: A Study in Unseasonable Ideas","description":"This remarkable history tells the story of the independent city-republic of Basel in the nineteenth century, and of four major thinkers who shaped its intellectual history: the historian Jacob Burckhardt, the philologist and anthropologist Johann Jacob Bachofen, the theologian Franz Overbeck, and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. \\"Remarkable and exceptionally readable . . .

After defining the problems, the author proposes models and solutions for some age-old dilemmas. Here are just some of the more than two dozen major questions that are discussed: What makes the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament authoritative for the church? How much continuity and discontinuity is there between the Old and New Testaments? Did the Old Testament writers consciously anticipate the Messiah? Were the object and method of salvation the same in both Testaments? What was the Old Testament believer's experience of the Holy Spirit? How can Christians teach or preach form the prophetic portions of the Old Testament? What is the challenge of the Old Testament for missions? According to Dr. Kaiser, understanding the Old Testament is the crucial problem for the Christian. Hardly an area in the Christian life, Christian doctrine, and biblical studies is not affected by one's understanding of the Old Testament. This book is a forceful demonstration of that truth. It deals with some of the crucial topics necessary to a proper and practical interpretation and application of the Old Testament and discusses them in three parts: (1) The Old Testament and Scholarship, (2) The Old Testament and Theology, and (3) The Old Testament and Life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2NAjpRfXFI4C&dq=Toward+Rediscovering+the+Old+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computational Philosophy of Science","description":"By applying research in artificial intelligence to problems in the philosophy of science, Paul Thagard develops an exciting new approach to the study of scientific reasoning.

The current controversy, centered on lawsuits for money damages, is characterized by sharp disagreement among stakeholders about the kinds of suits being filed, whether plaintiffs' claims are meritorious, and whether resolutions to class actions are fair or socially desirable. Ultimately, these concerns lead many to wonder, Are class actions worth their costs to society and to business? Do they do more harm than good? To describe the landscape of current damage class action litigation, elucidate problems, and identify solutions, the RAND Institute for Civil Justice conducted a study using qualitative and quantitative research methods. The researchers concluded that the controversy over damage class actions has proven intractable because it implicates deeply held but sharply contested ideological views among stakeholders. Nevertheless, many of the political antagonists agree that class action practices merit improvement. The authors argue that both practices and outcomes could be substantially improved if more judges would supervise class action litigation more actively and scrutinize proposed settlements and fee awards more carefully. Educating and empowering judges to take more responsibility for case outcomes--and ensuring that they have the resources to do so--can help the civil justice system achieve a better balance between the public goals of class actions and the private interests that drive them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b7_m0SVEiD0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Qualitative Methods for Marketplace Research","description":"The author draws on techniques from anthropology, sociology, psychology, and communication to guide the reader through all the naunces of qualitative methods needed to develop and analyse state-of-the-art market place studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6QUKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Qualitative+Methods+for+Marketplace+Research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life in Rural America","description":"A collection of essays by various authors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5NUZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Life+in+Rural+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bear Me Safely over","description":"Joseph's assured debut novel explores the lives of two Georgia families soon to be linked by a marriage.

Venice. A street. Enter Roderigo and Iago. RODERIGO. Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse, As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. IAGO. 'Sblood, but you will not hear me. If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me. RODERIGO. Thou told'st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate. IAGO. Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city, In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, Off-capp'd to him; and by the faith of man, I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, Evades them, with a bombast circumstance, Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war: And in conclusion, Nonsuits my mediators: for \\"Certes,\\" says he, \\"I have already chose my officer.\\" And what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife, That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric, Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election, And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds, Christian and heathen, must be belee'd and calm'd By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster, He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship's ancient. RODERIGO. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. IAGO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affin'd To love the Moor. RODERIGO. I would not follow him, then. IAGO. O, sir, content you. I follow him to serve my turn upon him: We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd. Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are Who, trimm'd in forms, and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And throwing but shows of service on their lords, Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin'd their coats, Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul, And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: In following him, I follow but myself. Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so for my peculiar end. For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In complement extern, 'tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. RODERIGO. What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, If he can carry't thus! IAGO. Call up her father, Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, And though he in a fertile climate dwell, Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, As it may lose some color. RODERIGO. Here is her father's house, I'll call aloud. IAGO.

Boston is swarming with soldiers, spies, and secrets. Tempers are flaring between the Whigs and the Tories. Fourteen-year-old Hannah Andrews is thrown into the middle of it all when she is driven out of her home by her guardian aunt to work as an indentured servant in the Boston household of Thomas Gage, governor of the colonies and general of the British armies. Soon after Hannah's arrival, the stable boy, Caleb, befriends her and alerts her to the issues faced by Americans under British rule. Hannah dreams of freedom and begins to sympathize with Americans who desire independence from Britain. On the other hand, Hannah has deep respect for the Gage family and affection for her rebellious young mistress, Meg. Hannah soon realizes that Meg is as trapped in her aristocratic life as Hannah is in her own bondage as a servant. Hannah relies on her beloved horse, Promise, to help her through the difficult times. Disguised as a boy on her midnight rides with Promise, Hannah learns on which side her heart belongs. Then, when Hannah overhears a British plot to march on her hometown, she and Promise risk their lives to carry the warning to the town of Salem.

Beginning in the 1930s, working for Newsweek and other magazines, he created poetic photo essays of enormous and lasting impact. Drawing from Smith's own archives and including illuminating texts, this comprehensive volume features more than 300 superb duotone reproductions of both famous and never-before-published images from his most important works. Smith's Life magazine photo essays are represented by images created in the 1940s and '50s for, among others, the landmark \\"Country Doctor\\", \\"Spanish Village\\", \\"Nurse Midwife\\", and \\"Albert Schweitzer: Man of Mercy\\". Among his later independent works are the hugely ambitious series on Pittsburgh and Haiti from the late 1950s.

They were nearly eliminated from the active force following the Vietnam War. But in the past fifteen years, special operations forces have risen from the ashes of the failed 1980 rescue of American hostages in Iran to become one of the most frequently deployed elements of the U.S. military. They are now adequately funded, better-equipped, and well-trained. Special operations forces are often the nation's first military response when faced with a crisis in today's uncertain and unstable international security environment. What caused this dramatic turnaround? As this book shows, it was a long way from congressional outrage at TV images of burned bodies of U.S. servicemen in the Iranian desert to the establishment of a special operations force of nearly 45,000 active and reserve personnel. The drama of how this happened sheds light on how public policy is made and implemented. It illustrates the complex interaction between internal forces within the special operations community, as well as between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government. The implementation of legislation establishing a special operations capability is seen to rebuild and protect these forces to an extent never imagined by the early \\"quiet professionals.\\" While offering insights into how the U.S. government makes policy, Susan Marquis also offers a revealing look at the special operations community, including their storied past, extreme training, and recent operational experience that continues to forge their distinctive organizational mission and culture. She describes the decade-long struggle to rebuild special operations forces, resulting in new SOF organizations with independence that is unique among U.S. military forces, an independence approaching that of a new military service.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zs9-0PyCTJcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literature: An Introduction to Reading and Writing, (1998 MLA Updated Edition) (5th Edition)","description":"Note: You are purchasing a standalone product; MyLiteratureLab? does not come packaged with this content.

It updated the discussion of design and decision making for the 21st century, with many new examples.

Thanks to the longevity revolution of recent decades, today's 55- to75-year-olds are living and working longer and healthier than ever before. This generation is the first to experience the period of personal renaissance in between middle and old age-what Trafford calls \\"My Time.\\" Defining this period as a whole new developmental stage in the life cycle, Trafford skillfully guides readers through the obstacles of My Time and offers them the opportunity to take full advantage of the bonus decades. With the same wit, compassion, and vivid storytelling that made Crazy Time one of the best-loved books ever written on the subject of divorce, Trafford blends personal stories with expert opinions and the latest research on adult development. From the psychoanalyst who gave up his practice to write self-help books, to the widowed mother of three who reinvented herself as a successful photographer, true tales of crisis and triumph sparkle on every page of this inspiring and insightful book.

Herwig Wolfram's panoramic history spans the great migrations of the Germanic peoples and the rise and fall of their kingdoms between the third and eighth centuries, as they invaded, settled in, and ultimately transformed the Roman Empire. As Germanic military kings and their fighting bands created kingdoms, and won political and military recognition from imperial governments through alternating confrontation and accommodation, the \\"tribes\\" lost their shared culture and social structure, and became sharply differentiated. They acquired their own regions and their own histories, which blended with the history of the empire. In Wolfram's words, \\"the Germanic peoples neither destroyed the Roman world nor restored it; instead, they made a home for themselves within it.\\" This story is far from the \\"decline and fall\\" interpretation that held sway until recent decades. Wolfram's narrative, based on his sweeping grasp of documentary and archaeological evidence, brings new clarity to a poorly understood period of Western history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_7EwDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Roman+Empire+and+Its+Germanic+Peoples&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Europa World Yearbook 1997 2v (Europa World Year Book (2v.))","description":"First published in 2003.

Drawing on ecumenical methodology, as well as many practical examples and illustrations, the authors discuss the developments in culture and missiology as these affect the practice of ecumenism, particularly in response to theologies of hope as well as inter-religious dialogue and pluralism.

The growth and growing pains of adulthood are identifiable in Hollinger's Hangin' On. Bike racer or not, readers will empathize with Jerry, Anne, Robert and the rest of the characters. In bicycle racing and life in general, heroic and tragic efforts are often overlooked, because the order at the finish line receives the most, if not all, of the recognition. What goes on between the starting line and finish line is still only part of what it takes to complete the plot. What happens after crossing one finish line and the next starting line is where our heroic and tragic moments happen the most in both the real world and in bike racing. One need not be a cyclist on the roads crossing the Texas prairie or a white collar professional in a big city to identify with the characters of Hangin  On, because those who are passionate about anyone or anything will feel it. But be prepared Hollinger subtly gives a wake up call, and what you saw in the mirror before Hangin  On may not be same after.

In 1862, recently widowed and with two small children to support, British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens agrees to serve as governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam (present-day Thailand), unaware that her years in the royal palace will change not only her own life, but also the future of a nation. Her relationship with King Mongkut, famously portrayed by Yul Brynner in the classic film The King and I, is complicated from the start, pitting two headstrong personalities against each other: While the king favors tradition, Anna embraces change. As governess, Anna often finds herself at cross-purposes, marveling at the foreign customs, fascinating people, and striking landscape of the kingdom and its harems, while simultaneously trying to influence her pupils especially young Prince Chulalongkorn with her Western ideals and values. Years later, as king, this very influence leads Chulalongkorn to abolish slavery in Siam and introduce democratic reform based on the ideas of freedom and human dignity he first learned from his beloved tutor. This captivating novel brilliantly combines in-depth research author Margaret Landon drew from Siamese court records and Anna s own writings with richly imagined details to create a lush portrait of 1860s Siam. As a Rodgers & Hammerstein Broadway musical and an Academy Awardwinning film, the story of Anna and the King of Siam has enchanted millions over the years.

Cadie Kessler has spent decades trying to cover up one truth. One moment. But deep down, didn t she always know her secret would surface? An urgent message from her long-estranged best friend Daniela Garcia brings Cadie, now a forestry researcher, back to her childhood home. There, Cadie and Daniela are forced to face a dark secret that ended both their idyllic childhood bond and the magical summer that takes up more space in Cadie s memory then all her other years combined. Now grown up, bound by long-held oaths, and faced with truths she does not wish to see, Cadie must decide what she is willing to sacrifice to protect the people and the forest she loves, as drought, foreclosures, and wildfire spark tensions between displaced migrant farm workers and locals.

James II's drive towards Catholicism had alienated the nation and his two staunchly Protestant daughters by his first marriage, Mary and Anne. They are the 'ungrateful daughters' who usurped their father's crown and stole their brother's birthright. Seven prominent men sent an invitation to William of Orange---James' nephew and son-in-law---to intervene in English affairs. But it was the women, Queen Mary Beatrice and her two stepdaughters, Mary and Anne, who played a key role in this drama. Jealous and resentful of her hated stepmother, Anne had written a series of malicious letters to her sister Mary in Holland, implying that the Queen's pregnancy was a hoax, a Catholic plot to deny Mary her rightful inheritance. Betrayed by those he trusted, distraught at Anne's defection, James fled the kingdom. Even as the crown descended on her head, Mary knew she had incurred a father's curse. The sisters quarreled and were still not speaking to each other when Mary died tragically young. Anne did nothing to deserve her father's forgiveness, declaring her brother an outlaw with a price on his head. Acclaimed historian Maureen Waller recreated the late Stuart era in a compelling narrative that highlights the influence of three women in one of the most momentous events in English history. Prompted by religious bigotry and the emotion that beset any family relationships, this palace coup changed the face of the monarchy, and signaled the end of a dynasty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WNx58cXdj8EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The ambushers (A Fawcett gold medal book)","description":"The memoirs of a Pulitzer Prize-winning literary journalist and critic discusses his childhood and education in small-town Ohio, his colorful family and friends, and his voracious appetite for reading.

Do the notation and vocabulary seem inconsistent? Does your knowledge of their algorithmic aspects feel incomplete? The fast Fourier transform represents one of the most important advancements in scientific and engineering computing. Until now, however, treatments have been either brief, cryptic, intimidating, or not published in the open literature. Inside the FFT Black Box brings the numerous and varied ideas together in a common notational framework, clarifying vague FFT concepts. Examples and diagrams explain algorithms completely, with consistent notation. This approach connects the algorithms explicitly to the underlying mathematics. Reviews and explanations of FFT ideas taken from engineering, mathematics, and computer science journals teach the computational techniques relevant to FFT. Two appendices familiarize readers with the design and analysis of computer algorithms, as well. This volume employs a unified and systematic approach to FFT. It closes the gap between brief textbook introductions and intimidating treatments in the FFT literature. Inside the FFT Black Box provides an up-to-date, self-contained guide for learning the FFT and the multitude of ideas and computing techniques it employs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TvaRyAEACAAJ&dq=Inside+the+Fft+Black+Box&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of orchestration, with musical examples drawn from his own works","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UUsJAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terror at Sea: True Tales of Shipwrecks, Cannibalism, Pirates, Fire at Sea, and Other Dire Disasters in the 18th & 19th Centuries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NoXaAAAACAAJ&dq=Terror+at+Sea:+True+Tales+of+Shipwrecks,+Cannibalism,+Pirates,+Fire+at+Sea,+and+Other+Dire+Disasters+in+the+18th&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fun with Bugs Stencils (Dover Stencils)","description":"Easy-to-trace images of 6 creepy crawlers   wasp, winged ant, Hercules beetle, moth, weevil, and grasshopper   will add an interesting note to many flat surfaces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yCxJKEq2P1IC&dq=Fun+with+Bugs+Stencils+(Dover+Stencils)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make the Rules or Your Rivals Will","description":"This book introduces a dynamic, new framework for using law, litigation, regulation and lobbying as part of competitive business strategy.

This is Sylvester Stallone. Give me a call . . .\\" It was these words that would set Jim Peterik on the road to rock 'n' roll immortality. After he and his Survivor bandmates recorded \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" for the Rocky III soundtrack, the song would go on to earn a Grammy, an Oscar nomination, reach triple platinum status and become one of the most recognizable tunes in music history. But there's much more to the story of Survivor and its founding member, Jim Peterik, than meets the eye. As one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation, Peterik has cowritten songs with some of the most famous bands and artists of our time, including 38 Special (\\"Caught Up in You,\\" \\"Hold on Loosely\\"), Sammy Hagar (\\"Heavy Metal\\"), The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, and many more. Now, for the first time, Peterik is sharing his stories. Filled with tales from Peterik's life in rock 'n' roll, Through the Eye of the Tiger documents his early days of success with The Ides of March (\\"Vehicle\\"), through the often torturous power struggles within Survivor, and the giddy highs that accompany a trail of worldwide hits. From going to a party in Led Zeppelin's hotel room (and turning right back out the door) to escorting a disoriented Janis Joplin back to her hotel room after opening her show in Calgary, Peterik's accounts will surprise and delight. Through the Eye of the Tiger is more than just a memoir of a songwriting legend; it's a classic rock 'n' roll story told through the eyes of someone who has lived through it all and through the Eye of the Tiger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGQVBQAAQBAJ&dq=THE+EYE+OF+THE+TIGER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Wishy-Washy's Christmas (Book & CD)","description":"When Mrs. Wishy-Washy asks her farm animals to take a bath for Christmas, they find a way to take one without freezing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcRaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Mrs.+Wishy-Washy%27s+Christmas+(Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye of the Beholder (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1204)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mxYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Eye+of+the+Beholder+(Silhouette+Intimate+Moments+No.+1204)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Friendship and Peer Culture in the Early Years (Language and Learning for Human Service Professions)","description":"Based on a year-long micro-ethnography of a nursery school, this book presents a unique approach to childhood socialization by focusing directly upon the social, interactive, and communicative processes that make up the world of young children.

In class, I remember being told to go out to the garden, sit there alone, and write down what I saw outside. As I reflect back on this, I realize what a rich and challenging childhood it was. It is more than rare that a child will be asked to write' anything at that age. I do remember the experience acutely, and I did write about the garden and the things I saw. Perhaps this, and the later pleasures of discovering word-art that were sparked, made the act of writing as natural to me as speaking was. I can still see that little piece of lined paper, with my words on it. It was in my writing files for many adult years; but somewhere in the moves from state to state, city to city in the U.S.A., part of those files were lost, and along with them, that one essential symbol of my early love affair with words. Because that first attempt led to many more all through childhood, by the time I was 10, verses of rhyme were pouring out. There has always been a resonance for me between writing and painting. Each expresses an aspect of what I know myself to be. Each reflects a perception of the world expressed in a way that cannot be substituted with another art form. Although the poetry was not put out in the world because of its personal nature, it allowed me to crystallize the events and feelings of intense experiences. It was a passion. I could feel a poem coming on' and would sit down to write without thinking, often finding the whole poem done' from start to finish, without pause at any point. This could and did occur in the middle of the night, out of a deep sleep. Of course as I matured, there were also great struggles involved, and even those poems which flowed out so easily were reworked and honed, sometimes for months even years. Parallel to this word-addiction was a love of drawing and painting, which started to accelerate in my early teens. Eventually, I would find myself stuck in matters of draftsmanship, and in need of specific, outside disciplines in the visual arts. So it was no surprise to anyone that my first choice at U.C.L.A. was a major in art and a degree in that field; although I suspect that secretly my parents would have preferred a choice more demanding of traditionally intellectual endeavors. I'm certain they were happy when I received my Masters and then my PhD in clinical psychology at a much later date. Arieti Sylvano says in his book \\"Creativity: The Magic Synthesis\\", that the arts in all forms (as well as the sciences) originate in what he terms the \\"endocept\\" or \\"amorphous cognition\\" which is the \\"nonrepresentational activity of the psyche\\". This is not to say the mind remains uninvolved in the act of making fine art; quite the contrary. A developed ability to conceptualize is required in all the fine arts; otherwise the results are generalized, unoriginal, or formularized. Formal problem solving, as well, is an ever present requirement. However, it is possible to accomplish a great part of the work in what I would term an altered' state. Much of it is like a meditation. All parts of the process will vary from artist to artist, of course. Most of my own work in the studio manifests as a joyous perception, while much of my writing focuses, without clear intention, on the melancholy, the painful, the darker dreams, the ambience of anxiety, the inevitability of loss. The writing probably has roots in a once-happy six year old who was jolted out of safety, traumatically relocated in a new country because of an impending war, and who never saw her grandparents again because those dear people were swallowed up in WWII's monstrosities.

Calvin Klein is the world's most well-known (and successful) fashion designer and has created one of the most recognizable brands in existence, but the tale of his ascendancy to the top of the fashion industry has never been fully told. The House of Klein is the warts-and-all expos  of a boy from the Bronx who made his name synonymous with high fashion by making his brand synonymous with sex. This book offers an informed, insider's account of the defining moments of a fashion legend's life, a life circumscribed by personal and professional struggle. Fashion writer Lisa Marsh pulls no punches in presenting the true story of this mammoth of the clothing industry, complete with corporate battles, lawsuits, petty personal vendettas and backroom dealings. Marsh reveals the underbelly of the glittering world of high fashion-a world characterized not so much by beautiful people and wild parties, as it is by money and power, above all else.

Book reviewers and academic critics often turned antagonistic toward Steinbeck when he no longer produced work with the sweeping reach and social consciousness of The Grapes of Wrath. He was accused of selling out, or co-opting his talent, when in fact the inordinate public success of Grapes and especially its attendant notoriety had caused a backlash for Steinbeck. As a result he became self-conscious about his own ability, and suspicious of that \\"clumsy vehicle,\\" the novel. The very act of researching and writing Grapes, which occupied him fully for several years and which he had already conceived as his final book on proletarian themes, changed him drastically. No longer willing to be the chronicler of Depression-era subjects, Steinbeck went afield to find new roots, new sources, new forms. For example, in the six years following the publication of Grapes, Steinbeck completed a suit of love poems; a full-length novel (bastardized by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1943 film, Lifeboat); a nonfiction scientific book, Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research (with Edward F. Ricketts); a documentary film, The Forgotten Village; a documentary book to help the war effort, Bombs Away: The Story of a Bomber Team; a series of articles he wrote as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune (later collected as Once There Was a War); and two novels, The Moon Is Down and Cannery Row. Steinbeck came to define himself less as a novelist and more as a man of letters, a restless experimenter with form and subject matter, and a prophetic postmodernist whose key subject for the rest of his career was the dilemma of individual choice and ethical consciousness. Thus, Steinbeck's later fiction, from The Moon Is Down (1942) through The Winter of Our Discontent (1962), and his later nonfiction, from Sea of Cortez (1941) through Travels with Charley (1962) and America and Americans (1966), often shows a different set of stylistic, thematic, and philosophical bearings from his earlier work and underscores his dramatic shift toward \\"individual thinking.\\" A full appreciation of Steinbeck's mid-career metamorphosis and, consequently, of his later achievement requires a corresponding shift in critical approach - a departure from the traditional New Critical norms. Instead of marginalizing these works, all the contributors to this volume agree that Steinbeck's later publications merit - indeed, demand - closer scrutiny. Written especially for this collection in honor of Professor Tetsumaro Hayashi, the distinguished founder and editor-in-chief of the Steinbeck Quarterly, on his retirement from Ball State University and his move to Kwassui Women's College in Nagasaki, Japan, these essays explore new ways of addressing Steinbeck's later work and career, and include forays into subjects as diverse as ethnicity and music. They range from treatment of his post-structuralist use of language in Sea of Cortez and his involvement as a speech writer for Franklin Delano Roosevelt's reelection bid in 1944 to the influence of Charles Darwin's theories of sexual selection in The Wayward Bus, his revision of the myth of Cain in The Winter of Our Discontent, and his employment of Arthurian quest values in his last book, America and Americans. For this group of critics - which includes respected veteran Steinbeck scholars Robert DeMott, John Ditsky, Mimi Gladstein, Cliff Lewis, Robert Morsberger, Susan Shillinglaw, and Roy Simmonds, as well as talented new voices Debra Barker, Kevin Hearle, Michael Meyer, Brian Railsback, Eiko Shiraga, and Geralyn Strecker - The Moon is Down and The Wayward Bus loom as significant works in the post 1930s re-evaluation (two essays each appear on these works). The book also includes Donald Coers's interview with the writer's widow, Elaine Steinbeck, the first of its kind ever published. After The Grapes of Wrath opens with eminent Americanist Warren French's appreciation of Professor Hayashi's distinguished career and his influence in Steinbeck studies; a bibliography of Hayashi's major publication concludes this honorary gathering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P29bAAAAMAAJ&dq=After+Grapes+Of+Wrath:+Essays+On+John+Steinbeck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Seasons: The 1944 St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns","description":"The 1944 baseball season was special to fans in St. Louis--the first and only time that the city's two major league teams made it to the World Series.Day by day, the 1944 season of both the Browns and Cardinals is chronicled.

But how did it evolve? How did a language spoken originally by a few thousand Anglo-Saxons become one used by more than 1,500 million? What developments can be seen as we move from Beowulf to Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens and the present day? A host of fascinating questions are answered in The Stories of English, a groundbreaking history of the language by David Crystal, the world-renowned writer and commentator on English. Many books have been written about English, but they have all focused on a single variety: the educated, printed language called  standard?? English. David Crystal turns the history of English on its head and instead provides a startlingly original view of where the richness, creativity and diversity of the language truly lies in the accents and dialects of nonstandard English users all over the world. Whatever their regional, social or ethnic background, each group has a story worth telling, whether it is in Scotland or Somerset, South Africa or Singapore. Interweaved within this central chronological story are accounts of uses of dialect around the world as well as in literary classics from The Canterbury Tales to The Lord of the Rings. For the first time, regional speech and writing is placed center stage, giving a sense of the social realities behind the development of English. This significant shift in perspective enables the reader to understand for the first time the importance of everyday, previously marginalized, voices in our language and provides an argument too for the way English should be taught in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qRKEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters of Painted Ladies: America's Resplendent Victorians","description":"Describes and illustrates the effects of the San Francisco-based Colorist movement on Victorian-style buildings around the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hvHtOti45fAC&dq=Daughters+of+Painted+Ladies:+America%27s+Resplendent+Victorians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shape Analysis and Classification: Theory and Practice (Image Processing Series)","description":"Advances in shape analysis impact a wide range of disciplines, from mathematics and engineering to medicine, archeology, and art.

Exclusively for Today's Leaders and Managers","description":"In his sixty-five-year consulting career, Peter F. Drucker, widely regarded as the father of modern management, identified eight practices that can make any executive effective. Leadership is not about charisma or extroversion. It s about these practices: Effective executives ask,  What needs to be done?  They also ask,  What is right for the enterprise?  They develop action plans. They take responsibility for decisions. They take responsibility for communicating. They focus on opportunities rather than problems. They run productive meetings. And they think and say  we  rather than  I.  Since 1922, Harvard Business Review has been a leading source of breakthrough ideas in management practice. The Harvard Business Review Classics series now offers you the opportunity to make these seminal pieces a part of your permanent management library.

A local priest got 120 released, many with broken ankles and other marks of abuse, but the rest vanished.  scar Mart nez, a young writer from El Salvador, was in Altar soon after the abduction, and his account of the migrant disappearances is only one of the harrowing stories he garnered from two years spent traveling up and down the migrant trail from Central America and across the US border. More than a quarter of a million Central Americans make this increasingly dangerous journey each year, and each year as many as 20,000 of them are kidnapped. Mart nez writes in powerful, unforgettable prose about clinging to the tops of freight trains; finding respite, work and hardship in shelters and brothels; and riding shotgun with the border patrol. Illustrated with stunning full-color photographs, The Beast is the first book to shed light on the harsh new reality of the migrant trail in the age of the narcotraficantes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_7lvDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Beast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bride for Donnigan (Women of the West #7)","description":"Responding to an Advertisement, She Crossed an Ocean to Meet a Total Stranger and Became a Mail-Order Bride...Kathleen O'Malley stood on the deck of the Barreth Lily and watched the land she'd called home for more than a dozen years slip from her view.

Chemical warfare affected tactics and almost changed the outcome of World War I. The overwhelming success of the first use of gas caught both sides by surprise. Fortunately, the pace of hostilities permitted the Allies to develop a suitable defense to German gas attacks and eventually to field a considerable offensive chemical capability. Nonetheless, from the introduction of chemical warfare in early 1915 until Armistice Day in November, 1918, the Allies were usually one step behind their German counterparts in the development of gas doctrine and the employment of gas tactics and procedures. In his final report to Congress on World War I, General John J. Pershing expressed the sentiment of contemporary senior officers when he said, \\"Whether or not gas will be employed in future wars is a matter of conjecture, but the effect is so deadly to the unprepared that we can never afford to neglect the question.\\" General Pershing was the last American field commander actually to confront chemical agents on the battlefield. Today, in light of a significant Soviet chemical threat and solid evidence of chemical warfare in Southeast and Southwest Asia, it is by no means certain he will retain that distinction. Over 50 percent of the Total Army's Chemical Corps assets are located within the United States Army Reserve. This Leavenworth Paper was prepared by the USAA Staff Officer serving with the Combat Studies Institute, USACGSC, after a number of requests from USAA Chemical Corps officers for a historical study on the nature of chemical warfare in World War I. Despite originally being published in 1984, this Leavenworth Paper also meets the needs of the Total Army in its preparations to fight, if necessary, on a battlefield where chemical agents might be employed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ddspvAEACAAJ&dq=Rhine+crossing+(Ballantine%27s+illustrated+history+of+the+violent+century:+Battle+book+No.+27)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American History: The Modern Era Since 1865, Student Edition","description":"Print student edition","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LNoJAAAACAAJ&dq=American+History:+The+Modern+Era+Since+1865,+Student+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business English and communication","description":"This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction for students and professionals who are studying English for business or workplace communication and covers both spoken and written English.

Centered on the letters they exchanged with each other and with other members of their circle writers, intellectuals, friends, and publishers, including Elizabeth Bishop, Caroline Blackwood, Mary McCarthy, and Adrienne Rich the book has the narrative sweep of a novel, telling the story of the dramatic breakup of their twenty-one-year marriage and their extraordinary, but late, reconciliation. Lowell s controversial sonnet-sequence The Dolphin (for which he used Hardwick s letters as a source) and his last book, Day by Day, were written during this period, as were Hardwick s influential books Seduction and Betrayal: Essays on Women in Literature and Sleepless Nights: A Novel. Lowell and Hardwick are acutely intelligent observers of marriages, children, and friends, and of the feelings that their personal crises gave rise to. The Dolphin Letters, masterfully edited by Saskia Hamilton, is a debate about the limits of art what occasions a work of art, what moral and artistic license artists have to make use of their lives as material, what formal innovations such debates give rise to. The crisis of Lowell s The Dolphin was profoundly affecting to everyone surrounding him, and Bishop s warning to Lowell  art just isn t worth that much  haunts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eG6VDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constellations Dot-to-Dot","description":"More than a dozen unique dot-to-dots are presented in this entertaining and educational collection.

Spirit Tree offers a unique social psychological interpretation of Shint? ritual at the Hakozaki Hachiman Shrine in Fukuoka, Japan and situates the cosmological organization of this practice within the larger context of ritual in East Asia. Employing a comparative approach, this study blends two theoretical orientations: cultural anthropology and Jungian psychology. Hakozaki's rituals are a combination of a Yayoi period female medium tradition with a complex set of Chinese Yin-Yang Five Phase principles. Both systems are based on the feminine archetype, a fundamental conceptual foundation of Shint? ritual practice, which cognitively links woman and the earth. While the female shaman tradition is female-affirming in outlook, the later Chinese system is much less so. This monograph is a new acknowledgement of the conceptual continuity of Shint? ritual as an outgrowth of social cognition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iDqKsWFEf-4C&dq=Spirit+Tree:+Origins+of+Cosmology+in+Shinto+Ritual+at+Hakozaki&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Peace with the Things in Your Life: Why Your Papers, Books, Clothes, and Other Possessions Keep Overwhelming You and What to Do About It","description":"A guide to understanding why your possessions keep overwhelming you and what to do about it, written by a professional organizer and psychotherapist.

Staff would be reminded very powerfully of the young people's feelings and fears in being in class and school and how they will cope. The books could prompt discussions in class to help other pupils to understand more and, one hopes, target less children who are going to be different.' - Rostrum Alex's younger brother Nic never seems to be able to get anything right. He even invites Brianna Santos the girl Alex likes over when Alex is goofing around in his geeky pyjamas. But Alex never forgets what a special person Nic is. Wishing on the Midnight Star presents the sibling's view of the joys and frustrations of having a younger brother with Asperger Syndrome, with insights into the daily adventures of an AS family, and the positive coping, and loving strategies they have evolved. It is an engaging and amusing teen love story that will appeal to older and younger kids.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pi-1_fJ4NFEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic World","description":"A rich and multi-faceted history of heroes and villains interwoven with the profound changes in human knowledge that took place between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Spanning some of the most vibrant and fascinating eras in European history, Cambridge historian Derek Wilson reveals a society filled with an ardent desire for knowledge and astounding discoveries and the fantastic discoveries that flowered from it. There was the discovery of the movement of blood around the body; the movement of the earth around the sun; the velocity of falling objects (and why those objects fell). But these these thinkers were steeped in and drew from intellectual traditions that might surprise us. There was folk religion, which in its turn had deep roots in a pagan past. Others referred to spirits or tapped into stores of ancient wisdom and herbal remedies. This was the world of wise women, witches, necromancers, potions and incantations. Even the mighty Catholic Church, which permeated all elements of life, had its own \\"magical\\" traditions. Devote believers and accomplished scientists alike both pursued alchemy. Astrology, also a rapidly developing field, was based on the belief that human affairs were controlled by the movement of heavenly bodies. Casting horoscopes was a near-universal practice, from the papacy to the peasantry. Yet from this heady cultural mix, the scientific method would spring. But it was not just Europe where this tidal wave of intellectual innovation was colliding with folk wisdom to create something new. The twelfth-century Islamic polymath, Averroes, has been called 'the father of secular thought' because of his landmark treatises on astronomy, physics and medicine. Jewish scholars melded mysticism to create the esoteric disciplines of the Kabbalah. By the mid-seventeenth century, \\"science mania\\" was in full flower. In 1663, The Royal Society in London received its charter. Just three years later, the French Academy of Sciences was founded, and other European capitals rapidly followed suit. In 1725, the word \\"science\\" was at last defined as \\"a branch of study concerned either with a connected body of demonstrated truths or with observed facts systematically classified.\\" Yet just nine years before, the last witch had been executed in Britain. Fascinating and thought-provoking, A Magical World is a reminder of humanity's paradoxical nature our passionate pursuit of knowledge alongside deep-rooted fears, superstitions, and traditions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TqAvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latin American cooking, (Foods of the world)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lXzozAEACAAJ&dq=Latin+American+cooking,+(Foods+of+the+world)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auction or Madame You Can't Possibly Go Wrong in This Bed","description":"Young Cassie Logan endures humiliation and witnesses the racism of the KKK as they embark on a cross-burning rampage, before she fully understands the importance her family attributes to having land of their own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ETNTDQAAQBAJ&dq=Auction+or+Madame+You+Can%27t+Possibly+Go+Wrong+in+This+Bed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"36 Days : The Complete Chronicle of the 2000 Presidential Election Crisis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oiTttwEACAAJ&dq=36+Days+:+The+Complete+Chronicle+of+the+2000+Presidential+Election+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walk This Way: An Interactive Guide for Following Jesus","description":"By presenting the beatitudes as the \\"eight steps\\" to becoming Jesus' disciple, this book makes discipleship accessible to everyone.

Drawing on unpublished scores, manuscripts, sketches and documents from the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin, concert programs from a private collection in Berkeley, acoustic recordings, information about Busoni's intellectual interests gleaned from an auction catalogue featuring the contents of his extensive library, and the published aesthetic writings, letters, and compositions, the present study offers the first comprehensive account of Busoni's work concept. By establishing connections between his ideas and his musical practice, it explores and clarifies the reasoning behind his idiosyncratic compositional style, a style characterized by a blurring of boundaries between original and borrowed material. Polystylistic mixtures of the old and new and a distinctive performance style, in which Busoni creatively altered and embellished existing texts, exemplify his practice in an age in thrall to Werktreue, when originality of idea was prized above all else.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d8I7h0eObT0C&dq=Musicians+of+Today+(Essay+index+reprint+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Courage of Sarah Noble Study Guide","description":"In this Newbery Honor book classic, young Sarah learns how to be brave even when the world is strange and new.

The question addressed by the book is posed in the Introduction: what is the significance of the existence of the Jewish people for Christian faith? It is only since the end of the Second World War that attempts have been made to answer this question in a manner sympathetic to the Jewish people. Michel Remaud's book counts, therefore, as one of the few pioneering efforts made so far to present a detailed theological answer to the question.The book consists of three parts: 'The Faithfulness of Israel', 'On the Shoah' and 'Facing Israel'. The first part includes a re-thinking of Isaiah chapter 53 on the Suffering Servant; in order to reconcile the classical Jewish and Christian interpretations of this passage, the author refers to chapters 9-11 of Paul's Epistle to the Romans.'On the Shoah' deals with the difficulties of speech on the subject and describes in a circumspect manner the nature of the Christian responsibility for the Shoah.The third part concerns current Christian teaching on themes linked to Judaism and suggests positive ways in which the two faiths may be shown to be linked. This is done without falling into syncretism or diminishing the special natures of each faith.An Appendix describes the significance and difficulties concerning the recognition of the State of Israel by the Holy See.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6e4RBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE PRICE OF UNION","description":"Explores the origins and development of American political institutions.

Why have males in many animals evolved more conspicuous ornaments, signals, and weapons than females? How can such traits evolve although they may reduce male survival? Such questions prompted Darwin's perhaps most scientifically controversial idea--the theory of sexual selection. It still challenges researchers today as they try to understand how competition for mates can favor the variety of sex-dimorphic traits. Reviewing theoretical and empirical work in this very active field, Malte Andersson, a leading contributor himself, provides a major up-to-date synthesis of sexual selection. The author describes the theory and its recent development; examines models, methods, and empirical tests; and identifies many unsolved problems. Among the topics discussed are the selection and evolution of mating preferences; relations between sexual selection and speciation; constraints on sexual selection; and sex differences in signals, body size, and weapons. The rapidly growing study of sexual selection in plants is also reviewed.

In Fisher s writings the razor-sharp rage is equalled only by the enveloping sweetness; the raw eroticism by a dazzling writerly elegance. Evocations of a haunting and mobile childhood are mixed in Fisher s stories with an X-ray view of the racialized sexual vernaculars of gay San Francisco; while the journals braid together the narratives of sexual exploration and discovery, a joyous and deepening vocation as a writer, a growing intimacy with death, and an engagement with racial problematics that becomes ever more gravely and probingly imaginative. A uniquely intimate, unflinching testimony of the experience of a young, African American gay man in the AIDS emergency, Gary in Your Pocket includes an introduction by Don Belton that describes Fisher s achievement in the context of other work by Black gay men such as Marlon Riggs and Essex Hemphill, and a biographical afterword by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GBONi2GO5WAC&dq=Gary+In+Your+Pocket:+Stories+and+Notebooks+of+Gary+Fisher+(Series+Q)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of Germany from the earliest times to the present day,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRYZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What the Heart Knows (A Milford-Haven Novel)","description":"Book One of the best-selling, award-winning series, now at last in paperback.

His lifelong accomplishments include the typical sports participation, a brief experience in the world of auto racing, and president and CO of several intermediate-sized corporations. At age forty-one, he experienced a life-altering near-death experience. From that time forward, a search for the answers to the meaning of this life began and his writing also began. When asked why, he'll say, \\"Nothing of this world can explain what happened to me, but I think it is most evident in my writing.\\" \\"I don't have to think about writing; I just sit down and begin. In just a very few minutes, I look over what I've written and I wonder where the words came from. I mean, I know I wrote them but sometimes they seem so unlike me that they bring me to tears. There is so much feeling and emotion in them. Everyone has told me that I should publish some of them. I have literally thousands of pieces of work. Sometimes, I just can't seem to start my day until I've put pen to paper and somehow reached that part inside of myself. I hope that somehow the poems inside of this book reach someone else too. The Itch Is Back is about a quest for the understanding of this life. It's about understanding love. It's about feeling alive. I hope that you enjoy.\\" And that's his take on it. Jim radically changed his entire life after the near-death experience. This book is dedicated to those changes. Jim would like to dedicate this book to his two children and to his wife, Brande, who, as he says, is the source of all his endeavors. He says that to dedicate this book to his family is merely a minor detail because he has already dedicated his life as well as his afterlife to them. When asked if there are more books to come, he smiles and says, \\"There's always more to come.\\" \\"This kind of mixture between old world style writing and modern philosophy is hard to find anymore. Jim's work seems to transcend time effortlessly with more heart and more feeling than anything I've ever read before. These are truly works that will live on forever, influencing generations to come to read and enjoy. A must-have book for the twenty-first century. No one's library is complete without a copy.\\" \\"Poetry often does not make it to publishing and that is a shame. The Itch Is Back proves once and for all that the modernization of our world has not fully eliminated spirituality nor love, nor the acceptance of the importance of expression expelled by any generation.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M6bsAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Itch+Is+Back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"J.J.

It's all here: from how she got the role (and why she almost didn't) to romances on the set and wild nights in Salzburg; from the near-disaster during the gazebo dance to her relationships--then and now--with her six celluloid siblings. Charmian offers stories from fans and friends and a treasury of photographs. And she reveals why she left acting, what she learned when she met the real von Trapp children; and how The Sound of Music has helped her get through stormy times in her own life.

Possessing a knowledge of culture, society, and history not always shared by the media's talking heads, anthropologists have played a crucial role in educating the general reader on the public debates from World War I to the second Gulf War. This anthology collects over fifty commentaries by noted anthropologists such as Margaret Mead, Franz Boas, and Marshall Sahlins who seek to understand and explain the profound repercussions of U.S. involvement in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Frequently drawing on their own fieldwork, the anthropologists go beyond the headlines to draw connections between indigenous cultures, corporate globalization, and contemporary political and economic crises. Venues range from the op-ed pages of internationally renowned newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post to magazine articles and television interviews. Special sections entitled \\"Prelude to September 11\\" and \\"Anthropological Interpretations of September 11\\" include articles that provided many Americans with their first substantial introduction to the history of Islam, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Each article includes a brief introduction contextualizing the commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oHx0Mao7nnMC&dq=Anthropologists+in+the+Public+Sphere:+Speaking+Out+on+War,+Peace,+and+American+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fodor's Citypack Chicago, 2nd Edition (Citypacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mxYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fodor%27s+Citypack+Chicago,+2nd+Edition+(Citypacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WYVERN.","description":"A Tale Of Becoming Set On The High Seas Born in 1609, son of a native woman and a Dutch sea captain he never knew, Jaki Gefjon grows up in the jungle as a sorcerer's apprentice.

With the struggle between Athens and Sparta at its core, the twenty-seven-year conflict drew in states from all points of the compass; from Byzantion in the north, Crete in the south, Asia Minor in the east and Sicily in the west. Since Thucydides described the war as 'the greatest disturbance to befall the Greeks' numerous studies have been made of individual episodes and topics. This authoritative work is the first single-volume study of the entire war to be published in over seventy-five years. Lazenby avoids the tendency of allowing historiography to obscure the analysis, and while paying due attention to detail, also looks at the fundamental questions of warfare raised by the conflict. Within a narrative framework, Lazenby concentrates on the fighting itself, and examining the way in which both strategy and tactics developed as the conflict spread. Not afraid to challenge accepted views, he assesses the war as a military rather than a political endeavour, evaluating issues such as the advantages and limitations of sea power. A readable and clear survey, this text offers a balanced discussion of controversial themes, and will appeal to ancient historians, classicists and all those who are interested in military history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jSgZ4JyYLwQC&dq=Peloponnesian+War+(Warfare+and+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of the Enemy: Oral Histories of Vietnamese Amerasians and Their Mothers","description":"When U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, they left behind thousands of young children fathered by American soldiers. The new regime regarded the Amerasians as children of the enemy and ostracized them from Vietnamese society. The U.S. government passed the Homecoming Act of 1988, finally facilitating immigration of Amerasians to the United States. Most who have emigrated faced difficulty adjusting to a new culture and only about 2 percent have been reunited with their fathers. Revealing and often poignant, the 38 interviews here give voice to the struggle that Amerasians and their mothers faced in their homeland.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nz7ZDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Better World: Stalinism and the American Intellectuals","description":"This book chronicles the struggle among non-Communist leftists and liberals over American relations with the Soviet Union from 1939 through the 1950s. Few now care as passionately and as violently as people did then about Soviet-American relations. It was a time when friends became enemies, and others forged strange alliances, all in the name of commitments that today seem remote. A Better World evokes those times and their choices, and explains why these long-ago battles still arouse such deep feelings today - and should.Americans who were pro-Soviet without being members of the Communist party - 'progressives' as they called themselves - had a large emotional investment in the Soviet Union. From 1935 to 1939 literally millions joined the 'Popular Front' of pro-Soviet organizations. O'Neill takes us through the shock of the Stalin-Hitler pact of 1939, through the revival of the Popular Front spurred by government and business support after Russia entered the war against Hitler. He traces the isolation of the anti-Stalinists, the rise and fall of Henry Wallace, and the eclipse of progressivism. And he explores the shifting allegiances of intellectuals as they struggled, often with each other, to influence the course of public debate, with long-lasting consequences for American intellect, culture, and morals.As O'Neill observes in his introduction, 'More than any of my other books A Better World inspired correspondents to send me probing or reflective letters.' It was this response, along with the extraordinary critical debate spurred by initial publication of this volume, that makes the book's continuing importance clear. The dream of achieving a better world through radical violence never dies, and the willingness of apologists to cling to utopian visions persists. As long as it does, the lessons of this book need to be available to us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0gB4zQEACAAJ&dq=A+Better+World:+Stalinism+and+the+American+Intellectuals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between the Testaments","description":"This informative volume highlights the \\"four hundred silent years,\\" the intertestamental period, about which the Bible gives no information.

Had anyone told Ben Malcolmson that he'd someday be a wide receiver on the national champion USC football team--after not playing football since an unfortunate fifth-grade Pop Warner experience--he would have called them crazy. As a reporter for The Daily Trojan, in the spirit of George Plimpton, he participated in walk-on tryouts for the team and was dumbfounded to find himself listed on the roster. His position on the team never amounted to much in a game-time contribution, but Ben felt strongly that his faith was inextricably linked to his purpose. He felt called to anonymously place Bibles in each USC teammate locker on Christmas Eve--to resounding indifference and rejection from his friends. It wasn't until three years later, when his role at USC had led to a role with Coach Pete Carroll at the Seahawks organization, that an old friend connected with Ben and told him that one of the Bibles had captivated the heart of a teammate in the three days before his death. With a humble spirit dedicated to consistent acts of discipleship, Ben Malcolmson is an authentic voice for the power of simple obedience and trust, for what can happen when a believer allows God to work in a life. Walk On is the result of God using his faithful people to work in the lives of others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HOs6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Playboy of the Western World and Riders to the Sea","description":"Two lyrical, beautifully crafted dramas set among the folk of the Aran Islands and western Irish coastlands.

During that first visit this man filled her ears with prophetic visions of a glorious future, the inheritance of those fortunate few who might choose to accompany him. His confidence and charisma were so entrancingthat she soon recruited two of her college roommates. When the psychologist fired his assistant two years later, Elizabeth and her mother followed. Over the next decade this man, a malevolent genius and master of twisting spiritual truth to benefit a self-serving agenda, organized a small dedicated band of followers. The Group evolved into an incestuous family, a cult. Their minds were fused with brainwashed doctrine of distinctly New Age philosophies. An intimate group of spiritual Navy Seals, they scrambled in terror, preparingthemselves to survive an approaching spiritual catastrophe, one man's divine vision of Armageddon. Subsequent to a momentous event in August 1994, The Black Dog Religion was born with their leader as high priest. Elizabeth sank lower and lower into a pit ofdespair, darker than she ever could have imagined. She became so deeply buried that escape seemed impossible.

Both a victim and a beneficiary of rival empires, Armenia experienced a complex evolution as a divided or an erased polity with a widespread diaspora. Ronald Grigor Suny traces the cultural and social transformations and interventions that created a new sense of Armenian nationality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Perceptions of antiquity and uniqueness combined in the popular imagination with the experiences of dispersion, genocide, and regeneration to forge an Armenian nation in Transcaucasia. Suny shows that while the limits of Armenia at times excluded the diaspora, now, at a time of state renewal, the boundaries have been expanded to include Armenians who live beyond the borders of the republic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fsEeXBmL1vcC&dq=Looking+toward+Ararat:+Armenia+in+Modern+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical Analysis of Extreme Values: with Applications to Insurance, Finance, Hydrology and Other Fields","description":"This is a self-contained introduction to parametric modeling, exploratory analysis and statistical interference for extreme values, as used in disciplines from hydrology to finance to environmental science.

This user-friendly beginner Tagalog book teaches more than 2,000 Tagalog words and expressions with over 500 being added for this new edition. These are spread throughout 44 lessons, the Appendices and the exercises as well as in the Tagalog-English and English-Tagalog vocabulary lists at the back of the book. The added Tagalog vocabulary is meant to keep learners abreast of changes that have occurred in the language since the first edition of Basic Tagalog which was published. This edition has retained all the grammar lessons and the tried-and-tested teaching methodology developed b the author, Paraluman S. Aspillera, for the original version. Her method has proven to be extremely effective for tens of thousands of foreigners and non-Tagalogs who have used this book to learn Tagalog, including many who have successfully learned to speak Tagalog, read Tagalog and write Tagalog through self-study on their own without a teacher. Downloadable audio has also been added to facilitate the correct pronunciation of Tagalog words and phrases. A succinct introduction to the language and a description of the character of Filipinos will hopefully provide learners with a better understanding of the language they are learning. The lessons in Basic Tagalog are intended for a three-month period of intensive study followed by another three months of applied oral communication. In six months (or about 250 hours), it is expected that an average learner should be able to speak, write and understand simple, everyday, conversational Tagalog as spoken by most Filipinos. Highlights of this book include: Over 2,000 Tagalog words and expressions. 44 lessons organized by organized for efficient language absorption. Extensive exercises and activities to reinforce the lessons. Vocabulary lists serve as comprehensive English-Tagalog and Tagalog-English dictionaries. Completely updated and expanded with new materials. Includes downloadable audio. Using Basic Tagalog to study the Tagalog language will further encourage both non-Tagalogs and non-Filipinos to speak Tagalog better. Only then will they appreciate the individuality of the language that reflects the resilience and flexibility of Filipinos all around the world. In the end, such learning will improve daily interactions and communications between non-Filipinos and Filipinos--whether in business, education, tourism, social or civic endeavors.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y8bZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Narrative Approach to Organization Studies (Qualitative Research Methods)","description":"With a focus on organization studies, this volume takes readers through the narrative approach to qualitative research, from setting up the fieldwork to writing up the research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bavwo4dZa30C&dq=A+Narrative+Approach+to+Organization+Studies+(Qualitative+Research+Methods)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wolfgang Puck Pizza, Pasta, and More!","description":"Shares secrets for preparing pasta and pizza, covering the basics, from sauce preparation to soups, and offering a collection of recipes that emphasize fresh foods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LoAFAAAACAAJ&dq=Wolfgang+Puck+Pizza,+Pasta,+and+More!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming a Product Designer (Guide to Careers in Design)","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BjWNWQmYw3cC&dq=Becoming+a+Product+Designer+(Guide+to+Careers+in+Design)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A comparative study of tertiary wastewater treatment by physico-chemical-UV process and macrofiltration-ultrafiltration technologies [An article from: Desalination]","description":"The effective integration of water and reclaimed wastewater still requires close examination of public health issues, infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and water utility management.

Selznick or Samuel Goldwyn, but the films he produced -- Casablanca, Jezebel, Now Voyager, The Life of Emile Zola, Becket, True Grit, and many other classics (as well as scores of Elvis movies) -- have certainly endured. As producer of numerous films, Wallis made an indelible mark on the course of America's film industry, but his contributions are often overlooked and no full-length study has yet assessed his incredible career. A former office boy and salesman, Wallis first engaged with the business of film as the manager of a Los Angeles movie theater in 1922. He attracted the notice of the Warner brothers, who hired him as a publicity assistant. Within three months he was director of the department, and appointments to studio manager and production executive quickly followed. Wallis went on to oversee dozens of productions and formed his own production company in 1944. Bernard F. Dick draws on numerous sources such as Wallis's personal production files and exclusive interviews with many of his contemporaries to finally tell the full story of his illustrious career. Dick combines his knowledge of behind-the-scenes Hollywood with fascinating anecdotes to create a portrait of one of Hollywood's early power players.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eIIwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eagle in Flight: The Life of Athanasius, the Apostle of the Trinity","description":"Eagle in Flight: The Life of Athanasius, the Apostle of the Trinity is the exciting and true story of St. Athanasius of Alexandria who saw almost all the bishops of the Church sign their names to false creeds, including Pope Liberius who signed under torture and later recanted. Falsely accused by his enemies of rape, murder, and treason, Athanasius, with the death penalty hanging over his head, fought to uphold the true faith as handed down from the apostles, while hiding out in abandoned cisterns, tombs, and the desert. This is a story of heroism and triumph presented in the form of a novel to make the events come alive for the reader.

Just as sociologists now find it necessary to think in terms of \\"multiculturalism,\\" so religion scholars and theologians today must work in the context of \\"multireligiosity.\\" Globalization is leading not only to multiethnic societies but also to plurality in religions and worldviews. Theology and the Religions: A Dialogue offers the first sustained analysis of the trend toward multireligiosity and its implications for the study of religion. Drawing on the resources of cultural analysis, religious studies, and theology, an international slate of thirty-seven scholars explores the relation of multiculturality and multireligiosity, the need for interreligious dialogue, and the possibilities for a \\"theology of religions.\\" This groundbreaking work is supported by case studies of various religious traditions in diverse cultures from around the world. Offering an engaging, wide-angle view of religion worldwide, Theology and the Religions makes a vital contribution to our understanding of the forces shaping the future of religious and social life.

It was from this \\"grassroots\\" Methodism that the various movements calling for evangelical renewal in the denomination arose during the twentieth century. Riley Case tells the story of the populist wing of the Methodist movement in America, culminating in the work of those who have sought in recent years to return Methodism to its authentic Wesleyan roots.The spread of Methodism in nineteenth-century America was accompanied, says Riley Case, by a slow, yet certain, division of the tradition into at least two branches. One strand might be called establishment Methodism. This is the Methodism usually described in denominational histories. It was the Methodism of tall steeples, rented pews, robed choirs, and denominational journals, colleges, and seminaries. It was Methodism becoming institutionalized, with authority focusing more and more in bishops, presiding elders, conferences, and (later) committees and agencies. Case contends that this focused authority--later identified simply as the hierarchy--offered a mediated faith, one best filtered and controlled by those with education and experience.The other strand of Methodism might be called populist Methodism. It, for the most part, was unofficial Methodism. It was the Methodism of log cabins, moral crusades, circuit preachers, revivals, camp meetings, prayer bands, and indigenous Methodist gospel music, including African American spirituals. It was an unmediated Christianity, one that did not need to be filtered through educated clergy or annual conferences. It was democracy in religion. Its authority was derived from the anointing of the Spirit and appealed to the power of primitive Methodism, or old-time religion. It is often referred to as grass-roots Methodism. It was Methodism not as an institution but as a movement.This book intends to tell the story of this second branch of the Methodist tradition in America. Drawing on a variety of sources and voices, it recounts the history of Methodism's evangelical wing. For all who wish to understand the convictions and concerns of the evangelical branch of The United Methodist Church today, this book will prove rewarding--and essential--reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yaA5AAAACAAJ&dq=Evangelical+and+Methodist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in Nature Honduras","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=USqKxgEACAAJ&dq=Adventures+in+Nature+Honduras&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Verbos Espanoles (Spanish Verbs)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JYQxtwAACAAJ&dq=Verbos+Espanoles+(Spanish+Verbs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coming Home (Vox Humana)","description":"David Cope's fourth collection, Coming Home, binds together the two major strands of his life and art.

And often there is an extraordinary synthesis, as in: The Abandoned City if we sit long enough, will our love grow wise? the roman mottos tumble from facades & crash. where statesmen argued the language of law, cedars split paving stones & broken pillars crumble. atop the giant boulder, a maple's single thick root grips granite all the way to soil below, where we stand amazed. lovers go to sing their love hand in hand, passing a drunken cursing hulk who pitches headlong toward a red-faced hooker- she shrieks, pushing trash cans in his path, her mouth a red circle of moaning terror.

In Tennessee, Ty rejoins his mother to manage the family marina and soon encounters his first love, the high school sweetheart he left behind. But the tranquility and contentment he craves is soon shattered. A close friend becomes one of the victims in a series of brutal murders. Suspecting that the bullet may well have been meant for him and determined to clear his family's business of any involvement in the ongoing violence, Ty is compelled to help track the perpetrator of the heinous crimes.

Since the first edition in 1981, it has been designed to provide beginning social work students the basic methodological foundation they need in order to successfully complete more advanced research courses that focus on single-system designs or program evaluations. Its content is explained in extraordinarily clear everyday language which is then illustrated with social work examples that social work students not only can understand, but appreciate as well. Many of the examples concern women and minorities, and special emphasis is given to the application of research methods to the study of these groups. Without a doubt, the major strength of this book is that it is written by social workers for social work students. The editors have once again secured an excellent and diverse group of social work research educators. The 31 contributors know firsthand, from their own extensive teaching and practice experiences, what social work students need to know in relation to research. They have subjected themselves to a discipline totally uncommon in compendia-that is, writing in terms of what is most needed for an integrated basic research methods book, rather than writing in line with their own predilections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-jlHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Social+Work+Research+and+Evaluation:+Quantitative+and+Qualitative+Approaches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rasputin,: Neither devil nor saint,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oGCcOgAACAAJ&dq=Rasputin,:+Neither+devil+nor+saint,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Win NT Server 4.0 Enterprise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h5fGjwEACAAJ&dq=Win+NT+Server+4.0+Enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Stone Arches: An American Missionary Doctor in China, 1892-1932","description":"Advance Praise for Beyond the Stone Arches \\"Now the world can share the life of this great man.

In these essays the minimalist approach to linguistic theory is formulated and progressively developed. Building on the theory of principles and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of languages is also restricted. Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation. The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional. All syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and keeping to very restricted conceptual resources.

Race, Class, and Political Symbols is a remarkably cogent examination of the uses of Rastafarian symbols and reggae music in Jamaican electoral campaigns. The author describes and analyzes the way Jamaican politicians effectively employ improbable strategies for electoral success. She includes interviews with reggae musicians, Rastafarian leaders, government and party officials, and campaign managers. Jamaican democracy and politics are fused to its culture; hence campaign advertisements, reggae songs, party pamphlets, and other documents are part of the larger picture of Caribbean life and letters. This volume centers and comes to rest on the adoption of Rastafarian symbols in the context of Jamaica's democratic institutions, which are characterized by vigorous campaigning, electoral fraud, and gang violence. In recent national elections, such violence claimed the lives of hundreds of people. Significant issues are dealt with in this cultural setting: race differentials among Whites, Browns, and Blacks; the rise of anti-Cubanism; the Rastafarians' response to the use of their symbols; and the current status of Rastafarian ideological legitimacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcPtAEACAAJ&dq=Race,+Class,+and+Political+Symbols:+Rastafari+and+Reggae+in+Jamaican+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot & Bothered (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"When it comes to hot dogs, Hot Doug's head chef Doug Sohn is the master of the craft.

But their eldest son, the family's shining light, died in a bizarre fishing accident. And when he disappeared-hauled into the depths by the giant marlin he had been fighting-he took with him a secret so corrupt that it could destroy the Braswells. Ten years later, a huge airliner crashes in the steamy shallows off the Florida coast, killing all aboard. Helping pull bodies from the water, Thorn finds himself drawn into a bizarre conspiracy: someone has developed a high tech weapon capable of destroying electrical systems in a powerful flash. The terrorist potential is huge. How are the secretive Braswells and their family-owned company, MicroDyne, involved? And what does it have to do with the family's obsessive hunt for the great marlin that killed their golden boy? With the Braswells, James W.

The telephone rings; the gun goes off, shooting -- and killing -- Teddy's two-year-old half sister Trina, who was playing in a wading pool in the yard outside, with Giselle, their mother, by her side.

It is difficult to find someone not taken abackand fascinated by the incomprehensible but indisputable fact: there are material systems which are aware of themselves. Consciousness is self-cognizing code. During homo sapiens's relentness and often frustrated search for self-understanding various theories of consciousness have been and continue to be proposed. However, it remains unclear whether and at what level the problems of consciousness and intelligent thought can be resolved. Science's greatest challenge is to answer the fundamental question: what precisely does a cognitive state amount to in physical terms? Albert Einstein insisted that the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple and can be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone. When one thinks about the complexities which present themselves in modern physics and even more so in the physics of life, one may wonder whether Einstein really meant what he said. Are we to consider the fundamental problem of the mind, whose understanding seems to lie outside the limits of the mind, to be essentially simple too? Knowledge is neither automatic nor universally deductive. Great new ideas are typically counterintuitive and outrageous, and connecting them by simple logical steps to existing knowledge is often a hard undertaking. The notion of a tensor was needed to provide the general theory of relativity; the notion of entropy had to be developed before we could get full insight into the laws of thermodynamics; the notice of information bit is crucial for communication theory, just as the concept of a Turing machine is instrumental in the deep understanding of a computer. To understand something, consciousness must reach an adequate intellectual level, even more so in order to understand itself. Reality is full of unending mysteries, the true explanation of which requires very technical knowledge, often involving notions not given directly to intuition. Even though the entire content and the results of this study are contained in the eight pages of the mathematical abstract, it would be unrealistic and impractical to suggest that anyone can gain full insight into the theory that presented here after just reading abstract. In our quest for knowledge we are exploring the remotest areas of the macrocosm and probing the invisible particles of the microcosm, from tiny neutrinos and strange quarks to black holes and the Big Bang. But the greatest mystery is very close to home: the greatest mystery is human consciousness. The question before us is whether the logical brain has evolved to a conceptual level where it is able to understand itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=buzuYtjU5o0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sinews of Power: War, Money and the English State, 1688-1783","description":"First published in 1989.

Drawing from dozens of constitutions in every region of the world, this book blends theory with practice to answer two all-important questions: what is an amendment and how should constitutional designers structure the procedures of constitutional change? The first matters now more than ever. Reformers are exploiting the rules of constitutional amendment, testing the limits of legal constraint, undermining the norms of democratic government, and flouting the constitution as written to create entirely new constitutions that masquerade as ordinary amendments. The second question is central to the performance and endurance of constitutions. Constitutional designers today have virtually no resources to guide them in constructing the rules of amendment, and scholars do not have a clear portrait of the significance of amendment rules in the project of constitutionalism. This book shows that no part of a constitution is more important than the procedures we use change it. Amendment rules open a window into the soul of a constitution, exposing its deepest vulnerabilities and revealing its greatest strengths. The codification of amendment rules often at the end of the text proves that last is not always least.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sCaeDwAAQBAJ&dq=Constitutional+Amendments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Water Technology, An Introduction for Environmental Scientists and Engineers (Arnold Environmental Management & Technology)","description":"Water reuse management is one of the challenges all water scarce countries have to deal with in the coming decades.

In fact, at most publishers, this sales piece is going to have to hold up under the scrutiny of a committee made up of a bevy of editors and a pod of sales and marketing people. With The Fast-Track Course on How to Write a Nonfiction Book Proposal, Mettee, a seasoned book editor and publisher, cuts to the chase and provides simple, detailed instruction that allows anyone to write a professional book proposal and hear an editor say Yes! According to Mettee, the first rule is: Do no harm. Too many authors don't pay enough attention to the small things like spelling and grammar and manuscript format that are needed to make their book proposals appear professional. They may have a great idea for a book and be eminently qualified to write it but they schmuck it up with slovenly disregard for the easy stuff. The last rule is: Be persistent. If you quit after your first rejection slip or after the thirteenth or the thirtieth, you'll never get published. Many books that are rejected scores of times go on to be best-sellers.

But morning sickness doesn't always strike in the morning, and for many women it doesn't even strike--it's an ever-present part of their pregnancy, with symptoms ranging from mild nausea and exhaustion to crippling depression and physical illness. We all know the standard suggestions--crackers and tea, Jell-O and ginger ale--but when they don't seem like enough, what can women really do to manage their symptoms and recover the happiness their pregnancy should bring? As debilitating as morning sickness is, we don't hear much about it. But finally, just when it seems as though there's nothing out there, women have somewhere to turn. Elizabeth Kaledin's The Morning Sickness Companion is a book by and for women suffering morning sickness. Morning sickness is a reality of pregnancy--many women are affected--and this book is dedicated to them. It fills a major void in pregnancy literature, providing a brief history of morning sickness, all the latest scientific thinking, research on its emotional toll, and lots of reassuring tips and advice from other women about what they ate, how sick they really were, sources of relief, and how to survive, since the fact is it is nearly inevitable.

It was necessary to invent calculus along the way, since fundamental equations of motion involve velocities and accelerations, of position.

He demonstrated that the ohserved motion of the planets could he explained hy assuming that there is a gravitational attraction he tween any two ohjects, a force that is proportional to the product of masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The circular, elliptical, and parabolic orhits of astronomy were v INTRODUCTION no longer fundamental determinants of motion, but were approximations of laws specified with differential equations. His methods are now used in modeling motion and change in all areas of science. Subsequent generations of scientists extended the method of using differ ential equations to describe how physical systems evolve. But the method had a limitation. While the differential equations were sufficient to determine the behavior-in the sense that solutions of the equations did exist-it was frequently difficult to figure out what that behavior would be. It was often impossible to write down solutions in relatively simple algebraic expressions using a finite number of terms. Series solutions involving infinite sums often would not converge beyond some finite time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=POPtCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Happy Talk (Little books of wit and wisdom)","description":"A tribute to Bob Ross-the soft-spoken artist known for painting happy clouds, mountains, and trees -- Happy Little Accidents culls his most wise and witty words into one delightful package.

At summer s end, rain clouds hovering over Kent have some in the Larkin household feeling under the weather in more ways than one. Ma is exhausted from nursing newborn Oscar, and Mariette needs a break. Meanwhile, Mariette s husband, Charley, reminisces about delightful summers spent in Brittany during his youth. It was inexpensive, the food was marvelous, the air was warm and sultry, and they would almost never see a drop of rain. And with that, Ma persuades Pop to take a holiday in France. But when the Larkin clan arrives in the village of St. Pierre le Port, it is vastly different from Charley s memories. It is raining, the food is awful, the hotel is run-down, and the manager is rather nasty.

This new volume, an extensive revision and abridgment of The Art of Persuasion in Greece, The Art of Rhetoric in the Roman World, and Greek Rhetoric under Christian Emperors, provides a comprehensive history of classical rhetoric, one that is sure to become a standard for its time. Kennedy begins by identifying the rhetorical features of early Greek literature that anticipated the formulation of \\"metarhetoric,\\" or a theory of rhetoric, in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e. and then traces the development of that theory through the Greco-Roman period. He gives an account of the teaching of literary and oral composition in schools, and of Greek and Latin oratory as the primary rhetorical genre. He also discusses the overlapping disciplines of ancient philosophy and religion and their interaction with rhetoric. The result is a broad and engaging history of classical rhetoric that will prove especially useful for students and for others who want an overview of classical rhetoric in condensed form.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FJh9XemAY0AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All kinds of animals (A Beka book reading program)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kGuntgAACAAJ&dq=All+kinds+of+animals+(A+Beka+book+reading+program)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Durrow: A Medieval Masterpiece at Trinity College Dublin","description":"Keeper of Manuscripts Bernard Meehan takes us on a guided tour of The Book of Durrow, an early medieval Gospel book regarded as second only to the Book of Kells.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=votIAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Durrow:+A+Medieval+Masterpiece+at+Trinity+College+Dublin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lessons From The Fighting Commandos","description":"Explains the background and philosophy behind the self-defense techniques developed by commando and special forces units, and demonstrates a variety of specific moves and strategies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vKofAAAACAAJ&dq=Lessons+From+The+Fighting+Commandos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shades of Blue and Gray: An Introductory Military History of the Civil War","description":"An introductory military history of the American Civil War, Shades of Blue and Gray places the 1861-1865 conflict within the broad context of evolving warfare. Emphasizing technology and its significant impact, Hattaway includes valuable material on land and sea mines, minesweepers, hand grenades, automatic weapons, the Confederate submarine, and balloons. The evolution of professionalism in the American military serves as an important connective theme throughout. Hattaway extrapolates from recent works by revisionists William Skelton and Roy Roberts to illustrate convincingly that the development of military professionalism is not entirely a post-Civil War phenomenon. The author also incorporates into his work important new findings of recent scholars such as Albert Castel (on the Atlanta Campaign), Reid Mitchell (on soldiers' motivation), Mark Grimsley (on \\"hard war\\"), Brooks D. Simpson (on Ulysses S. Grant), and Lauren Cook Burgess (on women who served as soldiers, disguised as men). In addition, Hattaway comments on some of the best fiction and nonfiction available in his recommended reading lists, which will both enlighten and motivate readers. Informative and clearly written, enhanced by graceful prose and colorful anecdotes, Shades of Blue and Gray will appeal to all general readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TidkVP3YKAsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old fashioned quilts","description":"Discover how to reproduce the time-honored treasures of the past with authenticity and ease.

The internationally acclaimed #1 bestseller had made Ondaatje the first Canadian novelist ever to win the Booker. Four years later, in 1996, a motion picture based on the book brought the story to a vast new audience. The film, starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, went on to win numerous prizes, among them nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Worldwide English-language sales of the book topped two million copies. But in April 2000, Anil s Ghost was widely hailed as Ondaatje s most powerful and engrossing novel to date. Winning a Governor General s Literary Award for Fiction, the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize and the Giller Prize, Anil s Ghost became an international bestseller.  Nowhere has Ondaatje written more beautifully,  said The New York Times Book Review. The setting is Sri Lanka. Steeped in centuries of cultural achievement and tradition, the country has been ravaged in the late twentieth century by bloody civil war. As in The English Patient, Ondaatje s latest novel follows a woman s attempt to piece together the lost life of a victim of war. Anil Tissera, born in Sri Lanka but educated in England and the U.S., is sent by an international human rights group to participate in an investigation into suspected mass political murders in her homeland. Working with an archaeologist, she discovers a skeleton whose identity takes Anil on a fascinating journey that involves a riveting mystery. What follows, in a novel rich with character, emotion, and incident, is a story about love and loss, about family, identity and the unknown enemy. And it is a quest to unlock the hidden past  like a handful of soil analyzed by an archaeologist, the story becomes more diffuse the farther we reach into history. A universal tale of the casualties of war, unfolding as a detective story, the book gradually gives way to a more intricate exploration of its characters, a symphony of loss and loneliness haunted by a cast of solitary strangers and ghosts. The atrocities of a seemingly futile, muddled war are juxtaposed against the ancient, complex and ultimately redemptive culture and landscape of Sri Lanka. Anil s Ghost is Michael Ondaatje's first novel to be set in the country of his birth.  There s a tendency with us in England and North America to say it s a book  about Sri Lanka.  But it s just my take on a few characters, a personal tunnelling into that   The book s not just about Sri Lanka; it s a story that s very familiar in other parts of the world   in Africa, in Yugoslavia, in South America, in Ireland.  I didn t want it to be a political tract. I wanted it to be a human study of people in the midst of fear.

Case studies of two individuals, one with mild disabilities and one with severe disabilities, are followed throughout the text to illustrate effective practices, ensuring readers are able to apply the content to students with different types and severity of disabilities, and are able to understand how practices can be tailored to meet individual student needs. The content is presented so that readers can apply key strategies immediately in their work as teachers or in other professional capacities. Research Summaries in each chapter address the research basis for effective practices that are discussed throughout the book. Spotlight on History in most chapters provides a short biography on an individual who made a significant contribution to the development of transition services. Additional resources and websites are included at the end of each chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a33uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Growing+Up:+Transition+to+Adult+Life+for+Students+with+Disabilities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Mercies Journal (A Companion Journal for Calm My Anxious Heart)","description":"Designed to be used as a companion to the book Calm My Anxious Heart, this journal will help you pause to focus on God's gentle leading in your life.

Maxwell was both an extraordinarily evocative writer and a highly unusual man. While touring the Iraqi marshes, he was captivated by an otter and became a devoted advocate of and spokesman for the species. He moved to a remote house in the Scottish highlands, co-habiting there with three otters and living an idyllic and isolated life  at least for a while. Fate, fame, and fire conspired against this paradise, and it, too, came to an end, though the journey was filled with incident and wonder. Maxwell was also talented as an artist, and his sinuous line drawings of these amphibious and engaging creatures, and the homes they occupied, illustrate his story. This book stands as a lasting tribute to a man, his work, and his passion. It was received and has endured as a classic for its portrait not only of otters but also of a man who endured heartaches and disappointments, whose life embodied both greatness and tragedy. He writes with rare eloquence about his birth, his devotion to the beloved Scottish highlands, and the wildlife he loved, while refusing to ignore the darker aspects of his nature and of nature in its larger sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RA_oCwAAQBAJ&dq=Ring+of+Bright+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People of the Circle, People of the Four Directions","description":"Publisher Marketing: A Gathering of Native American Prayers, Rituals, and Traditions. People of the Circle, People of the Four Directions explores the common spiritual symbols of the Native People of North and South America.

A team of nimble, limber, and extremely attractive volunteers selflessly ventured to the laboratory for months of researchthe results of those experiments are now available for only $12.95! Each sexual position comes with an estimated caloric expenditure (for each person involved), a list of possible side effects (leg cramp, lawsuit), and equipment recommendations (hanging bar, stethoscope, cowboy hat).

Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write. It was a crime punishable by death, but it resulted in one of the most eloquent indictments of slavery ever recorded. His gripping narrative takes us into the fields, cabins, and manors of preCivil War plantations in the South and reveals the daily terrors he suffered. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Written more than a century and a half ago by a Black man who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age. It is a record of savagery and inhumanity that goes far to explain why America still suffers from the great injustices of the past.

As one man so eloquently said, \\"Doctrine is the skeleton of our faith.

The trade-off used to be simple but absolute: Your business strategy either could focus on \\"rich\\" information - customized products and services tailored to a niche audience - or could reach out to a larger market, but with watered-down information that sacrificed richness in favor of a broad, general appeal. Much of business strategy as we know it today rests on this fundamental trade-off. Now, say Evans and Wurster, the new economics of information is eliminating the trade-off between richness and reach, blowing apart the foundations of traditional business strategy. Blown to Bits reveals how the spread of connectivity and common standards is redefining the information channels that link businesses with their customers, suppliers, and employees. Increasingly, your customers will have rich access to a universe of alternatives, your suppliers will exploit direct access to your customers, and your competitors will pick off the most profitable parts of your value chain. Your competitive advantage is up for grabs. To prepare corporate executives and entrepreneurs alike for a fundamental change in business competition, Evans and Wurster expand and illuminate groundbreaking concepts first explored in the award-winning Harvard Business Review article \\"Strategy and the New Economics of Information,\\" and present a practical guide for applying them. Examples span the spectrum of industries--from financial services to health care, from consumer to industrial goods, and from media to retailing. Blown to Bits shows how to build new strategies that reflect a world in which richness and reach go hand in hand and how to make the most of the new forces shaping competitive advantage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GFJZwgEACAAJ&dq=Blown+to+Bits:+How+the+New+Economics+of+Information+Transforms+Strategy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Web Bloopers: 60 Common Web Design Mistakes, and How to Avoid Them (Interactive Technologies)","description":"The dot.com crash of 2000 was a wake-up call, and told us that the Web has far to go before achieving the acceptance predicted for it in '95.

Every nation with pretentions to world power joined the ?battleship race?, from France and Russia to Argentina and Chile. Most critical of all were the rival building programmes of Britain and Germany, a bitter contest that helped trigger the First World War. Within a generation, the mighty battleships were rendered redundant. Submarines and aircraft dominated the seas.

There isabundant statistical data and careful analysis, some of which challenges the conventional wisdom. Highly recommended.\\"  Choice Island Paradox is the first comprehensive, census-based portrait of social and economic life in Puerto Rico. During its nearly fiftyyears as a U.S. commonwealth, the relationship between Puerto Rico's small, developing economy and the vastly larger, more industrialized United States has triggered profound changes in the island's industry and labor force. Puerto Rico has been deeply affected by the constant flow of its people to and from the mainland, and by the influx of immigrant workers from other nations. Distinguished economists Francisco Rivera-Batiz and Carlos Santiago provide the latest data on the socioeconomic status of Puerto Rico today, and examine current conditions within the context of the major trends of the past two decades. Island Paradox describes many improvements in Puerto Rico's standard of living, including rising per-capita income, longer life expectancies, greater educational attainment, and increased job prospects for women. But it also discusses the devastating surge in unemployment. Rapid urbanization and a vanishing agricultural sector have led to severe inequality, as family income has become increasingly dependent on education and geographic location. Although Puerto Rico's close ties to the United States were the major source of the island's economic growth prior to 1970, they have also been at the root of recent hardships. Puerto Rico's trade andbusiness transactions remain predominantly with the United States, but changes in federal tax, social, and budgetary policies, along with international agreements such as NAFTA, now threaten to alter the economic ties between the island and the mainland. Island Paradox reveals the social and family changes that have occurred among Puerto Ricans on the island and the mainland. The significant decline in the island's population growth is traced in part to women's increased pursuit of educational and employment opportunities before marrying. More children are being raised by singleparents, but this stems from a higher divorce rate and not a rise in teenage pregnancy. The widespread circular migration to and from the United States has had strong repercussions for the island's labor markets and social balance, leading to concerns about an island brain drain. The Puerto Rican population in the United States hasbecome increasingly diverse, less regionally concentrated and not, as some have claimed, in danger of becoming an underclass. Within a single generation Puerto Rico has experienced social and economic shifts of an unprecedented magnitude. Island Paradox charts Puerto Rico's economic fortunes, summarizes the major demographic trends, and identifies the issues that will have the strongest bearings on Puerto Rico's prospects for a successful future.

They thought of all the reasons why risking everything for a year at sea was a bad idea: They could go broke, get injured, be stranded at sea--maybe even die. More than likely, the only thing they would accomplish would be to embarrass themselves. Besides, only rich people sailed the world, right? Not a NYC theater family with five kids who would serve as the ship's entire crew. After all the deliberations, one thing was clear: their children would either be an excuse or a reason. They chose to set sail. Their journey proved to be a life-changing experience as they grew closer as a family and explored the world in a new way. They traveled to twenty-three islands, spanning eleven countries and territories, and got a hands-on global education while meeting new people and appreciating a variety of cultures. They experienced the beauty and fragility of the earth as well as the vastness and power of the sea. Working together as a family and a sailboat crew meant learning how to tackle hard challenges together, helping each other improve their skills, and exercising patience when difficult conditions emerged. Seven at Sea tells the story of a family learning to live together, simply and in harmony with the natural world. In doing so, they learned that giving up control can sometimes lead to amazing adventures.

Probing war's traumatic destruction upon Lewis's romantic expectations of tranquil life, this book surpasses literary analyses of Lewis's work by asserting a comprehensive definition of war literature. Equally, scholars and students of World War I, war literature, trauma studies, and C. S. Lewis will find this work an invaluable reassessment of central assumptions in their fields. Not least, here finally is the young C. S. Lewis preceding his usual and often idolized personas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ov7qrHtESbcC&dq=A+Morning+After+War:+C.+S.+Lewis+and+WWI&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manifesting Methods for Would Be Millionaires","description":"Could achieving Millionaire be as easy as picking up groceries from the store?

Older name reactions are described in text books, but more recently developed synthetically useful reactions that may have been associated occasionally with a name are not always well known. For neither of the above are experimental procedures or references easy to find. In this monograph approximately 500 name reactions are included, of which over 200 represent newer name reactions and modern reagents. Each of these reactions are extremely useful for the contemporary organic chemistry researcher in industry or academic institutions. This book provides the information in an easily accessible form. In addition to seminal references and reviews, one or more examples for each name reaction are provided and a complete typical experimental procedure is included, to enable the student or researcher to immediately evaluate reaction conditions. Besides an alphabetical listing of reactions and reagents, cross references permit the organic practitioner to find those name reactions or reagents that enable specific transformations, such as, conversion of amines to nitriles, stereoselective reduction, fluoroalkylation, phenol alkynylation, asymmetric syntheses, allylic alkylation, nucleoside synthesis, cyclopentanation, hydrozirconation, to name a few. Emphasis has been placed on stereoselective and regioselective transformations as well as on enantioselective processes. The listing of reactions and reagents is supported by four indexes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t0gXBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Suppers from Uphill Farm","description":"You'll experience authentic farmhouse cooking that will nourish the body and the spirit.

In this influential book, Neumann shows how the stages begin and end with the symbol of the Uroboros, the tail-eating serpent. The intermediate stages are projected in the universal myths of the World Creation, Great Mother, Separation of the World Parents, Birth of the Hero, Slaying of the Dragon, Rescue of the Captive, and Transformation and Deification of the Hero. Throughout the sequence, the Hero is the evolving ego consciousness.

In so doing, he provides not only a skillful introduction to American social thought since the 1950s but also a wide-ranging examination of the contemporary failures of American liberal ideology. As he explicates the works of these three men--all of whom moved easily between the academic world and the arenas of politics, government, or journalism--it becomes clear that present policy debates have not even begun to resolve the dilemmas their writings have exposed. Millions of readers know J. K. Galbraith, the renowned Harvard economist and social theorist who developed the concept of the \\"New Industrial State\\"; Michael Harrington, the de facto leader of the American socialist movement who revealed the existence of the \\"other America\\"; and Robert Heilbroner, the incisive economic thinker who questioned the naive optimism of Americans even before it significantly eroded in the mid-1970s. In this book they emerge as individuals, as thinkers, and as part of a larger picture of American efforts to reconcile democratic values and humane social goals with modern corporate capitalism. The study begins with a portrait of the U.S. economy and society at the end of the Civil War and discusses the momentous changes brought about by the rapid industrialization that followed. The central portion revolves around Galbraith, Harrington, and Heilbroner and explores their contributions to the intellectual and political discourse on key issues confronting America in the decades after 1945: the evolutionary trajectory of managerial capitalism; the persistence of poverty and class divisions; the expansion of the welfare state and the public sector in general; and the assault on welfare capitalism by the New Right in the 1980s. The concluding chapter examines the causes and consequences of the fervent adherence of Americans to liberal ideology, the origins and philosophical bases of that set of beliefs, and its future prospects.

But with the Challenger catastrophe in 1986, the whole Space Shuttle program came into question, as did NASA itself, so long an institution that was seemingly above reproach. Wheels Stop tells the stirring story of how, after the Challenger disaster, the Space Shuttle not only recovered but went on to perform its greatest missions. From the Return to Flight mission of STS-26 in 1988 to the last shuttle mission ever on STS-135 in 2011, Wheels Stop takes readers behind the scenes as the shuttle's crews begin to mend Cold War tensions with the former Soviet Union, conduct vital research, deploy satellites, repair the Hubble Space Telescope, and assist in constructing the International Space Station. It also tells the heart-wrenching story of the Columbia tragedy and the loss of the magnificent STS-107 crew. As complex as the shuttle was, the people it carried into orbit were often more so--and this is their story, too. Close encounters with astronauts, flight controllers, and shuttle workers capture the human side of the Space Shuttle's amazing journey--and invite readers along for the ride.

Lee's Confederates at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1863.\\" \\"Historian Richard Sauers shows that while Meade led his men to victory in one of the most famous battles in history, he was soon embroiled in political battles with fellow generals and Washington politicians. Despite detractors' efforts to question Meade's judgment and smear his reputation - efforts often exacerbated by the general's own volatile temper and undiplomatic behavior - he continued to put duty to his country and his men first. When Ulysses S. Grant was named lieutenant general in charge of all Union forces, Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac and soon overshadowed Meade. Sauers chronicles the tense relationship that developed between the two men and the effect it had on the crucial last days of the war.\\" \\"This concise but authoritative account is the only recent biography of Meade and should spark renewed study of one of the Civil War's most underrated leaders.\\" --Book Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZfnDF0tjjEYC&dq=Meade:+Victor+of+Gettysburg+(Military+Profiles)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dale Earnhardt : Remembering the Intimidator","description":"Provides a tribute honoring Dale Earnhardt, one of Nascar's greatest drivers, who died during the final lap of the 22nd Daytona 500, and discusses the legacy he left behind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QZphdGCt0qMC&dq=Dale+Earnhardt+:+Remembering+the+Intimidator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Library Clerk (Career Examination Series : C-1931)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C_EuAQAAIAAJ&dq=Library+Clerk+(Career+Examination+Series+:+C-1931)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Voyage","description":"May 1941.

The temple itself served as the mansion or palace of the deity to whom the estate belonged, and much of the ritual in temples was devoted to offering a representative sample of goods to the gods. After ritual performances, produce was paid as wages to priests and temple staff and presented as offerings to private mortuary establishments. This redistribution became a daily ritual in which many basic necessities of life for elite Egyptians were produced. This book evaluates the influence of common temple rituals not only on the day to day lives of ancient Egyptians, but also on their special events, economics, and politics. Author Katherine Eaton argues that a study of these daily rites ought to be the first step in analyzing the structure of more complex societal processes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sf0JAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Place","description":"Harm de Blij contends in this book that geography continues to hold us all in an unrelenting grip and that we are all born into natural and cultural environments that shape what we become, individually and collectively.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FekVDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Power+of+Place&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Regret to Inform You: Experiences of Families Who Lost a Family Member in Vietnam","description":"This is a fascinating and moving glimpse at the human strength and persistence it takes to survive the maze of government bureaucracy, and inconclusive evidence that comes after the telegram -- the one that begins \\"We regret to inform you..\\".

One of their main attractive features is the ability to accurately represent fairly general functions with a small number of adaptively chosen wavelet coefficients, as well as to characterize the smoothness of such functions from the numerical behaviour of these coefficients. The theoretical pillar that underlies such properties involves approximation theory and function spaces, and plays a pivotal role in the analysis of wavelet-based numerical methods. This book offers a self-contained treatment of wavelets, which includes this theoretical pillar and it applications to the numerical treatment of partial differential equations.

Katie, the narrator, has relocated to Missouri with her distant, occasionally abusive father, and she feels very much alone: her much-loved mother is dead; her new school is unaccepting of her; and her only friends fall far short of being ideal companions. When she accidentally falls through the ice while skating, she meets Jimmy. He is handsome, far older than she, and married, but she is entranced. As their relationship unfolds, so too does Katie's awareness of the pain and intensity first love can bring. Beautifully written in Berg's irresistible voice, Joy School portrays the soaring happiness of real love, the deep despair one can feel when it goes unrequited, and the stubbornness of hope that will not let us let go. Here also is recognition that love can come in many forms and offer many different things. Joy School illuminates, too, how the things that hurt the most can sometimes teach us the lessons that really matter. About Durable Goods, Elizabeth Berg's first novel, Andre Dubus said, \\"Elizabeth Berg writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, loneliness, love and hope. And the transcendence that redeems.\\" The same will be said of Joy School, Elizabeth Berg's most luminous novel to date.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oG3DyKo4S6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genefit Nutrition: Nutrition Designed by Life","description":"This handbook explains that our genes hold the key to a truly natural way of eating.

In response, scholars are paying more attention to conventional politics and to more broadly defined relations of power and difference in the interactions between human groups and their biophysical environments. Such issues are at the heart of the relatively new interdisciplinary field of political ecology, forged at the intersection of political economy and cultural ecology. This volume provides a toolkit of vital concepts and a set of research models and analytic frameworks for researchers at all levels. The two opening chapters trace rich traditions of thought and practice that inform current approaches to political ecology. They point to the entangled relationship between humans, politics, economies, and environments at the dawn of the twenty-first century and address challenges that scholars face in navigating the blurring boundaries among relevant fields of enquiry. The twelve case studies that follow demonstrate ways that culture and politics serve to mediate human-environmental relationships in specific ecological and geographical contexts. Taken together, they describe uses of and conflicts over resources including land, water, soil, trees, biodiversity, money, knowledge, and information; they exemplify wide-ranging ecological settings including deserts, coasts, rainforests, high mountains, and modern cities; and they explore sites located around the world, from Canada to Tonga and cyberspace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PL8r8B7-RJEC&dq=Political+Ecology+Across+Spaces,+Scales,+and+Social+Groups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protection Officer Training Manual","description":"This revised edition retains the exceptional organization and coverage of the previous editions and is designed for the training and certification needs of first-line security officers and supervisors throughout the private and public security industry. * Completely updated with coverage of all core security principles * Course text for the Certified Protection Officer (CPO) Program * Includes all new sections on information security, terrorism awareness, and first response during crises","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ACvKLsGmPegC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dealing in Murder (Molly Doyle)","description":"Elizabeth Porter was a top-of-the-lineManhattan antiques dealer until her ex-husband and his lover's flagrantly criminal scam left her reputation in tatters.

The incredible tale that he tells is of the fated last voyage of Captain Robert Scott and his crew to the outermost reaches of the South Pole on the Terra Nova. Chronicling the journey of the Terra Nova from England in 1910 to New Zealand in 1913, The Worst Journey in the World vividly describes the entirety of Scott s harrowing and tragic final expedition. Driven by a lust to investigate the untold scientific knowledge contained within the South Pole, these courageous pioneers embarked on a journey into previously unexplored territory, subjecting themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they traveled the massive expanses of the icy tundra. Cherry-Garrard was a key member of the Terra Nova crew that, in addition to the desire to uncover scientific data, desperately sought to be the first Europeans to reach the South Pole. But the expedition was thwarted at every turn by punishing weather, extreme bad luck, and the intense physical and mental decline of the crew on the final stages of their journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that rival explorer Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole only a few weeks before them, Scott s team then had to negotiate the last stage of their voyage, a doomed attempt which has no equal in peril, disaster, and tragedy.

Fish argues that the concept of mobility offers a significant paradigm for reading literature of the United States and the Americas in the antebellum period, particularly for women writers of the African diaspora. Charting journeys across nations and literary traditions, she examines works by three undervalued writers--Mary Seacole, an Afro-Jamaican; Nancy Prince, an African American from Boston; and Margaret Fuller, a white New Englander and Transcendentalist--in whose lives mobility, travel literature, and benevolent work all converge. Refiguring the forms of domesticity, they traveled to the outposts of conflict and imperial expansion--colonial crossroads in Panama, Tsarist Russia, the Crimean War front, the U.S. frontier, and Jamaica after emancipation--and worked as healers, educators, and reformers. Each writer blended themes from exploration literature and various autobiographical genres to reconfigure racial and national identities and to issue a call for social action. They intervened strategically into discourses of medicine, education, religion, philanthropy, and emigration through a shifting and mobile subjectivity, negotiating relationships to various institutions, persons, and locations. For each woman, travel removed her from the familiar and placed her in a position of risk, \\"out-of-bounds,\\" emotionally or physically. Seeking their own vision of the territories, they came to see themselves as citizens of the world, deeply involved in the causes they witnessed. As Fish documents, their desire to improve the quality of life for oppressed and wounded peoples distinguishes their works from other popular travel writers of the time. Drawing upon unpublished archival material such as letters, journals, and abolitionist periodicals, Fish incorporates print culture and theory into her discussion. She also examines historical accounts of the events and places with which these women were associated. She describes how Prince draws on the Bible and missionary discourse to make corrective readings of emigration policy and the lives of former slaves; Seacole appropriates the picaresque to embed her knowledge of Afro-Jamaican and Western medical tradition, and Fuller combines Romanticism and a fascination with racial science in her analysis of the American Midwest and in her evolving feminist critique. While writing in the popular 19th-century genre of the travelogue, Fish says, these black and white women were able to talk back, make and lose money, challenge stereotypes, and inform and entertain people with their adventures and benevolent work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gT51QgAACAAJ&dq=Black+and+White+Women%27s+Travel+Narratives:+Antebellum+Explorations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three minutes a day","description":"When Father James Keller founded The Christophers in 1945, he chose an ancient Chinese proverb as the motto, the credo, for the movement: \\"It's better to light one candle than to curse the darkness\\".

The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its componentsand to benefit from their poweryou need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions. The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and functions; and numerous examples of working code. The book focuses in particular on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms. The book covers all the new C++11 library components, including Concurrency Fractional arithmetic Clocks and timers Tuples New STL containers New STL algorithms New smart pointers New locale facets Random numbers and distributions Type traits and utilities Regular expressions The book also examines the new C++ programming style and its effect on the standard library, including lambdas, range-based for loops, move semantics, and variadic templates.

At the heart of the debate are fundamental questions concerning the nature of language, the role of data in building a model or theory, and the impact of the competence-performance distinction on the field of computational linguistics. Currently, there is an increasing realization in both camps that the two approaches have something to offer in achieving common goals. The eight contributions in this book explore the inevitable \\"balancing act\\" that must take place when symbolic and statistical approaches are brought together--including basic choices about what knowledge will be represented symbolically and how it will be obtained, what assumptions underlie the statistical model, what principles motivate the symbolic model, and what the researcher gains by combining approaches. The topics covered include an examination of the relationship between traditional linguistics and statistical methods, qualitative and quantitative methods of speech translation, study and implementation of combined techniques for automatic extraction of terminology, comparative analysis of the contributions of linguistic cues to a statistical word grouping system, automatic construction of a symbolic parser via statistical techniques, combining linguistic with statistical methods in automatic speech understanding, exploring the nature of transformation-based learning, and a hybrid symbolic/statistical approach to recovering from parser failures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uUzvaKiecSEC&dq=The+Balancing+Act:+Combining+Symbolic+and+Statistical+Approaches+to+Language+(Language,+Speech,+and+Communication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can We All Get Along?: Racial And Ethnic Minorities In American Politics (Dilemmas in American Politics)","description":"Rodney King framed an eternal question of American politics when he asked: \\"Can we all get along?\\" The second edition of this widely acclaimed text was expanded to reflect the latest scholarship and the most recent events in America's ongoing struggle with racial issues; the new version of the second edition has been fully updated to include results and analysis from the 1998 mid-term elections. Here, Paula McClain and Joseph Stewart combine traditional elements of political science analysis--history, Constitutional theory, institutions, political behavior, and policy actors--with a thoroughgoing survey of the political status of four major groups: African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and American Indians. They show similarities and differences in these groups' political action and experience, and point the way toward coalition, competition, and consensus-building in the face of ongoing conflict. Two dilemmas shape the book: How do we as a nation reconcile a commitment to equality with persistent inequality and discrimination? And what can we do about it--from the perspective of ethnic and racial minorities as well as within the dominant culture?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xBArAQAAIAAJ&dq=Can+We+All+Get+Along%3F:+Racial+And+Ethnic+Minorities+In+American+Politics+(Dilemmas+in+American+Politics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bad Moon Rising","description":"\\"A record heat wave suffocates remote rural Wisconsin as the local sheriff tracks down a killer hidden in the depths of the community in this atmospheric, race-to-the-finish mystery\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uRExEAAAQBAJ&dq=Bad+Moon+Rising&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Congressional Quarterly Almanac: 105th Congress 2nd Session...1998 (Cq Almanac)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oXr2LSuvtAAC&dq=Congressional+Quarterly+Almanac:+105th+Congress+2nd+Session...1998+(Cq+Almanac)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everything Weddings on a Budget Book: Create the Wedding of Your Dreams and Have Money Left for the Honeymoon (Everything Series)","description":"A Simon & Schuster eBook.

The result of all this suburban living is a hugely diverse residential area with spectacular houses in the hills and canyons, surrounded by trees and stunning views of the city. This book examines some of the highlights of domestic living around Los Angeles, and points out some of the major influences: Art Deco, Spanish, and contemporary architecture; spacious, light-filled rooms; and plenty of wood, steel and concrete. It examines how the city's flamboyant past has shaped the landscape, as well as how cutting-edge architects and interior designers continue to create exciting new styles and structures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IrvunwEACAAJ&dq=Los+Angeles+Houses+(Designpocket)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Boy Elvis: The Colonel Tom Parker Story","description":"Traces the live of the stowaway from Holland who reinvented himself into Colonel Tom Parker and became Elvis Presley's manager","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mn0LAAAACAAJ&dq=My+Boy+Elvis:+The+Colonel+Tom+Parker+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Mechanical Inventions","description":"Updated classic explores importance of technological innovation in cultural and economic history of the West.

And I began to think. If these people were put in situations when they could not get food to eat, and had to survive with their body starving, they would not treat food with such casual contempt. However, they were starving their bodies of essential nutrients out of sheer ignorance. They wanted to get thin. Many of them were genetically programmed towards obesity. Others began gaining weight due to the body reaching a stage when it was in such a desperate condition that malnutrition had set in. And that is why it was putting on weight as a last resort in order to protect the body from any sort of future starvation. This book is going to tell you all about ancient food eating practices followed by the wise men of yore. If you say, I cannot do without my potato chips, or my sugar fix, well, you are not ready to live a lifestyle which were followed by our ancestors all over the world, millenniums ago. They ate nourishing food. And they were thankful for what they got. They did not bother much about silly newfangled ideas about calories and in the amounts of calories required to keep you healthy and strong. This of course is a fallacy and is a silly myth, which I am going to explain to you later on, but at the moment I am going to tell you more about how foods were used to heal a number of diseases down the ages, and naturally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oL8vDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horseman: Brand of a legend","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P11gXwAACAAJ&dq=Horseman:+Brand+of+a+legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Your First Play, Second Edition","description":"First Published in 1998.

Lively and absorbing. . .\\"   The New York Times Book Review \\"Engrossing.\\"  Wall Street Journal  Entertaining and well-researched . . .    Houston Chronicle Three noted Texan writers combine forces to tell the real story of the Alamo, dispelling the myths, exploring why they had their day for so long, and explaining why the ugly fight about its meaning is now coming to a head. Every nation needs its creation myth, and since Texas was a nation before it was a state, it's no surprise that its myths bite deep. There's no piece of history more important to Texans than the Battle of the Alamo, when Davy Crockett and a band of rebels went down in a blaze of glory fighting for independence from Mexico, losing the battle but setting Texas up to win the war. However, that version of events, as Forget the Alamo definitively shows, owes more to fantasy than reality. Just as the site of the Alamo was left in ruins for decades, its story was forgotten and twisted over time, with the contributions of Tejanos--Texans of Mexican origin, who fought alongside the Anglo rebels--scrubbed from the record, and the origin of the conflict over Mexico's push to abolish slavery papered over. Forget the Alamo provocatively explains the true story of the battle against the backdrop of Texas's struggle for independence, then shows how the sausage of myth got made in the Jim Crow South of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. As uncomfortable as it may be to hear for some, celebrating the Alamo has long had an echo of celebrating whiteness. In the past forty-some years, waves of revisionists have come at this topic, and at times have made real progress toward a more nuanced and inclusive story that doesn't alienate anyone. But we are not living in one of those times; the fight over the Alamo's meaning has become more pitched than ever in the past few years, even violent, as Texas's future begins to look more and more different from its past. It's the perfect time for a wise and generous-spirited book that shines the bright light of the truth into a place that's gotten awfully dark.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nLZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Story+of+Texas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African American History Knowledge Cards","description":"Each card has a photographic portrait on one side and a concise essay about the featured individual on the other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m2noAwAACAAJ&dq=African+American+History+Knowledge+Cards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scariest Place in the World: A Marine Returns to North Korea (Thorndike Press Large Print American History Series)","description":"Sugar Lacey returns to her childhood home in Short Junction, Arkansas, where she confronts love, hatred, and black magic, which leads her to St. Louis where an old friendship puts her courage and compassion to the test.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oBtbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Scariest+Place+in+the+World:+A+Marine+Returns+to+North+Korea+(Thorndike+Press+Large+Print+American+History+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold Rush 2000 (original hardback)","description":"Captures the multiethnic, multicultural world of the California Gold Rush, in a richly textured social history that profiles the era's diverse and colorful characters, the evolution of a unique society, and the sources of our legends and myths about the Gold Rush.

Responses by churches to the new situation more religious education or attempts to use the global culture industries for Christian purposes are explored and found lacking. For the subversive praxis of Jesus of Nazareth to endure in the cultural ecology of postmodernism, Budde argues, churches must come to embrace their role as radical and countercultural alternative communities in which lay formation becomes a central preoccupation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gxlOswEACAAJ&dq=The+(Magic)+Kingdom+Of+God:+Christianity+And+Global+Culture+Industries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The egg and I","description":" A work of real comic genius. . . .

The independent structure of each chapter of the book makes it highly readable for a wide variety of mathematicians, students of applied number theory, and others interested in both study and research in number theory and cryptography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ITvaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelin the Green Guide Netherlands (Michelin Green Guides)","description":"This eBook version of the Green Guide Spain reveals a land renowned for its culture, heritage and geographical diversity.

The course was taught at the request of an exceptional group of graduate students (includ ing Anselm Blumer, Fred Garber, Evaggelos Geraniotis, Jim Lehnert, Wayne Stark, and Mark Wallace) who had just taken a course on coding theory from me. The theory of finite fields is the mathematical foundation of algebraic coding theory, but in coding theory courses there is never much time to give more than a \\"Volkswagen\\" treatment of them. But my 1979 students wanted a \\"Cadillac\\" treatment, and this book differs very little from the course I gave in response. Since 1979 I have used a subset of my course notes (correspond ing roughly to Chapters 1-6) as the text for my \\"Volkswagen\\" treatment of finite fields whenever I teach coding theory. There is, ironically, no coding theory anywhere in the book! If this book had a longer title it would be \\"Finite fields, mostly of char acteristic 2, for engineering and computer science applications. \\" It certainly does not pretend to cover the general theory of finite fields in the profound depth that the recent book of Lidl and Neidereitter (see the Bibliography) does.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fHtZngEACAAJ&dq=Finite+Fields+for+Computer+Scientists+and+Engineers+(The+Springer+International+Series+in+Engineering+and+Computer+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midnight at the Camposanto : a Taos Mystery","description":"The first novel in a series planned to follow the sacred and secular calendar through its annual cycle opens on Good Friday as The Brotherhood of Our Lord Jesus, the centuries-old lay society known as the penitentes, march singing their ancient, primitive hymns towards their vigil at the morada, the prayer hall in Talpa. One hermano, one brother, has been singled out to die, the assassin striking him down in the graveyard, the camposanto, and tumbling him into the darkened room to lie all night with his unsuspecting comrades. The next morning, one is charged with the act. This outrage arouses the widowed Christina Garcia y Grant, an attorney who gave up her practice in favor of innkeeping and writing, to defend the accused. Her team is composed of her mentor, La Dona Abogado--Miss Doris Jordan--a sturdy senior advocate, Ignacio Baca, an opera-and-sweet-loving public defender, and Mac McCloud, a doctor vacationing at Christy's La Casa Vieja B&B. This motley crew suspects that Hermandad Pat Salazaar has been set up. Sorting through Satanism, witchcraft, and modern day science, their widening investigation covers Taos, Los Alamos, and Santa Fe.... Seldom has so lyrical a voice described the beauties of Northern New Mexico and the very special culture of its Hispanic and Anglo people. The author writes with humor and compassion, peopling her story with memorable minor characters and recounting local legends with zest.

The author's previous novel, 1959, was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Book Award. Bird Kinkaid is an African-American woman who has recently been plagued by nightmares: It is a month after she witnessed Alex, her closest friend, plunge eight stories to her death on the sidewalk below and her grief has turned into obsession. Was Alex killed or was it a suicide? Was it an accident or did the white art critic and sometimes lover Frank Burton push her to her death? The two women had an intense friendship, their lives intertwined by shared space, history, friends (and occasionally lovers), and a passion for art. Alex's death shatters Bird, compelling her to search for answers to her friend's death amidst the disparate strands of Alex's quixotic life. When she locates a series of bizarre video tapes among Alex's belongings, in which she discusses her friends, her artwork, and her turbulent love life, Bird has the key to solving both the mystery of her friend's death and her own long-hidden demons.Alive with wit and sensibility, Maker of Saints is a fascinating and provocative novel about love, art, jealousy, and friendship in a funky, glitzy, New York demimonde.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3M-YgS4tU_cC&dq=The+Maker+of+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The blood of the cross","description":"We can never know too much about the truths that the blood of Christ proclaims.

Packets dominated during the first forty years of steam providing the quickest passenger transportation throughout mid-continent America. The packets remained fairly numerous even into the first two decades of the twentieth century when old age or calamity overtook them. By the 1930s the flock was severely depleted, and today the packet is extinct. Containing almost 6,000 entries, the directory includes a majority of combination passenger and freight steamers, but includes in a broader sense all types of passenger carriers propelled by steam that plied the waters of the Mississippi System. Each entry describes its steamboat by rig, class, engines, boilers, the shipyard where and when built, along with tidbits of historical interest on its use, demise, and/or conversion. Also included are today's steam-powered river passenger carriers, the excursion boats Belle of Louisville, Natchez, and Julia Belle Swain, and the two tourist steamers, Mississippi Queen and Delta Queen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=radYSAAACAAJ&dq=Ways+Packet+Directory+1848-1994:+Passenger+Steamboats+Of+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kamikaze Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers","description":" We tried to live with 120 percent intensity, rather than waiting for death. We read and read, trying to understand why we had to die in our early twenties. We felt the clock ticking away towards our death, every sound of the clock shortening our lives.  So wrote Irokawa Daikichi, one of the many kamikaze pilots, or tokkotai, who faced almost certain death in the futile military operations conducted by Japan at the end of World War II. This moving history presents diaries and correspondence left by members of the tokkotai and other Japanese student soldiers who perished during the war. Outside of Japan, these kamikaze pilots were considered unbridled fanatics and chauvinists who willingly sacrificed their lives for the emperor. But the writings explored here by Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney clearly and eloquently speak otherwise. A significant number of the kamikaze were university students who were drafted and forced to volunteer for this desperate military operation. Such young men were the intellectual elite of modern Japan: steeped in the classics and major works of philosophy, they took Descartes   I think, therefore I am  as their motto. And in their diaries and correspondence, as Ohnuki-Tierney shows, these student soldiers wrote long and often heartbreaking soliloquies in which they poured out their anguish and fear, expressed profound ambivalence toward the war, and articulated thoughtful opposition to their nation s imperialism. A salutary correction to the many caricatures of the kamikaze, this poignant work will be essential to anyone interested in the history of Japan and World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dFB7UHgRhvAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Proposed roads to freedom;: Socialism, anarchism and syndicalism,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=10-0JtkNLJYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caterpillar Rescue","description":"True Story of a boy that finds an injured caterpillar in front of a school bus and decides to bring it home.

Thus, against the background of current trends - globalization, democratization, the weakening of the nation-state and massive transstate migration, it examines the politics of historical, modern and incipient ethno-national diasporas. It argues that unlike the widely accepted view, ethno-national diasporism and diasporas do not constitute a recent phenomenon. Rather, this is a perennial phenomenon whose roots were in antiquity. Some of the existing diasporas were created in antiquity, some during the Middle Ages and some are modern. An essential aspect of this phenomenon is the endless cultural-social-economic and especially political struggle of these dispersed ethnic groups that permanently reside in host countries away from their homelands to maintain their distinctive identities and connections with their homelands and other dispersed groups of the same nation. While describing and analyzing the diaspora phenomenon, the book sheds light on theoretical questions pertaining to current ethnicity and politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mCYFN-zVMNEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peek-a-Zoo!","description":"The reader can look through die-cut pages for a visual clue to complete a game of peek-a-boo.

First published in 1990, this unforgettable expose tears the metallic blue shine off the legendary star, revealing the truth about  America s Team  and its beloved head coach Tom Landry, whose much-regaled Christian charity extended to strangers everywhere, yet stopped short of the team who labored under him. From the hangover that led Jerry Jones to buy the team, to the wild ride of the Staubach era, Bayless strips away the image of the team created by the most powerful PR machine in sports, revealed by insiders willing to break their silence. Packed with unparalleled insight into one of the most storied franchises in the history of sports, GOD'S COACH is a compelling revelation about a corrupt football franchise that dared call itself America s Team.

A Confederate soldier, Mastern betrays his best friend by falling in love with the man's wife and then out of guilt tries repeatedly to get killed in battle but ironically becomes a hero for his daring, before finally attaining a mortal wound. In The Cass Mastern Material, James A. Perkins fully explores how this episode supplies the crucial piece to a puzzle surrounding Warren's novel, tracing the story's evolution through several versions and genres over almost twenty years. Found here are both the earliest, short-story rendition of the Cass Mastern episode, originally published in 1944, and Warren's final dramatic version, completed in 1961 and now made available in print for the first time. The play was finally staged in 1999, and Perkins appends related letters, production notes, and an interview that provide a context for understanding the work's importance in Warren's career. \\"I have always felt that the section is central to [All the King's Men],\\" Warren wrote, concerning the Cass Mastern material. In a revolutionary reading of the novel, Perkins argues that the section provides the key to unlocking the mystery of Jack Burden's paternity. This unique volume affords a view of Warren's restless creative process and throws new light on the story that formed the crux of his greatest novel -- a story he apparently never felt he had exhausted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1YmAeO1BboYC&dq=The+Cass+Mastern+Material:+The+Core+Of+Robert+Penn+Warren%27s+all+The+King%27s+Men+(Southern+Literary+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Teenage Vampire: The Turning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wri3tQEACAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+a+Teenage+Vampire:+The+Turning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turkey Travel Map (Globetrotter Travel Map)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hGd4wgEACAAJ&dq=Turkey+Travel+Map+(Globetrotter+Travel+Map)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collected Stories of Wolfgang Hildesheimer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PRMhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Collected+Stories+of+Wolfgang+Hildesheimer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Computer Consultant's Guide: Real-Life Strategies for Building a Successful Consulting Career","description":"Drawing on the experiences and advice of over 125 practising computer consultants, this guide provides solutions to many frequently-asked questions.

This book examines this new phenomenon, arguing that celebrity humanitarianism legitimates, and indeed promotes, neoliberal capitalism and global inequality. Drawing on Slavoj iek s work, the book argues how celebrity humanitarianism, far from being altruistic, is significantly contaminated and ideological: it is most often self-serving, helping to promote institutional aggrandizement and the celebrity  brand ; it advances consumerism and corporate capitalism, and rationalizes the very global inequality it seeks to redress; it is fundamentally depoliticizing, despite its pretensions to  activism ; and it contributes to a  postdemocratic  political landscape, which appears outwardly open and consensual, but is in fact managed by unaccountable elites.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CTpd5oXI5LMC&dq=Vanity+Fair+July+2007+Africa+Issue,+Brad+Pitt+/+Desmond+Tutu+Cover&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guide to Benchmarking in Healthcare: Practical Lessons from the Field","description":"Midwifery & Women's Health Nurse Practitioner Certification Review Guide, Third Edition is a comprehensive review designed to help midwives and women's health nurse practitioners prepare for certification exams.

This book discusses the social and cultural significance of African Muslim proper names. It explains how names are chosen for newborns in African societies and the value they represent. In these days of mounting interest in identity and culture, many Muslim Africans, African-Americans and others wish to know the meanings of the names they choose so that they reflect their aspirations for their children and themselves.The book contributes cultural knowledge to today's discourse on the values and aspiration of people of different faiths. Given the long history of Islam in Africa, Muslim names communicate an old civilization encompassing a multicultural community. The book also documents African language contact throughout the continent. The world is both united and divided by its languages and their vocabularies and is similarly united and divided by names. Sharifa Zawawi draws on history, linguistics, anthropology and religion to provide a study of Muslim personal names in the context of family relationships, adoption, marriage, conversion, and social movements. The work first examines Muslim names and naming in the Qur'aan and in stories or traditions about the Prophet Muhammad. Secondly, it uses contemporary African publications, literature, journalism and telephone directories from west and east Africa and lists of names compiled by Africans living in west and east Africa. The African Muslim names to be found here come mainly from two languages; Hausa-Fulani and Kiswahili -- the two major African languages spoken by millions of people throughout the African continent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eUVmAAAAMAAJ&dq=African+Muslim+Names:+Images+and+Identities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crime Scene Search and Physical Evidence Handbook ( National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=epHaAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Architect's Essentials of Ownership Transition (The Architect's Essentials of Professional Practice)","description":"The majority of architecture and design firms employ fewer than ten people.

Roscoe Pound shows himself to be a jurist, philosopher, and scientist. For Pound, the subject matter of law involves examining manifestations of human nature which require social control to assert or realize individual expectations. Pound formulates a list of social-ethical principles, with a three-fold purpose. First, they are meant to identify and explain human claims, demands, or interests of a given social order. Second, they express what the majority of individuals in a given society want the law to do. Third, they are meant to guide the courts in applying the law. Pound distinguishes between individual interests, public interests, and social interests. He warns that these three types of interests are overlapping and interdependent and that most claims, demands, and desires can be placed in all three categories. Pound's theory of social interests is crucial to his thinking about law and lies at the conceptual core of sociological jurisprudence. Pound explains that rights unlike interests, are plagued with a multiplicity of meanings. He rejects the idea of rights as being natural or inalienable, and argues that to the contrary, interests are natural. The contemporary significance of the book is aptly demonstrated by the skyrocketing rate of litigation in our postmodern society. As the influence of familial and religious institutions declines, the courts exert an unprecedented degree of control over the public and private lives of most Americans. Law is now the paramount agency of social control. In the new introduction, A. Javier TreviNo outlines the principal aspects of Roscoe Pound's legal philosophy as it is conveyed in several of his books, articles, and addresses, and shows their relationship to Social Control Through Law. This book is an insightful, concise summary of Pound's ideas that, after more than half a century, remains surprisingly fresh and relevant. It will doubtlessly continue to engage jurists, legal theorists, and sociologists for many years to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RCAxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Women,+Law,+and+Social+Control+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3hvOugAACAAJ&dq=Masterpieces+of+the+Spanish+Golden+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Madame Bovary (Bantam Classics)","description":"A powerful nineteenth-century French classic depicting the moral degeneration of a weak-willed woman","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WtomKs0j8kUC&dq=Madame+Bovary+(Bantam+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AK-47 AKM & All VARIANTS, Disassembly and reassembly Guide","description":"A detailed, fully illustrated study of the most recognizable assault rifle ever produced.

A great liberal humanist, his multi-faceted work spans the history of philosophy, the philosophy of science, intellectual history, aesthetics, epistemology, the study of language and myth, and more. The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms is Cassirer's most important work. It was first published in German in 1923, the third and final volume appearing in 1929. In it Cassirer presents a radical new philosophical worldview - at once rich, creative and controversial - of human beings as fundamentally \\"symbolic animals,\\" placing signs and systems of expression between themselves and the world. This major new translation, the first for over fifty years, brings Cassirer's magnum opus to a new generation of students and scholars. Volume 1: Language is a fascinating examination of arguably the most fundamental of these systems of expression: human language. Cassirer traces the problem of language and expression far back in the history of philosophy, considering the work of the early Greek rationalists. He then examines the later empiricist tradition, up to the romantic tradition in the nineteenth century tackling fundamental questions about representation, signification and expression as well as language and conceptual thought in mathematics and science. Correcting important errors in previous English editions, this translation reflects the contributions of significant advances in Cassirer scholarship over the last twenty to thirty years. Each volume includes a new introduction and translator's notes by S. G. Lofts, a foreword by Peter Gordon, a glossary of key terms, and a thorough index.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TKxdtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Philosophy+of+Symbolic+Forms,+Volume+1:+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do's and taboos around the world","description":"The ultimate guide to international behavior.now completely updated and expanded!

Is it a game of skill, a test of manhood, or merely an organized brawl? Michael Oriard, a former professional player, asks these and other intriguing questions in Reading Football, the first contemporary book about football's formative years. American football began in the 1870s as a game to be played, not watched. Within a brief ten years, it had become a great public spectacle with an immense following, a phenomenon caused primarily by the voluminous commentary about the game conducted in popular newspapers and magazines. Oriard shows how this constant narrative in football's early years developed many different stories about what the game meant: football as pastime, as the sport of gentlemen, as a science, as a game of rules and their infringements. He shows how football became a series of cultural stories about power, luck, strategy, and deception. These different interpretations have been magnified by football's current omnipresence on television. According to Oriard, televised football now plays a cultural role of enormous importance for men, yet within the field of cultural studies the influence of football has been ignored until now.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GxQJKGYw-N8C&dq=Reading+Football:+How+the+Popular+Press+Created+an+American+Spectacle+(Cultural+Studies+of+the+United+States)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Running a muck: A bunch of zany cartoons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw90AAAACAAJ&dq=Running+a+muck:+A+bunch+of+zany+cartoons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Testing the Claims of Church Growth","description":"Examines church growth in light of Scripture, the Lutheran Confessions, and church membership data.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YxcCAAAACAAJ&dq=Testing+the+Claims+of+Church+Growth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wagner in Performance","description":"This book, addressed to both specialists and the opera-going public, brings together a team of acknowledged authorities from round the world to examine the performance history and reception of Wagner's works in Europe and America.

It focuses on the topic of 'circumventing custom' with special emphasis on the ingenious ways Orthodox (and other) Jews have devised to avoid breaking the extensive list of activities forbidden on the Sabbath. After examining the sources of Sabbath observance as set forth in the Old Testament, the New Testament, and rabbinical writings, some of the most salient forms of circumvention are described. These include: riding a special Shabbat elevator, unscrewing the lightbulb in the refrigerator, constructing an eruv (a space extending one's domicile so that objects may be carried outside the home), and relying on the services of the so-called 'Shabbes Goy,' among others. Dundes respectfully analyzes such facets of Jewish characteristics as an undue concern with purity, and a long-established tradition of indulging in nit-picking and argumentation. The resultant picture of Jewish character is drawn from an unusual mixture of religious written texts and oral tradition (jokes and proverbs). The sources range from ancient Israel to works from the twenty-first century. In many ways, it is an authentic and striking Jewish self-portrait that is painted for the very first time in this fascinating volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_a4hAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sharon and My Mother-in-Law: Ramallah Diaries","description":"Based on diaries and email correspondence that she kept from 1981-2004, here Suad Amiry evokes daily life in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

Oh, God, what happened, echoed in my ears as my backseater, unaware of why the collision had occurred, struggled to maintain control of our aircraft. I slammed myself back into the seat, locked the shoulder harness, and prepared for impact and certain death. Every warning horn blared, robbing us of even one silent moment. The impact was tremendous. Under the callsign of Paladin Zero Six, Captain Rafael J. Garcia, Jr., piloted an Apache helicopter on reconnaissance flights into Iraq during Operation Desert storm and led a range of combat missions. His battalion fired the first shots of the war on January 17, 1991, destroying the border radar sites and clearing a radar-free path to Baghdad.

The author sets the scene by outlining the course of the bombing war from 1939 to the night of the Nuremberg raid, the characters and aims of the British bombing leaders and the composition of the opposing Bomber Command and German night fighter forces.The aim of the Nuremberg raid was not unlike many hundreds of other RAF missions but, due to the difficulties and dangers of the enemy defenses and weather plus bad luck, it went horribly wrong. The result was so notorious that it became a turning point in the campaign. The target, the symbolic Nazi rally city of Nuremberg, was only lightly damaged and 96 out of 779 bombers went missing.Middlebrook recreates the events of the fateful night in astonishing detail. The result is a meticulous dramatic and often controversial account. It is also a moving tribute to the bravery of the RAF bomber crews and their adversaries. As reviewed in the Wall Street Journal: Using firsthand accounts, Mr. Middlebrook follows the planning, preparation and execution of the operation in meticulous detail, but he does more than that: Employing hundreds of eyewitness accounts, he shows the raid from the point of view of the German defenses and the civilians on the ground. Factual and analytical, this is a portrait of mechanized warfare at the level of personal experience.

This book, an in-depth look at our school's special brand of technique, strategy, philosophy as well as unique history, took about 15 years to compile, but will soon be offered in print by the world's leading on-demand publisher. Trafford Holdings Ltd is privately-held corporation, registered in British Columbia, Canada. There are over 120 shareholders, including many authors and all the permanent employees. It was incorporated in 1991. In late 1995, Trafford opened its doors and website. They are the first company in the world to offer an \\"on-demand publishing service,\\" and they are the best. The production of \\"Positive Aikido\\" has gone through numerous stages. The hand-drawings describing each of the positive techniques in traditional Aikido were begun in 1987 with the intention of providing new students with a reference guide - at the time to be photocopied for students in the U.S. and later possibly for the U.K. students as well. That plan, however, never took hold as more and more drawings were produced. The drawings of the first four groupings were finished in 1991 and in 1993, the second four groupings were added, along with some transcripts from a recorded converstaion between Sensei Ellis and Rogers on a long roadtrip between Dallas, Texas and Alamogordo, New Mexico. Rogers made his 1st Dan during that trip, and Positive Aikido picked up a lot of its histories and background information. Still, it was no more than a shep of papers cobbled together from various sources. In 1999, however, with the advent of digital photgraphy, Rogers decided to augment the drawings with some digital photos and possibly put together a proper booklet for students in all the Ellis Schools. The photos, however, required some supporting text - and there was a lot of other material which needed to be conveyed as well. The transcripts were rewritten and cleaned up a bit and the photos were digitally processed for the first four forms. During another visit to New Mexico, Sensei and his assistant Anita Wilson along with Sensei's son did the demonstrations needed for the last four forms. Later, the first four forms were re-shot with Sensei Rogers and one of his first U.S. students, Jeff Glaze of New Mexico. By this time, \\"Positive Aikido\\" was being developed as a book. The agent and publishers we first contacted agreed, but the material was still fairly rough. More photos were shot and extensive digital work was done on them to clarify technique. Additional sections were added to describe combat strategy and the philosophy behind \\"Positive Aikido\\". Sections on ethics and morals within the arts were developed along with material dealing with the selection of a martial art for beginners. And of course, the history section was strengthened and sharpened. Lastly, a complete reorganization of the material was accomplished with an addition of a section on pins and control and weapons (jo and sword). The finished work is comprised of more than 1000 photos, 600 hand-drawings and complex explanations and tips to make the techniques of Aikido work properly.

The idea took root while teaching geostatistics at the Centre de Geostatis tique (Ecole des Mines de Paris) over the past ten years in the two postgraduate programs DEA and CFSG. A first script of lecture notes in French originated from this activity. A specialized course on Multivariate and Exploratory Geostatistics held in September 1993 in Paris (organized in collaboration with the Department of Statistics of Trinity College Dublin) was the occasion to test some of the mate rial on a pluridisciplinary audience. Another important opportunity arose last year when giving a lecture on Spatial Statistics during the summer term at the Department of Statistics of the University of Washington at Seattle, where part of this manuscript was distributed in an early version. Short accounts were also given during COMETT and TEMPUS courses on geostatistics for environment al studies in Fontainebleau, Freiberg, Rome and Prague, which were sponsored by the European Community. I wish to thank the participants of these various courses for their stimulating questions and comments. Among the organizers of these courses, I particularly want to acknowledge the support received from Georges Matheron, Pierre Chau vet, Margaret Armstrong, John Haslett and Paul Sampson. Michel Grzebyk has made valuable comments on Chapters 26 and 27, which partly summarize some of his contributions to the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OGrmCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romancing Your Child's Heart","description":"This companion to \\"Romancing Your Child's Heart\\" shows parents how to lead their child(ren) into an intimate relationship with God, thus building up their resistance to evil.

America is a mere decade past World War II. Richard Nixon is next in command to President Dwight Eisenhower, the Dow Jones soars above 500, and Norma Jean Mortenson legally changes her name to Marilyn Monroe. Two words described the decade, as John Updike wrote in the short story  When Everyone Was Pregnant : Fear and gratitude. And during this boom period, grateful young families thrilled to find themselves homeowners after the uncertainty of the Great Depression followed by a second Great War. Those empty rooms needed filling in order to make the house a home, and homeowners turned to the iconic Better Homes and Gardens brand. Better Homes and Gardens Decorating Book, the first edition of a title that would spawn ten editions over the years, became the new home bible for injecting class, style (and the occasional misguided cowboy wallpaper) into American homes. While exploring numerous styles, the main theme of the book is the on-trend mid-century modern sensibility, a style as appropriate today as it was six decades ago when the book was initially released. Filled with hundreds of full-color period photos, dozens of adorable illustrations, and decorating tips and tricks that are both helpful and nostalgic, the book remains a fun classic.

Many cannot find jobs, and those who do are often stuck in low-wage, dead-end positions. Meanwhile employers complain that high school graduates lack the necessary skills for today's workplace. Beyond College for All focuses on this crisis in the American labor market. Around the world, author James E. Rosenbaum finds, employers view high school graduates as valuable workers. Why not here? Rosenbaum reports on new studies of the interaction between employers and high schools in the United States. He concludes that each fails to communicate its needs to the other, leading to a predictable array of problems for young people in the years after graduation. High schools caught up in the college-for-all myth, provide little job advice or preparation, leading students to make unrealistic plans and hampering both students who do not go to college and those who start college but do not finish. Employers say they care about academic skills, but then do not consider grades when deciding whom to hire. Faced with few incentives to achieve, many students lapse into precisely the kinds of habits employers deplore, doing as little as possible in high school and developing poor attitudes. Rosenbaum contrasts the situation in the United States with that of two other industrialized nations-Japan and Germany-which have formal systems for aiding young people who are looking for employment. Virtually all Japanese high school graduates obtain work, and in Germany, eighteen-year-olds routinely hold responsible jobs. While the American system lacks such formal linkages, Rosenbaum uncovers an encouraging hidden system that helps many high school graduates find work. He shows that some American teachers, particularly vocational teachers, create informal networks with employers to guide students into the labor market. Enterprising employers have figures out how to use these networks to meet their labor needs, while students themselves can take steps to increase their ability to land desirable jobs. Beyond College for All suggests new policies based on such practices. Rosenbaum presents a compelling case that the problems faced by American high school graduates and employers can be solved if young people, employers, and high schools build upon existing informal networks to create formal paths for students to enter the world of work.

With consummate skill, in a narration that never flags in vividness and drama, Robert Payne re-creates Mahatma Gandhi both as a spiritual and historical force and as a living personality. When in January, l948, Gandhi was assassinated in Delhi by a fanatic, his death sent shock waves around the world. For two generations he had been the conscience of his country and the world. Planting the idea of non-violence firmly in men s minds, he had not only conquered India but also changed the landscape of the human heart. In the tradition of his best-selling biographies of Lenin and Schweitzer, Robert Payne s life brings Gandhi alive as a rounded personality. Beginning with the moving story of a shy, awkward boy from a provincial Indian city who married at Thirteen, then was separated from his bride for years while he read law in London, the book describes Gandhi s life as a successful barrister in South Africa who turned his back on wealth to defend Indian settlers against discrimination and persecution. Robert Payne superbly describes Gandhi s daring marches to aid the oppressed; his fasts and imprisonments; his historic achievements at international congresses and conferences in India and England where, clad only in shawl and loincloth, he met with prime ministers and viceroys and won their respect as he fought for the dignity and freedom of his people.  I would place Robert Payne s book on the level of a great novel by Tolstoy, swiftly moving, panoramic, writ on the canvas of destiny and of close historical characterization,  writes Dr. Amiya Chakravarty, former private secretary of Rabindranath Tagore, who knew Gandhi personally and worked with him.  It is one of the great biographies. No finer account of Gandhi s life and death has been written.

He is the Founder of the Fast Track Group of Companies, an acclaimed solutions-based financial literacy firm and one of the nation s fastest-growing companies. For nearly a decade and a half, Darren has spoken to hundreds of thousands of people across North America, Europe and Latin America about how to become financially independent. He is an advocate of learning how to create wealth through business and investment, and believes that this vital knowledge is lacking from traditional education. In fact, in every country that he has spoken Darren has seen that schools do not teach their students to manage money. Darren has made it his mission to fill that void by providing financial education to people across the world. He went from an average middle-class upbringing to raising hundreds of millions of dollars in investor capital, owning nearly 5,000 real estate properties, millions of dollars in energy assets and acquiring two cruise ship terminals in the Caribbean. All of this was accomplished by educating himself on how to do it and then taking action. There is no greater expert on the art of raising capital from investors and no person more committed to sharing this information than Darren Weeks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1nJFCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chloe Mae Chronicles Set of 4:","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FKUqAAAACAAJ&dq=Chloe+Mae+Chronicles+Set+of+4:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brownstone in Brooklyn","description":"Considered one of the city's most notorious industrial slums in the 1940s and 1950s, Brownstone Brooklyn by the 1980s had become a post-industrial landscape of hip bars, yoga studios, and beautifully renovated, wildly expensive townhouses. In The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn, Suleiman Osman offers a groundbreaking history of this unexpected transformation. Challenging the conventional wisdom that New York City's renaissance started in the 1990s, Osman locates the origins of gentrification in Brooklyn in the cultural upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. Gentrification began as a grassroots movement led by young and idealistic white college graduates searching for \\"authenticity\\" and life outside the burgeoning suburbs. Where postwar city leaders championed slum clearance and modern architecture, \\"brownstoners\\" (as they called themselves) fought for a new romantic urban ideal that celebrated historic buildings, industrial lofts and traditional ethnic neighborhoods as a refuge from an increasingly technocratic society. Osman examines the emergence of a \\"slow-growth\\" progressive coalition as brownstoners joined with poorer residents to battle city planners and local machine politicians. But as brownstoners migrated into poorer areas, race and class tensions emerged, and by the 1980s, as newspapers parodied yuppies and anti-gentrification activists marched through increasingly expensive neighborhoods, brownstoners debated whether their search for authenticity had been a success or failure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-IgfAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Be Nice, Be Real: Balancing Passion for Self with Compassion for Others","description":"Don't Be Nice, Be Real! is a lively, light approach to a deadly serious subject-our lives.

Explained are the GPRS and EGPRS packet control channels and gateways to the GSM system to provide a maximum delivered packet data transmission rate of approximately 474 kbps. You will learn how EDGE is an evolved version of the GPRS radio channel that uses new phase modulation and packet transmission to provide for advanced high-speed EGPRS data services. The GPRS system allows cellular service providers to upgrade one or more GSM radio channels (with changes) to provide broadband medium-speed and high-speed data services to their customers. GPRS and EGPRS technology is an \\"always-on\\" system that allows users to browse the Internet without complicated dialup connections. You will discover that the key types of GPRS and EGPRS devices include external radio modems, wireless PCMCIA cards, embedded radio modules, and mobile telephones. External radio modems allow the customer to simply plug in their GPRS device to their USB or Ethernet data port to their desktop or laptop computer. GPRS PCMCIA cards can be added to most laptop computers or embedded radio modules allow devices such as PDAs and Laptops to integrate high-speed wireless without adding PCMCIA cards. Some mobile telephones include both GSM (voice and low speed data) and GPRS (high-speed packet data) capability. Because the needs of voice and data communication are different, the operation of the GSM radio channel is different. GPRS devices can have single mode (only GPRS/EGPRS) or dual mode (both GSM voice and GPRS data) capability. You will discover how the GPRS system was modified using EDGE technology toincrease the 171.2 kbps GPRS maximum data transmission rate to 474 kbps EGPRS data transmission rate. This book provides the basic technical components and operation of GPRS technology. You will learn the physical radio channel structures of the GPRS system along with the basic frame and slot structures. Described are the logical channels and their functions. Explained are the key GPRS network components and how they communicate with each other. Explained is the fundamental capabilities and operation of the GPRS and EGPRS radio channel including asymmetric data rates, modulation types (GMSK, 8-PSK), and how GPRS devices can use either GSM or GPRS control channels to setup and manage packet data communication sessions. You will discover how a packet control unit (PCU) coordinates the allocation of GSM voice channels and GPRS/EGPRS packet data channels and how a single GSM radio channel can provide up to 8 simultaneous data sessions and how many other users (possibly 80 per channel) can be added who have a 10% usage activity factor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lJolAQAACAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+GPRS+and+EDGE:+Technology,+Operation,+and+Services&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Even with My Issues","description":"The enemy will try anything to prevent you from moving beyond your issues, just as he did with the woman with the issue of blood.

The first part of the book maintains that there is a very striking similarity in the epistemologies of John Henry Newman, a convert to Catholicism from the nineteenth century, and Michael Polanyi, a scientist-turned-philosopher from the twentieth. By mapping each man's work in turn, the author shows that both men recognized the same key features of the life of the mind, although they used different terminology to develop similar insights. Newman spoke of the illative sense, by which the mind guides itself in all concrete reasoning, while Polanyi focused on the tacit dimension of personal knowledge. The second part of the book explores some of the theological implications of the epistemology of personal knowledge. Because \\"all knowledge is tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge\\" (Polanyi), all of Catholicism, to the extent that it may be construed as a body of knowledge, is \\"tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge.\\" The book is intended to serve as a foundation for post-critical theology. Newman and Polanyi provide an antidote to the skepticism generated by empiricism, positivism, objectivism, and rationalism. The post-critical view offers relief from closed systems inspired by the Cartesian model of clear and distinct ideas, formal operations, propositional rigidity, and chains of argument. The ground which Newman and Polanyi have in common should prove a fruitful resource for doing systematic theology less systematically and for defending dogma non-dogmatically. This book takes up issues relevant to epistemology, philosophy of science, natural theology, apologetics, and systematic theology. Martin X. Moleski, S.J., is associate professor of religious studies at Canisius College. \\"Both Newman and Polanyi rank high among the pioneers in the history of the post-critical movement in epistemology. They pointed out the limitations of the methods that had become current since the time of Descartes and Spinoza. . . . The systems of these two authors are exceptionally useful for dealing with the major issues that trouble the theological climate today.\\"--From the Foreword by Avery Dulles, S.J. \\"This engaging and lucid study brings into dialogue two thinkers whose methods share much in common despite their different purposes. . . . A principal contribution of Moleski's study is its cultivation of the common ground that religion shares with science.\\"--Theological Studies \\"An important and utterly engaging study. . . . Those familiar with Newman's Grammar of Assent and Polanyi's Personal Knowledge will appreciate the ways in which Moleski makes sometimes unexpected connections between the two thinkers, despite Polanyi's critical disposition toward Catholicism. Personal Catholicism is a most welcome contribution to today's rethinking of the relationship between faith and reason.\\"--First Things \\"There is a wealth of material here that could be applied to issues of faith and reason, science and faith, faith and the nature of reality as they are raised in contemporary society. . . .\\"--The Gospel and Our Culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hAeK_HYOoS8C&dq=Personal+Catholicism:+The+Theological+Epistemologies+of+John+Henry+Newman+and+Michael+Polanyi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Does My Child Have a Speech Problem?","description":"The essential, up-to-date guide for helping children with language and listening problems Does your child have trouble getting the right words out, following directions, or being understood?

Breathturn into Timestead: The Collected Later Poetry gathers the five final volumes of his life's work in a bilingual edition, translated and with commentary by the award-winning poet and translator Pierre Joris. This collection displays a mature writer at the height of his talents, following what Celan himself called the  turn  (die  Wende ) of his work away from the lush, surreal metaphors of his earlier verse. Given  the sinister events in its memory,  Celan wrote, the language of poetry has to become  more sober, more factual . . . 'grayer.'  He abandoned the richer music of lyric poems, paring his compositions down to increase the accuracy of the language that now  does not transfigure or render 'poetical'; it names, it posits, it tries to measure the area of the given and the possible.  In his need for an inhabitable post-Holocaust world that held the memory and anguish of that history, Celan experimented with a bold new poetics. Breathturn into Timestead reveals a poet undergoing one of the most profound artistic reinventions of the twentieth century creating a poetry grounded in his painful personal history and the ravages of postwar Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pTW3BQAAQBAJ&dq=Breathturn+(Sun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coaching & Mentoring For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"An innovative professional development strategy that facilitates change, improves instruction, and transforms school culture!

As a leading member of the Prague Surrealist Group, his work is linked to a rich avant-garde tradition and an uncompromising moral stance that brought frequent tensions with the authorities in the normalization years following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Svankmajer's formative influences have been the pre-war surrealists, the Prague of Rudolf II, experimental theatre, folk puppetry and, above all, the political traumas of the past 50 years. Like his contemporaries--including playwright president Vaclav Havel, and, in exile, novelist Milan Kundera and filmmaker Milos Forman--Svankmajer's dominant life experiences have been the realities of the Stalinist system, both the explicit state terror of the 1950s and the Brezhnevist neo-Stalinism of the 1970s and the 1980s. After training in puppetry and working in the Prague theatre, he made his first film in 1964. He directed a number of important films in the 1960s, including the live-action and Kafkaesque Byt (The Flat, 1968) and Zahrada (The Garden, 1968) and consolidated his international reputation with Moznosti dialogu (Dimensions of Dialogue) in 1982. Since then, he has continued his highly visual and poetic approach in two feature-length films, Neco z Alenky (Alice, 1987) and Lekce Faust (Faust, 1994). As a filmmaker, Svankmajer is constantly exploring and analyzing his concern with power, fear and anxiety, confrontation and destruction, magic, the irrational and the absurd, and displays a bleak outlook on the possibilities for dialogue. In challenging accepted narrative, the bourgeoisie of realism (nezval), and the thematic and formal conventions of the mainstream media, Svankmajer's work is startlingly dynamic, subversive, and confrontational.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bEEcAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dark+Alchemy:+The+Films+of+Jan+Svankmajer+(Contributions+to+the+Study+of+Popular+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Nice!

We all must consider where golf is headed and how best to protect the traditions of the game. I think The Future of Golf in America is vitally important. --Ben Crenshaw, former Masters champion Geoff Shackelford is a sane voice from deep in the trees. In his new and important book, The Future of Golf In America, he's here to tell us that bigger is not better. His call is the same one Henry David Thoreau made from a different wood: 'Simplify, simplify.' --Michael Bamberger, Sports Illustrated senior writer and author of To the Linksland A galvanizing new book from one of America's leading golf writers, The Future of Golf in America reveals how the tradition-rich sport has been kidnapped by equipment manufacturers and knowingly deregulated by its governing bodies. and Grounds for Golf, Geoff Shackelford charges that the slumping golf industry responds to unregulated technology by lengthening and narrowing courses at great expense, even as golfers flee the sport because golf takes too long, is too difficult and too expensive. Offering new commentary and analysis, along with essays from the Los Angeles Times, Links, Golf Magazine, Golf World and Golfdom, Shackelford chronicles several astonishing mistakes made by the once-respected United States Golf Association. He observes that the momentum gained from Tiger Woods' positive effect on golf's popularity is being squandered by an ill-advised emphasis on commercial interests. Shackelford urges the USGA to re-shoulder its responsibilities while suggesting how the PGA Tour can restore excitement to its championships for the good of the sport.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GhbflekyW0gC&dq=The+Future+of+Golf+in+America:+How+Golf+Lost+Its+Way+in+the+21st+Century+(and+How+to+Get+It+Back)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleep Medicine Pearls, Second Edition","description":"This second edition by noted sleep medicine authority Richard B.

Richard Pomfret examines the countries  relations with external powers and the possibilities for development offered by infrastructure projects as well as rail links between China and Europe. The transition of these nations from centrally planned to market-based economic systems was essentially complete by the early 2000s, when the region experienced a massive increase in world prices for energy and mineral exports. This raised incomes in the main oil and gas exporters, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan; brought more benefits to the most populous country, Uzbekistan; and left the poorest countries, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, dependent on remittances from migrant workers in oil-rich Russia and Kazakhstan. Pomfret considers the enhanced role of the Central Asian nations in the global economy and their varied ties to China, the European Union, Russia, and the United States. With improved infrastructure and connectivity between China and Europe (reflected in regular rail freight services since 2011 and China s announcement of its Belt and Road Initiative in 2013), relaxation of United Nations sanctions against Iran in 2016, and the change in Uzbekistan s presidency in late 2016, a window of opportunity appears to have opened for Central Asian countries to achieve more sustainable economic futures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8UZkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tell Me a Story: A New Look at Real and Artificial Memory","description":"How are our memories, our narratives, and our intelligence interrelated?

To design smart machines, Schank therefore investigated how people use narratives and stories, the nature and function of those narratives, and the connection of intelligence to both telling and listening.

NATIONAL OBSERVER:  Mr. Wallace, who kept journals and diaries at every stage of progress (in writing The Prize), has managed to make it all come alive for us, permitting us a sense of sharing in the making of the book.  CLEVELAND PRESS:  Wallace s anatomy of a best seller is a fantastic record of almost total recall.  SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER:  The Writing of One Novel is an extremely valuable book for writers, and because its author is the eminently successful Irving Wallace it can be read avidly by a much wider circle of enthusiasts. Wallace is a best seller extraordinary and this present book is a comprehensive survey of how he came to write, how he wrote and how he was affected by the reception of The Prize The book seems utterly honest.  ST. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH:  Never before have I seen a successful writer tell so much about the ways of his work.  LOS ANGELES TIMES:  Irving Wallace s candid and searching account of the conception, gestation and birth of The Prize... I found it a fascinating and revealing book... an excellent case study of what went into and came out in a single novel.

First, the various dimensions of the empirical study of the sciences are clarified in a methodological analysis of theoretical traditions, including the sociology of scientific knowledge and neo-conventionalism in the philosophy of science. Second, the author argues why the mathematical theory of communication enables us to address crucial problems in science and technology studies, both on the qualitative side (e.g., the significance of a reconstruction) and on the quantitative side (e.g., the prediction of indicators). A comprehensive set of probabilistic entropy measures for studying complex developments in networks is elaborated. In the third part of the study, applications to S&T policy questions (e.g., the emergence of a European R&D system), to problems of (Bayesian) knowledge representations, and to the study of the sciences in terms of 'self-organizing' paradigms of scientific communication are provided. A discussion of directions for further research concludes the study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H7J6Q-1Q5GcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Published Author's Guide to Promotion","description":"Everything you ve ever wanted to know about publishing but were too afraid to ask is right here in this funny, candid guide written by an acclaimed author.

Miami criminal defense attorney Jack Swyteck isn't looking for a new client, at least not one who is homeless and in jail for threatening to jump off a bridge. But from the moment Jack is called to defend the man, who goes by the name Falcon, something is amiss. For one thing, Falcon comes up with the $10,000 bail in cash. Then the body of a brutally murdered woman is found in the trunk of the abandoned car in which he is living. Panicked and on the run, Falcon takes Jack's best friend, Theo, hostage. They end up barricaded in a motel room, and Theo isn't the only one at Falcon's mercy. Jack must work with the cops and their crackerjack negotiator to free Theo and the other captives before Falcon decides he has nothing to lose by killing them all. What Jack doesn't know is that Falcon has a much bigger agenda, and that there are people behind the scenes who will stop at nothing to keep their dangerous secrets. Thus unfolds a riveting, lightning-paced story, as only James Grippando can tell it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LbWwWL-AKLoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic in the Shadows (Shadowrun)","description":"Magic in the Shadows is an advanced magic book that combines all the previously published Shadowrun magic rules with all new rules and magical creatures.
