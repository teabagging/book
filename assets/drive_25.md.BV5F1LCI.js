Nesbit's Psammead Trilogy: A Children's Classic at 100 (Children's Literature Association Centennial Studies)","description":"The year 2006 marks the hundredth anniversary of book publication of the final volume of the Psammead trilogy-Five Children and It (1902), The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904), and The Story of the Amulet (1906)-a remarkable series of fantasy novels for children by an equally remarkable writer, Edith Nesbit. In this trilogy, Nesbit combined fantasy and history with the domestic realism and humor of her Bastable books-The Story of the Treasure Seekers (1899), The Wouldbegoods (1901), and The New Treasure Seekers (1904)-the books that established her reputation as one of England's preeminent writers for children. By doing so, she not only earned popularity with several generations of child readers, but she also established her claim to a position in the pantheon of important writers for children. The essays collected in this volume celebrate the completion of the Psammead trilogy. Written by both established and new scholars in England, Canada, and the United States, these essays employ differing critical strategies and place Nesbit in various contexts to assess her achievement. In producing books with memorable comic moments, character-testing adventures, plausible child characters with real feelings and real limitations, and interesting and challenging thematic material, Nesbit produced in the Psammead trilogy books that children still read with enjoyment. Such fantasies truly are classics of children's literature. Teachers and students of children's literature and of British literature and culture will find this a valuable guide to critically reviewing and enjoying Nesbit's works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FLERfuhpRSMC&dq=E.+Nesbit%27s+Psammead+Trilogy:+A+Children%27s+Classic+at+100+(Children%27s+Literature+Association+Centennial+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Leadership Investment: How the World's Best Organizations Gain Strategic Advantage through Leadership Development","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"To Repel Ghosts","description":"A collection of poetry that integrates the rhythms of jazz chronicles the dynamic work and brief life of Jean-Michel Basquiat, revealing the artist's rise to success, his struggle with both fame and heroin, his untimely death, and his influential legacy.

Unable to stifle his curiosity, he finally lands the proper introduction, and a world previously hidden is brought into view.

His first fighter was the famed Spitfire, hero of the Battle of Britain. By 1943, however, it was obsolescent and did not match up well against the first-line German Messerschmitts and Focke-Wulfs. Yet Loving survived 101 combat missions flying the Spitfire. In the spring of 1944, Loving s 31st Fighter Group started flying P-51 Mustangs and was transferred to the new Fifteenth Air Force to escort heavy-bomber formations on long-range strategic strikes across southern Europe, including southeastern Germany. In the flak-filled skies over Ploesti, Vienna, Bucharest, Munich, and Stuttgart, where a number of the war s fiercest air battles took place, Lieutenant Loving flew head-to-head against some of the Luftwaffe s top fighter aces. By the time George Loving completed his 151st, and final, combat mission on August 21, 1944, he had risen from a lowly second lieutenant and untested wingman to captain, group leader, and Mustang ace.

Almost 900 miles long, the range climbs to nearly 11,000 feet and boasts several canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon. The rules of law and society have never taken hold in the Sierra Madre, which is home to bandits, drug smugglers, Mormons, cave-dwelling Tarahumara Indians, opium farmers, cowboys, and other assorted outcasts. Outsiders are not welcome; drugs are the primary source of income; murder is all but a regional pastime. The Mexican army occasionally goes in to burn marijuana and opium crops -- the modern treasure of the Sierra Madre -- but otherwise the government stays away. In its stead are the drug lords, who have made it one of the biggest drug-producing areas in the world. Fifteen years ago, journalist Richard Grant developed what he calls \\"an unfortunate fascination\\" with this lawless place. Locals warned that he would meet his death there, but he didn't believe them -- until his last trip. During his travels Grant visited a folk healer for his insomnia and was prescribed rattlesnake pills, attended bizarre religious rituals, consorted with cocaine-snorting policemen, taught English to Guarijio Indians, and dug for buried treasure. On his last visit, his reckless adventure spiraled into his own personal heart of darkness when cocaine-fueled Mexican hillbillies hunted him through the woods all night, bent on killing him for sport. With gorgeous detail, fascinating insight, and an undercurrent of dark humor, God's Middle Finger brings to vivid life a truly unique and uncharted world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d4XbWUd-UesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Never Dies","description":"His name is Bond.

Designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, this text invites its audience to take a fresh look at previously learned material through the prism of tensor calculus. Once the framework is mastered, the student is introduced to new material which includes differential geometry on manifolds, shape optimization, boundary perturbation and dynamic fluid film equations. The language of tensors, originally championed by Einstein, is as fundamental as the languages of calculus and linear algebra and is one that every technical scientist ought to speak. The tensor technique, invented at the turn of the 20th century, is now considered classical. Yet, as the author shows, it remains remarkably vital and relevant. The author s skilled lecturing capabilities are evident by the inclusion of insightful examples and a plethora of exercises. A great deal of material is devoted to the geometric fundamentals, the mechanics of change of variables, the proper use of the tensor notation and the discussion of the interplay between algebra and geometry. The early chapters have many words and few equations. The definition of a tensor comes only in Chapter 6  when the reader is ready for it. While this text maintains a consistent level of rigor, it takes great care to avoid formalizing the subject. The last part of the textbook is devoted to the Calculus of Moving Surfaces. It is the first textbook exposition of this important technique and is one of the gems of this text. A number of exciting applications of the calculus are presented including shape optimization, boundary perturbation of boundary value problems and dynamic fluid film equations developed by the author in recent years. Furthermore, the moving surfaces framework is used to offer new derivations of classical results such as the geodesic equation and the celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m369BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AudelBasic Electronics (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"Answers at your fingertips Over the past hundred years, electronic technology--especially digital--has transformed our world.

Hollihan and Baaskes discussions of these ideas and their applications are easy to follow, unencumbered by technical jargon, and illustrated with engaging examples drawn from current and well-known historical events.

M. Barrie, about his mother and family life in Scotland. According to The Bookman, it was the 7th bestselling book of 1897 in the United States. The book was written in tribute to Barrie's mother and includes family reminiscences.[1] In the book, Barrie recounts his mother telling tales of her childhood, and credits her with inspiring his interest in literature. Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, OM was a Scottish author and dramatist, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. The son of a weaver, Barrie studied at the University of Edinburgh. He took up journalism, worked for a Nottingham newspaper, and contributed to various London journals before moving to London in 1885. His early works, Auld Licht Idylls (1889) and A Window in Thrums (1889), contain fictional sketches of Scottish life and are commonly seen as representative of the Kailyard school. The publication of The Little Minister (1891) established his reputation as a novelist. During the next 10 years Barrie continued writing novels, but gradually his interest turned toward the theatre. In London he met the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired him in writing about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, a \\"fairy play\\" about this ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland. This play quickly overshadowed his previous work and although he continued to write successfully, it became his best-known work, credited with popularising the name Wendy, which was very uncommon previously. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital, which continues to benefit from them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4FdZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: An Introduction to Modern Economic Thought","description":"A reexamination of the major economic theories of the past two hundred years discusses how long-dead, famous economists such as Adam Smith and others would handle today's economic problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4an04D09LgC&dq=New+Ideas+from+Dead+Economists:+An+Introduction+to+Modern+Economic+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computers Of Star Trek","description":"The depiction of computers on the various \\"Star Trek\\" series has ranged from lame to breathtakingly imaginative.

For some this status was simply a matter of lineage - e.g. the Infantry Regiment 'List', which traced its identity to the Bavarian unit with which Hitler had served in World War I.

The traditional approach to reporting is no longer adequate, users now demand easy-to-use intelligent platforms and applications capable of analyzing real-time bu- ness data to provide insight and actionable information at the right time. The end goal is to improve the enterprise performance by better and timelier decision making, - abled by the availability of up-to-date, high-quality information. As a response, the notion of \\"real-time enterprise\\" has emerged and is beginning to be recognized in the industry. Gartner defines it as  using up-to-date information, getting rid of delays, and using speed for competitive advantage is what the real-time enterprise is all about. . . Indeed, the goal of the real-time enterprise is to act on events as they happen.   Although there has been progress in this direction and many com- nies are introducing products toward making this vision a reality, there is still a long way to go. In particular, the whole lifecycle of business intelligence requires new techniques and methodologies capable of dealing with the new requirements imposed by the real-time enterprise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sqG9DAEACAAJ&dq=The+Real-Time+Enterprise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Choose and Use Lumber, Plywood, Hardboard and Laminates (Popular Science Skill Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q14JAQAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Choose+and+Use+Lumber,+Plywood,+Hardboard+and+Laminates+(Popular+Science+Skill+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Opera According to Bartalini: A Book of Doggerel Libretti and Comic Illustrati","description":"The plots of twenty-eight of the most popular operas, from \\"Aida\\" to \\"Die Walkure,\\" are recounted in tongue-in-cheek verse, accompanied by satirical illustrations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lC3ZMppMdYEC&dq=The+Opera+According+to+Bartalini:+A+Book+of+Doggerel+Libretti+and+Comic+Illustrati&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing Options: A Report on Graves' Disease Treatments","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X5xiPQAACAAJ&dq=Healing+Options:+A+Report+on+Graves%27+Disease+Treatments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-ray astronomy","description":"Modern x-ray data, available through online archives, are important for many astronomical topics.

This book provides the first comprehensive review of the history of tropical rain forests on a long term geological timescale, commencing with the origin of the angiosperms over 100 million years ago, which today overwhelmingly dominate these forests. Tropical rain forest evolution is discussed in a global context within an up to date plate tectonic, palaeogeographical and palaeoclimatic framework, primarily by reference to the record of fossil pollen and spores. A particularly important aspect of this book is that in addition to published literature, it relies heavily on unpublished palynological data generated for petroleum companies during the course of hydrocarbon exploration programmes. Without access to such data the book could not have been written. The main text of the book reviews the evolution of tropical rain forests on a continent by continent basis, culminating with a global synthesis of their history in relation to the changing positions of the world?s tectonic plates and changing climates. This section also establishes the age of the great tropical rain forest blocks and identifies the world?s oldest tropical rain forests. The final chapter compares 20th Century tropical rain forest destruction with prehistoric forest clearance in temperate regions, and looks for analogues of the present phase of destruction within the geological record before considering long term implications of total rain forest destruction. The book will be of interest to all concerned with tropical rain forests, especially biologists, botanists, ecologists, and students of evolution. It will be valuable for postgraduates and advanced undergraduates, as well as stratigraphers, palaeobotanists, palynologists, and petroleum geologists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1rbuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Origin+and+Evolution+of+Tropical+Rain+Forests&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Practical Primer of Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)","description":"Forty lessons designed to introduce beginning students to the basic patterns and structures of Classical Chinese are taken from a number of pre-Han and Han texts selected to give students a grounding in exemplary Classical Chinese style.

Robert A. Orsi tells us that the women who were drawn to St. Jude--daughters and granddaughters of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and Ireland--were the first generations of Catholic women to make lives for themselves outside of their ethnic enclaves. Orsi explores the ambitions and dilemmas of these women as they dealt with the pressures of the Depression and the Second World War, made modern marriages for themselves, entered the workplace, took care of relatives in their old neighborhoods, and raised children in circumstances very different from those of their mothers and grandmothers. Drawing on testimonies written in the periodicals devoted to St. Jude and on interviews with women who felt their lives were changed by St. Jude's intervention, Orsi shows how devotion to St. Jude enabled these women to negotiate their way amid the conflicting expectations of their two cultures--American and Catholic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QfwCFN8nSCAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jumping Ship and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvQmlBNGbzgC&dq=Jumping+Ship+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Viking Romances (Penguin Classics)","description":"Combining traditional myth, oral history and re-worked European legend to depict an ancient realm of heroism and wonder, the seven tales collected here are among the most fantastical of all the Norse romances.

The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own.

Analyzing the symbolic language of Tarot images that express the intimations of the unconscious, she invites readers to explore novel ways of learning about the nature of ourselves and the world we are situated in. Combining thorough research with an accessible style, this groundbreaking book is essential reading for present and future generations of practitioners, academics and students across disciplines. Pia Br?nzeu, Professor of English Literature and Vice-Rector of the Universityof Timis ?oara, Romania; author of Corridors of Mirrors. A sequel to the author s Re-Symbolization of the Self: Human Development and Tarot Hermeneutic and Semiotics Education Experience, Semetsky s new book presents the Tarot sign-system as a school of ethical living. Bringing the philosophies of Peirce, Deleuze, Dewey, Whitehead and Gebser in a dialogue with the cutting-edge science of coordination dynamics, she grounds the art of Tarot in the logic of signs acting across nature, culture and human mind. Building on Noddings   maternal factor , Semetsky demonstrates how the lessons embodied in Tarot symbolism recover the feminine value of relations and contribute to Self~Other integration. Such is the message of Tarot images. The Image is the Message. Igor Klyukanov, Professor of Communication, Eastern Washington University, USA; editor, Russian Journal of Communication; author of A Communication Universe: Manifestations of Meaning, Stagings of Significance. Semetsky s amalgamation of the techniques of visual communication with the emerging field of edusemiotics is an absolute masterpiece in transdisciplinarity. By forging diverse strands of inquiry into an overall model of how images enhance learning, Semetsky s new book provokes us to take a fresh look at iconic information and is a required reading for everyone who is engaged with the art and science of visual semiotics at the intersection of nature and culture. Marcel Danesi, Professor of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Canada; editor-in-chief, Semiotica; author of The Quest for Meaning: A Guide to Semiotic Theory and Practice. Finally. An in-depth look at Tarot from within the field of semiotics, a perspective that had been inexplicably overlooked until now. As a language of exile from language, Tarot cards are silent words that became images. Here is a book that turns our thirst for symbols into a learning tool. The sign sings in Inna Semetsky s work.

It is not possible, in a work of so cursory and slight a character, to do more than lightly touch upon the many points of varied interest which a country such as Brazil offers to the minds of thoughtful persons. I have, therefore, merely endeavoured to say a few words about the country in which so many of the best years of my life have been spent, because I find that the few ideas people do possess about it on this side of the Atlantic are, generally speaking, very fragmentary and often entirely erroneous. I have confined myself principally to speaking of those States of which I have personal knowledge, although there are many more, both in the north and in the interior of Brazil, which offer an equally interesting field for study.

When people try to understand puzzling human behavior, they construct behavior explanations, which are a fundamental tool of social cognition. But, Malle argues, behavior explanations exist not only in the mind; they are also overt verbal actions used for social purposes. When people explain their own behavior or the behavior of others, they are using the explanation to manage a social interaction by offering clarification, trying to save face, or casting blame. Malle's account makes clear why these two aspects of behavior explanation exist and why they are closely linked; along the way, he illustrates the astonishingly sophisticated and subtle patterns of folk behavior explanations. Malle begins by reviewing traditional attribution theories and their simplified portrayal of behavior explanation. A more realistic portrayal, he argues, must be grounded in the nature, function, and origins of the folk theory of mind the conceptual framework underlying people's grasp of human behavior and its connection to the mind. Malle then presents a theory of behavior explanations, focusing first on their conceptual structure and then on their psychological construction. He applies this folk-conceptual theory to a number of questions, including the communicative functions of behavior explanations, and the differences in explanations given for self and others as well as for individuals and groups. Finally, he highlights the strengths of the folk-conceptual theory of explanation over traditional attribution theory and points to future research applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z8maVP-oPGUC&dq=How+the+Mind+Explains+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossing America","description":"Now completely revised, this perennially popular guide turns driving trips into adventures as it highlights more than 3,500 places to visit--all just a short drive from major interstate highways. 500 color photos. 103 maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bI8IAQAAMAAJ&dq=Crossing+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","description":"Written by an anonymous English monk during the late 14th century, The Cloud of Unknowing puts forth a method of contemplation that stresses the impotence of the understanding to break through the cloud of unknowing that separates God and humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LAx0_zPqvtkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Guide to the Great Outdoors","description":"Explains how to get free information about America's public lands","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xk4AAAAACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Sam%27s+Guide+to+the+Great+Outdoors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Using HTML and XHTML (Special Edition)","description":"Special Edition Using HTML & XHTML is a comprehensive Web publishing reference, providing practical solutions to real-world Web development problems.

Are you obsessed over the past? Do you give responsibility for your actions to your emotions? Do you want to learn how to use emotional intelligence and anger management? If yes, then keep reading! The world is bad, nobody can be trusted, so sometimes we need to wear beautiful armor that will protect us from suffering... What does this armor hide? Our emotional part, our heart that expected something else and received nothing. Emotions often lead us to sabotage our chances of success by saying or doing things we often regret. What can teach us how to take advantage of our emotions is Emotional Intelligence. According to the experts, this quality is vital for a career and possessing this ability is even more important than having a high IQ: most successful people have a good level of EI. Emotional intelligence has become a key skill for companies and leaders, if cultivated, it could be improved by up to 70%. Decades of studies have shown that the best leaders and teams have achieved their excellent results by having high emotional and social skills, including self-control, resilience under stress, empathy, influence and teamwork. You realize outrage is harming your life, yet you don't have the vaguest idea of how to fix it. Intelligence is a handbook for everything regarding the emotional quotient, abbreviated EQ. It discusses the different facets of EQ from why we have feelings to when we need them. It explains why emotional intelligence could take you beyond IQ in life, without inherently diminishing the crucial role that book smarts play in your life. It also goes to burst the common misconceptions regarding current emotional intelligence, thereby helping you to separate the realities from the misunderstandings. This book covers the following topics: Discover what is Emotional Intelligence How to Improve Emotional Intelligence What E.I. can do for your family, friends and work Be a better leader; Learn how to deal with anger Why do you need to challenge anger? Have more complete and satisfying family and relationships; Make more sensible decisions; Have a higher level of self-esteem and self-confidence; And so much more! When an emotion is not properly expressed or felt, it becomes like water trapped in a dam. The pressure grows and grows at every situation you encounter while bottling up that emotion adds its own pressure to the dam. Finally, when the dam breaks, the emotional tidal wave that explodes can quite literally run roughshod all over your life. This is commonly seen in people without anger management or who have explosive anger issues. No emotion is immune to the proverbial dam that they can get trapped behind. Unfortunately, when the tidal wave is unleashed, it is often over the single one last drop that broke through the dam. That drop might be small and insignificant, but the entire weight of the tidal wave comes out with it. Ready to get started?

In 1483, Father Felix Fabri sails from Germany to Mount Sinai on a pilgrimage to venerate the relics of Saint Katherine of Alexandria. But at each of the shrines he visits throughout Greece and Palestine, he finds that the remains of Katherine s body are being stolen piece by piece: her hand, her ear, and then her tongue vanish from their holy resting places. Desperate to discover the thief and save his saint from such appalling desecration, Felix is thrust into a strange mystery that takes him across the desert and plumbs the depths of his soul.  Holman seduces you into a world of priests, rogues, saints, a world bright with horizon, wonder, piety. Her prose, tart, racy, and somber, will sing in your soul a long while.

Some don't make it to adulthood. Some do, but their lives rarely rise above the despair that brought them to the streets in the first place. A few manage to beat the street, to get their lives back on track. In this disturbing account Marlene Webber draws on extensive interviews with these kids to explore the realities of street life, its attraction, and its consequences. Street kids like to project an image of themselves as free-wheeling rebels who relish life on the wild side. All brashness and bombast, they strut around inner cities panhandling, posturing, and prostituting themselves. Labelled society's bad boys and girls, they often live up to their image. But as sixteen-year-old Eugene tells us, the street forces bravado on homeless adolescents, 'but underneath, a lot of kids are plenty scared.' Eugene is only one of many street kids who talked to Webber in major cities across Canada. She lets her subjects tell their own stories; their voices are sometimes brave, sometimes bitter, often heartbreaking. Webber cuts a comprehensible path through the tangle of forces, including family breakdown and social-service failure, that accelerate the tragedy of Canada's runaways. She suggests measures that might help more of them beat the streets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7x2NBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photos of Lucas (Edition Euros)","description":"Who Benefits From Special Education?: Remediating (Fixing) Other People's Children addresses the negative consequences of labeling and separating education for students with \\"disabilities,\\" the cultural biases inherent in the way that we view children's learning difficulties, the social construction of disability, the commercialization of special education, and related issues. The theme that unifies the chapters is that tension exists between professional ideology and practice, and the wishes and expectations of the recipients of professional practice--children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities and their families. These voices have rarely taken center stage in formulating important decisions about the quality and characteristics of appropriate practice. The dominant view in the field of special education has been that disability is a problem in certain children, rather than an artifact that results from the general structure of schooling; it does not take into consideration the voices of people with disabilities, their families, or their teachers. Offering an alternative perspective, this book deconstructs mainstream special education ideologies and highlights the personal perspectives of students, families, and front-line professionals such as teachers and mental health personnel. It is particularly relevant for special education/disabilities studies graduate students and faculty and for readers in general education, curriculum studies, instruction theory, and critical theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9XOUl7HrodcC&dq=Photos+of+Lucas+(Edition+Euros)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Film and Television Acting, Second Edition: From stage to screen","description":"Film and Television Acting offers solid techniques for creating a natural, believable performance for film and television.

Running spy networks overseas. Tracking down terrorists in the Middle East. Interrogating enemy prisoners. Analyzing data from spy satellites and intercepted phone calls. All of these are vital intelligence tasks that traditionally have been performed by government officials accountable to Congress and the American people. But that is no longer the case. Starting during the Clinton administration, when intelligence budgets were cut drastically and privatization of government services became national policy, and expanding dramatically in the wake of 9/11, when the CIA and other agencies were frantically looking to hire analysts and linguists, the Intelligence Community has been relying more and more on corporations to perform sensitive tasks heretofore considered to be exclusively the work of federal employees. This outsourcing of intelligence activities is now a $50 billion-a-year business that consumes up to 70 percent of the U.S. intelligence budget. And it's a business that the government has tried hard to keep under wraps. Drawing on interviews with key players in the Intelligence-Industrial Complex, contractors' annual reports and public filings with the government, and on-the-spot reporting from intelligence industry conferences and investor briefings, Spies for Hire provides the first behind-the-scenes look at this new way of spying. Shorrock shows how corporations such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, SAIC, CACI International, and IBM have become full partners with the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Pentagon in their most sensitive foreign and domestic operations. He explores how this partnership has led to wasteful spending and threatens to erode the privacy protections and congressional oversight so important to American democracy. Shorrock exposes the kinds of spy work the private sector is doing, such as interrogating prisoners in Iraq, managing covert operations, and collaborating with the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans' overseas phone calls and e-mails. And he casts light on a \\"shadow Intelligence Community\\" made up of former top intelligence officials who are now employed by companies that do this spy work, such as former CIA directors George Tenet and James Woolsey. Shorrock also traces the rise of Michael McConnell from his days as head of the NSA to being a top executive at Booz Allen Hamilton to returning to government as the nation's chief spymaster. From CIA covert actions to NSA eavesdropping, from Abu Ghraib to Guant namo, from the Pentagon's techno-driven war in Iraq to the coming global battles over information dominance and control of cyberspace, contractors are doing it all. Spies for Hire goes behind today's headlines to highlight how private corporations are aiding the growth of a new and frightening national surveillance state.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F52N9M2ALpsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"genies don't ride bicycles","description":"The hugely popular early chapter book series re-emerges -- now in e-book!

While his philosophy has been the subject of numerous studies and translations, Joseph Walser provides the first examination of Nagarjuna's life and writings within the social, religious, and institutional contexts of the early history of Buddhism. Walser locates Nagarjuna's second century writings at a critical juncture in the development and spread of Mahayana Buddhism. At this time, Mahayanist writings and teachings were regarded with great suspicion, and its followers were subject to legal censure. Walser explores how Nagarjuna's writings, including his most famous works, The Jeweled Garland and Foundational Stanzas, established a connection between the authority of the existing Buddhist canon and Mahayana teachings. In doing so, Nagarjuna was able to demonstrate the legality of Mahayana interpretation within the strictures of Buddhist monastic law. This established a place for Mahayana in the Buddhist tradition and insured the reproduction and transmission of the sect's central texts. Walser's analysis draws on close readings of Nagarjuna's texts, particularly their treatment of the three baskets of the Buddhist canon: Vinaya (Buddhist monastic law), Sutra (the sermons of the Buddha), and Abhidharma (Buddhist sectarian treatises). Walser also examines how the philosopher forged alliances with the laity and other Buddhist sects alliances that proved pivotal in insuring the survival of Mahayana teachings. In addition to his analysis of Nagarjuna's writings, Walser explores a range of Buddhist and non-Buddhist sources, as well as art historical and epigraphic evidence to offer a creative and original contribution to the understanding of Nagarjuna and the early history of Buddhism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-tt0PgAACAAJ&dq=Nagarjuna+in+Context:+Mahayana+Buddhism+and+Early+Indian+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freddy and the space ship;","description":"The lovable characters from Bean Farm took off for Mars in Benjamin Bean s fabulous space ship but Mrs. Peppercorn s fiddling with the controls knocked them off their course and landed them in a far more strange place than they had prepared for.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xucdBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered, Vol. 2 (Student Edition)","description":"In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons.

A nurse practitioner wonders whether she has violated professional boundaries in her care for a homeless man with AIDS, and a home care case manager is the sole attendee at a funeral for one of her patients.

Award-winning historian John David Smith argues that African American slavery remained a salient metaphor for how Americans interpreted contemporary race relations decades after the Civil War. Smith draws extensively on postwar articles, books, diaries, manuscripts, newspapers, and speeches to counter the belief that debates over slavery ended with emancipation. After the Civil War, Americans in both the North and the South continued to debate slavery s merits as a labor, legal, and educational system and as a mode of racial control. The study details how white Southerners continued to tout slavery as beneficial for both races long after Confederate defeat. During Reconstruction and after Redemption, Southerners continued to refine proslavery ideas while subjecting blacks to new legal, extralegal, and social controls. An Old Creed for the New South links pre and postCivil War racial thought, showing historical continuity, and treats the Black Codes and the Jim Crow laws in new ways, connecting these important racial and legal themes to intellectual and social history. Although many blacks and some whites denounced slavery as the source of the contemporary  Negro problem,  most whites, including late nineteenth-century historians, championed a  new  proslavery argument. The study also traces how historian Ulrich B. Phillips and Progressive Era scholars looked at slavery as a golden age of American race relations and shows how a broad range of African Americans, including Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, responded to the proslavery argument. Such ideas, Smith posits, provided a powerful racial creed for the New South. This examination of black slavery in the American public mind which includes the arguments of former slaves, slaveholders, Freedmen's Bureau agents, novelists, and essayists demonstrates that proslavery ideology dominated racial thought among white southerners, and most white northerners, in the five decades following the Civil War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wUOSzGdZC_MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","description":"The brand new epic fantasy series from international bestseller Brandon Sanderson.

Indeed, how do we put on the mind of Christ? How do we see through his eyes? How do we feel through his heart? How do we learn to respond to the world with that same wholeness and healing love? That s what Christian orthodoxy really is all about. It s not about right belief; it s about right practice.   Cynthia Bourgeault, author of The Wisdom Jesus What does it mean to follow the path of Christ today? Putting on the Mind of Christ is the first book to offer an integral understanding of the Christian spiritual path--one that examines the basic stages of spiritual development described by the great saints and sages, along with the psychological stages of development used by modern psychology. American mystic Jim Marion draws upon his own rich spiritual experience and deep understanding of scriptural models, to show readers how to emulate the developmental stages of the Christ: how to put on the mind of Christ to achieve spiritual illumination and communion with the Christ. He examines the seven levels of consciousness of the human personality mapped by the work of Jean Piaget, Carol Milligan, and Lawrence Kohlberg, and leads readers to the consciousness that Jesus called the Kingdom of Heaven--the highest level of spiritual development. Marion shows how inner spiritual growth has always been the true essence of Christian practice and shares his own spiritual experiences within a \\"Christ-focused\\" framework. Pioneering, transcendent, and grounded, Putting on the Mind of Christ will permanently alter the landscape of 21st-century Christianity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=30EQxw7TEN4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flow of Endtime Events: Bible Prophecy from a Prewrath Perspective","description":"A personal relationship with Jesus Christ and the leading of the Holy Spirit are required as first steps in understanding the Bible.

Charli is one of the many people who have lived through soul-crushing pain. Beginning when she was four years old, she witnessed the darker side of humanity firsthand, from a physically abusive father who abandoned the family to a neglectful mother. Living in foster care and enduring seven years of daily torture was no walk in the park for Charli and certainly didn t lighten the burden she would have to bear later in life.

Each individual chapter contribution is organized around a central theme: that the integration of theory, clinical wisdom, and practical and meaningful research produce the best understanding of couple and family relationships, and the best treatment options. The handbook contains five parts: ? Part I describes the history of the field and its current core theoretical constructs ? Part II analyzes the theories that form the foundation of couple and family therapy, chosen because they best represent the broad range of schools of practice in the field ? Part III provides the best examples of approaches that illustrate how clinical models can be theoretically integrative, evidence-based, and clinically responsive ? Part IV summarizes evidence and provides useful findings relevant for research and practice ? Part V looks at the application of couple and family interventions that are based on emerging clinical needs, such as divorce and working in medical settings.

Over 30,000 people a year are killed with guns in suicides, homicides, and accidents, and Americans use guns for defensive purposes as many as a million times a year. There is little doubt that gun violence and control are issues of vital importance, and they continue to inspire national debate. It is doubtful, however, that most gun debates are worth listening to. Not surprisingly, they generally leave their participants exactly where they began, with their biases intact, and onlookers perplexed. Written deliberately to counter an atmosphere of hysteria and extremism, Point Blank, now in paperback, offers logical argument supported by empirical information.

As he delves further, he learns the Osbornes are not at all what they seem. And when his own deputy goes missing, Strafford must work to unravel the ever-expanding mystery before the community s secrets, like the snowfall itself, threaten to obliterate everything.

In this provocative and laugh-out-loud funny book, Rathbun explores the often uneasy relationship between authentic faith and its cultural trappings, which faith must try to make sense of. In Post-Rapture Radio, our faithful narrator finds a mysterious box containing the sermons and journal entries of a genuine, unvarnished American character--the Reverend Richard Lamblove. The little-known Lamblove tried and failed to revolutionize contemporary Christian culture. As his journal entries, cereal box scribblings, and random notes on paper scraps reveal, Lamblove sees contemporary culture as shallow, overly individualistic, and consumed with the kind of status measured by money, power, and celebrity. And American Evangelicalism--which has been integrated into the culture as a whole--has similar failings. Reverend Lamblove vanished with-out a trace, but Russell Rathbun has \\"compiled\\" his papers into a compelling critique of contemporary faith--an antidote to faith-as-usual and a wakeup call for Christians to genuinely respond to the gospel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u0FtzEihcMEC&dq=Post-Rapture+Radio:+Lost+Writings+fromthe+Failed+Revolution+at+the+End+of+the+Last+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing Musical Intuitions: A Project-Based Introduction to Making and Understanding Music Complete Package","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JLizAEACAAJ&dq=Developing+Musical+Intuitions:+A+Project-Based+Introduction+to+Making+and+Understanding+Music+Complete+Package&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fortunes of Nigel","description":"Lord Nigel Olifaunt's father loaned huge sums of money to King James I of England years before.

The story tells of Gilgamesh s adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, the Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind s eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George s gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluent narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.

According to medieval legend, these coins had existed since the time of Abraham's father and had been used in many transactions recorded in the Bible. This book documents fifty specimens of coins which were venerated as holy relics in medieval and modern churches and monasteries of Europe, from Valencia to Uppsala. Most of these relics are ancient Greek silver coins in origin mounted in precious reliquaries or used for the distribution of their wax imprints believed to have healing powers. Drawing from a wide range of historical sources, from hagiography to numismatics, this book will appeal to students and academics researching Late Antique, Medieval, and Early Modern History, Theology, as well as all those interested in the function of relics throughout Christendom. The Thirty Pieces of Silver is a study that invites meditation on the highly symbolic and powerful role of money through coins which were the price, value, and measure of Christ and which, despite being the most abject objects, managed to become relics\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pU3UzgEACAAJ&dq=Thirty+Silver+Coins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Olive Tree Dictionary: A Transliterated Dictionary Of Conversational Eastern Arabic (Palestinian)","description":"The Olive Tree Dictionary translates from Arabic to English and contains an English Arabic Index.

Although many people view virtual reality as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Indeed, the search for illusionary visual space can be traced back to antiquity. In this book, Oliver Grau shows how virtual art fits into the art history of illusion and immersion. He describes the metamorphosis of the concepts of art and the image and relates those concepts to interactive art, interface design, agents, telepresence, and image evolution. Grau retells art history as media history, helping us to understand the phenomenon of virtual reality beyond the hype. Grau shows how each epoch used the technical means available to produce maximum illusion. He discusses frescoes such as those in the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii and the gardens of the Villa Livia near Primaporta, Renaissance and Baroque illusion spaces, and panoramas, which were the most developed form of illusion achieved through traditional methods of painting and the mass image medium before film. Through a detailed analysis of perhaps the most important German panorama, Anton von Werner's 1883 The Battle of Sedan, Grau shows how immersion produced emotional responses. He traces immersive cinema through Cinerama, Sensorama, Expanded Cinema, 3-D, Omnimax and IMAX, and the head mounted display with its military origins. He also examines those characteristics of virtual reality that distinguish it from earlier forms of illusionary art. His analysis draws on the work of contemporary artists and groups ART+COM, Maurice Benayoun, Charlotte Davies, Monika Fleischmann, Ken Goldberg, Agnes Hegedues, Eduardo Kac, Knowbotic Research, Laurent Mignonneau, Michael Naimark, Simon Penny, Daniela Plewe, Paul Sermon, Jeffrey Shaw, Karl Sims, Christa Sommerer, and Wolfgang Strauss. Grau offers not just a history of illusionary space but also a theoretical framework for analyzing its phenomenologies, functions, and strategies throughout history and into the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7OYaXjE5_lcC&dq=Virtual+Art:+From+Illusion+to+Immersion+(Leonardo+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","description":"\\"Saletan's Bearing Right is as subtle and intelligent a study of abortion politics as has ever been written.

Why are they less likely to seek public office or join political organizations? The Private Roots of Public Action is the most comprehensive study of this puzzle of unequal participation. The authors develop new methods to trace gender differences in political activity to the nonpolitical institutions of everyday life--the family, school, workplace, nonpolitical voluntary association, and church. Different experiences with these institutions produce differences in the resources, skills, and political orientations that facilitate participation--with a cumulative advantage for men. In addition, part of the solution to the puzzle of unequal participation lies in politics itself: where women hold visible public office, women citizens are more politically interested and active. The model that explains gender differences in participation is sufficiently general to apply to participatory disparities among other groups--among the young, the middle-aged, and the elderly or among Latinos, African-Americans and Anglo-Whites.

Explanation of Outcomes Analysis Index Reviews of this book: The Private Roots of Public Action begins with common explanations for the gender difference in participation, from domestic demands on women's time and psychic space through the effects of the patriarchal family, socioeconomic hierarchies, and political socialization...The results of [this] novel analysis are complex and interesting...The authors extend their model to examine the relationship between class, race or ethnicity, and political participation. This unique and accessible volume will be influential in the fields of political socialization and gender and politics. Strongly recommended. --B. E. Marston, Choice The Private Roots of Public Action is the most comprehensive examination of the similarities and differences in the political activity of women and men. The range of inquiry is enormous. Burns, Schlozman and Verba delve not only into political activity but also into the processes in the family, in the workplace, in places of worship, and in voluntary associations that promote and inhibit political involvement. This book goes beyond the literature in connecting to an enormous range of scholarship in political science, economics, and sociology. This is a fine piece of work. --John Mark Hansen, University of Chicago The Private Roots of Public Action is a very important book. It pushes research on gender and participation to a whole new level, and reshapes the agenda as far as our thinking and our research about the connections among family life, the workplace, institutions of civil society, and political and governmental institutions. The authors demonstrate the importance of understanding political participation within a larger context in a way that does justice to the complexity of people's lives. --Kristi Anderson, Syracuse University The Private Roots of Public Action is an important contribution to the literature on both political participation and gender politics. Because of its database, its tie-in to the most current work on political participation, and its comprehension of important current questions about gender politics, this book provides a new benchmark for work in this field. In particular, the Civic Voluntarism model developed by Verba, Schlozman, and Brady, and the consideration of how gender difference and inequality might feed into that model, is a unique contribution. This accessible book will be welcomed by gender politics scholars and will have an impact on the field of political participation. --Virginia Sapiro, University of Wisconsin-Madison","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uW7sYFhAGr4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FAZA X1/9 - Strada - 128 race world & repair manual","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zn5_PQAACAAJ&dq=FAZA+X1/9+-+Strada+-+128+race+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devotions from the World of Music","description":"The world of music is filled with special moments that teach us about life.

The theoretical framework used in this work combines Weberian, Aristotelian, evolutionary anthropological, and feminist theories in a comparative-historical context. The dual nature of humans, as both an animal and a consciously aware being, underpins the analysis presented. Part One covers tribes. It uses anthropological literature to describe the  campfire democracy  of the African Bushmen, the Pygmies, and other band societies. Its main focus is on the tribal democracy of the Cheyenne, Iroquois, Huron, and other tribes, and it pays special attention to the role of women in tribal democracies. Part Two describes the city-states of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Canaan-Phoenicia, and includes a section on the theocracy of the Jews. This part focuses on the transition from tribal democracy to city-state democracy in the ancient Middle East  from the Sumerian city-states to the Phoenician. Part Three focuses on the origins of democracy and covers Greece Mycenaean, Dorian, and the Golden Age. It presents a detailed description of the tribal democracy of Archaic Greece  emphasizing the causal effect of the hoplite-phalanx military formation in egalitarianizing Greek tribal society. Next, it analyses the transition from tribal to city-state democracy with the new commercial classes engendering the oligarchic and democratic conflicts described by Plato and Aristotle. Part Four describes the Norse tribes as they contacted Rome, the rise of kingships, the renaissance of the city-states, and the parliamentary monarchies of the emerging nation-states. It provides details of the rise of commercial city states in Renaissance Italy, Hanseatic Germany and the Netherlands.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GNgoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream Keys","description":"58 Dream KeysYou will learn.....How to discern your life assignment and how to unlock the secret of multiplying God's blessings through dreams and visions, just by speaking a Dream Key over your life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3L-FtAEACAAJ&dq=Dream+Keys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Personal Power II (Volumes 1 thru 12)","description":"This eBook edition of \\"Personal Power\\" has been formatted to the highest digital standards and adjusted for readability on all devices.

Nalini Warriar, author of Blues from the Malabar Coast and a McAuslan Book Award winner A collection of beguiling stories from an American writer who excels at depicting the family ties that bind: fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters whose connections to one another are as fragile as they are irrevocable.

Written close to the senses, Bloodknots penetrates to the core. Ami Sands Brodoff is from New York and also lived in Princeton, New Jersey, before relocating with her husband to Montreal, where she writes and teaches creative writing. Her work has received a Pushcart Prize nomination and has been anthologized in numerous journals and book collections.

Elegant and wicked.... [This] might be the first true-crime book that makes the reader want to book a bed and breakfast for an extended weekend at the scene of the crime.\\"  The New York Times Book Review Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \\"soul of pampered self-absorption\\"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YjxITJFUDhoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"lucky wreck (Autumn House Poetry)","description":"The poems in Lucky Wreck trace the excitement of plans and the necessary swerving detours we must take when those plans fail.

They dared to risk it all in a skiff of reeds or leather, on a ship of wood or steel, knowing the only thing between them and certain death was their ship. To explore, to seek out what lay beyond the close and comfortable, every explorer had to embrace danger. And as they did so, what arose was a mystical bond, a passion for the ships that carried them. From the very first time humans dared to warp the fabric of space, escaping from the ashes of the third World War, they also created ships. These vessels have become the icons of mankind's desire to rise above the everyday, to seek out and make the unknown known. And these ships that travel the stellar seas have stirred the same passions as the ones that floated in the oceans. While every captain has wished that their starship could be outfitted in the same manner as the sailing ship H.M.S. Beagle without weapons that proved untenable. From the start, Starfleet realized that each vessel, due to the limited range of the early warp engines, must be able to stand alone against any attack. Thus arose the idea, taken from the days of wooden sailing ships, that every Starfleet vessel must stand as a ship of the line. Through the actions of their captains and crews, countless starships have taken on that role. Here we remember some of those ships and their heroic crews. In celebration of one of science fiction's most beloved franchises, this updated edition of the acclaimed Ships of the Line hardcover collection now includes dozens of additional images brought together for the first time in book format spectacular renderings featured in the highly successful Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendar series. With text by Star Trek's own Michael Okuda, the story of each of these valiant starships now comes to life. ?, ?, & ? 2014 CBS Studios, Inc.

A community and a nation were shocked. In a time when such crimes against children were rare, the public was transfixed as local television stations aired stark footage of the first hours of the investigation. Life and Newsweek magazines published exclusive stories the following week. When Kenneth Hansen was convicted and sentenced for the murders, the case was considered solved until questions were raised about Hansen s presumed guilt. Shattered Sense of Innocence: The 1955 Murders of Three Chicago Children tells the gripping story of the three murdered boys thirteen-year-old John Schuessler, his eleven-year-old brother, Anton, and thirteen-year-old Bobby Peterson and the quest to find and bring to justice their killer. Authors Richard C. Lindberg and Gloria Jean Sykes recount the bungled 1955 police investigation, the failures of multiple law enforcement agencies, and the subsequent convictions of Kenneth Hansen, in 1995 and 2002, and present new information concerning two suspects overlooked by police for five decades. The authors deftly examine all sides of this tragic story, drawing on exclusive interviews with law enforcement agents, with horse trainers affiliated with the so-called horse mafia, and with the man convicted of the murders, Kenneth Hansen. This intensely intimate account offers a rare glimpse into one community and examines how these atrocious crimes altered public perceptions nationwide. Shattered Sense of Innocence, which is also a story of political controversy, a determined federal agent s quest for justice, and a community s loss of innocence, includes fifty illustrations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CDjkQ24Y6EsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Haircut Today!","description":"Dominic refuses to get his hair cut, no matter how much his mother wants him to or how bad it looks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dWI0_FFTd5cC&dq=No+Haircut+Today!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Way to Treat a Lady","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mPiwAAAAIAAJ&dq=No+Way+to+Treat+a+Lady&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Weekend","description":"The Lost Weekend' is a gripping story of a talented but alcoholic writer Don Birnam who is a sensitive, charming, and educated man.

Y. Agnon is considered the towering genius of modern Hebrew literature for his hard-edged modernism and soft-hued imagery. With this new collection of stories, the English-speaking audience has, at long last, access to the rich and brilliantly multifaceted fictional world of one of the great writers of this century. These stories span the lifetime of a quintessential wandering Jew - born in Buczacz, Poland, living in Germany, and finally settling in Jerusalem - and they bring to life the full gamut of the modern Jewish experience in fiction. This broad selection of Agnon's fiction introduces the full sweep of the writer's panoramic vision as chronicler of the lost world of Eastern European Jewry and the emerging society of modern Israel. Here are stories that portray the richly textured culture of traditional Jewish life in Poland, as well as changes in the life of the community over time. Several stories reflect on the Jewish infatuation with German and Western culture in the interwar period: \\"On the Road,\\" for example, narrates an eerie encounter on the eve of a holy day between an itinerant Jew and a ghostly company of martyred Jews from the Crusades. The early years of Jewish settlement in the land of Israel are recalled in \\"Hill of Sand,\\" which is also a revealing portrait of the artist as a young man; \\"A Book That Was Lost\\" is a powerful metaphor for the writer's own journey from Buczacz to Jerusalem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yG8OAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+Book+That+Was+Lost:+And+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Andy Warhol Men Address Book (Andy Warhol)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vIsXHY4HqHAC&dq=Andy+Warhol+Men+Address+Book+(Andy+Warhol)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fearless: Double Edition #6: Payback (#6) & Freak (#30)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5S7htwEACAAJ&dq=Fearless:+Double+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chimpanzee and Red Colobus: The Ecology of Predator and Prey","description":"Our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, are familiar enough--bright and ornery and promiscuous. But they also kill and eat their kin, in this case the red colobus monkey, which may say something about primate--even hominid--evolution. This book, the first long-term field study of a predator-prey relationship involving two wild primates, documents a six-year investigation into how the risk of predation molds primate society. Taking us to Gombe National Park in Tanzania, a place made famous by Jane Goodall's studies, the book offers a close look at how predation by wild chimpanzees--observable in the park as nowhere else--has influenced the behavior, ecology, and demography of a population of red colobus monkeys. As he explores the effects of chimpanzees' hunting, Craig Stanford also asks why these creatures prey on the red colobus. Because chimpanzees are often used as models of how early humans may have lived, Stanford's findings offer insight into the possible role of early hominids as predators, a little understood aspect of human evolution. The first book-length study in a newly emerging genre of primate field study, Chimpanzee and Red Colobus expands our understanding of not just these two primate societies, but also the evolutionary ecology of predators and prey in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UEnVvXcfUrUC&dq=Chimpanzee+and+Red+Colobus:+The+Ecology+of+Predator+and+Prey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double, Double, Oil and Trouble (A John Putnam Thatcher Mystery)","description":"ePub eBook 2nd Edition.

Already formed by the time of the revolutions of 1905 and February 1917, these militant workers organised themselves into parliamentary detachments known as the krasnogvardeytsi, or 'Red Guards'.

Marching out Sunday night, the protesters brandished rifles, their maxim: \\"If we die, you are going to die.\\" Cornell '69 is an electrifying account of that weekend which probes the origins of the drama and describes how it was played out not only at Cornell but on campuses across the nation during the heyday of American liberalism. Donald Alexander Downs tells the story of how Cornell University became the battleground for the clashing forces of racial justice, intellectual freedom, and the rule of law. Eyewitness accounts and retrospective interviews depict the explosive events of the day and bring the key participants into sharp focus: the Afro-American Society, outraged at a cross-burning incident on campus and demanding amnesty for its members implicated in other protests; University President James A. Perkins, long committed to addressing the legacies of racism, seeing his policies backfire and his career collapse; the faculty, indignant at the university's surrender, rejecting the administration's concessions, then reversing itself as the crisis wore on. The weekend's traumatic turn of events is shown by Downs to be a harbinger of the debates raging today over the meaning of the university in American society. He explores the fundamental questions it posed, questions Americans on and off campus are still struggling to answer: What is the relationship between racial justice and intellectual freedom? What are the limits in teaching identity politics? And what is the proper meaning of the university in a democratic polity?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ux1HYX_CDLUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PC Magazine Wireless Solutions","description":"Wireless is freedom.

The psyche is a manifold of conscious and unconscious contents, and the symbol is their mediator. Because Lorca's dramatic characters are psychic entities made up of both conscious and unconscious elements, they unfold, grow, and meet their fate in a dense realm of shifting symbols. In Psyche and Symbol in the Theater of Federico Garc a Lorca, Rupert Allen analyzes symbologically three dramatic works of Lorca. He has found Perlimpl n to be a good deal more complex in both psyche and symbol than it has been admitted to be. Yerma involves psychological complications that have not been considered in the light of modern critical analysis, and the symbolic reaches ofBlood Wedding have until this book remained largely unexplored. Lorca was no stranger to the \\"agony of creation,\\" and this struggle sometimes appears symbolically in the form of his dramatic characters. Both Yerma and Blood Wedding reflect specific problems underlying the creative act, for they are \\"translations\\" into the realm of sexuality of the creative turmoil experienced by Lorca the poet. Perlimpl n portrays the paradoxical suicide as a self-murder born out of the futile attempt to create not a poem, but a self. Previous criticism of these three plays has been dominated by critical assumptions that are transcended by Lorca's own twentieth-century mentality. Allen's analysis provides a new view of Lorca as a dramatist and presents new material to students of symbology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rxjlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insects: A Guide to Familiar American Insects (A Golden Nature Guide)","description":"This eBook is best viewed on a color device.

This handsome edition, first published in 2016, is presented in paperback to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the original publication and features images by expedition photographer Frank Hurley, modern color photography of the fauna and vistas the men encountered, as well as long-lost photos taken by the expedition s Ross Sea Party and discovered in 2013. The expedition s story begins on the eve of World War I, when the ship Endurance departed England with Shackleton and his team of six men. The plan was to travel 1,800 miles across the icy continent from the Atlantic side, while a second team aboard the Aurora, would reach Antarctica s Pacific side and lay out supply depots for the advancing team. As the Endurance approached the continent, however, it became hopelessly locked in an ice floe, beginning a series of harrowing travails. Today considered an adventure survival classic, South is the true story of a thrilling polar expedition. Never before has Shackleton's lively prose been so extensively and stunningly illustrated.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m87HDwAAQBAJ&dq=South%3B:+The+story+of+Shackleton%27s+1914-1917+expedition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Son of Minos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=84pwng5q1TUC&dq=Son+of+Minos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Segway safaris: touring Florida's Amelia Island in style.(Going Green): An article from: E","description":"Agritourism has emerged as a viable financial option for many farms and ranches.

Oates states in her preface, \\"In the essay or review, the dynamic of storytelling is hidden but not absent,\\" and indeed, the voice of these \\"conversations\\" echoes the voice of her fiction in its dramatic directness, ethical perspective, and willingness to engage the reader in making critical judgments. Under the heading \\"Not a Nice Person,\\" such controversial figures as Sylvia Plath, Patricia Highsmith, and Muriel Spark are considered without sentimentality or hyperbole; under \\"Our Contemporaries, Ourselves,\\" such diversely talented figures as William Trevor, E. L. Doctorow, Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Connelly, Alice Sebold, Mary Karr, Anne Tyler, and Ann Patchett are examined. In sections of \\"homages\\" and \\"revisits,\\" Oates writes with enthusiasm and clarity of such cultural icons as Emily Bront?, Ernest Hemingway, Carson McCullers, Robert Lowell, Balthus, and Muhammad Ali (\\"The Greatest\\"); after a lapse of decades, she (re)considers the first film version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Americana, Don DeLillo's first novel, as well as the morality of selling private letters and the nostalgic significance of making a pilgrimage to Henry David Thoreau's Walden Pond.

Half of the world's population lives in coastal regions lapped by tidal waters. Yet how little most of us know about the tide - a key force on our planet that has altered the course of history and will transform our future.

William Arthur Sirmon from January 1, 1918 to November 12, 1918. In this account of a regular officer in the 82nd Division, 325th Infantry, you are led through ten chapters of a heartfelt, attention-grabbing journey. It starts out at Ft. Gordon, Georgia, where Sirmon was in charge of training soldiers. His story takes you across the beautiful, yet run down, terrain of France. William Arthur Sirmon spent more than four years prior to 1917 as an officer of the Philippine Constabulary, serving primarily in Mindanao, the  Island of Blood . He was the most highly decorated soldier from Georgia, and it is believed, of the entire Great War. February 16th, 1919, only he and Sergeant Alvin York were awarded The Legion of Honor of France, Distinguished Service Cross and the Croix de Guerre with Palm by General Pershing. These accolades made him an honorary citizen of England and France. This diary is not completely blood and guts, but surprisingly light for the most part. It describes the day-to-day life of typical American doughboys and the obstacles they faced through the entire war.

This collection of over 200 images chronicles the life and times of this once fledgling township established in 1843, to its incorporation as a city in 1951, and on to its present day prosperity. Historian Arthur M. Woodford has compiled maps, photographs, and drawings to tell the story of this \\"Village on the Lake.\\" Here the reader will find views of Lake St. Clair, the Milk River, and the many 19th century families and farms that fostered the growth of the area. Included are the stories of the infamous Blossom Heath Inn, Jefferson Beach Amusement Park, the grand Masonic Country Club, and the Interurban railway. Following World War Two, St. Clair Shores grew as part of the population boom of southeastern Michigan, and this once quiet village is now a modern suburban community of over 66, ooo residents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CvuNy1BDhUEC&dq=St.+Clair+Shores:+Village+on+the+Lake+(MI)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Barry Halper Collection of Baseball Memorabilia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kt2qswEACAAJ&dq=The+Barry+Halper+Collection+of+Baseball+Memorabilia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highwaymen and Outlaws","description":"Site authored by Gillian Spraggs.

By 1314 Bruce had captured every major English-held castle bar Stirling and Edward II took an army north to subdue the Scots.

A  vivid and devastating  (The New York Times) portrait of an indomitable girl from acclaimed journalist Andrea Elliott  From its first indelible pages to its rich and startling conclusion, Invisible Child had me, by turns, stricken, inspired, outraged, illuminated, in tears, and hungering for reimmersion in its Dickensian depths.  Ayad Akhtar, author of Homeland Elegies ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times ? ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Atlantic, The New York Times Book Review, Time, NPR, Library Journal In Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter. In this sweeping narrative, Elliott weaves the story of Dasani s childhood with the history of her ancestors, tracing their passage from slavery to the Great Migration north. As Dasani comes of age, New York City s homeless crisis has exploded, deepening the chasm between rich and poor. She must guide her siblings through a world riddled by hunger, violence, racism, drug addiction, and the threat of foster care. Out on the street, Dasani becomes a fierce fighter  to protect those who I love.  When she finally escapes city life to enroll in a boarding school, she faces an impossible question: What if leaving poverty means abandoning your family, and yourself? A work of luminous and riveting prose, Elliott s Invisible Child reads like a page-turning novel. It is an astonishing story about the power of resilience, the importance of family and the cost of inequality told through the crucible of one remarkable girl. Winner of the J.

It was first titled 'The Saints' Knowledge of Christ s Love' and is worthy of being ranked alongside Sibbes and deals with a much neglected subject area. The subject matter of this work which was first preached, is greatly needed today. On the one hand, experiences of the Spirit are being claimed from which the glory of the redeemer and the wonder of his love are quite absent, while on the other, an almost total attention to the understanding and practising of scripture truth is having the effect of marginalising the experiential element in true, spiritual knowledge. Bunyan's description of Christ's love to believers and how they ought to know it, cuts in both the above-mentioned directions. From some 440 Bible references he shows how knowing Christ's love is the message of Scripture and also the essence of heaven, partly possessed and expressed on earth. Those who know it are rich beyond measure and they are the people who 'sweeten the churches and bring glory to God and to religion'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jw9TzQEACAAJ&dq=All+Loves+Excelling:+The+Saints%27+Knowledge+of+Christ%27s+Love+(Puritan+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colombian Gold","description":"Alienated, amoral, and decadent, Santiago Villalba, seduced into becoming a front for his country's corrupt military dictatorship, finds his political naivete and moral apathy shattered by a threatened terrorist coup","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i3csAQAAMAAJ&dq=Colombian+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women, Celibacy, and the Church: Toward a Theology of the Single Life","description":"This book shows that for Christians, both men and women, the single life is an option equally valid and honorable to marriage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZ7YAAAAMAAJ&dq=Women,+Celibacy,+and+the+Church:+Toward+a+Theology+of+the+Single+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cybersona","description":"In an extreme case of identity theft, a computer genius who has recently become a quadriplegic when caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout uses an Internet game called \\"Cybersona\\" to take over the body of another player, a recently-fired science teacher, to get revenge on those responsible for his paralysis.

Once every few years a book comes along with an insight so penetrating, so powerful and so simply, demonstrably true that it instantly changes the way we think and do business. Such a book is Broken Windows, Broken Business, a breakthrough in management theory that can alter the destiny of countless companies striving to stay ahead of their competition. In this vital work, author Michael Levine offers compelling evidence that problems in business, large and small, typically stem from inattention to tiny details. Social psychologists and criminologists agree that if a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired, soon thereafter the rest of the windows will be broken and the perception will build that crime in that neighborhood is out of control. The same principle applies to business. Drawing on real-world corporate examples, from JetBlue's decision to give fliers what they really want leather seats, personal televisions, online ticketing - to Google's customer-based strategy for breaking out of the pack of Internet search engines, to business-to-business firms' successes and failures, Levine proves again and again how constant vigilance and an obsession with detail can make or break a business or a brand. With tips and advice on changing any business to one that dots its i's, crosses its t's, and attracts more clients, Broken Windows, Broken Business goes straight to the heart of what makes all enterprises successful the little things that mean a lot.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nJfvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vAShSAAACAAJ&dq=Thaddeus+of+Warsaw:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Satan's World","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eUlK1emkLIUC&dq=Satan%27s+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature (2 Volumes)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UX7VAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pastels (Fine Arts for Beginners)","description":"Basic lessons in becoming a good painter in pastels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-9lyiGaYEugC&dq=Pastels+(Fine+Arts+for+Beginners)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terrific (New York Times Best Illustrated Books (Awards))","description":"A gentle, dreamlike tale about heading home in the night.

Assessing 100 years of antitrust policy in the United States, this book shows that while the antitrust laws claim to serve the public good, they are as vulnerable to the influence of special interest groups as are agricultural, welfare, or health care policies. Presenting classic studies and new empirical research, the authors explain how antitrust caters to self-serving business interests at the expense of the consumer.

In 1998 the nematode worm---perhaps the most intensively studied animal on earth---was the first multicellular organism ever to have its genome sequenced and its DNA mapped and read. Four years later, the research that led to this extraordinary event garnered three scientists a Nobel Prize. Along with Robert Horvitz and Sydney Brenner, John Sulston discovered the phenomenon of programmed cell death in the worm, an essential concept that explains how biological development occurs in animal life and, as Horvitz later showed, how it occurs in human life. But this story is about more than just the worm. It is about how an eccentric group of impassioned scientists toiled in near anonymity for years, driven only by a deep passion for knowledge and scientific discovery. It recounts how hours of research and immense ambition resulted in one of the greatest discoveries in human history. \\"Brown's book traces the worm project from its inception, as fascinating for the obsessive, almost nerd-like quality of the researchers as for the unravelling of the worm's wormliness.\\"---Guardian \\"Brown should be commended for making what may seem to be obscure, esoteric science both accessible and exciting.\\"---Rachel Ankeny, American Scientist \\"What Brown does remarkably well in In the Beginning is to convey the passion, idealism, and cooperative spirit of the early worm workers.\\"---Science \\"In an era when scientific storytelling has become commonplace, this book stands out for its lesson on independent thought....Brown clearly relates the perseverance and vision of the first generation of worm scientists that led to these accomplishments.\\"---Catherine A.

Donne s output is tremendously varied in style and form and demonstrates his ability to exercise his rhetorical capabilities according to context and occasion. This edition aims to present the text of all his known poems, from the epigrams, songs and satires written for fellow young men about town, to the more mature verse-epistles and memorial elegies written for his patrons. The Longman Annotated English Poets series traditionally aims to present poems in chronological order; in this edition, however, the principle has been observed only within generic sections. This organisation reproduces the manner in which Donne s original readers first encountered the poems in the various manuscripts of his elegies and satires that circulated in Donne s lifetime. Volume One contains the Epigrams, Verse Letters to Friends, Love Lyrics, Love Elegies and Satires; Volume Two contains the religious poems, Wedding Celebrations, Verse Epistles to Patronesses, Commemorations, and the Anniversaries. The lyrics have been arranged alphabetically for ease of reference and because, in all but a few cases, precise date of composition is impossible to determine. Each poem has extensive editorial commentary designed to put the twenty-first century reader in possession of all that is necessary fully to appreciate Donne s work. A substantial headnote sets each poem in its historical and literary context, while the annotations give detailed guidance on the wealth of classical and religious allusions and give full representation to the literary, historical and philosophical culture out of which the poems grew. In keeping with the traditions of the series, Donne s own text has been modernised in punctuation and spelling except where to do so would alter or disrupt a rhyme","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p5i1QQAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Poems+of+John+Donne&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","description":"As the ten-volume Civil War Battle Series concludes, the multiple strands of the story are woven toward their resolution as the Brannon family is faced with the loss of its farm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tw9KAAAACAAJ&dq=Appomattox+(The+Civil+War+Battle+Series,+Book+10)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet me at Midnight","description":"Teens waging a war of practical jokes declare peace when they fall for one another in this charming YA romantic comedy from Jessica Pennington.

America s black market is much larger than we realize, and it affects us all deeply, whether or not we smoke pot, rent a risqu  video, or pay our kids  nannies in cash.

It's difficult to score there because the defending team can concentrate its efforts. Likewise, the offensive team has less area in which to maneuver. It takes the focused and precise execution of all players doing their assigned tasks to advance the ball in the Red Zone and score. In business and in every other area of life, we encounter many Red Zones-situations where the pressure is on and our \\"wiggle room\\" is limited. It's there where we have to draw on preparation, experience, and strength of character if we hope to reach our objective.

More and more of us travel across city, county, even state borders every morning on our way to work. Our television, radio, and print media rely on a regional marketplace. Our businesses, large and small, depend on suppliers, workers, and customers who rarely reside in a single jurisdiction. The parks, riverfronts, stadiums, and museums we visit draw from, and provide an identity to, an area much larger than a single city. The fumes, gases, chemicals, and run-off that pollute our air and water have no regard for municipal boundaries. This book lays out a variety of opinions on regionalism, its history and its future. While the essays do not comprise a debate, pro and con, about regionalism, they do provide a wide array of perspectives, based on the authors' diverse backgrounds and experience. Some contributors have made close academic studies of how regional action occurs, in various states like Minnesota, California, and Oregon; others give an historical account of a particular region like that surrounding New York City; and yet others point out aspects of regionalism--race, especially-- that should not be ignored. Why did past efforts at regional collaboration fall apart? What did regionalist efforts of decades ago leave undone, and what new goals should regionalists set? Without an understanding of these questions, policymakers and advocates may find themselves \\"reinventing the region.\\" This book provides an important understanding of how regionalism has played out in the past, how policies shape places, and the possibilities and limits of regional action.

Katz, director of the Brookings Institution Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, was formerly chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MbIDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can't Take It With You: A Play","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ko2stQEACAAJ&dq=You+Can%27t+Take+It+With+You:+A+Play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light Muffins: Over 60 Recipes for Sweet and Savory Low-Fat Muffins and Spreads (Low-Fat Kitchen)","description":"Gathers low fat recipes for breakfast, snack, savory, and dessert muffins, as well as spreads","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nBTfw9jaxXMC&dq=Light+Muffins:+Over+60+Recipes+for+Sweet+and+Savory+Low-Fat+Muffins+and+Spreads+(Low-Fat+Kitchen)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Friends' Beliefs: A Young Reader's Guide to World Religions","description":"Do you wonder what goes on inside a church, a temple, or a mosque?

It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion.

She knows her mother was set up by Jonathon Gable, the head of both the powerful Gable family and an international banking corporation. Now she s determined to take him down from the inside. Bell needs access to the Gable home and offices, so she poses as a bartender to seduce her way into the bed and life of Jonathon s rebellious youngest son, Lander. He s not a typical Gable, spending more time in the dive bars of Harlem than the posh cocktail lounges of the Upper East Side. He has an attraction to danger, a vulnerability Bell isn t shy about exploiting. It should be easy to uncover the secrets she needs to destroy his family and clear her mother s name. But it turns out Lander is much more complicated than she ever imagined. He s enticing, intelligent, mysterious plus their sexual chemistry is off the charts. Even though Bell knows he s the enemy, she can t help but be moved, both physically and emotionally, by the man she swore was just a target. When he finds out the truth she s sure both their hearts and her plan will be crushed...until she begins to realize that Lander might be hiding his own secrets, darker than she ever imagined.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xF0oAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las Vegas- Your Way","description":"Las Vegas!

For London s Chief Inspector Reg Wexford, it wasn t an official call. He was just being neighborly when he agreed to talk to Joy Williams about her missing husband, Rodney. Apparently, he went to Ipswich on business and never came home. Wexford has an idea what happened: He most likely ran off with one of his girlfriends. However, there are a few nagging concerns, like Rodney s suspicious letter of resignation and his abandoned car. And is it just a fluke that his disappearance coincides with a rash of stabbings all straight through the heart, all with male victims. Wexford s detective instincts must take flight in order to bring down a murderer. Or two. Or three. Because, behind the seemingly placid domesticity of his Sussex neighbors, there is a growing web of tangling secrets, double lives, and triple-crosses.  Rendell, winner of the Mystery Writers of America s prestigious Edgar Award, is regarded as one of the top mystery writers working today. With An Unkindness of Ravens, she shows, once again, that reputation is well-deserved  (Los Angeles Times).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PmRaRUYoMLkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All There Is to Know: Readings from the Illustrious 11th Edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fhUtoyM6wN4C&dq=All+There+Is+to+Know:+Readings+from+the+Illustrious+11th+Edition+of+the+Encyclopedia+Britannica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Problem of a Chinese Aesthetic (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","description":"The Problem of a Chinese Aesthetic calls for and applies a new model of comparative literature - one that, instead of taking for granted the commensurability of traditions and texts, gives incompatibility and contradiction their due.

It welcomes everyone, especially sinners, and is one of the most tolerant and accepting denominations you can imagine. Straight/gay, young/old, pro-life/pro-choice. Some believe in reincarnation and ascended masters. Others come for the mysticism and healing liturgies, while many attend because of the stately beauty of the Liberal Catholic liturgy. The amazing thing is that the Liberal Rite works for all of them. The archbishop introduces you to the major concepts of the Rite, from the simple to the esoteric.

ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EXH2BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Underground Clinical Vignettes: Biochemistry: Classic Clinical Cases for USMLE Step 1 Review","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEZlPgAACAAJ&dq=Underground+Clinical+Vignettes:+Biochemistry:+Classic+Clinical+Cases+for+USMLE+Step+1+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cookbook of Foods From Bible Days,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r7SSpwAACAAJ&dq=Cookbook+of+Foods+From+Bible+Days,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Crazy: the Radical Therapy of R.

Few lessons are as prevalent in military history as is the adage that tanks don t perform well in cities. The notion of deliberately committing tanks to urban combat is anathema to most. In Breaking the Mold: Tanks in the Cities, Mr. Ken Gott disproves that notion with a timely series of five case studies from World War II to the present war in Iraq. This is not a parochial or triumphant study. These cases demonstrate that tanks must do more than merely  arrive  on the battlefield to be successful in urban combat. From Aachen in 1944 to Fallujah in 2004, the absolute need for specialized training and the use of combined arms at the lowest tactical levels are two of the most salient lessons that emerge from this study. When properly employed, well-trained and well-supported units led by tanks are decisive in urban combat. The reverse is also true. Chechen rebels taught the Russian army and the world a brutal lesson in Grozny about what happens when armored units are poorly led, poorly trained, and cavalierly employed in a city. The case studies in this monograph are high-intensity battles in conflicts ranging from limited interventions to major combat operations. It would be wrong to use them to argue for the use of tanks in every urban situation. As the intensity of the operation decreases, the second and third order effects of using tanks in cities can begin to outweigh their utility. The damage to infrastructure caused by their sheer weight and size is just one example of what can make tanks unsuitable for every mission. Even during peace operations, however, the ability to employ tanks and other heavy armored vehicles quickly can be crucial. A study on the utility of tanks in peace operations is warranted, and planned.- Timothy R.

It focuses on the emergence, amidst the decay of medieval culture, of \\"the mixed life,\\" this reconciliation of action and contemplation, as the essential link between Catholic spirituality and Protestantism. The transmission of this work to lay persons seeking the interior dimensions of their lives without withdrawing from the world is presented. The hitherto monastic spiritual exercises for strengthening attention are discussed in depth. The traditional and vital Christian knowledge of the human condition, which the Brothers and Sisters verified for themselves, is emphasized, especially the crucial significance of the force of attention in the recollection of oneself and God. The importance of strengthening attentive awareness is everywhere alluded to in the sources, but virtually ignored in current accounts of the Christian heritage. The book traces a transmission of spiritual exercises supported by a strongpsychological base that is strangely familiar to the climate of today's search for meaning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=97oCE2MufY4C&dq=The+Brotherhood+of+the+Common+Life+and+Its+Influence+(SUNY+Series+in+Western+Esoteric+Traditions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Restructuring of American Religion","description":"A study of developments in modern American religion examines the interaction between religion and politics that has occurred in the years since World War II, the polarization of religious dogma, and the rise of special interest groups","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2QoFEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Restructuring+of+American+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect 10: Writing and Producing the 10-Minute Play","description":"A More Perfect Ten is a revision of Gary Garrison's pioneering book on writing and producing the 10-minute play, and it is now the most authoritative book on this emerging play form.

In Love for Sale, David Hajdu one of the most respected critics and music historians of our time draws on a lifetime of listening, playing, and writing about music to show how pop has done much more than peddle fantasies of love and sex to teenagers. From vaudeville singer Eva Tanguay, the  I Don t Care Girl  who upended Victorian conceptions of feminine propriety to become one of the biggest stars of her day to the scandal of Blondie playing disco at CBGB, Hajdu presents an incisive and idiosyncratic history of a form that has repeatedly upset social and cultural expectations. Exhaustively researched and rich with fresh insights, Love for Sale is unbound by the usual tropes of pop music history. Hajdu, for instance, gives a star turn to Bessie Smith and the  blues queens  of the 1920s, who brought wildly transgressive sexuality to American audience decades before rock and roll. And there is Jimmie Rodgers, a former blackface minstrel performer, who created country music from the songs of rural white and blacks . . . entwined with the sound of the Swiss yodel. And then there are today s practitioners of Electronic Dance Music, who Hajdu celebrates for carrying the pop revolution to heretofore unimaginable frontiers. At every turn, Hajdu surprises and challenges readers to think about our most familiar art in unexpected ways. Masterly and impassioned, authoritative and at times deeply personal, Love for Sale is a book of critical history informed by its writer's own unique history as a besotted fan and lifelong student of pop.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1L_VCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bryan Kest: Spinal Strengthening (CD & Booklet)","description":"Here is a book for finding your way as a warrior and adapting to a peaceful life at home.

During the many decades of the author s clinical psychiatric practice, the primary aim was to seek the most effective ways to relieve human suffering in all of its many forms. The inner mechanism of surrender was found to be of great practical benefit and is described in this book. Dr Hawkins s previous books focused on advanced states of awareness and Enlightenment. Over the years, thousands of students had asked for a practical technique by which to remove the inner blocks to happiness, love, joy, success, health and, ultimately, Enlightenment. This book provides a mechanism for letting go of those blocks. The mechanism of surrender that Dr Hawkins describes can be done in the midst of everyday life. The book is equally useful for all dimensions of human life: physical health, creativity, financial success, emotional healing, vocational fulfillment, relationships, sexuality and spiritual growth. It is an invaluable resource for all professionals who work in the areas of mental health, psychology, medicine, self-help, addiction recovery and spiritual development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n1_6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Letting+Go&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heavenly Balkans (Argonne House Press chapbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dld-AAAACAAJ&dq=Heavenly+Balkans+(Argonne+House+Press+chapbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roy Gardner: My Story - Hellcatraz","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W-2EGwAACAAJ&dq=Roy+Gardner:+My+Story+-+Hellcatraz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Dictionary of Criminal Justice: Key Terms and Major Court Cases","description":"Combines a dictionary of key legal terms with an index of leading United States Supreme Court cases indexed by type of case, such as death penalty, right to counsel, and searches and seizures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5_jF7YIPzYC&dq=The+American+Dictionary+of+Criminal+Justice:+Key+Terms+and+Major+Court+Cases&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k_ICEjM0r0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry","description":"In this national bestseller based on Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health research, Dr. Willett explains why the USDA guidelines--the famous food pyramid--are not only wrong but also dangerous.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ukk1DwAAQBAJ&dq=Eat,+Drink,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Rhetorical Discourse, Third Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fSErAQAAIAAJ&dq=American+Rhetorical+Discourse,+Third+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At Home with God : Here and Now (Searching for Wisdom in the Bible)","description":"From biblical times through the Middle Ages and the Reformation, the Christian religion enjoyed a sturdy belief in God, consistent with human knowledge of the universe. But modern science then introduced a new picture of this world, at odds not only with the old world picture but with the miracle-working God of ancient Scripture. Of the many different responses to this conflict, three stand out: i) To deny the religious view of God and the world; or ii) To deny many solid findings of generations of scientists concerning the evolution of stars, the Earth, and life; or iii) To deny little, yet to affirm little in religion to repeat ancient rituals without serious conviction. Lee Adams Young, a physicist and Bible scholar, claims to replace this chaos with an orderly view of God and the world in only 437 pages! He makes three main points: 1. The Bible consistently but falsely split the world into two separate realms: Heaven and Earth. God rarely or never left his celestial throne room to visit the Earth. The steeples of traditional churches pointed toward this Sky God, and the Lord's Prayer still speaks of a Father in Heaven. The result has been a disconnect between God and the believer a chasm bridged only by armies of angels and other intermediaries, or via long-distance calls. The solution, according to At Home with God: Here and Now, is to proclaim (as does science) that there is only one realm of reality. God should be seen as dwelling in this world, says Young indeed, within each of us, available for direct communication and personal support. Prayer should take the form of face-to-face communication with a person no farther away than the other end of a park bench. 2. The Bible consistently and correctly insists upon the inseparability of the human body and soul. So does Aristotle, and the latest Catholic Catechism. Alas, in postbiblical times many Jews and Christians have come to believe that at death the human soul could detach itself from the body and ascend to Heaven. Young responds as follows: a. If there is no Heaven, the latter step has no meaning. We are face to face with God now in this life. Because we already live in a sacred world, one need not die in order to reach the divine. b. The notion of a soul that can function independently of bodily support goes against ancient and modern awareness of the influence of bodily conditions on thinking and memory. c. Near-death experiences (NDEs) are reports from the living, not from those who died. Medical research shows that NDEs are triggered, not by the objective peril of death, but by the subjective fear of death. d. Human faith in an afterlife can blunt the human need to put interpersonal relationships in order in this life. We must mend our personal fences now there is no second chance, as the Hebrew Bible says. 3. The God depicted in Young's book is entirely consistent with modern science. That God is seen as the essential governor of nature, whose regularities people depend on and science describes. This book is recommended to all who seek a religious faith based on reality, not makebelieve; a faith grounded in ancient wisdom yet believable in this modern age.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZID2qMN2esEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","description":"Little Women with a twist: four sisters from a blended family experience the challenges and triumphs of life in NYC in this beautiful full-color graphic novel perfect for fans of Roller Girl and Smile.

Rather than concentrating on geographic or chronological categories, however, the authors have arranged their subject matter thematically in order to focus on the basic needs common to all human communities. The book is divided into five major sections, each of which deals with vernacular as well as monumental structures. These five topics are discussed in terms of particular architectural solutions, comparing and contrasting geographically separated buildings and construction traditions. For example, the issue of architectural meaning is studied through symbolic gardens in China, verbal ornament in the Islamic world, and the wall paintings of Ndebele women of southeast Africa. Theoretical issues related to particular building traditions are illuminated by these juxtapositions. Traditions in Architecture begins with an investigation into the ways in which the continuity of traditional forms is maintained. Next, the authors explore practical issues such as housing and food structures, climate and ecology, building materials, and architectural forms and methods. Architectural goals and purposes, which determine what is built, vary from culture to culture and are given special attention. Planning and design -- ways in which space is used in patterns of organization -- constitute a discussion ranging from urban plans to landscaped settings. The text concludes with an examination of cultural values, investigating the interaction between architecture and social relations, traditional theories, decision-making, and the economics of building.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iJeTswEACAAJ&dq=Traditions+in+Architecture:+Africa,+America,+Asia,+and+Oceania&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucia Rising","description":"Three of Benson's Lucia stories. \\"Queen Lucia\\" was published in 1920, \\"Miss Mapp\\" in 1922 and \\"Lucia in London\\" in 1927.

A mathematically rich cognitive theory, he claims, could solve the most difficult problems that any environment could present, eliminating the need for dualism by eliminating the need for a reflex theory. Such a mathematically rigorous description of the neural processes that connect sensation and action, he explains, will have its roots in microeconomic theory. Economic theory allows physiologists to define both the optimal course of action that an animal might select and a mathematical route by which that optimal solution can be derived. Glimcher outlines what an economics-based cognitive model might look like and how one would begin to test it empirically. Along the way, he presents a fascinating history of neuroscience. He also discusses related questions about determinism, free will, and the stochastic nature of complex behavior.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-ozEAAAQBAJ&dq=Decisions,+Uncertainty,+and+the+Brain:+The+Science+of+Neuroeconomics+(Bradford+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Airport","description":"Chicago-O'Hare, DFW, LAX, New YorkLa Guardia. Across the country, Americans take for granted the convenience of air flight from one city to another. The federal role in managing air traffic and the cooperative corporate planning of major airlines mask to some degree the fact that those airports are not jointly owned or managed, but rather are local public responsibilities. In this unique history of the places travelers in cities across America call \\"the\\" airport, Janet R. Daly Bednarek traces the evolving relationship between cities and their airports during the crucial formative years of 191847. She highlights the early history of experimentation and innovation in the development of municipal airports and identifies the factors including pressure from the U.S. Post Office and the military, neither of which had the independent resources to develop a network of terminals that made American cities responsible for their own air access. She shows how boosterism accelerated the trend toward local construction and ownership of the fields. In the later years of the period, Bednarek shows, cities found they could not shoulder the whole burden of airport construction, maintenance, and improvement. As part of a general trend during the 1930s toward a strong, direct relationship between cities and the federal government, cities began to lobby for federal aid for their airports, a demand that was eventually met when World War II increased the federal stakes in their functioning. Along with this complex local-federal relationship, Bednarek considers the role of the courts and of city planning in the development of municipal airfields. Drawing on several brief case studies, she looks at the social aspects of airports and analyzes how urban development resulted in a variety of airport arrangements. Little published work has been available on this topic. Now, with Bednarek's insightful and thorough treatment and broad view of the subject, those interested in the patterns of American air travel will have new understanding and those concerned with urban development will recognize an additional dimension.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q7YIp8f69rMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flxible Transit Buses: 1953-1995 Photo Archive","description":"Flxible has been manufacturing buses since 1924 and was one of GM's top competitors when it came to bus manufacturing.

Not long ago, people believed girls shouldn t play sports. That math and science courses were too difficult for them. That higher education should be left to the men. Nowadays, this may be hard to imagine, but it was only fifty years ago all of this changed with the introduction of the historical civil rights bill Title IX. This is the story about the determined lawmakers, teachers, parents, and athletes that advocated for women all over the country until Congress passed the law that paved the way for the now millions of girls who play sports; who make up over half of the country s medical and law students; who are on the national stage winning gold medals and world championships; who are developing life-changing vaccines, holding court as Supreme Court Justices, and leading the country as vice president. All because of Title IX and the people who believed girls could do anything and were willing to fight to prove it.

Someone steps up to the pulpit while others fan out through the auditorium with small envelopes. Most of those envelopes are inscribed with \\"God loves a cheerful giver.\\" There are blanks to write in name, address, date, and, of course, the amount of cash or check that will be inserted. Typically, almost all of those envelopes have a place indicating \\"Tithe\\"________, \\"Offering\\"________, \\"Children's ministry\\"____, \\"Sunday School\\"________, \\"Other\\"_______. The Faithful dutifully contribute their part in this play, passing the filled envelopes to the attendants who whisk them all away to a private office. Meanwhile, a speaker is usually expounding to the congregation why they should contribute, affirming the reasoning directly from the Bible. This is done sometimes with personal testimony and sometimes with an implied threat that if they do not cooperate, they are robbing God. Sometimes they will speak passionately of tithing to the church as an expression of thanks to God and act of worship. Tithing is a long held tradition. Most Christians are too busy to question and search out religious practices for themselves. No one wants to spend the extra effort, time, and study, to pray and seek a higher truth. It is much easier to trust tradition or to merely study an issue, only as far as a denomination or pastor teaches. We have been carefully conditioned not to challenge convention. Sometimes God Himself will challenge us to put aside what others say and teach to delve deeper into a subject in order to find the hidden manna of God's Word. TheTithe That Binds is the fruit of one of those challenges. If you have the courage to read this, you may never see tithing in the same way again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vghkPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Tithe+That+Binds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Book of Prayer","description":"Author Stormie Omartian has inspired millions toward a deeper faith and prayer life through her bestselling books (more than 10 million copies in print) including the Power of a PrayingTM series.

For the first time, they are asked to think deeply, write extensively, document assertions, solve non-routine problems, apply concepts, and accept unvarnished critiques of their work. College Knowledge confronts this problem by looking at the disconnect between what high schools do and what colleges expect and proposes a solution by identifying what students need to know and be able to do in order to succeed. The book is based on an extensive three-year project sponsored by the Association of American Universities in partnership with The Pew Charitable Trusts. This landmark research identified what it takes to succeed in entry-level university courses. Based on the project's findings - and interviews with students, faculty, and staff - this groundbreaking book delineates the cognitive skills and subject area knowledge that college-bound students need to master in order to succeed in today's colleges and universities.

The daughter of the Templeton's stern Irish housekeeper, Margo had been treated like a member of the family. Deep down, she knew that money could not buy the thing she craved most her mother's acceptance. Maybe things would be different if she could be sweet like Laura or had Kate's shrewd head for business.

In the 1630s, visitors to the prosperous trading cities of the Netherlands couldn't help but notice that thousands of normally sober, hardworking Dutch citizens were caught up in an extraordinary frenzy of buying and selling. The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house. Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair. This colorful cast of characters includes Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers all centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but with one thing in common: tulipomania.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=piXqsiQ4h1QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hobo on the way to heaven","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Peanuts philosophers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SShXnQEACAAJ&dq=The+Peanuts+philosophers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Emotional Rape Syndrome: How to Survive and Avoid It","description":"We can touch the part of a person's body that gets used in sexual rape, but we can't touch what gets used in emotion rape - for example, the higher emotions of love or trust.

Even before they joined forces, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written dozens of Broadway shows, but together they pioneered a new art form: the serious musical play. Their songs and dance numbers served to advance the drama and reveal character, a sharp break from the past and the template on which all future musicals would be built. Though different in personality and often emotionally distant from each other, Rodgers and Hammerstein presented an unbroken front to the world and forged much more than a songwriting team; their partnership was also one of the most profitable and powerful entertainment businesses of their era. They were cultural powerhouses whose work came to define postwar America on stage, screen, television, and radio. But they also had their failures and flops, and more than once they feared they had lost their touch. Todd S. Purdum s portrait of these two men, their creative process, and their groundbreaking innovations will captivate lovers of musical theater, lovers of the classic American songbook, and young lovers wherever they are. He shows that what Rodgers and Hammerstein wrought was truly something wonderful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n59MDwAAQBAJ&dq=Something+Wonderful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of radio,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=41ytQwAACAAJ&dq=Elements+of+radio,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School for Scandal: How to Kiss a Hero","description":"Enrolled at Miss Treadwell's Academy for Young Ladies in order to learn the art of marrying well, the unconventional Nichola Hainesworth is delighted by the school's unorthodox curriculum, including her fencing lessons and her arrogant instructor, wounded war hero Lord Brian Boru.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appleton & Lange's Review for the Usmle, Step 1 (A & L's review series)","description":"Appleton's rich beginnings found their source at Lawrence Institute, the university in the woods, on the Fox River.

Eager to claim her long-lost heritage, she was amazed at the formal elegance of Wakefield, the sumptuous English estate of her distant cousin...the notorious Lord Jason Fielding. Sought after at plays, operas, and balls by London's most fashionable ladies, Jason remained a mystery to Victoria. Bewildered by his arrogant demeanor, yet drawn to his panther-like grace, she came to sense the searingly painful memories that smoldered in the depths of his jade-green eyes. Unable to resist her spitfire charm, Jason gathered her at last into his powerful arms, ravishing her lips with his kisses, arousing in her a sweet, insistent hunger.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST, NPR, AND KIRKUS REVIEWS A scathing portrait of an urgent new American crisis Over the last two decades, America has been falling deeper and deeper into a statistical mystery: Poverty goes up. Crime goes down. The prison population doubles. Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail. In search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime but it s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side. In The Divide, Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights. Through astonishing and enraging accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all. Praise for The Divide  Ambitious . . . deeply reported, highly compelling . . . impossible to put down.  The New York Times Book Review  These are the stories that will keep you up at night. . . . The Divide is not just a report from the new America; it is advocacy journalism at its finest.  Los Angeles Times  Taibbi is a relentless investigative reporter. He takes readers inside not only investment banks, hedge funds and the blood sport of short-sellers, but into the lives of the needy, minorities, street drifters and illegal immigrants. . . . The Divide is an important book. Its documentation is powerful and shocking.  The Washington Post  Captivating . . . The Divide enshrines its author s position as one of the most important voices in contemporary American journalism.  The Independent (UK)  Taibbi [is] perhaps the greatest reporter on Wall Street s crimes in the modern era.

An inspiration to many of the revolutionary generation, Shariati's combination of Islamic political thought and Left-leaning ideology continues to influence both in Iran and across the wider Muslim world. In this book, Siavash Saffari examines Shariati's long-standing legacy, and how new readings of his works by contemporary 'neo-Shariatis' have contributed to a deconstruction of the false binaries of Islam/modernity, Islam/West, and East/West. Saffari argues that through their critique of Eurocentric metanarratives on the one hand, and the essentialist conceptions of Islam on the other, Shariati and neo-Shariatis have carved out a new space in Islamic thought beyond the traps of Orientalism and Occidentalism. This unique perspective will hold great appeal to researchers of the politics and intellectual thought of post-revolutionary Iran and the greater Middle East.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9IQ7DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Oxford Thesaurus","description":"Offers the accurate coverage of essential vocabulary for all your writing needs.

These authors are mixedbloods who, in their writing, try to come to terms with the marginalization both of mixed-bloods and fullbloods and of their cultures in American society. Their novels are complex and sophisticated narratives of cultural survival - and survival guides for fullbloods and mixedbloods in modern America. Rejecting the stereotypes and cliches long attached to the word Indian, they appropriate and adapt the colonizers language, English, to describe the Indian experience. These novels embody the American Indian point of view; the non-Indian is required to assume the role of \\"other\\". In his analysis Owens draws on a broad range of literary theory: myth and folklore, structuralism, modernism, poststructuralism, and, particularly, postmodernism. At the same time he argues that although recent American Indian fiction incorporates a number of significant elements often identified with postmodern writing, it contradicts the primary impulse of postmodernism. That is, instead of celebrating fragmentation, ephemerality, and chaos, these authors insistupon a cultural center that is intact and recoverable, upon immutable values and ecological truths. Other Destinies provides a new critical approach to novels by American Indians. It also offers a comprehensive introduction to the novels, helping teachers bring this important fiction to the classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xoXLVM0MiQYC&dq=Other+Destinies:+Understanding+the+American+Indian+Novel+(American+Indian+Literature+and+Critical+Studies+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lily's In London?! (Young Women of Faith, Lily 13)","description":"In Religious Experience and the New Woman, Joanna Dean traces the development of liberal spirituality in the early 20th century through the life and work of Lily Dougall (1858--1923), a New Woman novelist who became known as a religious essayist and Anglican modernist. Dean examines the connections between Dougall's marginal position as a woman intellectual and her experiential, combatively iconoclastic theology, and demonstrates that through her writing and mentoring, Dougall contributed to the shaping of modern spirituality. Lily Dougall described religious experience -- the sense of the presence of God -- as the \\"rock\\" of her theology. Dean observes the protean nature of this rock as Dougall moved from a submissive holiness faith, to a mystical Mauricean sense of the Kingdom of God, to the relational theology of personal idealism, and reveals how psychology, which appeared to provide scientific support for her religious beliefs, eventually threatened to undermine her experiential faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FT-Ip8twb2sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"P-40 Warhawk Pilot's Flight Operating Manual","description":"Flown by the American Volunteer Group in China known as the \\"Flying Tigers,\\" the P-40 Warhawk earned a reputation for its toughness in combat.

No watchdog groups rank therapists for potential consumers; no one school of thought has proven to be superior to another. And no method has emerged for determining what makes therapy successful for some but not for others. Doing Psychotherapy Effectively proposes much-needed answers to the puzzling questions of what therapists actually do when they are effective. Mona Sue Weissmark and Daniel A. Giacomo offer a unique mode of evaluation that focuses not on a particular school of therapy but on the relationship between therapist and patient. Their approach, the \\"Harvard Psychotherapy Coding Method,\\" begins with the assumption that good therapeutic relationships are far from intuitive. Successful relationships follow a pattern of behaviors that can be identified and quantified, as the authors demonstrate through clinical research and videotaped sessions of expert therapists. Likewise, positive changes in the patient, observed through client feedback and case studies, can be described operationally; they involve the process of overcoming feelings of detachment, helplessness, and rigidity and becoming more involved, effective, and adaptable. Weissmark and Giacomo explain and ground these principles in the practice of psychotherapy, making Doing Psychotherapy Effectively an accessible and pragmatic work which will give readers a tool for measuring therapeutic effectiveness and further understanding human transformation. For the first time, successful therapy is described in a way that can be practiced and communicated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W_FCuBwUsP8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeares Son in Law John Hall Man &","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vjCHtgAACAAJ&dq=Shakespeares+Son+in+Law+John+Hall+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jade treasures of the Maori","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8sHLswEACAAJ&dq=Jade+treasures+of+the+Maori&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society","description":"Only a few books stand as landmarks in social and scientific upheaval.

Originally published in 2001, Thunder and Light is the second volume in Marie-Claire Blais s prize-winning Soifs series, hailed as one of the greatest undertakings in modern Quebec fiction. Powered by its characters  gripping exploration of the world s dark corners, the novel is a teeming microcosm in which boundaries collapse and the extremes and contradictions that animate our times are reconciled. Blais locks us directly into the consciousness of her characters, many of whom we met in her previous novel, These Festive Nights, and many that she derives from actual news stories: Jessica, a seven-year-old attempting to beat the world record as the youngest pilot to cross the continent; Nathana?l, a teenager on death row for killing his favourite teacher; Our Lady of the Bags, a modern-day Joan of Arc who lives among Manhattan s skyscrapers and follows the voices in her head; and Caroline and Jean-Mathieu, aging artists who are fighting to come together again. One character s thoughts or actions have consequences for another 3,000 miles away who is a complete stranger to the first. This is an intricate house of cards, delicately but expertly constructed, that shocks us in its perversity and familiarity, ultimately finding hope and redemption in the most human and basic forms of art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=66-aDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom","description":"Sixty-five million years ago, a comet or asteroid larger than Mount Everest slammed into the Earth, inducing an explosion equivalent to the detonation of a hundred million hydrogen bombs. Vaporized detritus blasted through the atmosphere upon impact, falling back to Earth around the globe. Disastrous environmental consequences ensued: a giant tsunami, continent-scale wildfires, darkness, and cold, followed by sweltering greenhouse heat. When conditions returned to normal, half the plant and animal genera on Earth had perished. This horrific chain of events is now widely accepted as the solution to a great scientific mystery: what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs? Walter Alvarez, one of the Berkeley scientists who discovered evidence of the impact, tells the story behind the development of the initially controversial theory. It is a saga of high adventure in remote locations, of arduous data collection and intellectual struggle, of long periods of frustration ended by sudden breakthroughs, of friendships made and lost, and of the exhilaration of discovery that forever altered our understanding of Earth's geological history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N26YDwAAQBAJ&dq=T.+Rex+and+the+Crater+of+Doom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Me Illustrate: More Than 400 Stories, Anecdotes, and Illustrations","description":"Any Christian speaker would benefit from a copy of 'Let Me Illustrate' in their library.

With these goals in mind and with more than three decades of experience, Bennett presents strategies that have consistently proven effective for the broadest possible range of students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rRfuAAAAMAAJ&dq=Secondary+Stages:+Revitalizing+High+School+Theatre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deng Xiaoping and the Cultural Revolution","description":"The daughter of the former Chinese leader describes his life and political career, emphasizing the story of the Cultural Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E-6U-xoh7OIC&dq=Deng+Xiaoping+and+the+Cultural+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Broken Lands (Empire of the East, Bk. 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The VOICES OF ROBBY WILDE","description":"An engrossing, often disturbing, look into the inner life of a paranoid schizophrenic, The Voices of Robby Wilde has greatly advanced the popular understanding of mental illness since its first publication in 1987. Robby Wilde heard his first \\"voice\\" when he was nine years old--a man's voice clearly saying, \\"I've got you!\\" With increasing frequency and intensity, such hostile uttering would vex Wilde for the rest of his life, distorting his behavior and shattering his self-esteem. Some ten years before his death at age fifty-three, Wilde asked his friend Elizabeth Kytle to write about his affliction. Ranging in time from Wilde's youth in rural North Carolina to his impoverished last days in Columbus, Ohio, Kytle chronicles the slow unraveling and final breakdown of a life. Different views of Wilde, his illness, and his struggle to live and work as a \\"normal\\" person come forth in a series of twice-told tales; accounts based on Wilde's own recollections alternate with sometimes vastly differing reports of the same incidents by friends, family members, coworkers, and others who knew and cared about him. Wilde's story, heightened by his longing to be understood and his acute grasp of his own situation, will challenge readers to new levels of respect and compassion for the mentally ill.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ADb07y0YiDgC&dq=The+VOICES+OF+ROBBY+WILDE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Generation: How the Assassinations of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War","description":"The assassination of John F.

One of her books examined how women with breast cancer deal with diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Then her 17-year old daughter Lauren was diagnosed with leukemia, and the theories and paradigms of academe gave way to the real-life struggle of a mother and her daughter for healing and for the best medical treatment possible. Finding Strength details two years in the lives of these two women, from early symptoms and denial, through diagnosis and two years of treatment, to a clean bill of health. Each chapter first describes the events of a particular time and then discusses the literature on the subject, relating to their own experience what medical and sociological researchers have found. The book considers such topics as acknowledging diagnosis, remission induction, having to deal with some health professionals (doctors and nurses) who are blunt and insensitive, discovering the importance of friends and family, of food and faith. The book concludes with an epilogue by Lauren Clarke, who throughout the book has added footnotes to her mother's text where she felt the need to amplify or clarify what her mother has written. During treatment, Lauren was in her last year of high school and first year of university, and she created a magazine for teens with cancer for a creative writing course and also published several articles on living with cancer in her university newspaper. Excerpts from these, as well as some of her poetry on her illness, are included throughout the book. The book also includes an extensive bibliography and list of resources for childhood cancer. A touching personal memoir and an insightful examination of our health-care system, Finding Strength explores one family's response to personal crisis. It will be a source of hope and practical help for anyone in a similar crisis,and will provide a uniquely informed perspective on the needs of patients and their families for health care workers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h8gCAAAACAAJ&dq=FINDING+STRENGTH:+A+Mother+and+Daughter%27s+Story+of+Childhood+Cancer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rising of the Moon","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qTzpwm6NX-UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gayelord Hauser Cookbook: Good food, good health, good looks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ssqeoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Gayelord+Hauser+Cookbook:+Good+food,+good+health,+good+looks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diagnostic Cytology And Hematology Of The Dog And Cat, 2e","description":"Long-trusted in the field, Cowell & Tyler's Diagnostic Cytology and Hematology of the Dog and Cat, 5th Edition is the complete resource for helping you learn the necessary skills to diagnosis and treat dogs and cats.

This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit, the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux. Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1YESXanrgQC&dq=A+History+of+Modern+Computing+(History+of+Computing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chronology of the West river Rail Road","description":"The story of the ill-fated West River Railroad of southern Vermont (1880-1936), originally serialized in the Brattleboro Daily Reformer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ym1HrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Chronology+of+the+West+river+Rail+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to Promise (Heart of Texas)","description":"Come back again to Promise, Texas, in this classic favorite Western romance series by #1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber.

First published in 1948, and long out of print, Tomorrow Will Be Better is a heartwarming story of love and marriage from Betty Smith, the beloved author of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Set in the Williamsburg and Bushwick sections of Brooklyn in the 1920s, Tomorrow Will Be Better is the story of Margy Shannon--shy, eager, joyfully optimistic--and her search for something better from life than the hard misery of poverty in which she lives. All Margy's parents have ever known is an unrewarding life of poverty, pain, and hard work--a life that has ultimately worn them down. But Margy, young and just out of school, still holds steadfast to an unshakable hopefulness and believes a better life is possible. Her goals are simple enough--to find a husband she loves, have children, and live in a nice home--one where her children will never know the terror of want, the need to hide from quarreling parents, and the dread of unjust punishment. And when she meets Frankie Malone, she thinks at last her dreams might be fulfilled. Rich with the flavor of its Brooklyn background, and the joys and heartbreak of family life, Tomorrow Will Be Better is told with a simplicity, tenderness, and humor that only Betty Smith could write.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ujpbyAEACAAJ&dq=Tomorrow+Will+Be+Better&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Founding Mothers: Women of America in the Revolutionary Era","description":"Describes the daily lives, social roles, and contributions of women living during the Revolutionary period.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OsWBWELTZVIC&dq=Founding+Mothers:+Women+of+America+in+the+Revolutionary+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liberace; an autobiography","description":"A candid autobiography of \\"Mr. Showmanship\\" whose candelabra, glass topped piano, bejeweled wardrobe, and versatility have made him one of the world's highest-paid entertainers and the first TV matinee idol.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cWGfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Liberace%3B+an+autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something swims out","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FFmqAAAAIAAJ&dq=Something+swims+out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nixon Reconsidered","description":"A revealing look at a president and his role in history argues that Watergate and foreign policy successes overshadowed Nixon's domestic accomplishments, including reforms in welfare, civil rights, economic and environmental policy, and reorganization of federal bureaucracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h8ftAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nixon+Reconsidered&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stolen Throne","description":"The thrilling prequel to Dragon Age: Origins, the hit role-playing video game from award-winning developer BioWare!

It may be the brittle piety of a father who can never forgive his son for his illegitimacy. Or it may be the screen of bigotry that a redneck deputy has raised to blunt the awful childhood memory of the day his parents took him to watch a black man being murdered by a gleeful mob. By turns haunting, heartbreaking, and horrifying--and informed throughout by Baldwin's uncanny knowledge of the wounds racism has left in both its victims and its perpetrators--Going to Meet the Man is a major work by one of our most important writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gc1WAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trolleycars, Streetcars, Trams and Trolleys of North America: A Photographic History","description":"Trolleycars Frank Sullivan & Fred Winkowski.

Intrigued by this process of \\"intimate creativity,\\" psychologists Irving and Suzanne Sarnoff (themselves partners in love and work) decided to conduct in-depth interviews with partners in visual art because they defy the supremely individualistic tradition of their field. Whatever their age or sexual orientation, these artist-couples combine their talents to form a collective identity as a professional team. Passionately intense about their shared commitment, they communicate endlessly to resolve conflicts and reach consensus. Providing mutual validation and support, they increase their productivity and the quality of their work; they minimize their fear and frustration and enhance their pleasure in being together. The authors also draw on historical and contemporary literature about similar couples, ranging from Jean Arp and Sophie Taeuber to Gilbert and George to Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.

On January 15, 1947, passersby made a grisly discovery in a vacant lot in Los Angeles: the body of a naked young woman, cut in two, and savagely mutilated. The victim was identified as Elizabeth Short, a struggling Hollywood actress. Nicknamed the Black Dahlia by a headline-hungry press, her lurid demise sparked a desperate manhunt. But the mystery of the Black Dahlia murder remained unsolved for nearly half a century -- until now. A victim of incest and brutality from infancy, Janice Knowlton was an old hand at repressing hideous memories by age ten, when she watched her father, George Frederick Knowlton, torture, kill, and dismember Elizabeth Short in the detached garage of their California home. It was not the first of Daddy's murders Jon had witnessed, and it would not be the last -- but she had been so traumatized that it took over four decades for fragments of her memory to resurface. Aided by a family counselor specializing in child abuse, Jan experienced a nightmare flood of childhood memories -- and realized that she had witnessed her father commit up to nine savage and sadistic murders, including that of her own infant son, a child of incest. Using census records, maps, family interviews, police reports, and clippings from a dozen newspapers to document her searing memories, Janice exposes her father's thirty-year rampage of rope and murder in this astonishing survivor's testament -- and provides persuasive evidence that Los Angeles low enforcement authorities always knew the shocking truth...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2y0cogEACAAJ&dq=Daddy+Was+the+Black+Dahlia+Killer:+The+Identity+of+America%27s+Most+Notorious+Serial+Murderer--Revealed+at+Last&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherman's 21 Laws of Speaking: How to Inspire Others to Action","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y9lNAAAACAAJ&dq=Sherman%27s+21+Laws+of+Speaking:+How+to+Inspire+Others+to+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qz00AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of the silent planet (Avon)","description":"Out of the Silent Planet introduces Dr. Ransom and chronicles his abduction by a megalomaniacal physicist and his accomplice via space ship to the planet Malacandra.

Natty and trim as straight as a sapling, with few words and no gestures quite unlike those of two days, or rather nights, ago, when the cold froze them out of their blankets, and they sat around the camp-fires pounding tin cans and singing the Indian medicine song with a good Irish accent. Very funny that affair the mixture of Cheyenne and Donnybrook is a strange noise. The last stage from Custer to the railroad is thirty-five miles and a half, which we did with two relays, the latter half of it in the night. There was no escort only two orderlies and the general and I pattered along through the gloom. The clouds hung over the earth in a dense blanket, and the road was as dim as a Florentine fresco; but night nor cold nor heat can bring General Miles to a walk, and the wild charge in the dark was, as an experience, a complete thing. You cannot see; you whirl through a ca?on cut in the mud; you plough through the sage-brush and over the rocks clatter and bang. The general is certainly a grim old fellow one of the kind that make sparks fly when he strikes an obstacle. I could well believe the old Fifth Infantryman who said \\"he's put many a corn on a dough-boy's foot,\\" and it's a red-letter day for anyone else that keeps at his horse's heels. You may ride into a hole, over a precipice, to perdition, if it's your luck on this night, but is not the general in front? You follow the general that's the grand idea that is the military idea. If the United States army was strung out in line with its general ahead, and if he should ride out into the broad Atlantic and swim to sea, the whole United States army would follow along, for that's the idea, you know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0nd9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indians and Colonists at the Crossroads of Empire: The Albany Congress of 1754","description":"On the eve of the Seven Years' War in North America, the British crown convened the Albany Congress, an Anglo-Iroquois treaty conference, in response to a crisis that threatened imperial expansion. British authorities hoped to address the impending collapse of Indian trade and diplomacy in the northern colonies, a problem exacerbated by uncooperative, resistant colonial governments. In the first book on the subject in more than forty-five years, Timothy J. Shannon definitively rewrites the historical record on the Albany Congress. Challenging the received wisdom that has equated the Congress and the plan of colonial union it produced with the origins of American independence, Shannon demonstrates conclusively the Congress's importance in the wider context of Britain's eighteenth-century Atlantic empire. In the process, the author poses a formidable challenge to the Iroquois Influence Thesis. The Six Nations, he writes, had nothing to do with the drafting of the Albany Plan, which borrowed its model of constitutional union not from the Iroquois but from the colonial delegates' British cousins. Far from serving as a dress rehearsal for the Constitutional Convention, the Albany Congress marked, for colonists and Iroquois alike, a passage from an independent, commercial pattern of intercultural relations to a hierarchical, bureaucratic imperialism wielded by a distant authority.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gz-ApAxMaPIC&dq=Indians+and+Colonists+at+the+Crossroads+of+Empire:+The+Albany+Congress+of+1754&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Criminal Law and Procedure (West Legal Studies Series)","description":"The general principles of criminality and culpability, individual crimes; their elements and related issues are fully discussed.

However, another significant migration occurred during the industrial period of the nineteenth century, when many French Canadians settled in the Saginaw Valley and on the Keweenaw Peninsula two regions characteristic of Michigan s economic development in the nineteenth century. The lumber industry of the Saginaw Valley and the copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula provided very different challenges to French Canadian settlers as they tried to find ways to adapt to changing environments and industrial realities. The French Canadians of Michigan looks at the factors behind the French Canadian immigration by providing a statistical profile of the migratory movement as well as analysis of the strategies used by French Canadians to cope with and adapt to new environments. Using federal manuscript censuses, parochial archives, and government reports, Jean Lamarre closely examines who the immigrants were, the causes of their migration, their social and geographical itinerary, and the reasons they chose Michigan as their destination. Besides comparing the different settlements in the Saginaw Valley and the Keweenaw Peninsula, Lamarre also compares the Michigan French Canadians to the French Canadians who settled in New England during the same period. This book is a major contribution to the study of the French Canadian migration to the Midwest and will be valuable to researchers of both Michigan and French Canadian history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NTPXVX3xgUcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Vulmea's vengeance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_RatAEACAAJ&dq=Black+Vulmea%27s+vengeance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Side by Side: A Multicultural Reader","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-7CzAAAACAAJ&dq=Side+by+Side:+A+Multicultural+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manana en la batalla piensa en mi (Alfaguara de Bolsillo) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Most accounts of the Spanish transition to democracy have been celebratory exercises at the service of a stabilizing rather than a critical project of far-reaching reform. As one of the essays in this volume puts it, the  pact of oblivion,  which characterized the Spanish transition to democracy, curtailed any serious attempt to address the legacies of authoritarianism that the new democracy inherited from the Franco era. As a result, those legacies pervaded public discourse even in newly created organs of opinion. As another contributor argues, the Transition was based on the erasure of memory and the invention of a new political tradition. On the other hand, memory and its etiolation have been an object of reflection for a number of film directors and fiction writers, who have probed the return of the repressed under spectral conditions. Above all, this book strives to present memory as a performative exercise of democratic agents and an open field for encounters with different, possibly divergent, and necessarily fragmented recollections. The pact of the Transition could not entirely disguise the naturalization of a society made of winners and losers, nor could it ensure the consolidation of amnesia by political agents and by the tools that create hegemony by shaping opinion. Spanish society is haunted by the specters of a past it has tried to surmount by denying it. It seems unlikely that it can rid itself of its ghosts without in the process undermining the democracy it sought to legitimate through the erasure of memories and the drowning of witnesses' voices in the cacaphony of triumphant modernization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DdA7EAAAQBAJ&dq=Manana+en+la+batalla+piensa+en+mi+(Alfaguara+de+Bolsillo)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Asthma and Allergy Action Plan for Kids : A Complete Program to Help Your Child Live a Full and Active Life","description":"Statistics show that up to 40 percent of children in the United States suffer from allergies and at least 10 percent suffer from asthma.

There is the constant protectiveness from caregivers, confusing limits and rules, headaches, obesity, shortness of breath, and sleep deprivation. In some cases these side effects, such as stress and obesity, cycle back to make the original condition worse. Dr. Dozor's plan, developed over the last twenty years, is designed to empower both parents and children.

Divested of his empire, exiled to the tiny island of Elba, the ex-conqueror had no army, no money, no ships - nothing but an empty title and his unflagging ambition. But his audacity admitted no defeat. Mustering a minuscule army of a thousand men, with few supplies, he sailed for France and set into motion the events that over the next one hundred days would propel a beleaguered Europe once again into total war, ending with the catastrophic battle of Waterloo, the routing of his Grand Army, and his second - and final - exile. In One Hundred Days, Alan Schom shows us, in his lively, immediate narrative style, the inevitability of Napoleon's return from exile and his doomed bid for power. Landing unopposed on French soil, the emperor and his skeleton force began their march through a hostile countryside impoverished by years of war, famine, and conscription. Yet the charismatic leader managed to attract men and support: by the time they reached Paris with a force of 20,000, the Bourbon king Louis XVIII had abandoned the city, and Napoleon was greeted with parades and the shouts of citizens eager to align themselves with the stronger power. But war already loomed over his return. The Duke of Wellington and his Grand Allied Army, astonished and alarmed by Napoleon's rise from the ashes of exile, were already on the march and determined to quench him once and for all. The two armies met at Waterloo to fight the bitter three-day contest that would mark the end of Napoleon. Alan Schom's One Hundred Days is a detailed chronicle of the events that led up to the final fall of Napoleon, and a complex and vivid portrait of the personalities that surrounded him: the icily charming and self-serving Talleyrand; the brutal, fickle police minister Fouche, who helped form the first modern police state; the brave but vacillating Ney; the dogged Davout, the emperor's scapegoat; and Napoleon's underestimated foes, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and the aging yet pugnacious Marshal Blucher. Meticulously reconstructed from diaries, memoirs, and correspondence, a host of lesser characters spring to vivid life, populating the grandiloquent stage of the Napoleonic empire. More than an account of a watershed event in the evolution of modern Europe, One Hundred Days is a chronicle of an age, replete with intrigue, drama, and consequence. Believing that the epic of history is incomplete without providing the elementary human perspective responsible for shaping it, Alan Schom unveils a story rich in intimate detail: history with a human face and voice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uNpnAAAAMAAJ&dq=One+Hundred+Days:+Napoleon%27s+Road+to+Waterloo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The biology of dragonflies: (Odonata or Paraneuroptera) (Cambridge zoological series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N3YeAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Cook Everything : Vegetarian Cooking","description":"The ultimate one-stop vegetarian cookbook-from the author of the classic How to Cook Everything Hailed as \\"a more hip Joy of Cooking\\" by the Washington Post, Mark Bittman's award-winning book How to Cook Everything has become the bible for a new generation of home cooks, and the series has more than 1 million copies in print.

The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it \\"the greatest book of the sea ever written.\\" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: \\"Unforgettable phrases abound.\\" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael,\\" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9lNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The insurrection in Mesopotamia, 1920,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wGugAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit (Grove Press Poetry)","description":" A strutting, dazzling, exhilarating  collection of poems by the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Awardwinning author of The Cloud Corporation (The Village Voice). In his critically acclaimed debut collection, Timothy Donnelly pairs an extraordinary gift for rhetorical exuberance with a stunning formal mastery. The title poem conjures an imaginary play, populated by objects, that forms an allegorical rendering of a single lifetime. In  Accidental Species,  he puts forth a remarkable statement about his own efforts as a poet, a humorous ars poetica by way of a heartbreaking lover s complaint. For its thoughtfulness, range, and sheer energy, Twenty-Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit is a remarkable work from one of our most original young poets.

In the spring of 1999, the world watched as more than 800,000 Kosovo Albanians poured over Kosovo's borders, bringing with them stories of torture, rape, and massacre. One year later, Paula Huntley's husband signed on with the American Bar Association to help build a modern legal system in this broken country, and she reluctantly agreed to accompany him. Deeply uncertain as to how she might be of any service in a country that had seen such violence and hatred, Huntley found a position teaching English as a Second Language to a group of Kosovo Albanians in Prishtina. A war story, a teacher's story, but most of all a story of hope, The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is the journal Hunt-ley kept in scattered notebooks or on her laptop over the eight months that she lived and worked in Kosovo. When Huntley asked her students if they would like to form an American-style \\"book club,\\" they jumped at the idea. After stumbling upon a stray English-language copy of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, Huntley proposed it as the club's first selection. The simple fable touched all the students deeply, and the club rapidly became a forum in which they could discuss both the terrors of their past and their dreams for the future. The Hemingway Book Club of Kosovo is a compelling tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3JjoecurEW4C&dq=The+Hemingway+Book+Club+of+Kosovo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titans' Daughter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dpYsAAAACAAJ&dq=Titans%27+Daughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ministry in nursing homes: Mission action resource (Witness/ministry resources)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=61oOHAAACAAJ&dq=Ministry+in+nursing+homes:+Mission+action+resource+(Witness/ministry+resources)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RNA Methodologies, Third Edition: A Laboratory Guide for Isolation and Characterization","description":"This laboratory guide represents a growing collection of tried, tested and optimized laboratory protocols for the isolation and characterization of eukaryotic RNA, with lesser emphasis on the characterization of prokaryotic transcripts.

Endlessly resourceful and dazzlingly innovatory, Purcell's music instantly evokes the energy and confidence of Restoration England. The age of Pepys and Dryden--of elegance, wit, and boundless creativity--gave birth to an audacious new theatre and, in Purcell's operas, to a new musical form. It was also an age of violence and suspicion. In the decade before Purcell's birth the people had executed their king. Treason was no longer unthinkable. Popish plots, coup attempts, invasion scares, international double-dealing... England seethed with conspiracies, real and imagined. Purcell, court musician to three reigns, was forced to tread a delicate path between the opposing factions. A working musician, Purcell was organist and harpsichordist as well as composer; tuner and repairer as well as performer. He also wrote music for every conceivable occasion: for the Church and for the theatre, for the chamber and for the great occasions of State. Purcell moved easily through the echelons of London society: from the quiet of the chapel royal to the raucous taverns. King and courtiers, actresses and innkeepers, tradesmen and artist... Purcell knew all the characters that comprised the constant flux of London life. Maureen Duffy, unsurpassed in her treatment of the modern capital city, now captures the sights, sounds and the flavour of a very different London. New documentary evidence, gleaned from a scrupulous investigation of original documents and sources, together with a novelist's instincts have enabled her to create the most vivid and illuminating portrait yet of England's greatest--and most elusive--composer.\\" --Dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RFEZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Henry+Purcell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family Book of Bible Fun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=czd6TWzgVkEC&dq=The+Family+Book+of+Bible+Fun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studio Structured User-Interface Design for Interaction Optimisation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pcg2zwEACAAJ&dq=Studio+Structured+User-Interface+Design+for+Interaction+Optimisation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Long Stay in a Distant Land","description":"The Lums are cursed.

E. Called the \\"religious revolutionary,\\" he is the earliest known creator of a new religion. The cult he founded broke with Egypt's traditional polytheism and focused its worship on a single deity, the sun god Aten. Erik Hornung, one of the world's preeminent Egyptologists, here offers a concise and accessible account of Akhenaten and his religion of light. Hornung begins with a discussion of the nineteenth-century scholars who laid the foundation for our knowledge of Akhenaten's period and extends to the most recent archaeological finds. He emphasizes that Akhenaten's monotheistic theology represented the first attempt in history to explain the entire natural and human world on the basis of a single principle. \\"Akhenaten made light the absolute reference point,\\" Hornung writes, \\"and it is astonishing how clearly and consistently he pursued this concept.\\" Hornung also addresses such topics as the origins of the new religion; pro-found changes in beliefs regarding the afterlife; and the new Egyptian capital at Akhetaten which was devoted to the service of Aten, his prophet Akhenaten, and the latter's family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XwUiuI79nUEC&dq=Akhenaten+and+the+Religion+of+Light&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tilly and the Rhinoceros","description":"By her sweet and caring ways, Tilly the goose turns a grumpy rhinoceros who threatens the economic life of the village into a delightful, helpful friend to all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K9cWAQAAMAAJ&dq=Tilly+and+the+Rhinoceros&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saemtliche Werke: Kritische Studienausgabe (15 Volumes) (German Edition)","description":"A Companion to Nietzsche provides a comprehensive guide to all the main aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy, profiling the most recent research and trends in scholarship.

Later, when their dad begins dating again, the sisters decide to make sure he's dating someone who is right for them too. When dad does meet that someone, Olivia & Maria are happy. Then dad announces his plan to remarry. Now the girls must cope with the experience of having a stepmother. Will she be like the wicked stepmother in the story, Cinderella? As one who has experienced the role of stepmother twice, I can assure you that it is a role one must give careful consideration. You are not only making a commitment to your partner, but also to his children. As a stepmother, I had always searched unsuccessfully for a children's book depicting stepmothers in a positive way. Something to erase the indelible image of the \\"wicked\\" stepmother in the story Cinderella. I wanted them to have confirmation that not ALL stepmothers are mean & indifferent. Much to my dismay, I was never able to present them with anything tangible. And so, these frightened children were left to battle the situation with very little reassurance of a positive outcome. Finally, I decided to put teaching on the back burner & do something about this dilemma. I would write a children's book on a subject I knew something about & felt that children, divorced singles with children & stepparents desperately needed. My hope is that those who read \\"The Not No Wicked Stepmother\\" will come away with a positive attitude about stepfamilies & some ideas about how to make them successful.

Molly Baskette deliver a clear and compelling modus operandi for making family life work--one rooted in research on parenting and Christian values, peppered with personal stories and a heavy dose of humor. When authors Ellen O'Donnell and Molly Baskette became parents, they read lots of books on parenting--many of them great. But when it came to practical suggestions that would help their family spiritually and psychologically, they came up short. Together, they sought out brainstorming actionable steps to help their families in ways that weren't being discussed in parenting books. This book is the fruit of their brainstorming and discussions. In Bless This Mess, readers will gain tools as they learn how to talk to kids about money, bodies, God, ethics, disability, and difference; how to stress less (really); how to embody an ethic of service to others; how to live a practice of deep generosity and gratitude; and, most of all, how to stop being so afraid all the damn time, as we raise our kids in an increasingly chaotic and often scary world. Both Christian spirituality and modern science can help us parent more fearlessly in an age of anxiety. With real-life examples and strategies to address the challenges of raising a toddler, preteen, or teenager, Bless This Mess guides parents of children at all stages of their development. Readers will shed stress with this resource they can turn to again and again for practical guidance as their children grow and the family encounters new challenges. Most important, readers will not feel alone, as they peruse relatable stories and are reminded of the companionship of God in their parenting journey\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cvOiDwAAQBAJ&dq=Bless+this+Mess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Dolce Vegan!: Vegan Livin' Made Easy","description":"Sarah Kramer is a vegan cooking superstar.

On May 13, 1939, the luxury liner St. Louis sailed from Hamburg, one of the last ships to leave Nazi Germany before World War II erupted. Aboard were 937 Jews some had already been in concentration camps who believed they had bought visas to enter Cuba. The voyage of the damned had begun. Before the St. Louis was halfway across the Atlantic, a power struggle ensued between the corrupt Cuban immigration minister who issued the visas and his superior, President Bru. The outcome: The refugees would not be allowed to land in Cuba. In America, the Brown Shirts were holding Nazi rallies in Madison Square Garden; anti-Semitic Father Coughlin had an audience of fifteen million. Back in Germany, plans were being laid to implement the final solution. And aboard the St. Louis, 937 refugees awaited the decision that would determine their fate. Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts have re-created history in this meticulous reconstruction of the voyage of the St. Louis. Every word of their account is true: the German High Command s ulterior motive in granting permission for the  mission of mercy;  the confrontations between the refugees and the German crewmen; the suicide attempts among the passengers; and the attitudes of those who might have averted the catastrophe, but didn t. In reviewing the work, the New York Times was unequivocal:  An extraordinary human document and a suspense story that is hard to put down. But it is more than that. It is a modern allegory, in which the SS St. Louis becomes a symbol of the SS Planet Earth. In this larger sense the book serves a greater purpose than mere drama.

The most commonly used probes are visible light, X-ray radiation, a high-energy electron beam, or a sharp, flexible needle. These four types of probe form the basis for optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy. Microstructural Characterization of Materials, 2nd Edition is an introduction to the expertise involved in assessing the microstructure of engineering materials and to the experimental methods used for this purpose. Similar to the first edition, this 2nd edition explores the methodology of materials characterization under the three headings of crystal structure, microstructural morphology, and microanalysis. The principal methods of characterization, including diffraction analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and chemical microanalytical techniques are treated both qualitatively and quantitatively. An additional chapter has been added to the new edition to cover surface probe microscopy, and there are new sections on digital image recording and analysis, orientation imaging microscopy, focused ion-beam instruments, atom-probe microscopy, and 3-D image reconstruction. As well as being fully updated, this second edition also includes revised and expanded examples and exercises, with a solutions manual available at http://develop.wiley.co.uk/microstructural2e/ Microstructural Characterization of Materials, 2nd Edition will appeal to senior undergraduate and graduate students of material science, materials engineering, and materials chemistry, as well as to qualified engineers and more advanced researchers, who will find the book a useful and comprehensive general reference source.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HxVLnwEACAAJ&dq=Microstructural+Characterization+of+Materials&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farm Under a Lake","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Harvest: A Novel","description":"A stable fire in a remote English village leads to disputes between newcomers who are wrongly accused and long-term residents who refuse to believe one of their own could be responsible, a situation that is further exacerbated by the observations and meticulous note-taking of another outsider.

The authors argue that a new class of global, knowledge-driven manufacturing industries has emerged in which learning, continuity, and speed define competition. In these new industries, access to knowledge creation processes matters more than ownership of physical assets. Location matters only insofar as it confers learning advantages and market access. Companies need strategies that can mobilize their organizations' country-specific strengths and freely leverage them in open, global learning partnerships with allies, suppliers, and customers. Managing New Industry Creation distills principles that managers can use to seize leadership for their companies as these new industries emerge. The authors draw their insights from firsthand discussions with over 160 managers and scientists who helped found the high-information-content flat panel display (FPD) industry. In the early 1990s, large-format FPDs exploded into public knowledge as a critical enabling technology for notebook computers. In the future, FPDs will increasingly function as the face by which users interact with technology products. The book recounts the business decisions that propelled the industry from humble beginnings to empower a globally mobile workforce and eventually build wall-hanging, high definition televisions that every household can afford. The FPD industry was the first new manufacturing industry to fully emerge in a global economy defined more by trade in knowledge than in physical products. Although FPDs were commercialized in Japan, the joint efforts of an international community of companies made high-volume production of large displays viable. Companies from outside of Japan including IBM, Applied Materials, and Corning achieved key positions by challenging U.S.-centered preconceptions of innovation, new business creation, and management process, giving unprecedented global authority and responsibility to their Japanese affiliates. Their success established new rules for competing in the knowledge-driven, global manufacturing industries of the future, first described here for managers, R&D scientists, academics, and students of corporate strategy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=glq_bMdXpmcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heaven Is a Playground","description":"In 1974, Rick Telander intended to spend a few days doing a magazine piece on the court wizards of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant. He ended up staying the entire summer, becoming part of the players' lives and eventually the coach of a loose aggregation known as the Subway Stars. Telander tells of everything he saw: the on-court flash, the off-court jargon, the late-night graffiti raids, the tireless efforts of one promoter-hustler-benefactor to get these kids a chance at a college education. He lets the kids speak for themselves, revealing their grand dreams and ambitions. But he never flinches from showing us how far their dreams are from reality. The roots of today's inner-city basketball can be traced to the world Telander presents in \\"Heaven is a Playground,\\" the first book of its kind. Rick Telander is a senior writer for \\"Sports Illustrated\\" and the winner of the 1987 Notre Dame Club Award for Excellence in Sports Journalism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqAmx_SNOV8C&dq=Heaven+Is+a+Playground&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Situations Of Life: Floetry... For Poetry Lovers","description":"This book contains short poetic stories. My poetry talks about the different areas and ways in which some of us might view life's characteristics. They let your mind wander. They open up your thoughts to help you acknowledge a fictional as well as nonfictional approach to things in the past and things to come. Everyone knows their gifts and shortcomings within their own mind, body, and heart. These poetic stories \\"flow\\" within those real affects of the human condition. Everyone has their own opinion of how life flows and what life is all about. My writings talk about all occasions. We all know that life is not promised to us. We should all make the best of our lives. Loving, caring and sharing should be major values as we allow life to continually show us, through our relationships with ourselves as well as others, that we are here to live, learn, and contribute by being all of who we are. Loving yourself, taking care of your loved ones, and accepting the fact that you can change any aspect of your life should mean the most to all of us. I hope you enjoy my book of short poetic stories. I hope also that you find those pearls of wisdom, strength, and love contained within your life inside the stories in this book that touch you personally. May life last you long, and your health remain strong.

In response to this disaster the complete array of military and civilian investigative and judicial procedures ran their course. After almost two years of investigation with virtually unlimited resources, no culprit emerged, no bad guy showed himself, no smoking gun was found. This book attempts to make sense of this tragedy--a tragedy that on its surface makes no sense at all. With almost twenty years in uniform and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, Lieutenant Colonel Snook writes from a unique perspective. A victim of friendly fire himself, he develops individual, group, organizational, and cross-level accounts of the accident and applies a rigorous analysis based on behavioral science theory to account for critical links in the causal chain of events. By explaining separate pieces of the puzzle, and analyzing each at a different level, the author removes much of the mystery surrounding the shootdown. Based on a grounded theory analysis, Snook offers a dynamic, cross-level mechanism he calls \\"practical drift\\"--the slow, steady uncoupling of practice from written procedure--to complete his explanation. His conclusion is disturbing. This accident happened because, or perhaps in spite of everyone behaving just the way we would expect them to behave, just the way theory would predict. The shootdown was a normal accident in a highly reliable organization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mve2cTSin1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Espanol en espanol","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YD9EnQEACAAJ&dq=Espanol+en+espanol&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nevada","description":"One of Vogue's Best Books of 2022 So Far, Buzzfeed's Summer Books You Won t Be Able To Put Down, Book Riot's Best Summer Reads for 2022, and Dazed's Queer Books to Read in 2022 \\"[Nevada] is defiant, terse, not quite cynical, sometimes flip, addressed to people who think they know.

Maria Griffiths is almost thirty and works at a used bookstore in New York City while trying to stay true to her punk values. She s in love with her bike but not with her girlfriend, Steph. She takes random pills and drinks more than is good for her, but doesn t inject anything except, when she remembers, estrogen, because she s trans. Everything is mostly fine until Maria and Steph break up, sending Maria into a tailspin, and then onto a cross-country trek in the car she steals from Steph. She ends up in the backwater town of Star City, Nevada, where she meets James, who is probably but not certainly trans, and who reminds Maria of her younger self.

TransAfrica was instrumental in the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa and the reinstatement of President Aristide in Haiti. Robinson's thoughtful and provocative memoir paints a vivid picture of racism in the hallowed halls of Harvard, where he went to law school, as well as the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. He also recounts in fascinating detail his trips to troubled African and Caribbean nations; more than anyone else, he has raised awareness of the problems in those countries. Defending The Spirit also gives a devastating commentary on America's foreign policy endeavors in African and Caribbean nations, and an impassioned call to African-Americans for new leadership and activism to fight racism all over the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VE-3RaC7HgEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Euros 13 (No.13)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Practical ethics,","description":"For thirty years, Peter Singer's Practical Ethics has been the classic introduction to applied ethics.

This book is the first to connect systematically these two aspects of Spinoza's legacy. Steven B. Smith shows that Spinoza was a politically engaged theorist who both advocated and embodied a new conception of the emancipated individual, a thinker who decisively influenced such diverse movements as the Enlightenment, liberalism, and political Zionism. Focusing on Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise, Smith argues that Spinoza was the first thinker of note to make the civil status of Jews and Judaism (what later became known as the Jewish Question) an essential ingredient of modern political thought. Before Marx or Freud, Smith notes, Spinoza recast Judaism to include the liberal values of autonomy and emancipation from tradition. Smith examines the circumstances of Spinoza's excommunication from the Jewish community of Amsterdam, his skeptical assault on the authority of Scripture, his transformation of Mosaic prophecy into a progressive philosophy of history, his use of the language of natural right and the social contract to defend democratic political institutions, and his comprehensive comparison of the ancient Hebrew commonwealth and the modern commercial republic. According to Smith, Spinoza's Treatise represents a classic defense of religious toleration and intellectual freedom, showing them to be necessary foundations for political stability and liberal regimes. In this study Smith examines Spinoza's solution to the Jewish Question and asks whether a Judaism, so conceived, can long survive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87sx1v9UmlQC&dq=Spinoza,+Liberalism,+and+the+Question+of+Jewish+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Fresh Look at American English: A Weird and Wonderful Language","description":"A delightful, easy-to-read book that discloses many of the mysteries of American English.

These letters, exchanged with family and with his famous contemporaries, reveal his loneliness, grim humor, loyalty, painful shyness, and enthusiasm for the music of Beethoven and Schubert-moods that the self-effacing composer did not publicly display. Divided into sections on Brahms's solitary, scholarly existence and his fruitful composing career--including examinations of rare first drafts--the biography relates how crises in Brahms's personal life were translated into his music, and how he often managed to ignore or suppress them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W6oHAQAAMAAJ&dq=Brahms,+his+life+and+work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoughts and Reflections on Billy Graham's Life Principles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EOPJtwEACAAJ&dq=Thoughts+and+Reflections+on+Billy+Graham%27s+Life+Principles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning Trainers: Their Road to the Top","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pKGHAAAACAAJ&dq=Winning+Trainers:+Their+Road+to+the+Top&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's No Place Like Home: Steps to Becoming a Stay-At-Home Mom","description":"Some statistics show that as many as 70 percent of working mothers want to be stay-at-home moms.

Is it possible to truly know who we are? Do our lives have a purpose, or are we just accidental? What are we meant to contribute? What are we meant to become, to create, and to share? In The Book of Understanding, Osho, one of the most provocative thinkers of our time, challenges us to understand our world and ourselves in a new and radical way. The first step toward understanding, he says, is to question and doubt all that we have been taught to believe. All our lives we ve been handed so-called truths by countless others beliefs we learned to accept without reason. It is only in questioning our beliefs, assumptions, and prejudices that we can begin to uncover our own unique voice and heal the divisions within us and without. Once we discover our authentic self, we can embrace all aspects of the human experience from the earthy, pleasure-loving qualities that characterize Zorba the Greek to the watchful, silent qualities of Gautam the Buddha. We can become whole and live with integrity, able to respond with creativity and compassion to the religious, political, and cultural divides that currently plague our society. In this groundbreaking work, Osho identifies, loosens, and ultimately helps to untie the knots of fear and misunderstanding that restrict us leaving us free to discover and create our own individual path to freedom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PG2fi3o5yh0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Identity (The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume II)","description":"Drawing on a wide range of social and psychological theories, Castells presents original research on political processes and social movements.

This book argues that what begins as a narrative of racial exclusion and black-white division has been complicated by cultural racism, Islamophobia and an unexpected challenge to secular modernity. Moreover, the idea of 'race' as underclass has had to contend with the creation of middle class formations and high levels of participation in higher education among some non-white groups. These plural divisions are not intractable but require us to rethink simplistic and monistic ideas about racism, secularism, liberalism and what it means to be British.Tariq Modood has developed a unique and influential perspective out of his sense that the concerns of South Asians lie at the heart of 'race relations' in Britain. This book gathers together a number of his key sociological, political and theoretical interventions, together with a substantial new Introduction and Conclusion, allowing readers to engage with a distinctive analysis of race and religion.Key Features:* Combines a discussion of racism and Muslim politics in Britain* Offers an interdisciplinary combination of empirical sociology with political theory of multiculturalism* Challenges the secularist bias of liberals and social scientists","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pra4ngEACAAJ&dq=Multicultural+Politics:+Racism,+Ethnicity,+and+Muslims+in+Britain+(Contradictions+of+Modernity)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rex","description":"A look inside the often hidden world of parasites turns the clock back to the beginning of life on Earth to answer key questions about these highly evolved and resilient life forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JeeZAgAAQBAJ&dq=Rex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Serious Training for Endurance Athletes 2nd","description":"SERIOUS Training for Endurance Athletes provides the tools to create training programs and workouts that will pay off in competition.

Many have failed, though, to realize that those closest to the alcoholic, primarily the family, generally suffer psychological damage and often become as emotionally distressed as the alcoholic himself. Given the common effects of the disease of alcoholism and the society we're raised in, it's all but impossible for those around a drinking alcoholic not to be drawn into the sickness. Such persons, especially the family members, are apt to become anxious and fearful and to develop feelings of low self-worth, anger, and resentment. In short, they're likely to develop their own emotional illness in connection with another's alcoholism, and they, too, need help in dealing with the problem. The feelings of anger, shame, and guilt associated with family alcoholism come from the constant confusion, conflict, unpredictability, inconsistency, mistrust, and sense of failure that each member experiences. The family victims seldom learn without outside help that they didn't cause the disease and that they can't control it. This book discusses all these issues in depth","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p9PiwAEACAAJ&dq=Detachment:+The+Art+of+Letting+Go+While+Living+With+an+Alcoholic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing of Economics","description":"\\"The implied reader of my little book is a student of economics or of related fields who needs to write.

Lieutenant Gail Nicholson disapproves of what she calls Marti's sloppy work habits, and regards her success as a fluke rather than the result of hard work and skill. Marti thinks the woman just may be feeling overly competitive with her, as one of the only other women on the job, and a black woman at that, but Marti knows she must put up with her boss's ill will or else she could be out of job. When a homeless woman turns up dead, Lt. Nicholson dismisses the case. After all, being a suburb of Chicago, Lincoln Prairie has its share of homeless citizens, and another dead one-especially in the winter-ranks pretty low on the lieutenant's radar screen. She's more worried about an assault on a city alderman. But unable to let the woman's death go, Marti takes it upon herself to figure out the truth, even if it costs Marti her job. Could this homicide be part of a larger pattern? Can Marti find the killer before another person turns up dead?

The last two decades have brought remarkable advances in our knowledge of human sexuality. These data are in the process of being assimilated into the main body of psychiatric thought, which is being greatly enriched thereby. Our increased understanding of sexuality is also currently being translated into innovative new approaches to the treatment of sexual difficulties. These developments promise relief to many persons with distressing sexual problems who were previously thought to be beyond help. At the present time, the specific approach to sex therapy described in this volume is being employed, further developed and, most important, systematically evaluated at the Sex Therapy and Education Program of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic of the Cornell University-New York Hospital Center. The Cornell program is psychiatrically oriented. It regards sex therapy as a specialized branch of psychotherapy. The Clinic conceives of sexual dysfunctions as psychosomatic symptoms and it s orientation is multicausal and eclectic in that it believes that sexual dysfunctions are the product of multiple etiologic factors, and our treatment armamentarium comprises an amalgam of experiential, behavioral and dynamically oriented modalities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OirYAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voyage to Atlantis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=apoCuwAACAAJ&dq=Voyage+to+Atlantis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zrUozgEACAAJ&dq=Relations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Health: How to Wake Up the Body's Intelligence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PJ2xtQEACAAJ&dq=Creating+Health:+How+to+Wake+Up+the+Body%27s+Intelligence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements.3 volumes.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KHMDAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Forget to Smile","description":"In Oregon's timber country, inside a smoky bar, stands proprietor Tory Duncan.

Eyr -s band is hungry and in need of new skins. The old seer predicts a coming snow, and without a good supply ofmeat, the band may starve or die of cold. Eyr walks over meadows and hills with the other hunters looking for tracks, but they return with little game. That night Eyr dreams of killing the great woolly mammoth with his sharp spear. He imagines how his band would dance and feast, with food to last them through the dark winter. The next morning the band-s hunter-leader wakes him. Having reached the age that he can hunt alone, Eyr is sent to scout the large beaststhat roam the tundra, especially the woolly mammoths. Taking only his cape, his knife, his spear, and a smoldering ember, Eyr sets out to become a man and save his band.Told in rhyming couplets, just as many ancient storytellers told the epic tales of the past, Eyr the Hunter: A Story of Ice-Age America is based upon many facts. Margaret Zehmer Searcy is a cultural anthropologist who has taught classes about Native Americans and their customs for more than two decades in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Alabama. She has visited archaeological sites and is familiar with the kinds of animals that existed in the Ice-Age landscape. Joyce Haynes has won numerous local, state, and national awards for her illustrations. She has illustrated more than a dozen books and is the author of Drawing Wild Animals .

In fact, parents may feel they don't know the answers to such questions for themselves, much less for their young children. In Teaching Your Children About God, Rabbi David Wolpe shows Jewish parents how to openly explore the idea of God with their children. Through poignant anecdotes and practical exercises, Wolpe teaches how parents can guide children in the practice of prayer and create an atmosphere in which children feel comfortable questioning and wondering about God, life, and death. Wolpe also offers invaluable insights into children's spiritual needs, reveals the powerful effect faith can have on a child's self-esteem, and enables parents to understand their children's fears, dreams, and hopes.

Bukowski moved it a little farther.  Los Angeles Times Book Review In what is widely hailed as the best of his many novels, Charles Bukowski details the long, lonely years of his own hardscrabble youth in the raw voice of alter ego Henry Chinaski. From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, woman, and the Los Angeles Public Library's collection of D.H. Lawrence, Ham on Rye offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast's coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rv4qbAACPzYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No More Holiday Blues: Uplifting Advice for Recapturing the True Spirit of Christmas, Hanukkah, and the New Year","description":"PSYCHOLOGY/POP PSYCHOLOGY","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Da2AAAACAAJ&dq=No+More+Holiday+Blues:+Uplifting+Advice+for+Recapturing+the+True+Spirit+of+Christmas,+Hanukkah,+and+the+New+Year&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GLORY. A Novel.","description":"NAMED A MOST ANTICPATED BOOK OF 2022 BY VULTURE, BUZZFEED, AND OPRAH DAILY \\"Few writers possess a literary voice as inimitable as Bulawayo s [The] dazzling voices of this novel will draw you deep into its ambitious and mystifying heart.\\"  Vulture \\"Genius.\\" #1 New York Times bestselling author Jason Reynolds From the award-winning author of the Booker-prize finalist We Need New Names, a exhilarating novel about the fall of an oppressive regime, and the chaos and opportunity that rise in its wake. NoViolet Bulawayo s bold new novel follows the fall of the Old Horse, the long-serving leader of a fictional country, and the drama that follows for a rumbustious nation of animals on the path to true liberation. Inspired by the unexpected fall by coup in November 2017 of Robert G. Mugabe, Zimbabwe s president of nearly four decades, Glory shows a country's imploding, narrated by a chorus of animal voices that unveil the ruthlessness required to uphold the illusion of absolute power and the imagination and bulletproof optimism to overthrow it completely. By immersing readers in the daily lives of a population in upheaval, Bulawayo reveals the dazzling life force and irresistible wit that lie barely concealed beneath the surface of seemingly bleak circumstances. And at the center of this tumult is Destiny, a young goat who returns to Jidada to bear witness to revolution and to recount the unofficial history and the potential legacy of the females who have quietly pulled the strings here. The animal kingdom its connection to our primal responses and its resonance in the mythology, folktales, and fairy tales that define cultures the world over unmasks the surreality of contemporary global politics to help us understand our world more clearly, even as Bulawayo plucks us right out of it. Although Zimbabwe is the immediate inspiration for this thrilling story, Glory was written in a time of global clamor, with resistance movements across the world challenging different forms of oppression. Thus it often feels like Bulawayo captures several places in one blockbuster allegory, crystallizing a turning point in history with the texture and nuance that only the greatest fiction can.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D1g2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sexual Life of Savages and Other Stories","description":"A collection of erotic stories includes \\"In the bathroom at Joey's,\\" \\"Dear Veronica,\\" \\"Unction,\\" and \\"Dinner\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bSOKQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Sexual+Life+of+Savages+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vulgar Latin","description":"Vulgar Latin refers to those features of Latin language that were not recommended by the classical grammarians but existed nonetheless. Although Vulgar Latin is not well documented, evidence can be deduced from details of the spelling, grammar, and vocabulary that occur in texts of the later Roman Empire, late antiquity, and the early Middle Ages. Every aspect of Vulgar Latin is exemplified in this book, proving that the language is not separate in itself, but an integral part of Latin.Originally published in French in 1967, Vulgar Latin was translated more recently into Spanish in an expanded and revised version. The English translation by Roger Wright accurately portrays Vulgar Latin as a complicated field of study, where little is known with absolute certainty, but a great deal can be worked out with considerable probability through careful critical analysis of the data. This text is an invaluable aid to research and understanding for all those interested in Latin, Romance languages, historical linguistics, early medieval texts, and early medieval history.J zsef Herman is the former director of the Linguistic Research Institute at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and is currently Professor of Latin Linguistics at the University of Venice.
