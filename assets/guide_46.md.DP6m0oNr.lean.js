You'll love this one too!"},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"The cartoons wouldn't be so funny (except the pictures are just adorable), if they weren't so true. Sloane translates human emotions into these cute chicks doing outrageous things. Buy one for yourself and 10 to give away."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"Sloane Tanen has done it again!! Get out your gift list, this book is perfect for everyone. Don't miss these adventures of the fuzzy chickens, the book is hilarious."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"After reading Bitter with Baggage, I didn't think there could be a more spot on, hilarious take of a chick's life, that is until I picked up Going for the Bronze.Tanen captures a women's life and relationships, and the angst and humor that goes along with both brilliantly! This is the perfect book to share with a friend having a bad day--I've turned many a friend's tears of frustration into tears of laughter with a mere flip of the page. It's also the ideal book to share with each other to make a good day even better.If these crazy little chicks could talk, they'd make great guests on Oprah. Wait, if they could talk, they'd have their own show, and Oprah would be their guest."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"This is the fun stuff: \\"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage\\" by Sloane Tanen is a sequel to \\"Bitter with Baggage Seeks Same: The Life and Times of Some Chickens.\\" This is a hilariously silly, irreverent little picture book of chicken peeps posed with miniature props in \\"human\\" settings.Alongside the yellow chicks are tiny props such as food items, books, hats and cell phones. The brightly colored dioramas include cars, doll furniture and even a SWAT helicopter. Venues range from a coffee bar to the Grand Canyon. It's all a sort of bizarre cross between \\"Thomas the Tank Engine\\" and \\"Sex and the City.\\"This is NOT a children's book, as it features adult situations and language. The captions are just plain nutty. Some are subtle, some are outrageous, and at least one I didn't even understand. But they are so much fun!"},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"I was thrilled to see a second book by Sloane Tanen, along the same lines as Bitter with Baggage, in the bookstore, recently. I immediately bought it, and as a last-minute thought, brought it along to my book club. Not only did it give us a light reprieve from our regular conversation, but some of the scenes that Tanen has artfully put together rang so close to home that we ended up talking about how we related to the pictures of fuzzy chicks, instead. (The urge to hang yourself after one too many conversations about a friend's baby's pooping habits, anyone?) We all enjoyed it very much, and it has turned out to be a great idea for holiday presents. I hope there will be a third book!"},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"As funny as the first book! Being bitter was never so much fun."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"I love Sloane Tanen's sense of humor and her wonderful chickens. I didn't think I could laugh harder than I did with the first book, but this one is every bit as funny, and in some cases funnier as it builds on a lot of the humor in Bitter With Baggage. Get both for xmas presents for your friends, then buy a handful of Where Is Coco Going? for your friends' toddlers. My 2 year old insists on reading it every night. These books also make excellent get well presents for sick friends as they are the perfect pick-me-ups."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"Sloane Tanen has once again taken a clever and intimate look at life and presented it - with the return of her delightful chickens - in the best of all possible ways. How much more fun it is to learn these truths through her wit and charm. \\"Still Bitter\\" is the book to buy for anyone you know who needs to lighten up."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"to become a movie star....it's only a matter of time before hollywood grabs these little guys and makes a huge bundle ofcash from their witty loveable world. Ms. Tanen's book is darker than the first one, edgier, as the chickens continuetheir search for the perfect anecdote. I can't wait to see the movie. Hurry up and make it already."},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"I first fell in love with Sloane Tanen's work when I read the caption above the photo: \\"Samantha looked around the playground in amazement. Her mother had been right. She really WAS the smartest and the prettiest.\\"If you thought you had to give up picture books when you graduated from second grade, have I got a treat for you! Writer Sloane Tanen and photographer Stefan Hagen take those tiny little stuffed yellow chicks you can find at Easter and put them in wickedly funny scenarios in gorgeously detailed dioramas. This is the first book in the series BITTER WITH BAGGAGE SEEKS SAME: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF SOME CHICKENS and it's both delightfully bitter and sunny-natured. And who can't relate to adorable little spoiled tyrant Coco who is rarely seen without her tiara and dreams \\"that one day she would grow up to be a benevolent queen...or a supermodel?\\"The second book in the series--GOING FOR THE BRONZE: STILL BITTER, MORE BAGGAGE is equally hilarious. One of my favorite pages shows two chickens peering over the side of the Titanic while a chicken floats beneath them and one of them comments, \\"I don't know, the last thing he said was something about being king of the world and then I may have accidentally pushed him.\\" No one is safe from the satire including Charles and Camilla, American Idol, and Hooters. And the photographs are so detailed that you can spend hours just noticing things in the background.I should warn you that, due to a wee bit of naughty language, these picture books are for adults only, but Sloane Tanen has also written a children's book called COCO ALL YEAR ROUND. If you want your child to develop a deliciously dark and dysfunctional sense of humor right along with you, you can read them rhymes featuring the adorable Coco like \\"I walk down the street with my whole Girl Scout troop. It would have been fun had I not slipped in poop.\\" (I'll spare you a description of the illustration on this one.)[...]"},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"A followup to Sloane Tanen's earlier \\"Bitter with Baggage Seeks Same.\\" This is also a hilarious look at the lives of adult females. Thanks to Sloane for these books!!! My college daughter and I laugh, laugh, laugh at these funny, situations and how Sloane has captured them perfectly with the help of some fuzzy little chicks!!!!"},{"Title":"Going for the Bronze: Still Bitter, More Baggage","review":"What a great follow-up to Bitter with Baggage.

Only one girl can stop the ticking clock.... Sarah, an ordinary teenager who just happens to be the Chosen One. In order to stop the countdown, she must kill Jezebel, the demon in human form. And Julia, another teenager, must survive - because she knows, somehow, that the baby she is pregnant with somehow fits into the picture. Although the only key to this is the visions she and the baby's father, George, are having. Meanwhile, George searches the wilderness for Julia, and Sarah, with the help of her friend Ariel, makes a plan to kill Jezebel before it's too late....

In other words, beware of those who attempt to use scripture to &quot;fit&quot; their points-of-view.Lucado, on the other hand, does the opposite. He presents a variety of stories that range from moral tales to historical accounts of triumphs and disasters, all of which parallel the fables and parables of ancient times, and while reading each chapter, one should conclude that if there is any point that Lucado is trying to get across, it is not for his own personal benefit; instead, it is this: we fail to realize that there are so many modern-day events in our world that make the works of the gospel writers just as relevant today as they were in the past and that many of these happenings brought to life are just as applicable to the so-called ordinary individual as they are to the famous figures who headline our daily news."},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"This book will give you an understanding of why God's message is delivered as it is, to get our attention. Max provides some wonderful stories from John to broaden our understanding of why God communicates the way he does."},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"I loved this book. It was the first one of Max Lucado's that I have read and I liked it so much, I have read 5 more since then. I recently gave this book to my brother who is going through a tough divorce. But that was only after I had read it twice. I loved this book and Max Lucado is so anointed. I recommend this book and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"A friend of mine gave this book to me as a gift. It is truly the best book I have ever read when it comes to improving your personal relationship with Jesus Christ. I really enjoyed Max Lucado's style of writing. He used examples that made sense to me and that I could relate to. He grabs you and makes you want to read more. I am looking forward to reading other books by Lucado and hope that he continues to help those of us in search of HIM"},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"Max Lucado has a profound message. What is unique about his writing is the simple means used to express the message. Though the passages in the book are not always cohesive to the theme, some of them are quite moving.God uses many means to get the attention of his people. Unfortunately, his people are not always attentive. Too often the image of a punitive, angry God becomes the prime image for contemporary society. This book is a reminder of the kind hand extended to us from God. He is patiently waiting for His people to take the remaining steps to Him. A pilot, Wile E. Coyote, and a father carrying his children to bed are among the metaphors used. Some of the passages fit the theme better than others. It may be better to look at the selections as independent entities rather than a collection. They might be better appreciated independently.Though some might believe Lucado waters down or over-simplifies the message Christianity, I would aruge the overall products is moving. The book is intended to reinforced the message of the bible, not be the message."},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"Once again Max Lucado writes a book that will not allow you to put it down for any length of time. His writings are easy to read and understand. He always puts a new viewpoint onto God and His word. It is always a pleasure and a blessing to read one of Max Lucado's books."},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"This book allows us to see God's word applied to situations we have been in and can relate to. Further proving the awesome power He has!"},{"Title":"A Gentle Thunder: Hearing God Through the Storm","review":"First of all, Amazon is incredibly great about shipping items as soon as possible. I was kind of bummed out when I saw the projected delivery date was at least a week after I purchased the book, but when I received it early, I was overjoyed. This book is a great read - Max Lucado has a writing style like no other and the way he makes things personal feels like he has been a friend forever.On the page where the information for the product is given, I thought all the information presented was wonderful. Plus, the change to \\"look inside\\" the book makes the suspense rise until I actually have the book in my hand.

In the early days of home inspections, the &quot;Complete Book of Home Inspection&quot; was considered the &quot;Bible&quot; of the industry. Now, after over 20 years in publication, with the updated chapters and the new sections on mold and pools, nothing has changed. The beginning home inspector can still depend on this book as a dependable single reference source. It should also be extremely useful for the first time homebuyer in the preliminary stages of home selection, but should not be used in place of a professional home inspection."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"This book provides a general description of all aspects of inspecting a home.

There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection by Norman Becker is one of the best books that I have read about home inspections. This book is written so that the average home owner or buyer, as well as the Skilled Professional Home Inspector, will gain valuable information about the many areas that need to be checked when buying or inspecting a home. As a ASHI Certified Inspector I find this book to be a excellent reference book, and I refer to it often.

I definitely wish I had read it before I bought my first house. It'll help you evaluate the condition of items from your roof down to your crawl space or basement and everything in between. It is written in an easy-to-understand format and is well organized so you can find exactly what you are looking for.I am studying to become a home inspector myself and found this book to be a very useful first step.

The book covers a wide variety of topics in a very thorough manner and allows the reader to not feel overwhelmed if they have to inspect a home. A good approach for using this book is to go through the home to see if you like the home. As you go through, note what type of systems are in place (oil furnace, gas hot water heater, etc.). Then read the book to provide some background to better prepare yourself to understand what you see when you inspect the home.The guy did an excellent job of communicating his years of knowledge into a useful book. If you're going to do your own home inspection, this book should be read. I'm also an engineer and home inspector. It took me years to learn what is compiled in this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"I don't recommend this book due to many incorrect observations and information noted in the chapters. I was very surprised that this book was recommended by other readers because there were many mistakes and errors in the book. Some important topics were discussed incorrectly and others were too brief. To find out and confirm this I gave this book to several local real estate contractors and they pointed out many other errors in this book that even I was unaware of. They explained to me how many things discussed in the book were outdated or not relevant."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"The only time I would write a negative review if I think a book has been over rated. This book is definitely over rated. My husband and I are real estate investors and continually read books to improve our profits.

ASHI has books that tell a lot more details and cover all the topics left out by this book. I am an ASHI certified home inspector so I am experienced in this field and know when I'm reading a good book on the subject. This book does not tell the whole story needed for a professional inspector and appears to be written for a beginner who only wants a basic understanding on home inspections and inspectors.I've been an ASHI home inspector for many years and wouldn't recommend this book to any of inspectors in my state. Shop around and you'll find much better reading to be informed."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"Due to inaccurate information in this book, I agree with some of the other book reviewers that this book is on unstable ground.

I too regret purchasing the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"I have been a home inspector for many years and can tell you that the advice and other information in this book is old and was published 10 years ago.

It is written in a very simple, but informative style. This book is not only meant for new home inspectors, or first time home buyers, but for experienced inspectors as well. The content in this book will serve as a source of information for anyone who needs to understand how a particular system works, or how to recognize a minor, or major problem. The many graphic illustrations are very helpful to fully understand what the problems actually look like. This book is a must to have."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"Some information in this book is good, however much appears on &quot;shaky&quot; ground. A few items are not accurate. I regret purchasing the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"Despite the flaws in this book I haven't seen a better book for home buyers and owners. (Although it might not be obvious that is who this book is targetted at, not professional inspectors.) So if you are in the market for a house I would recommend you at least browse through this book.The good parts are that the author lays out a methodical approach to inspecting a house and usually includes good descriptions of how to investigate and evaluate the various components and systems of the house. The end of most chapters contains a checkpoint summary of that chapter.The downsides are that the information in the book is almost a decade old now; this second version was published in 1993. Sometimes the author assumes knowledge that I didn't have. The book is targetted at a lay audience but doesn't really have enough illustrations and definitions and examples to really deliver on this promise. For instance, when inspecting a hot-water heating system he says, &quot;A forced system will have a circulating pump in the return line near the boiler.&quot; It would be nice a picture was shown to illustrate the difference between having a circulating pump and not having one.Also, the author gets something wrong in at least one place. When talking about tankless water heaters he says, &quot;From an energy-conservation point of view, a tankless water heater is not desirable. It is inefficient and wasteful of energy.&quot; This is untrue today and I doubt whether it was true when the book was written. The US Department of Energy in their reference brief on tankless heaters acknowledges that tankless heaters are more efficient and less wasteful of energy; that is part of the reason they are used in Europe and Japan where energy prices are higher than here in America. They also tend to have longer life expectancies than conventional tank heaters.I find the author's statements strange because they make little sense. It also makes me a little worried because now I wonder what else he got wrong that I don't know about. Despite this, I still think the book is very useful to potential home buyers."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"This book covers all the major components of home inspection. It is not so obvious by its content that it is intended primarily for the home buyer. I definitely recommend it to home inspectors as it is as good a reference as any of the books written for home inspectors. There are a lot of first-hand cases experienced by the author in lower New York that will give helpful inspection clues to buyers/inspectors. Unfortunately I do not consider the book the &quot;bible&quot; of home inspection. I have not yet come across such a book.. when I do I'll be sure to let you know (in its own review)."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"I found this book to be very readable even to a home repair novice like me. It contains a lot of information about what to look for when buying a house, and additional information about how houses are constructed which should be useful when maintaining one. I read 3 such books and this is by far the best."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"For a new home owner or home inspector, this book is a good, basic book that even a lay person can understand (one that has no knowledge of the field).

I highly recommend this for someone starting out in the business as a reference book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"As a new comer to the home inspection business I was looking for a book to give me the basics. Based on a colleague's recommendation I bought Norman Becker's book and I want to commend him....it covers more than just the basics, it's a very indepth discussion of ALL, and I mean ALL, of the problems and issues one encounters as a home inspector or a new home buyer. It is written in a style that makes not only pleasant reading, but Norman explains the issues in simple, easily understood language, whether you're an inspector just entering the business, a long term experienced inspector or new home buyers, first out of school or an experienced, ready to retire buyer! It's not easy to satisfy such a wide spectrum, but Norman does it extremely well, making easy and enjoyable reading for all who have the interest or need.As for technical content, I say again that the book covers everything one needs to know about the subject, so much so that I keep one copy on my office desk and another in the car so I have quick access to an excellent reference guide at all times.It has never failed me when I needed a quick update on any issue, no matter how small or big. You know how you often check to make sure you have your wallet in your pocket when you leave the house....well I make that same check to be sure I have Norm Becker's book within my reach at all times.I'm sure the book not only satisfy's an individual's need such as mine, but from the quality of its content, I believe it has made, and will continue to make, a positive impact on our home inspection industry.Please thank Mr. Becker for making this home inspector's entry into the field not only more effective but easier and more pleasant.Bill Mason,"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"As a Commercial and Residential Inspector, I found this book to be a good reference book over many other's I have purchased to learn more about performing good inspections.

I still find myself referring to it. Every good inspector has read this book and anyone thinking about doing home inspections should read it. The book is clearly written and covers all of a homes systems (the new edition has the latest topics), explaining how each system works and what to look for when checking it. It gives good detail without getting overly technical and is easy to read. Home buyers should read this book so that they are well informed about their biggest purchase and will know what to look for and what questions to ask when they find their potential new home."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"This book thoroughly walks the reader through the home inspection procedure in a step-by-step fashion. It is definitely worth buying and reading. Some chapters, such as the one on wood-destroying insects, have much detail. Others have a bit less detail and would benefit from additional illustrations and text. The author focuses on safety and cost considerations in performing home inspections. Sometimes he is a little puritanical in championing safety considerations first, but it's hard to knock that. He gives many useful tips to the novice home inspector, for example on how to check septic systems for proper function. I've read this book once over and have reread some chapters. It deserves careful study of the individual chapters. I intend to carry the book with me when I look through prospective houses."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"Most books of this type are written by people with little understanding of the engineering involved in pre-purchase home inspections.

The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Home Inspection: For the Buyer or Owner","review":"We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new."},{"Title":"Soft Porn Plays Hardball: Its Tragic Effects on Women, Children and the Family","review":"This book is an extraordinary, shocking content analysis of Playboy magazine through the years. Hugh Hefner, rather than the slightly-roguish but benign pioneer of openness he is often portrayed to be, emerges as an agenda-pushing cad with a disdain for marriage, family, children, monogamy, and ultimately, women.

She thinks her opinion is the right opinion and that she speaks for all women and children! She doesnt speak for me! Of all the horrors going on in the world, this is all she can complain about? What a waste of time!"},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"I read this when I was a kid and reread it recently and it's an absolute pleasure! The book deals with the period of the Crusades. It's set in the deserts around Syria/Palestine. The armies of the Crusaders have set up camp after a temporary truce. King Richard the Lion-Heart lies ill and members of the European nobility are scheming to make a profit at the expense of the Crusade. Around all this, a knight (the main character) is sent on a mission to negotiate a potential peace with Saladin.This book has the classic images of the Crusades: duels, secret convents hidden in the harsh, craggy rocks of the desert, hermits, sultans, kings, dukes, Nubian slaves, conspiracies, Arab doctors and the like. It makes fascinating reading and reveals a lot about the imagination of Scott and his time.This book is one of Scott's less famous works but very undeservedly so. I think it's as good as Ivanhoe."},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"In novel and poem after novel and poem, Sir Walter Scott argues that the past never completely dies. He suggests that what is better (e.g. Reformation and Protestantism, rationalism and peaceful behavior) generally replace what is less good e.g. European Catholicism, superstition, cattle raiding and clan wars). But even \\"the bad old days\\" had good things not so apparent today: intense personal loyalties, unquestioning courage, chivalry and unselfish idealism. There are elements deep inside human nature in never ending war with their opposites.This philosophy of history is nowhere more apparent than in Scott's 1825 historical novel, THE TALISMAN, which can be regarded as the second in a trilogy of King Richard I novels, of which the first is THE BETROTHED and the third is IVANHOE. Richard is not the designated hero in any of the three, but this most popular of England's kings dominates any scene in which he appears.Because he is their best warrior, other European Kings and Princes on the Third Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the great Muslim leader Saladin grudgingly acknowledge Richard the Lion Heart first among equals. But they know that he generally regards them as self-seeking, cowardly and always ready to cut a deal with Saladin and run back home to Austria, France, Italy and elsewhere. Richard's haughty personality inevitably undermines his best intentions to hold a shaky coalition together.The King is accompanied by his recent bride, the young, beautiful, frivolous Berengaria of Navarre. Richard's cousin, Edith Plantagenet, heads the ladies attending the Queen. Edith cannot disguise her growing love for an ostensibly poor Scottish knight, Sir Kenneth of the Couchant Leopard. The Queen teases her for this and succeeds in luring Kenneth away from a post of high honor personally assigned by the Lion Heart.Before this, Kenneth, on a mission from the High Council of the Crusade (Richard lying ill of a devastating fever) rides to the wilds near the Dead Sea to consult with a mysterious Carmelite Priest. En route he meets the disguised Saladin and, after an indecisive combat, the two become friends. Saladin is later introduced in another disguise as El Hakim (the healer) to Richard whose fever he cures with a mysterious talisman. Only the disguised Sultan's intercession prevents the enraged but grateful Richard from executing Sir Kenneth after the latter allows the standard of England to be stolen by the Head of the Knights Templar and the almost equally evil Conrade of Montserrat. Returned in disguise as a black mute, a gift from Saladin, Sir Kenneth saves Richard from assassination and, with the help of his great Scottish deer hound, unravels the plot of the Templar and Conrade.Sir Kenneth is revealed as Prince David of Scotland and thus high enough in rank to marry the King's cousin. Saladin, who had wanted to marry Edith Plantagenet himelf as part of an overall peace treaty, graciously yields to his friend Kenneth/David and gives the young couple the talisman as a wedding present.Where is the philosophy? In his first encounter with Kenneth, Saladin, a Kurd, reveals his traditional belief that Kurds descend from a mixture of demons and beautiful mortal women, from evil and good, that these qualities war in Kurds forever and that even conversion to Islam does not make Kurds honor their demon ancestors the less. Islam allows Kurds to hope the demons will be converted to light in the end. There is much of the dualism of Iranian Zoroastrianism in the novel, a variant of Scott's often repeated view that in every turning point of history, good wars with and defeats evil, but never utterly, never completely-- and rightly so. -OOO-"},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"Reading Walter Scott is a bittersweet experience, as we admire his adroit and nimble use of our English language, even as we mourn our modern-day loss of appreciation for such skill. His characters, as always, are credible and rich. His vivid depiction of the stormy King Richard stands among his best. Richard's Muslim healing sage ever speaks with quiet, fiery wisdom. Predictably, Kenneth the Scot is the true hero -- humble, strong, and bravehearted. Considering that the story is burdened with battles that almost happen, love affairs that never quite consummate, and mystical scenes that never truly resolve, this classic book nevertheless holds the reader captive throughout, and delivers a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"This is one of Scott's best novels, (my favorite being \\"The Antiquary\\"). Set in the 12th century, two men meet in the desert, an armored crusader and a brilliant arabian-mounted bow-weilding horseman. They do battle, only to become friends. The Catholic and the Moslem come to respect each other. Sir Kenneth, the crusader goes on to join the camp of Richard the Lionhearted, and his mysterious desert friend comes, time after time to his aid. In the end, well, I don't want to give away all the surpises. Usually I read the end first, but this was so good I didn't take the time to, and was quite surprised in the end. Scott's novels don't all have a happy ending, so this one gets an extra gold star. ;)"},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"Scott's classic tale of the Crusade is a product of his Victorian times with endless hidden relationships and disguises reminiscent of Dickens' Pickwick Papers. No one is who you think they are and if they are, they aren't on the side you expected. Also, there are no battles, this is a Crusade of philosophical discussions, mystery, scientific discovery, romance, crime, and mistaken identity.Richard of England has tenuous leadership of a band of Templars, Scotsmen, French, German, and assorted mercenaries in a Holy Crusade to recover Jerusalem from the Infidels. During the time of this story, a truce is in place and Richard is near death with a mysterious fever. As this was a time of great patriotic fervor, trouble breaks out in the allied camps when various national flags are desecrated. All part of a plan for the other allied leaders to become supreme over the near-dead Richard.Fortunately, Richard recovers with the help of an Infidel medical man. To really liven things up, the Royal women then join the camp, including Richard's charming young consort. Various alliances are contemplated, all including marriage proposals as their contractual binder. A very brave young Scotsman turns out to be a person of greater standing than advertised.All in all, a very enjoyable novel. Dont expect to learn any actual history from Scott. It is not true that Richard and Saladin were allied, however briefly, against the Templars and the Austrians. It is true that all held Richard in great respect and that the Infidels were very advance in the scientific and medical arts."},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"An excellent book! Very informative historical fiction, gripping plot, lofty descriptions. It deserves it's name of classic, and I am thrilled that it is back in print!"},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"I really enjoyed The Talisman by Sir Walter Scott. I really like Scott's style of writing,and his characters are interesting and humorous. Richard the Lionhearted, and his wife Berengaria, another famous person, along with Soldan Saladin, ruler of the Arabs at the time, are characters. the talisman takes place during a the Third Crusade at a time of brief piece between the Christians and the Saracens. So even though there are no great battles in the story, the book is still full of action and humor. One thing that some of the less philosophically minded readers might object to is that at the beginning of the book the main character and a Saracen warrior get into a long, long, long discussion about the differences between the Christian and Saracen cultures. I found the discussion very interesting, but some people might be bored by it. Just a warning. Stick to it, though--The Talisman is a great book."},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"Heroes and cowards, loyalty and deceit, Europeans and Arabs, knights and dwarfs; Sir Walter Scott covers it all in The Talisman. If you're looking for an intricate plot with strange twists and turns; this isn't the book for you. The story starts with the classic duel of mortal combat between two extremely different foes that, of course, ends with each opponent realizing that he cannot destroy the other. In the end, the outcome of this battle turns out to be more significant than the reader knows. Centered around an unknown Scottish knight during the 3rd crusade and his hunt for glory, the plot is simple and predictible. It isn't until the end when every identity is revealed that you realize the depth of the plot. Somehow, Scott uses the unique setting, odd small events, poetic dialog, and conflicting cultures to keep the readers attention. Most of the characters in the book turn out not to be as they seem and the plot follows suit. The moral of the story is not to judge a book by its cover and the point is driven home by the sappy, flowery picture on the front that has nothing to do with the book."},{"Title":"The Talisman","review":"I had looked for this title for years before ordering it through Amazon; I'm so glad that it's back in print. This is historical fiction at its best: the action is fast-paced, the authorial voice is constantly garnishing the narrative with little observations and commentaries, and one can sense that Scott has a profound respect for Saladin, despite the execration in which Infidels were held, both at the time of the Crusades, and even in the early Nineteenth Century when the book was written. I recommend this book, especially for connoisseurs of Sir Walter Scott. I'm sorry to say that his only other novel I've read is *Ivanhoe*, but this one certainly stands with *Ivanhoe* as a true classic."},{"Title":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition: Primary Care Version","review":"Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex.

The descriptions of the country are phenomenal and place you in the country! Having been to many of the places that the author describes I can attest to the accuracy. He also does an amazing job describing the political situation, the corruption that is indemic to the nation and the problems that the common Afghan faces as the nation transitions to a representative democracy. The author does a very good job of explaining the difficulties faced when trying to change villages that are akin to what was found during Medieval times. One particularly good depiction is found in the quote, \\"Yet in some sense, it's absurd to expect the capital to effectively manage the countryside; the central government can hardly handle itself.\\" Although the author is obviously one of the privledged class of Afghans in that he can afford to travel from California back to Kabul for three consequtive summers, he still manages to accurately describe the issues faced by the exceptionally poor and illiterate majority of the citizens of Afghanistan. I would strongly recommend this novel to anyone interesting in gaining a very good perspective of the country, the villages, the government and the problems facing all of the nations that are contributing fiscal resources and their daughters and sons in an effort to transition Afghanistan from a failed State to some sort of democracy."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"The book's title was intriguing and it did not disappoint!In fact, I kept turning to the back cover to check the photo of the teenager, Said Hyder Akbar, in amazement.

Not because it was an easy read, but because I couldn't *stop* reading it."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"This book will take its place among my favorite books about Afghanistan. The author has an amazing story of three summers spent helping his father in Afghanistan after September 11th and the fall of the Taliban. Said Hyder Akbar's father brought his family to Pakistan and then America after the Soviet invasion but worked with the Mujahudeen during the Soviet occupation. His father knew Hamid Karzai and worked as his press secretary (2002) and then governor of Kunar (2003-2004). Said Hyder Akbar started coming over to work with his father starting the summer of his junior year in High School.Being raised in America allows him to communicate the unique culture of Afghanistan to a US audience in a very accessible way. Having spent a year working with the Afghan Army I was fascinated to hear the perspective of someone would could articulate the perspective of ordinary Afghans interacting with US Soldiers and trying to rebuild their country.Said Hyder Akbar's writing has great humor and candidness about it. His descriptions of the complex issues his father faced in governing a remote province on the Pakistan border are fascinating and illuminating of the problems that face rebuilding all of Afghanistan. He brings out the struggle and weariness of the people who have fought for over two decades and just want to have life without war. As noted above his description of the difficulties faced by US soldiers in interacting with an unfamiliar culture are spot on and very perceptive.This book was written with Susan Burton of This American Life and anyone who likes this radio (and now TV) program will recognize the wit and power of that show in this book. It is a must read for any westerner who wishes to have a better understanding of the Afghan culture."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"The author is an insider because his father is governor of Kunar province and his family is part of an elite group of educated Afghans who mingle with President Karzai and other leaders. In no other personal memoir in English about Afghanistan do Afghans figure so prominently. The author is an outsider because he grew up in California and never even went to Afghanistan until he was in high school. The observations he makes about Afghanistan are therefore very accessible. A very personal, moving story which I highly recommmend for anyone trying to understand the cultural context in Afghanistan as well as the difficulties of bringing governance to the provincial and local levels."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"After reading this book, I felt I had a better understanding of the situation in Afghanistan.

In this book the US pre and post 9-11 history is inextricably interlaced with Afghanistan's. They get a 9-11 over and over again. In getting a look how Afghanistan is we also get a bigger look at our current world.The book is deeply inspiring and sad too. It should be required reading for all high school students. A study question should be where are the woman. Another question should be is why so many of us do not follow our dreams like Hyder does.Hyder, in finding himself also shows us so much between the lines about Afghanistan and this country's greatness and warts. He is modest about his real contributions leaving that for the dust jacket."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"Yesterday a friend asked what I was reading.I just finished 'Come Back to Afghanistan: My Journey from California to Kabul' written by Said Hyder Akbar, a 20-year old college student in California. Like many others, Akbar's story is a migrating one - from Afghanistan to Pakistan, India, and then the USA.When the Taliban were ousted in 2001, Akbar's father, a long time friend of President Hamid Karzai decided to go back to Afghanistan. Akbar started coming with him on his school and college breaks, and got back in touch with his country that he had left a long time ago. It's a homecoming of sorts.The book is brilliant. Written with the assistance of journalist Susan Brunton, Akbar takes us into corners and niches that few books on Afghanistan do. It is deeply personal and highly political without the usual history, geography or other details. Born in Afghanistan and raised in the US, Akbar is able to straddle both countries and regions. He neither despairs nor scoffs at anyone or anytime. His writing is passionate, gentle and unassuming.Akbar's goal in Afghanistan is to be with his father and get to know his country. He travels with, among other things, a tape recorder, and makes programmes for National Pubic Radio in California. He interviews the person in the highest office - President Karzai - as well as his driver, Sartor. He listens to everyone and judges none. During the two years he goes back and forth, Akbar's brother and mother visit Afghanistan. His father is appointed as the Governor of the province of Kunar, a remote and troubled area, where the family collects and lives together.Through sickness and health Akbar goes through the journeys he charts for himself. His writing is sensitive and engaging. It never strays or lags. It is clear that he loves Afghanistan, is sensing what his relationship with his old land is, and how it will develop. He is conscious of the contradictions within himself.When I think about why I liked the book so much, and the experience of reading the book, I feel it its so akin to my time in Afghanistan. Without being able to speak the language (Dari an Pashto), I communicated with those I could, in Urdu, Hindi and English. I reached out to the humanity in them, and they in turn, reached out to mine.In the final analysis the book is about being reconciled to where we come from. No matter where we are, our multiple identities always call us to the land we were born, and we yearn to return. That has been my experience too.The book also describes the Afghan situation - the challenges to the Afghan people, the leaders, the donor community and Americans stationed in Afghanistan and back home. It presents everyone's reality. Akbar's strength is his ability to see what is happening, from many perspectives, and present it in a dispassionate way.In a growing body of literature on Afghanistan, Akbar's will enjoy a place of pride. It's young, passionate, and terribly easy to read."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"What a wonderful experience to find a book written by a student at a community college, Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, CA.What Hyder is experiencing is also what community college students often are after - finding out who they are, where they are supposed to be, looking for those second and third chances.Hyder's literary voice is already well developed despite his youth, no doubt because of the rich life experience he already has.I recommend this book to anybody interested not only in uncensored information on what really is going on in Afghanistan, but also to those of of us who are bridging countries and continents by being born in one and living in another."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"The beginning of the book where he had talked about the plane parts in the airport, really got me to read it.

For instance: If you knew what was happening in Afghanistan why did you still choose to go there. I would not have because I wou;d've been afraid to go there and something happen to me. I really liked your writing style and how you described the bombing and crossing into Pakistand.

The most striking thing about this book is that, by the time you have finished reading it, you will care very deeply about what has happened, and IS happening, in Afghanistan. At times very touching and sad, and at other times very funny, this is a very moving, emotionally-charged and honest book."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"Wow, this book was magnificent. It reveals Afghanistan in a way that I've never seen before (and I've read about extensively this country), giving the readers great insight into the past and present situation of the country. What I most enjoyed about this book was how, because of the unique and compelling viewpoint from which this story is told, it manages to be an informative and entertaining read at the same time.Akbar writes with incredible details that help make this often stereotyped land come alive, and his background as an American teenager can make some of his anecdotes surprisingly funny. One of the more memorable parts of the book for me was when Hyder, arriving home having just survived an ambush with American Special Forces, decides to tell his father about what happened and gets reprimanded by his father for cutting off a meeting he was in - it was too trivial an issue, his father thought.His adventures inside the country make this an exciting read, but what was more appealing for me was how he seems to keep his objectivity throughout his extended stays in Afghanistan. Whether he is talking to Americans or villagers or the President, Akbar doesn't seem to have an agenda and it really comes through in this book.I definitely recommend this book especially for people who want to obtain a better understanding of Afghanistan, its people, and the current US involvement in the country."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"I was intrigued after hearing the author as a special correspondent on NPR's Morning Edition.

She and I were both very impressed by the maturity and skill of this young author. We had both just finished reading the novel The Kite Runner which is set in Afghanistan. Said does a masterful job of viewing Afghanistan from both the perspective of an American and of a native son which makes the read both enjoyable and enlightening. My mother, who has very limited experience with other cultures and is very conservative, was quite moved by the dilemma of the people of Afghanistan.

The kid camehere around age 2 and has been totally Northern CA\\"Americanized\\" over in East Bay in Concord area (SFO Bay Area) and had never been to Afghanistan before because he was bornafter his family had gotten out, and was born inPakistan. Before his first trip over, he was given a mike and lots of tapes to be a teen reporter for a Teen news service. He got better and better equipment including video with eachcoming summer.The first summer was spent in Kabul because his fatherwas the acting media/press spokesperson for thePresident or acting President of Afghanistan. By thetime he returned the next summer, his Dad was now theGovernor of Kunar on the Pakistan Border and by amilitary base that has been a military base forcenturies. The Americans are just the most recentoccupants and this is where the Al Quaida go back andforth over the border up in the mountains betweenPakistan and Afghanistan too.This kid is fluent in Dari, and Pashtu and AmericanEnglish with all the slang and he is a little youngerthan a lot of the recruits. He begins acting as aninterperter and goes out with the Military to villagesand so on. He is also present at some interrogationsbecause he is better and faster and in a big sensemore trusted than the hired interpreters who do notknow American English as well as this kid.I learned more from this book than all the other booksabout Afghanistan put together. I can not stressenough how important this book is for anyone who isinterested in what's been going on in Afghanistansince the US arrived after the bombings in October2001.My own personal opinion is that this kid is actuallyolder than he is and might not even know it. He istotally computer/internet/ebay shopping savvy andbefore he ever went to Afghanistan he got hold of allthe books he could to learn the past history of it andwanted to know all the politics through the years andwith this grasp of the past and all the tribal andcultural differences, he arrived for the first time inhis parents' country with an astute knowledge of thepast, more so than most kids who had never been out ofthe USA would have been. His goal is to graduate fromUC Berkeley with a degree in Business, then get hisMBA and depending on the situation in Afghanistan, goback over and work in that government like his Dad isdoing. (His Dad ran Radio Kabul before the SovietInvasion and after until it was totally shutdown,etc.)In the Afghanistan culture, dates like date of birth,weeks, months, years, do not mean anything and it comes out at one point in the book that his father routinely had this habit of just making up arbitrary dates when filling out official and/or governmental forms like for immigration. While supposely his mother knew/remembers the actual dates, this is the most mature high school senior I've ever heard of. He gave up his high school prom and graduation with all his friends and classmates because getting over to Afghanistan was more important than that. What usual teen would give up a class trip to some beach/resort locale? He did that too, because getting to Afghanistan was more important. So he might be even older than he realizes; he sure acts like it. What he knows and says just really blows you away as far as your preconceptions about the mind of ateenager.He was working as an aide to his father and was givena lot more responsibility than any other kid wouldhave been given and he was working with the USMilitary to make their lives a lot easier when doingthe translations, etc. A lot of major stuff went downduring his stay and so you have a front seat to thisfrom this kid's book/memoir.I highly recommend this book. The others I've readare all memoirs too and about their families'struggles under the Soviets/Communists mostly andtheir escape to Pakistan and eventual coming to theUSA or Canada and the adjustment there to their newlives and such. This kid grew up American but had theAfghanistan languages and cultural norms to be able toadjust to what life is like today over there and beable to relate to the Afganis in the villages, etc.And this one talks about what the Military is doingoverthere too and how they do what they do, too. Sothis is the one to read for many reasons."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"Hyder is a most exceptional teenager. He speaks English, Dari and Pashtu, and spends his summer vacations helping his father rebuild Afganistan. That he will meet his college language requirement by studying French... as though the world is crying for French translators... is only one anomaly of his eventful young life.Hyder describes the dangerous, grinding work of rebuilding Afganistan. I hope Young (and Senior)Akbar can keep enthusiasm because their country needs them and they are in a unique position to serve.I believe there is more consensus in the US for Afgan assistance than almost any issue out there, but Hyder doesn't encounter much reconstruction. Everytime we see the US, it's a military presence, and the encounters are less than desireable.Failures on the micro level - Soldiers give a village a pipe so that they can build a water supply - Karsai's US bodyguards contradict him in front of others - Hyder's dad, governor of a province, close personal friend of Karsai, father of American citizens, has to be searched to enter a US military base.On the macro level is the fate of Abdul Wali. It's unclear why he's presumed to have information or to be guilty of something. But, Adbul Wali, father of 15 children, (29 years old?) can't tell us why or how he died in US custody, setting back credibility for the US and Karsai. We meet people who lose loved ones in what is commonly called \\"collateral damage\\" or \\"friendly fire\\".We drive with Hyder through roadless places and climb surreptitiously into Pakistan. He recounts the nuances of the first post Taliban Loya Jirga (missling the big point the female reps). We get insight into how a tiny country manages an international media, the appointment processes, how UN workers will accept triage in its voting registration process if local officials let them, the legacy of the comminist era, warlords and notables.We learn how opportunitsts like Malik Zarin play the US troops like a fiddle... just call your enemies Taliban!Afganistan only makes headlines when there is an explosion. Where is our tax money going? What do we have to show for the post-Taliban dollars and human lives that have been spent? HOW do we support Karsai, his cabinet and his governors? In this book, the only Americans are in the military or with the press. WHAT are they doing over there?This book should be required reading for any soldier or official in Afganistan or Iraq and be highly recommended for anyone even thinking about nation building anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"Come Back to Afghanistan: A California Teenager's Story","review":"Said Hyder Akbar is a surprisingly strong writer for his age. The way that he leads the reader into this exotic world is amazing. One genuinely gets to feel some of the things that are in the news as far as the conflict near Pakistan's border. Although the book was written in 2006 many of his observations ring true to this day. If you are interested in Afghanistan/Pakistan make sure to read this book becuase it will not dissapoint you."},{"Title":"La Oreja Rota (Adventures of Tintin Ser.)","review":"Since this is the Spanish version of the \\"Broken Ear\\" (L'Oreille Cass&eacute;e), this review will go in Spanish.La Oreja Rota es uno de los primeros libros de Tintin (1937), aun no aparecen personajes se&ntilde;eros como el Capit&aacute;n Haddock o el Profesor Tornasol, pero ya se nos muestra un Tint&iacute;n m&aacute;s definido y una l&iacute;nea argumental m&aacute;s s&oacute;lida y coherente que las de las anteriores entregas, aunque sin alcanzar cumbres como las que encontramos, por ejemplo, en \\"el Cetro de Ottokarr\\".En esta ocasi&oacute;n Tint&iacute;n parte a Sudam&eacute;rica en busca de un &iacute;dolo hurtado a un museo. En las aventuras que correr&aacute; por la selva (&iquest;amaz&oacute;nica?), nos denuncia la fragilidad y crueldad de los gobiernos de la Latinoam&eacute;rica de esos a&ntilde;os, la descarada ingerencia de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as estadounidenses en los asuntos de estado de esos pa&iacute;ses que so&ntilde;aban con la verdadera independencia, y la mezcla de buena onda y melancol&iacute;a que, en diversas proporciones, se puede encontrar a lo largo de este magn&iacute;fico continente.El relato sigue la t&iacute;pica inocencia profunda de Tint&iacute;n, que tanto ha encantado a generaci&oacute;n tras generaci&oacute;n, constituyendo una bocanada de aire puro en un mundo ultrasofisticado como el que que nos ha tocado vivir.El libro se lo compr&eacute; a mi hija de 8 a&ntilde;os, que lo ha disfrutado con pasi&oacute;n, tal como yo lo hice a su misma edad.Cinco estrellas bien merecidas."},{"Title":"Cat on the Mat (Oxford Reading Tree Branch Lib)","review":"This book is for the beginning reader.

In the meantime, Ms. Bivan' book is a treat. Very thoroughly researched, and nicely illustrated. Many black and white photo. Some color photos, but it definitely could use more, and from a larger range of years. My complaint was that it seemed a &quot;puff piece&quot;, written by someone a little too closely involved with the MAO program -- and therefore lost some objectivity in reporting of some pageant scandals of yore -- and let's face it, those are some of the most fun in a pageant history book. Nonetheless, this is clearly a work of love on Miss Bivan's part, and a must for anyone who is a Miss America devotee.

Roberts keeps the theme of self-discovery going with personal insights to the young Prince, his companion and a brief look into the mind of Hael's enemy.Again, Roberts' theme of self-discovery is the core of the book. The action and descriptives are wonderful, and I particularly enjoy all the touches of primitive technology and the implementations of technology, new and lost in a primitive society."},{"Title":"Chattooga: Descending into the Myth of Deliverance River","review":"Once again, John Lane has succeeded in writing a book that really connects with the regular fan of the wilderness with a desire to read.

It so clearly and randomly gives full inspiration and guidance to all who strive daily to feel that need to fill themselves with desensitized toxic moments.

Enjoy being yourself is unfortunately something that for most of us has never been experienced. Carol has been given the magical moments of inspiration to show us how to achieve the serenity and joy in our lives that we all deserve.

It is interesting, well-written and entertaining throughout, with each chapter finishing with a few straightforward questions and exercises to move you on in the right direction. Part three, &quot;deep water&quot;, deals masterfully with the darker and more difficult experiences one sometimes has while trying to connect more deeply with the soul's purpose.A major theme is developing an awareness of synchronicity (meaningful co-incidence) experiences as guiding posts for deeper personal development. There are a large number of interviews with people from a wide range of backgrounds, all of whom have come to find their unique purpose through such ideas. Quotes from the famous such as the Dalai Lama and Frank Zappa (!), and not so famous are also highlighted throughout the text e.g.&quot;intuition is the creative, universal intention expressing through you&quot; and &quot;either I am lost, crazy and screwed up, or I am found and on a difficult part of the path&quot;.I found the chapter on &quot;the void&quot; particularly supportive, especially the section on &quot;holding your centre during confusion, chaos and fear&quot;.

I liked all of the stories and the author's own anecdotes about creating good fortune."},{"Title":"The Purpose of Your Life: Finding Your Place In The World Using Synchronicity, Intuition, And Uncommon Sense","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone struggling with their life purpose.

It teaches one to open up to the &quot;gut instincts&quot; we all experience and have been taught to ignore. I for one became more aware of what life had in store for me - mainly by acknowledging my intuition and repetitive messages.Carole Adrienne's stories and life experience are fascinating. I for one would not be able to drop everything in pursuit of what life had in store for me. That in itself is the challenge we all face and part of the message this book brings - having the courage to listen to what we are being told and what we FEEL. Then acting on it!One of my favorite books of 1999."},{"Title":"The Purpose of Your Life: Finding Your Place In The World Using Synchronicity, Intuition, And Uncommon Sense","review":"Sigh. I thought this book was going to be very good based upon the reviews, and expected it to contain lots of exercises for developing intuition. I thought it was a workbook, but it's not. It's basically a collection of really long stories about other people from far away lands who discovered their soul mate while drinking tea in a zen garden, or that were offered a great job out of nowhere after completing university in India and touring the country to feed the poor (hard to do if you yourself are poor and lack education). It is about people with names like boona cheena (she prefers her name be spelled in lowercase letters. I know this because the author of this fascinating book told me so). Some of the stories are inspiring, and there are useful techniques in this book, but the problem is that the techniques are buried. Buried in language that appears overly flowery in its attempt to convey spirituality. Example - the author on boona cheena: \\"listening to the events that shaped her life, I was struck by the obvious purposefulness behind the early experiences of this deeply spiritual and focused woman.\\" Uhhh, yah, OBVIOUS, so why is the story SO LONG, and how does it help one who is confused about their path? Most of us have not had our foreheads touched by the Dalai Lama. I'd appreciate the stories if they were fewer and shorter, and made a clear connection to something tangible that can be applied to my own purpose. Short and concise, that is key. There are a few good exercises, but many are fill-in-the-blanks and circle-the-most-appropriate. This book would be more effective if it were 150 pages instead of 300."},{"Title":"The Purpose of Your Life: Finding Your Place In The World Using Synchronicity, Intuition, And Uncommon Sense","review":"This is a great book! The book has a really wonderful insight on how to explore the gentle energy of life as you twist in your own wonder. It will contour the dreams of your future.

This book will help you discover your own life purposes."},{"Title":"The Purpose of Your Life: Finding Your Place In The World Using Synchronicity, Intuition, And Uncommon Sense","review":"This is a pretty good book, and I'd definitely say it's worth a look. You can't go wrong with the ideas. But in addition to buying this one, you might want to take a look at TEN WORDS THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE by Ervin Seale. That book's a real eye opener, because it explains the laws of the universe in such simple terms, you can't help seeing where your thinking's been all screwed up and how you've been blocking your heart's desire."},{"Title":"Wallace Stevens: Musing The Obscure","review":"If you are a fan of Stevens's poetry, or, especially, if you are just starting to read his work, this book needs to be on your shelf. The poems of Wallace Stevens are often difficult, and the beginning reader can be tempted to give up in despair. That's a shame, because his poetry is worth the trouble, repays the effort, and it will do so over the rest of your life. Sukenick's book is essentially a straightforward translation manual, and a very good one. Not every poem is found here, but a great many are, including most of the best and most well-known. Sukenick will greatly add to your understanding and enjoyment of what you are reading, and through it you will begin to crack the various aspects of the Stevens Code. Then, fledged, you will begin to fly on your own. It's a flight worth taking."},{"Title":"April Fool's Day: A Novel","review":"Slasher films aren't generally regarded for their sense of logic. APRIL FOOL'S DAY takes the typical ... teens, bizarre killings, and oddly-costumed killer of the genre and adds some decent characterization and a plot filled with more twists than a corkscrew.The story focusses on a group of friends invited to an island mansion for the weekend. It's not long before an unseen killer starts picking them off one by one. Is it real, or just another prank on April Fool's day? Read the book and find out - provided you can find a copy.Jeff Rovin's wonderful prose digs into the characters' heads and slowly builds tension before a hair-raising climax that's only the beginning of the end. Several more chapters follow, adding a new twist to the story.Is the film good? Can't say. I haven't seen it. But the book reads like the teen thrillers of Cristopher Pike or R.L. Stine. So, if your a fan of thrillers, chillers, or just plain blood spillers, I'd definitely recommend a read."},{"Title":"April Fool's Day: A Novel","review":"April Fool's Day by Jeff Rovin is a brilliant and unnatural slasher novel in tradition of Fred Walton's film. The novelization delivers the perfect slasher cliches: a bunch of teenaged characters, an unknown killer and the characters being killed off one-by-one while everyone is partying and drinking. The novelization adds about forty pages that stray away from the film. Those forty pages add a more sinister, twisted ending that never surfaced to the final cut of the film. The novel aligns itself to the production itself, but has connections to other films. The films it shares a large connection with are: Scream Series (including 4) and Slaughter High, Happy Birthday To Me, Sorority Row, Nightmare on Elm Street and Black Christmas. If you liked this novel, I suggest these films to you. The novelization left you in complete suspense and the transformed ending sent chills down your spine! If you like novels with twists and turns, bloody slashings and provocative, voluptuous teenagers then April Fool's Day is for you! I strongly reccommend this novel and officially call this my favorite novel of all time!"},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Dr. Oliver Sacks, the well-known neurologist and author of the best-selling books, Awakenings, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, and An Anthropologist on Mars, brings us into his world as he journeys to Oaxaca, Mexico with a group of naturalists and botanical aficionados, all passionate about ferns.Some readers may stop here, as the study and discussion of ferns would be only a remotely interesting topic to most people. However, Dr. Sacks is quite adept at pulling readers into his world by describing a wide variety of other topics in a fascinating and interesting manner. Thus it is, that - through him - we see and better understand his botanical colleagues and the passion they all have for exotic ferns and the beautiful vegetation of Southern Mexico.Using his lightly edited travel journal as his manuscript, Sacks delves into the history, geography, and rich cultural heritage of Oaxaca, Mexico. It through brief cultural discussions of Zapotec culture, anthropology, and foods of the region and we better understand, not only the role of ferns, but also how the potato, tomato, wide varieties of beans and maize, and the hundreds of species of peppers from the region influence the meals of Mexicans and Europeans alike.A good bedside book as reading it is like having a leisurely conversation with a brilliant, but humble and caring genius, keen himself on being a good conversationalist and colleague.R. Neil ScottMiddle Tennessee State University"},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"This is a delightful read on many levels that need not be reiterated given the comments from previous reviewers. Sacks' style is inviting and relaxing. The inner child is nourished by simple curiosity in how the world works, from the smallest sporophytic fern to the resilence of ancient cultures challenged by the modern world. I want to go to Oaxaca and I want to know more about ferns. One could only hope to find such a travel companion as Sacks and his fern nerds."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Dr. Sacks allow the reader to take a pleasant mental journey to a fascinating place, Oaxaca, Mexico. I appreciated the artistry of honest reflection and blending history of place, culture, flora and science. So the insight was not just of Oaxaca but of tidbits of information on a broad range of topics. Perfect for those with intellectual curiosity - one could take each chapter and find a topic to research via the internet and come away much more enlightened. By the way, I decided to read this book after enjoying the visual journal:Diario de Oaxaca: A Sketchbook Journal of Two Years in Mexico- by artist, Peter Kuper."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"A friend mentioned this book because I'm going to Oaxaca, Mexico soon. I skipped over much of the botanical information, although it was well written. My interest was in his vivid descriptions of the landscape and attractions in the State of Oaxaca. It was a quick, pleasant read and very informative."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"... or for the wonderful Mexican city Oaxaca, or if you're planning a trip there, or if you know already that you enjoy the writings of Oliver Sacks, then I have no doubt at all that you'll relish this 150-page excursion into science, history, plazas, and the assorted reflections of a 66-year-old traveler. Otherwise, you might not find the focus or detect the tenor of Sacks's \\"Journal\\". The author declares in his preface that the book is a scarcely revised selection of pages from the journal he kept as part of an excursion by members of the American Fern Society to the city and state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, a region that stretches across rain forests, cloud forests, deserts, and densely populated farmlands, and that supports an amazing variety of ferns and other 'primitive' plants. The other members of the AFS party were each and all fascinating personages, whom Sacks portrays with relish. All I can say is that I wish I'd been there, and you will also, after reading this book.A quick read, the sort of book you might take on a long flight! Sacks's cogitations on the subject of co-evolution are especially stimulating, and of course the frightful ecological prospects for regions of immense diversity, like Oaxaca, in the next few decades of global warming and pollution are not unmentioned."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Some chapters are a delight to read- a very frank and engaging take by the author on his observations and thoughts. Other chapters seem a tad self-contained and unbalanced, with way too much attention and emphasis given to a particular observation or subject. Given that it's a jouranl though, one reasonably expects that the jottings penned would have a bit of a subjective emphasis and a slightly idiosyncratic feel."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Once again, Oliver Sacks takes us into his world. A tenacious scribbler, he carries us on a journey back to the timeless world of nature. Quick to tell us of his passion for ferns, he recounts his journey to Oaxaca, Mexico with his collegues who share his fascination.On one level, we are treated to a kaeidoscope of hundreds of exotic ferns and their latin names he and his frends find in the lush vegetation of Mesoamerica. Not being a fern lover myself, I marvel at the intrigue of the hunt for these living fossils, objects from the distant world of time and creation before the advent of humanity. One would expect that such trivia would bore the reader, but no, Sacks absorbs us in his fascination with the varieties of these creature; he takes us along in the narrative by his marvel with discovery.At another level, Sacks enters the world of Oaxaca. He treats us to the rich culture of the region. He regails us with tales of the potato, the tomato, the bean, maise and pepper. He describes the ageless Oaxacan cuisine that nourishes his fellow pilgrims and the people of the region. The rubber ball of the Zatopec culture and the games played with it especially intrigues him. And his delightful descriptions of the delicious Oaxacan chocolate in all its forms stimulates mouthwatering longing for a taste. More importantly, he tells us of the people who lived in the region and bore the brunt of the Spanish Conquistadores. One is treated to the rich history of the Mesoamerican civilizations that rivaled Rome and Athens. Yet, Oaxaca's civiliztion achieved greatness while being innocent of the wheel, iron, compass, and alphabet. Sacks tells us of his confusion as a Westerner entering this world where his reference points create discontinuity.Sacks marvels at the breadth and scope of his companions' erudition. He tells us of their vigor and clarity of mind, some of whom are into their seventh decade. Most of all, he tells us of the comfort of being among fellow scientists and friends who enjoy each others company that is devoid of the competitiveness and the rush of living in the in the rapid paced world at home.He ends his tale by describing the idyllic surroundings of their last meal together beneath bald cypresses on the banks of a river. They were treated to estafado de pollo, a chicken stew in almond sauce and mole amarillo, with pork spiced with yerba santa and pitiona, all washed down with copious amounts of refreshing hot cinnamon-flavored Oaxacan chocolate!"},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"What an odd little book. Just as he was finishing writing the brilliant UNCLE TUNGSTEN professor of nuerology Oliver Sachs joins an eleven day journey to Oaxaca with a band of botantists the putative purpose of which is to study ferns. Now Oliver likes ferns; he is a member of the American Fern Society and appreciates the antiquity and remarkable adaptability of ferns as much as the average guy (ok--the average, brilliant botanist). The book is replete with charming drawings of ferns and lots of Latin names and fernish descriptions. But it isn't really about ferns.It is also a quite wonderful description of this special section of southern Mexico. As well as describing the tremendous variety of plant life found in this Mexican state he also is stunned by the variety of food. One restaurant has well over 100 dishes none the same and few immediately recognizable to his North American eye. Sachs tosses in a good deal of history--of the ancient Aztecs, Toltecs, Zapotecs and Mayans as well as Cortez and the conquering Spaniards. He also passes on a few pointed comments about the church and the modern disaster that is Mexican government. He is intrigued by Oaxaca and thinks about the necessity of returning. But this book isn't really about Oaxaca or Mexico herself.The thirty plus botantists on this tour are an soortment of gays, lesbians, heterosexuals--all in couples save Sachs. He remarks that he has always been a loner--never really part of a couple. One night after drinking a lot of mescal they all ascend a mountaintop to observe a lunar ecliipse. Sachs enjoys the joking and camaraderie immensely, but as the eclipse approaches totality he goes off by himself to best appreciate the event. Almost through the trip he finds himself feeling oddly. After much reflection he decides that he must be feeling joy--because of the adventure, the scientific richness of all he sees, the new experience of Mexico; and, to some degree, because he feels part of a group. And that, I think, is the heart of this book. A brilliant but lonesome man finds sustenance and joy in the company of his peers. An odd, but absolutely charming, little book."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Sometime during the writing of his well regarded book &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot;, Neurologist Oliver Sacks took a 12 day trip to state of Oaxaca (pronounced wah-HOCK-ah) in southern Mexico ostesibly for the purpose of observing and cataloging ferns with members of the American Fern Society- to which he belongs. Oaxaca Journal is the Author's first person account of the delighful little adventure that resulted.Because of the Author's boundless curiosity about pretty much everything, the trip becomes more than just a fern collecting odyssey. To the searching eye of Sacks, a simple midmorning sitting alone at a cafe table in a town square, becomes a rumination on human tolerance for sun and shadow. A visit to the Ancient Meso-American city of Monte Alban becomes an excuse to probe into the curious history of rubber- which the Zapotec people used to make their heavy sport balls for their own unique form of basketball. Casually encountered botanical names are savored for their historical baggage and contribution to language and culture. And each new plant Sacks and his travelling companions encounter sparks a conversation which could end up touching on just about any realm of human experience.Sacks' travelling companions are a particular delight; intelligent, well read, boundlessly enthusiastic, they are the sort of people one dreams of having along on trips to casually recount tidbits of history, science, and cuture to enrich the experience. Anyone belonging to a club with a scientific or academic bent, will recognize the combination of passion and quirkiness in the author's new friends.Fans of the casual, digression laden, style James Burke's &quot;Connections&quot; books or of the popular recent books on single subjects, such as Mark Pendergrast's &quot;Uncommon Grounds&quot; and Mark Kurlansky's &quot;Salt&quot;, will probably enjoy Oaxaca Journal. These books are typically pretexts for digressions into juicy and fascinating anecdotes from the nooks and crannies of human history and knowledge.In a way, the author's vivid account of his trip reads like a book length &quot;National Geographic&quot; article. There's no real agenda or underlying theme. The confluence of experiences that the trip allows to happen is point. In this sense, like the best travel writers, Sacks teaches his reader a way of traveling- that is, a way of searching and savoring our fascinating world.Oaxaca Journal is a pithy 162 pages- with a generous amount of white space included. I would have liked to have seen more text- but I suppose that that would not fit in with the brief nature of the trip in which there was enough experience to tanatalize, but not delve deeply. The entire work could be savored during a long airport layover on the way to an exotic travel destination- which I think would provide the perfect lesson for how to proceed once arrived."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"Dr. Sacks accompanied a group of botanical friends on a trip to see, catalogue, draw, and take delight in the unparalleled variety of ferns in Oaxaca, Mexico. His resulting journal is a meditation on Zapotec culture, amateur naturalists, edible insects, psychedelics, and above all ferns: seemingly so fragile yet having survived, with little change, for over 300 million years.According to the author, his \\"sense of a prehistoric world, of immense spans of time, was first stimulated by ferns and fossil ferns.\\"For someone like myself who loves both ferns and the writings of Dr. Sacks, this journal is a treasure. It was composed under the blue sky of Oaxaca and filled with an emotion that Dr. Sacks admits is usually foreign to him: joy.The author is fond of reading natural history journals and he has created a multi-faceted gem of his own, out of observations on lost civilizations, mescal, cochineal insects, plants as rare as horsetails a hundred feet high, and others as common as the bracken fern.Half of our property in Michigan is covered with bracken ferns and I was always curious as to why insects didn't seem to bother them. According to this author, bracken is regarded as the 'Lucrezia Borgia' of the fern world: \\"the young fronds release hydrogen cyanide as soon as the insect's mandible tears into them, and if this does not kill or deter the bug, a much crueler poison lies in store. Brackens, more than any other plants, are loaded with hormones called ecdysones, and when these are ingested by insects, they cause uncontrollable molting.\\"The Romans used bracken on their stable floors because it arrested or perverted the development of fly larvae, although Dr. Sacks doesn't specify how the ancients kept the horses from eating their bedding. Bracken also poisons mammals, and humans who eat too many fiddle-heads over a long period of time are apt to develop stomach cancer.It is tempting to open up \\"Oaxaca Journal\\" and reread an essay equally as vivid as the riff on the 'Lucrezia Borgia of ferns.' There are so many choices. By writing a journal for the National Geographic 'Literary Travel Series,' Dr. Sacks has opened himself up to every conceivable subject under the blazing Mexican sun.There is indeed joy in this book."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"I finished reading this in 2 days. I couldn't put it down - wanted to keep reading so that I could turn each corner with the author and other members of this excursion and see what fern, bird, or historical artifact would be observed next. I loved the extra background history about foods, artifacts, architecture, etc. The book truly took me right along with the group on their fern-hunting trip into old Mexico.Thanks for taking me along as a stow-away. I can't wait to share this book with my reading group."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"This is a book about enthusiasm. A group of amateur enthusiasts (fern lovers, bird lovers, botanists) meet for a 10 day trip exploring the Mexican state of Oaxaca, which offers unusual and rare species due to its mountains and varied climate. This is a journal kept by one scientist/geek of the travels along with the other amateur/geeks. There is probably more about ferns here than you want to know, but it is not overwhelming. What really comes through is the excitement and enthusiasm these people have for something they love. A slight book at a stretched 160 pages, Sacks' journal of the trip has interesting insights into the Mexican culture and history, encounters with gun toting guards at road blocks, observations on children, pottery, nature, geology, love, tradition, an appreciation for enthusiastic people, and an encounter with semi-legendary figure living in the mountains. Early on he explains that most of the official discoveries in botany come from amateurs, and although the book won't make you want to collect ferns, it will encourage you to keep a journal on your next trip."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"This is a book for Oaxaca lovers and people who could BECOME Oaxaca lovers at the slightest provocation. Oliver Sacks, rummaging around in the history, natural history, geography, geology, anthropology and cuisine of this best-loved part of Mexico, and recording his thoughts, has answered many questions I have had about the place. Just for one example, through reading his book, I discovered that El Tule, the gigantic tree outside of town that everyone visits sooner or later, is a bald cypress and is probably at least 3000 years old. Neither fact is really clear from the information available at the site, perhaps losing something in translation. But the book is filled with such tidbits, and that's not all. Sacks and his fern-loving companions find a lot to enjoy in this old, stucco-walled, stone-paved city and the surrounding countryside. Some books make me wonder (and fear!) what the world is coming to. This book proclaims that all is not lost, since it focuses on things that have always brought hope to mankind, and perhaps represent our ultimate hope: the wonderful natural world and the many GOOD dimensions of the human mind...the many good humans. When a group of such people, intelligent, interested, interestING, and curious--as one reviewer said, exactly the kind of traveling companions one would like!--will take time from their lives and trek all the way to Oaxaca to look at ferns, the world becomes a better place, even if no one else knows about it. Thanks to Mr. Sacks, we do."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"After finishing this book, I am convinced that people who develop a passion for something, be it for career, avocation, or hobby, tend to live longer and are more frequently happy, and when they die, they die happy. I bet Oliver Sacks is one of these lucky people! Never cease to be fascinated--that is one key to happiness, and Sacks proves to us just that. Without question he is a Renaissance man, keen to share with us his enthusiasm for his profession (evident from his excellent prose in \\"The man who mistook...\\" and his other books) but stays open to ideas and activities that pique his interest, one of which is attending and participating in the New York Botanical Garden's Fern Society and embarking on a weeklong trip to Oaxaca, Mexico with a quirky cast of people whose common interest in ferns and other plants, and birds, transcend professions, economic status, nationality, and personal histories. The fact that the book was based on his travel journals that were written at the time of his trip and were left unedited made the reading experience more poignant and powerful. At the end you feel grateful for people who look \\"beyond the scenery\\", who take the time \\"to stop and smell the flowers\\", and who see the world almost with the same innocence as children, for they are the ones that make life richer, and perhaps even make the world a better place for the rest of us--and for future generations."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"This book has its own special charm. World- renowned psychologist and author Oliver Sacks takes a trip with members of the American Fern Society. He is an amateur here, but cannot conceal his respect for his fellow travelers, and his joy at being with them in the Mexican province of Oaxaca. Sacks describes his own childhood fascination with the work of Naturalists, and gives portraits of those avid students of specific botanical forms, those lovers of the smallest details of the natural world. For me however the Ferns and Sachs description were of secondary interest. I found his descriptions of his fellow travelers, his meditations on the history and culture of the area, his thoughts about himself and his role as perpetual single in a world of couples- more fascinating.The book is small but it is informed by a great intelligence and sensitivity . One passage I particularly enjoyed involved Sacks sitting alone and writing in a cafe in a central square of Oaxaca. He talks about the way Hemingway loved to write in cafes in the light of the day, and the way Auden closed himself into the darkness and kept all light out. He says he himself finds the cafe and the light congenial but above all loves the experience of writing on a moving train.In this book he moves beautifully through different levels of the natural and human world, and provides the reader with a pleasant and richly informative journal of his journey."},{"Title":"Oaxaca Journal","review":"I am a huge fan of Oliver Sack's writing. He brought so much interest, knowledge and \\"wow\\" to case writing and now, he is bringing it to ferns and travel writing. To tell you the truth, I would never have picked up a book about ferns and would have hated it if someone was so bold as to give me one as a present, but when I went to the bookstore to browse for some summer reading, I was intrigued to find this book.What initially got me was the graphic of the ferns on the cover. They reminded me of some food items at a fancy restaurant I had a while back. Paging through the book, I was intrigued by more wonderful graphics and finally by the fact that this was a travel journal. I rushed to the register and indulged in the first couple pages that very same afternoon.I enjoy travel writing - mainly because it gives such an intimate look into another person's observations, thoughts and experiences. Some travel writers are careful not to say too much, but Sacks gives it all to his readers. I so much enjoyed his very detailed descriptions of his friends, the natural landscape, the food and yes, the ferns. I walked the unpaved paths with him, put on my glasses to find yet to be discovered plants and listened to his conversations with his friends.This is a wonderful book. Sacks has a great way of keeping his readers engaged with stories of ferns and interesting facts about his travel companions. I highly recommend the book to all of the curious and open minded that won't be put off by ferns.P.S. This book belongs to a series of travel writing published and, I think, commissioned by National Geographic."},{"Title":"The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law","review":"Perhaps I'm being anachronistic, but I don't think an autobiography should be written by anyone other than the subject him or herself. If the person doesn't feel up to the job, he should have an authorized biography published with a vignette explaining his involvement in the project. Whatever her reasons, Ms. Abramson's decision to employ Richard Flaste was a big mistake. If she was too lazy to write this book herself, she should have at least taken the time to find a competent writer. Reading this book is like trying to drive across a treacherous bog in a Ferrari. You hope there's something good on the other side but the journey is so needlessly frustrating and unpleasant, you aren't sure if it's worth it. Let me save you some trouble. Even if you had a Range Rover, this journey wouldn't be worth it. My conclusion: for someone who is so assertive and logical in her public speaking, Ms. Abramson has published a very disappointing autobiography"},{"Title":"The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law","review":"I have always liked the way that Leslie Abramson handles herself as well as being a fairly big fan of her courtroom practices. So, I went into this book with some preconceived biases. Well, they were all proven wrong.Abramson is an extremely intelligent woman, and an excellent attorney, but her writing, as well as that of Richard Flaste, is quite dry and rather boring. She has some nice stories to tell, but the manner in which she delivers them is undeniably dull.The book clearly had no cogent flow to it whatsoever. The book was somewhat hard to get through, but I read on, hoping it lead to something better.

My family is the subject of one of the stories Leslie chose to discuss in detail within her book. I have to say I was shocked and infuriated to find my family story, including names and a picture sent to Leslie in a Christmas card, printed without our consent or knowledge. After the initial shock I sat down to read the book and was again outraged at the many erroneous facts intertwined in our brief story. I have to wonder if she even looked at our file or if she just tried to pull from memory and/or embelish this brief condensed story of our life. I do not know all the laws governing what you can or can't print in an autobiography, but I would think that if you were writing about other people's lives, you should have to state the facts and be able to substantiate those facts with documentation. I know that the 6 pages of this book dedicated to my life story has so many fabricated and outright false statements, it is impossible for me to read any of the other stories with any degree of faith that what I am reading is the Real story! I would recommend that anyone who reads this book takes it for what it is, an autobiography about Leslie Abramson. Do not read it to understand the subjects of her cases or what the Real facts behind their cases were."},{"Title":"The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law","review":"This book gives a very interesting inside look into the world of criminal defense attorneys. The author gives her unique perspective on the law through stories of several cases she defended. While I found the book very interesting, especially her explanation of the Menendez case, I couldn't help thinking that she was giving only one side of the story and leaving out facts that didn't support her views of defendant's rights. Still, it was very enthralling and hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law","review":"This attorney either gets way too emotionally attached to her clients or she fashioned her syrupy prose in an artifical effort to win new ones.

A criminal defense attorney's calling is indeed a noble one, but should stop well short of the glorification and/or rationalization of the criminal element that seeps throughout this book. A few nuggets on trial preparation, tactics, and strategy can be gleaned by a careful reader; however, books such as Black's Law and The Trial Lawyers provide richer insight and are far more credible."},{"Title":"The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law","review":"If you ever thought there was more to certain cases than what you saw on tv, irregardless of whether you agree with Abramson's conclusions or not, you owe it to your sense of humanity or cynicism to read this boo"},{"Title":"From the Place in the Valley Deep in the Forest","review":"An excellent collection, with exceptionally vivid characters.

Lesser pieces like &quot;Sifting Through&quot; and the title story are still better than most, though they seemed somewhat brisk in their presentation.

Although Gentle Tamers is an entertaining read, the difference in tone and style between 1958 and 1970 is remarkable. People who came to this book expecting something similar to Bury My Heart will be probably be disappointed. This is a much lighter work, and dated in a way that Bury My Heart is not. It is still a remarkably researched and well-written work, so the fact that it is different should not dissuade you from reading it.Brown looks at the different categories of women western pioneers and works out his thesis that while the men settled the western US states, it was the women who civilized it. His different chapters include: hardships of the journey; women captured by Native Americans; women of easy virtue; performers; rebels; schoolteachers; and homesteading housewives. He provides ample stories and pictures to accompany the different categories.I enjoyed reading Gentle Tamers although I did not find what I was looking for (more information about Narcissa Whitman). The stories are lively and entertaining. It reads quickly, and Brown is a very smooth and skilled writer.There are several wince-worthy moments in the very 1950s language around Native Americans and women (very surprising given that the vocabulary was totally gone by the time he published Bury My Heart). For a serious treatment of issues of women in the West, I would look elsewhere. This book is clearly more focused on well-researched and light anecdote.Would be a terrific gift for someone interested in stories of the West-- a nice halfway point between a historical treatment and a novel."},{"Title":"The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West (A Bison book, BB 370)","review":"I started reading this little gem while researching material for an historical fiction novel and soon discovered that I couldn't get enough of their stories. Before reading this book, I was guilty of looking back at our history never imagining the grit and humor our ancestors possessed. A great read."},{"Title":"The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West (A Bison book, BB 370)","review":"Gentle Tamers is a wonderful study of the role of women in molding the American West during the expansion during the 19th century. The book is divided, by chapter, into studies of various aspects of life that were affected by women, everything from politics to theater to education. This book adds to the mosaic of the westward expansion - a mosaic with so many pieces that sometimes complement and sometimes contradict. It is very readable and pulls heavily from diaries kept by women during this period.Unfortunately, the book has its weak points, many of which reflect the writers of the journals. The Native American community is painted with broad brush strokes, often in an overly negative way. Also, there is absolutely no mention of the role of African American or Mexican women as a part of this migration. Both groups were represented during the period and should have been included in the writing. This omission may be because these women were less likely to keep written records, but some mention should have been included. Also, the chapter structure tends to obliterate any sense of time, with pre-Civil War and post-Civil War migrations treated almost as one. It would have been interesting to learn about the differences between these periods.Overall though, in spite of these problems, Gentle Tamers has much to recommend it."},{"Title":"The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West (A Bison book, BB 370)","review":"I'm in the midst of reading this and really enjoying it. While I know quite a bit about Western women's histories, Dee Brown has introduced me to a few more. Having read \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" many years ago, I was already familiar with Brown's writing, so I was delighted to see this book as a Kindle Daily Deal. My favorite story so far concerns a woman who was left alone in a covered wagon during a hard winter in Montana (you'll have to read the book for the interesting details). She managed to survive, and when an Indian hunting party discovered her in the spring, they were so impressed with her fortitude, they took her to what was then the territorial capital (Walla Walla, WA).

Their strength, ingenuity, courage and adaptability is amazing."},{"Title":"The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West (A Bison book, BB 370)","review":"I saw Dee Brown criticized once because he wasn't a \\"true\\" historian but a librarian. It's true: he was a librarian. But where are primary resource materials such as letters, newspapers and the like kept? They are stored in archives which are kept by librarians. So it seems to this reader that Mr. Brown ought to be more qualified than most to write history.This particular focuses on women and the roles they played in Manifest Destiny. Dee Brown writes with a sense of irony and a bit of humor. But he always maintains the dignity of his subject.When the curtain rose on the Old West till it set, there was always a woman on stage. Dee Brown is the chronicler of the anecdotes that tell their story. And he keeps the reader hungry for the next and the next.It's the details that make the story. And therein lies the strength of Dee Brown's writing. This is social history at its best. And it's just plain fun."},{"Title":"The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West (A Bison book, BB 370)","review":"A copy of \\"The Gentle Tamers\\" is in the staff lounge at the high school I am substituting at.

I love how this book is rich with detail in a way that is really engaging. I look forward to my breaks every day so that I can read a few more pages of this book.I am so going to be buying myself my own copy. I can see myself enjoying rereading it over the years. See if you like the sound of it to :)))"},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect is one of the best women's weight training books I have ever read. There is a lot of great information about isolation versus compound exercises, push-pull muscles, cardio training and weight training intensity.Sculpting starts by outlining why women's body sculpting is more challenging than men's body sculpting, and provides reasons why women should do weight training. He then moves to his body sculpting program, which he claims will provide tone but not bulk to women's bodies. There are three phases, and in each phase you weight train 3x per week, with cardio 3-5x/week. What changes is how the weight training is structured.Phase one is a body conditioning phase, and includes three full body days. Each day includes one exercise per body part, changing the exercise for each day. (E.g., for day 1 quads you might do squats, day 2 lunges, and day 3 leg press.) For each exercise you do 3 sets of 15 reps, at 75% maximum weight. Each body part is worked 3x per week. This stage is to build muscle -- he stresses that you can't shape muscle unless you first have muscle. He recommends staying with this phase for 3-6 months, and says you will reach 50% of your potential with this phase.Phase two is the toning and shaping phase, and lasts at least 6 months. Here the body is split into two: e.g., day 1 - chest, back, shoulders and calves; and day 2- biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings and abs. You still do weights three days a week, but alternate day 1 and day 2. Each body part is worked 3 x every two weeks. You use two exercises per body part in a superset, still doing 3 sets of 15 reps for each exercise. The intensity of the weights is increased in this phase. The goal is to create muscle symmetry and proportion, and he says you will reach 90% of your genetic potential with this phase.Phase three is targeted body sculpting. The body is split into three - e.g., day 1 - chest and back, day 2 - shoulders, biceps and triceps, day 3 - legs and abs. Each body part is given three exercises in a superset. You still do 3 sets of 15 reps at high intensity, and you are still training 3 days a week, but now each body part is worked one day per week. He claims you will reach your full potential at this stage, but he stresses that you need to have gone through the first two phases for this approach to work.Overall, it is a great book - well written and seems very well researched. The weaknesses are that there is nothing about diet, there is a strong preference for gyms over home workouts, and he doesn't provide exact workout schedules (but he does provide examples.) I would love to see a video series that uses this approach."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"Before I joined a gym six months ago, I had not worked out for five years. I began weight training with a personal trainer, but after my sessions were up (and I ran out of money) I was nervous about being able to maintain a steady routine on my own. I purchased this book and was very impressed with it's training advice and recommended workout routines. There are many exercises with pictures and explanations that that have proven to be very effective for myself. This book also explains how to work out intelligently- how to incorporate cardio exercises, how to allow muscle groups to recuperate, and how to concentrate on the muscles being utilized in each exercise. The routines suggested are designed for a woman's body but do not lack in intensity and endurance. This is a fantastic book for any woman who just joined a gym as well as those who would like to improve upon their current routine. I'm very pleased with my results and I attribute them to the advice and information provided by Mr. Schoenfeld."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"Fitness is my passion and I'm always reading books and articles about fitness. After a while, a lot of the information starts to sound the same. What a refreshing relief to have found this book! This is the first book that I can say that I really learned something from in years. It is divided into three parts; body conditioning, toning and shaping and advanced bodysculpting. While there is good info throughout the book, I found the advanced bodysculpting chapters to be of particular benefit. These chapters show how certain exercises can be combined to achieve optimal definition. The sample routines are great and demonstrate exactly how to incorporate the concepts into a total fitness program.Overall, the book is very well written and easy to understand. It's a great reference that I'll use time and again."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"The first half of the book is pretty basic info that I did not find as useful as someone might who is new to resistance training. The latter half of the book outlines how to sculpt your body. For each major muscle group the author classifies exercises into three categories depending on what parts of the muscles are being worked. By doing some or all the exercise he suggests, you can sculpt your body. What I find really useful is to know each of the categories so that I can ensure that I am working all parts of my back, for example. Now I can see that there may be times that I was doing two exercises that were working the same areas. When developing my program, I will refer to each category and make sure I have selected exercises that will cover all the categories.The book does have some flaws. The author stresses at the beginning of the book that it is important to know what muscles you are working so that you can focus on them while exercising. But when he illustrates each exercise, he does not tell you which specific muscles you are working. Most other books will list the latin names of the muscles you are working, and some even illustrate the specific muscles, which is quite useful. He suggests a limited number of exercises for each category. Some of the exercises he mentions you can't find in the book (such as &quot;spider curls&quot;). When you look at the illustrated exercises, he does not tell you what category it is working. You have to keep referring back to an earlier page to figure that out. There are so many more exercises you could do for each of the categories but he does not mention them. It would have been nice if he had a chart of exercises that you could do without having to illustrate all of them. The book does not have an index either.Conclusion: I don't think the book warrants the rave reviews it's received on amazon.com and could have been organized better, but half of the book has useful info. When I first started to read it I was going to return it because the first half of the book wasn't telling me anything I didn't know already. The body sculpting section has good info that I will incorporate into my program, so I have decided to keep the book."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"I'm really shocked that no one mentioned the fact that Brad says wearing high heels is a good way to work your calves! No mention whatsoever that high heels cause bad posture, increase your risk of injury to ankle/knee/lower back. There are so many other ways to work your calves!Also, the book shows overhead shoulder presses with the bar behind the back, which is widely considered to be dangerous. Several of the pictures for squats &amp; lunges show the front knee bending beyond the ankle &amp; toes. Even a basic body sculpting class at a gym will give you that form pointer. Further, deadlifts, which can be really dangerous if done improperly, are shown with the head down &amp; back rounded--totally wrong form.I'm not a doctor or PT or weight training snob...But I've used three different PTs before, and have spent not an insignficant amount of time reading various strength training sources on theweb, and I've never seen any of these moves/forms recommended.I bought the book b/c I thought it would help me come up with my own routines. It does seem helpful in that regard (hence 1 star as opposed to 0), but the egregious errors make me worry about everything else in the book. If you're using this book, go to a *good* PT to check your form!"},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"I was so excited to read a book especially designed for women, however once I opened it up it didn't take long before I was disappointed. This book gives many techniques that can only be done in a gym, on many different machines. If you enjoy training at home, on you own equipment, you will find that many of the exercises cannot be done without specific machines. The author shows a photo of a woman doing the exercise and then gives a VERY BRIEF description of what she is doing. He never addresses proper form of the exercises or what to be sure not to do in order to achieve maximum results and prevent injury. This book also seems to be focused towards women body builders or health competitors. Aproximately every chapter has a short story on a female weight trainer and they are all competitors. This told me alot about the author's goal of the book, because he seems to think that &quot;perfect&quot; is more bulky than I think the average woman pictures herself. In the cardio chapter the author tends to take off with his vast knowlege of training, and begins to lose the reader with his terms and points that he is trying to make, without giving you some background to what he is talking about. He also is ever sure to point out all of women's short comings and why she will never be able to train at the same level as a man wether it be weights, or cardio exercise (as if that was our goal). Bottom line, this book is aimed at satisfying the more Golds Gym, die-hard iron pumping, G-I Jane type, not a woman who wants to have a sleeker, sexier, but very feminine physique."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"Brad Schoenfeld does a wonderful job with this book. It is well thought out -- and moves you from the beginning exercises to the advanced. I have been doing the beginner exercises for about 8 weeks now and have seen a tremendous improvement in my body -- and my energy as well.It is imperitive that you have access to a gym to work out. Or else you will have to have an extensive gym in your home.I really learned a lot from this book -- and have every intention to continue my work outs. I know that I can get to the advanced levels -- but I am moving slowly so that I don't injure myself.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a weight lifting program.

I tried several exercise programs and diets but none really worked and I felt frustrated about everything. I started to believe that I would never be able to get back to where I was.Then, I was reading Fitness magazine and learned about Brad's book. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Upon reading it, I immediately got a good feeling. His words were really motivational and I realized all the reasons that my workouts never really worked. The program was easy to follow and the sample routines were extremely helpful.After a little less than 3 months, I have followed the program religiously and my results have been nothing short of fantastic! I feel I'm in the best shape of my life. I am back to being a size 4, but my clothes fit even better than they did before.

Now I'm only doing the exercises required, and targeting the proper muscles. The addition of a dvd was a nice touch, it shows the perfect form for most of the exercises included in the book.

The explanations of compound versus isolation exercises were a huge help, as well as the explanation in the beginning of each section that details which specific muscles are worked with each exercise.

I did start with toning and sculpting. I am doing his suggested routines and I like the fact that for two weeks (6 days) you do a different routine. It breaks it up and it does not get boring.

Using it for 6 weeks with cardio improved my physique. I lost a lot of inches and I can see my body really change. I am so happy with it! I even borrowed and eventually bought his other books. The Look Great in Sleeveless is also very good. It has lots of similarities with the Sculpting book or even repeats his explanations of the basics of how things should be done or how our bodies work, etc. but I still find the Sleeveless Book complements the Sculpting book very well (Sleeveless book has versions for home use).

I can't wait to start the toning phase!"},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"I have been following the sculpting program for about six months and it has totally changed the way I look and feel about myself. I've lost a total of twenty three pounds, gone from a size 12 to a size 4, and for the first time in my life look toned and fit. It is an easy read and makes sense out of the topic without getting overly technical.

This book is great if you are willing to dedicate yourself to a workout. It tells you how to workout and answered numerous questions that I always had about working out.

Lastly, make a list by muscle group of all the exercises throughout the book with the page numbers so that you have a quick reference."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"I recently purchased this book with dvd. It only took a fewseconds for me to realize that this is an outstandingprogram. The dvd is very well organized. It does not jump around. Brad starts with the right sequence of muscles to exercise first. Thank you.The pace in explaining the exercise, movement, themodel (Jan) executing the moves is perfect--not too fast, not too slow. I was especially impressed that alternative equipment usage was demonstrated in the dvd for those of us (like me) who can no longer make it to the gym (at least daily).Most fitness books (and I have many) only demonstrate movesfrom the gym and offer no alternatives.This book is a MUST for any personal trainer as a refresher--plus you will learn as it can be an excellent instruction tool. It is a must for anyone who wants to workout but does not want to be overwhelmed with a bunch of fluff, junk, boasting--you WILL NOT find that in this book or on the dvd.To me, Brad has a gift of instructing, teaching, and he walks the walk. Again, most in this industry have the bodies and can execute moves, but cannot teach it to the average person. A beginner, intermediate, or advanced exerciser will NOT be bored, discouraged, or lost. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG WITH THIS BOOK. IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.Though I am a personal trainer and group exercise instructor, I am writing this from the user's persective."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"As far as weight training goes, this is not really the best books out there. I gave it two stars simply because it gives an alternative to what similar exercises can be done at home if you're not at the gym, or if you don't have access to a gym (while traveling, for example). But even this is not enough. It seems that the book is hastily compiled. I would like to comment also about the models used in the book - personally, the don't have the look of someone working out or anything, with the impractical long coiffed hair and all that, that sometimes hid an essential part of the form during the exercise, like the shoulder. It would be more realistic to dress them as regular gym-goers do - like tying their hair up, for example, instead of having them look as if they're going to a pub. It's just irritating and unappealing.Plus, I agree with what one of the readers said about bad form in the book. Like I said, this book could be improved."},{"Title":"Sculpting Her Body Perfect","review":"This book is packed with information on how to get your body into its best shape.

So, I got a used copy of this book, and I really wish I had started this program years ago when I was just starting out. It makes such a difference to be educated in how muscle breakdown and repair works, how you really need to focus on form, and how important it is to REST between workouts.

Although perhaps I might have known it from the title, this book is not about the fitness you will need for daily life. This book is about how to build an exercise program in order to adore yourself in the mirror. I personally find that thought revolting, so the book isn't really for me. That said, ...This book does a good job of outlining a flexible exercise program that can easily be adjusted to meet anyone's needs. It outlines the basic muscles that need to be worked. Then, each program has slots for each muscle group. So, fill in an exercise for chest muscles, another for ham-strings, etc. From the standpoint of building a program, this may be the easiest and simplest book I have come across. This is also the only book I have seen that actually treats women's issues in particular. Things such as time of the month, or pregnancy, can affect how your exercise program works. Unlike other books, this author has recommendations for dealing with those issues.The author also recommends using the mirror to determine what goals you wish to set for yourself.What is not in this book are the why's: why this program versus that one. Why should I do three sets of 8-12 reps, and when should I (if ever) switch to sets of low reps? When is my program okay, versus when should I change it and how? I mean, the three exercise program outlines are likely to get old quickly. Likewise, Schoenfeld offers only one program during pregnancy, and no insight on how or why to vary it for variety and safety--only that his must be followed to be safe.Knowing what I do now, I would not buy this book again.

His insights into the Great Books are limited, but his enthusiasm makes up for it. He's no Clifton Fadiman, certainly no Will Durant. He is a journalist and writes like one. It's worth the money but don't expect inspiration."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"In GREAT BOOKS, David Denby examines the extent to which the concept of great books has become the flash point between the relativistic left, which declares that such books are the living proof of the imperialistic, hegemonic, and racist Western culture and the two millennia old tradition of fixed greatness, which hails the eternal verities of man's belief in his own inner and unchanging self. Until the 1960s, most educated men and women assumed the validity of the belief that the then generation of students was heir to a tradition of ongoing core beliefs that stretched back to the ancients of Greece and Rome. By the time that David Denby graduated from Columbia in the mid 1960s, Jacques Derrida and other relativists had managed to convince a growing segment of America that the philosophical ground under their feet was as mushy as the concommitant notion that all humanity shared certain basic traits. After more than thirty years following his graduation, Denby determined to return to school to find out (perhaps once and for all) what all this hoopla was about.Denby took a full year course in Great Books. Nearly all of his fellow students were recent high school graduates, many of whom reminded Denby of himself way back when. Part of the beauty of GREAT BOOKS is the recognition that his year's voyage was shared by us, his readers. As he struggled to master the wisdom of the Ancients and near Ancients, so did we. His professors began with the classicists of Greece. Homer's ILIAD upset most of Denby's class since they had been fully inculcated in the politically correct philosophy that the desire for glory and the ability to kill to achieve it was unworthy of the effort. Achilles, in particular drew their ire as Homer portrayed a warrior who positively exulted in the Klingon credo of death before dishonor and that killing was a right reserved to those who had the courage to seize it. As the course progressed, Denby could see that little by little exposure to the ideas waiting patiently within the studied texts was causing many of them to re-evaluate long held beliefs. Along the way, Denby unveils the covers that the relatavists had attempted to smother the ideas that make of the core of greatness of such books. Do Great Books truly exist? (Yes they do) Are their ideas worth studying and emulating? (Yes they are) Should we blame the authors of Great Books for their not considering such modern points as racial/ethnic prejudice, political hegemony, and victimology? (No we should not) The Greeks were but the starting point in Denby's reassimilation of the core values of Western civilization. The list of \\"greats\\" on the Great Books list is imposingly long: Homer,Sappho, Plato, Sophocles, Aristotle, Aeschylus, Euripides, and these were just the Greeks. One of the points that Denby makes is that there is no one single common denominator among them all. Each is as different from the other as the night is from the day. What unites them is their collective sense of danger to orthodox ideas, with \\"orthodox\\" being synonymous to beliefs that deny the ongoing relevance of traditional Western thought. GREAT BOOKS is a potent reminder that there is a reason for their legitimate relevance and that when the relativists point to what they see as a mushiness under the pages of the Great Books, this mushiness is more likely to describe their own thought processes."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I also returned to school to take undergraduate English classes as a man in my 40's. My reasons were different than Denby's, and my classes at our state university were not always high quality. I found his book almost like returning to Columbia. He shares the great wisdom and insight of his professors, while including sharp and relevant observations of his own. These \\"Great Books\\" are difficult, and having Denby and his professor put them in context is more than a little helpful. The whole post-structuralist movement has, in my opinion, been a trip down a dead-end road and Denby gives great--maybe not original--insight into where these theorists went wrong. He and others who share his views seem to have lost the battle from a 2011 perspective, and we are all worse off because of it."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Like another reviewer, I bought this book with some trepidation. It had caught my eye when it was new. I worried about it being patronizing dribble of one flavor or another. Perhaps I bought the book to find out. Really, I bought the book from Salvation Army--cheap. Didn't cost much to try.Over a half-century+ spent reading adult literature, the value of the re-read is evident. As said by Nabokov (re Denby), \\"... one cannot read a book; one can only reread it.\\" When I was young, and Hesse was cool, I read 'Steppenwolf' because I had heard about it. At about 40-years-of-age, now about the age of the Steppenwolf character, I read it again. It really struck home! I really didn't get it the first time I read it, and I had no basis for being able to understand it. The first read was, perhaps, a waste of time. However (sticking to Hesse), 'Siddhartha', also read more than once, was appropriate for my youth. Having read their reviews, it is confirmed: Denby's book is not likely to be comprehended by young adults.Denby's book is very sincere, honest & thorough. The critics are right. The book is not about the \\"classics\\" but about how they impact Denby's life. He clearly demonstrates the effect of the experiment on him. It provoked profound thoughtfulness and self-analysis. He learned that his tastes & expectations of literature had vastly changed. He discovered that he was more open--& independent--minded than he had been as a college freshman. His perspective now included an experience-basis, as well as idealism. The experience was very positive in complex ways. It's not so much what is read but that quality expression is read. (Anyone who has both read the book and seen the movie knows that movies are only abstracts of the book--my criticism of the movie 'Dr. Zhivago' (1967).) Hard for a 20-year-old to believe, but at 48, aging is not yet debilitating for those who participate. (For those who don't, 18 and beyond is debilitating.)This book is about Denby, and that is what makes it interesting. I don't have to agree with him on anything at all; but his thoughtfulness, reasoning, and expression do have to be respected. I am glad I ran across this book. I'm recommending it to others (of my generation)."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"This book is about the experience of reading and thinking about the Great Books, so it is not merely a summary of the Great Books. The author does provide in the front of the book a list of the books in the Great Books courses at Columbia, (1) Literature Humanities and (2) Contemporary Civilization. At the end of the book he provides samples of previous reading lists. The author personalized the experience of reading and thinking about the Great Books. I particularly appreciated how on pages 203-205 (Interlude 5)a professor from Europe expressed disagreement over the use of such a course. The professor's point was that the great books were read in high school in Europe, and therefore was not suitable material for college. The European professor also disparaged the reading skills of American students. The author pointed out that it is exactly because American high schools neglect the Great Books that they should be studied in college, which helps improve the students' reading skills.We really should consider whether all colleges would benefit their students by making a similar Great Books course mandatory. It's a shame the Great Books are not studied in high school."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"This book is proving to be a terrific introduction to The Great Books. David Denby's writing style is worth reading for its own value and he does an excellent job of taking you to class with him. If you attended a movie of this book you would not be as close beside and inside Denby as you are while reading this book! I highly recommend it if you are interested in the classics but arent' sure you're ready for the plunge, or if you simply want a refresher course."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Denby's THE GREAT BOOKS reads much like his movie reviews in THE NEW YORKER--intelligent, opinionated, and slightly forced, but almost always profitable. GREAT BOOKS recalls his mid-90s attempt to mediate the debate over the Western Literature canon and its place in the academy. He does this by re-enrolling at Columbia and taking the same core courses he had taken 30 years earlier. Although admittedly a liberal, he avoids the victumization syndrome that he believes the heirs of Nietzsche at the university have ironically created on the Left. The Right, however, also err in putting too much confidence in the canon's ability to raise up culture. Having placed himself in the middle, Denby can jab sometimes at the Left (the absurd attack upon Joseph Conrad) and the Right (feminist criticism did create a place at the table for Virginia Wolff). A hidden strength is his philosophical nuggets, such as the point that Kant's goal was to establish a moral philosophy that was absolute yet did not depend on the word of God."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"What a trip!

Saw David on television when this book published. I read the book. Any intelligent reader can see how Denby has presented his love of literature in this book. Inner dialogue influences one to delve more deeply into the works themselves! Those who do not like this book are clearly suffering from sour grapes! The publishing world wants unique works...well here's one! Should be required reading in all Universities and High Schools. Clearly Denby has exposed himself to ridicule, we all do in our writings, but his book deserves kudos for Denby's point of view, love and inspiration of the classics."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I have to admit I approached this book with some trepidation. I learned from the jacket liner that Denby was a film critic for New York Magazine (I vaguely remember reading some of his reviews) who had returned to the same Lit classes at Columbia he had attended in the late sixties. What was a film critic going to tell me about the classics that I didn't already know? I've read every classic I could get my hands on since I was 13. I expected something along the lines of Adler or Van Doren (brief accounts of the hundred or so &quot;greatest books of all time&quot;). I'm glad now that I gave Denby the benefit of the doubt. Like Denby, I returned to college as an older student and felt a blend of exhiliration and disorientation similar to his. He's particularly adroit in conveying how politics have changed the nature of classroom discourse. There's no need here to get into a debate over the neo-relativist, agenda-driven camp on one side of academia, vs. the liberal, canonical &quot;traditionalists,&quot; although much of the book revolves around these arguements. What I'd like to comment on primarily is Denby's authentic love of literature and the power that it holds to shape lives. This is an old saw, but is still relevant and is eloquently expressed and demonstrated by the author. He argues that &quot;great&quot; literature is not primarily aimed at making us feel good about ourselves. On the contrary, growth usually comes about only after a period of some discomfort and anxiety. The message of great fiction is not that we or our society or culture are superior to other peoples or societies or cultures. In fact, the message is usually the opposite. I have to admit that I found some of Denby's recounting of his private life digressive and not especially engaging. His reading of King Lear, juxtaposed with his memories of his mother's final years, was heartfelt, but didn't quite come off in the final analysis. It seemed that the parallels he drew (friction between generations, the weakening of the intellect as one grows older, etc.) didn't seem particularly relevant or insightful. The chapter on Conrad was, for me, the crowning moment of the book. Denby covers a lot of ground in this chapter, particularly in light of what just proceeded in the chapter on deBeauvoir. He nails down the essence of the scholarly debate, while at the same time giving us a vivid picture of the response a highly-charged piece of fiction can provoke in dispirate readers. As I lover of &quot;the classics&quot; myself, I might be biased as to which side of the debate I stand on, but I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and think at the same time."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"What makes some literature great ? Great literature is inspiring and life-changing, taking us to new places and leading us to think in new ways. It brings you not only into the author's mind but into their whole cultural millieu, to a time and place that we wouldn't have otherwise experienced or understood. Western culture is of course just part of the world's vast storehouse of ideas and stories, but it is one of the deepest and profoundest parts. In &quot;Great Books,&quot; film critic David Denby unapologetically focuses on his experience at Columbia with some of the classics of Western literature.Denby regales us with his enviable experience of being re-introduced to great literature as an adult, engaging the classics as an enthusiastic and willing observer instead of a bored and cynical youth obsessed with carving their own niche. Unlike his classmates, Denby has the luxury known mostly only to the mature, to actually enjoy the trip rather than using the readings as a springboard to show his own cleverness and garner good grades. His honest enthusiasm shows through as we experience a taste of great literature through his eyes.While this book is somewhat a summary of some of the classics, it would fail on that basis alone, paling in comparison to the Cliff and Monarch notes, just as those notes pale in comparison to the original works. This is not a book to read to understand the classics of Western literature, nor to help with any scholarly pursuit of knowledge. This is a very pleasant and enjoyable excursion through great literature along with someone in the unique position to be an experienced critic, a skilled writer, and an enthusiastic student viewing the subjects as if for the first time. If reading this book and sharing the author's enthusiasm encourages you to read the classics, it has done a wonderful thing. If you read this book to get a condensed version of the originals, a vicarious education through Denby's interpretation, you will be sadly cheated.This is a fun book for lovers of great books, but it is not itself a great book. I hope it inspires more people to understand why some of us love great books."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"David Denby's &quot;Great Books&quot; proves that even if we knew then what we know now, our academic struggles would still be up-hill.Denby gives us essentially a travelogue of his journey through the &quot;great works of Western literature&quot; at Columbia University, where he has returned to revisit the course material. Unsurprisingly, Denby gives brief descriptions of the works on the syllabus, paying particular attention to particular passages that struck his fancy. More surprisingly, Denby also brings us into the classroom, discussing the professors in detail while relating the other students' efforts to master the material.These exchanges are fascinating because Denby refuses to patronize the students, who seem to be a genuinely scholarly bunch, capable of digesting and reacting personally to the material. Sure, there are some low points, such as when the students run up against Dante and the eternal damnation of the &quot;Inferno,&quot; which the students seem to reject as &quot;so non-20th century&quot;(!). On other works, the students are as engaged and insightful as Denby, even though they lack his life experience. Denby avoids looking down on the students for their inexperience, and he tries to see the works from their perspective as well as his own.Perhaps unexpectedly for Denby, his perspective isn't all that different from the students' in one critical regard -- he is reminded how difficult it is to keep up with the reading. In some of the more humorous passages in a surprisingly funny book (not slapstick, mind you), Denby laments falling behind in his reading, or struggling to find a quiet place in Manhattan to read, or finding moments of solitude during the daily pell-mell of parenting. In a refreshingly candid book, we are not force-fed another &quot;education is wasted on the young&quot; tirade.Denby's various synopses of the books on the syllabus hit and miss -- of course, he is writing as much about his reaction to the books as the books themselves, and it's a bit frustrating when Denby doesn't fall in love with one of our favorites. Denby's less-than-ecstatic reaction to the aforementioned &quot;Inferno&quot; is one chapter where I found myself shaking my head, disgreeing with Denby. And one wishes that a few of Denby's chapters were longer -- but hey, if you are wishing for more, that's got to be the sign of a good book, right?"},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"David Denby's GREAT BOOKS is a compellingly written, nostalgic joyride of a book proving that in some ways, we can go home again. Home for Denby is his alma mater, Columbia University, where during the 1991-92 academic year he retook the classic western literature courses that welcomed him to college thirty years before. With more than even your average eighteen-year-old's vigor, middle-aged Denby chronicles his own odyssey of sitting back down in the classroom and becoming a student again. The often amusing classroom scenes are interspersed with insightful commentary on the cultural scene of the early 1990s, as well as the movie critic's own musings on how certain of the works were and are tied significantly to moments and themes of his own life.The book is deeply enriched by Denby's capacity for wonder, and not harmed all that much by his prominent ego. Denby discovers that however much we think of ourselves, the great writers will always teach us humility--or at least the folly of hubris! Those who have also taken such courses and read similar works with serious intent may not agree with all of Denby's critiques, but then examining each other's interpretations is what we do in literature class and in life.Though some 460 pages, GREAT BOOKS rarely drags, and left me wishing it was even longer. There's no doubt that the author left a part of himself in college that it was killing him to get back, but he's mature enough to realize that attempting such reclamation is a doomed venture. Renewal is what Denby's after, and that's what reading the gargantuan likes of Homer, Dante and Shakespeare gives us. With a frank and friendly tone, Denby does a fresh and impressive job of inspiring this renewal in the reader."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Frankly I'm puzzled by the many negative reviews of this book, since Denby is a wonderfully sane and balanced writer who writes extremely well. His idea of returning to Columbia to retake a course on the 'Great Books' was a masterstroke. The blow-by-blow account of his struggles with the set texts, and of the meaning (or lack of it) which he found in them; the wonderful portraits he gives us of his professors, both male and female, and their varied approaches and teaching styles, and of his fellow students and the conflicts and animosities which were always simmering beneath the surface (and which occasionally broke through); his interesting and even valuable insights into the texts (see for example his masterful account of Boccaccio's Decameron); and his genuine concern with social and cultural issues, and with the meaning that at least some of the Great Books can still have for us today - all these and more held my interest throughout. It's possible that feminists don't like some of the things he said, though what he says about feminists is true enough and may easily be confirmed by a reading of Camille Paglia. It's also possible that some readers may have been misled by the title of the book, and may have overlooked the 'My Adventures With' of the subtitle, words which ought to tell anyone that this is not so much a book about the 'Great Books' as about the author's highly invidual and personal response to them. But for me Denby's book was one of the more interesting books I've read for some time. I only wish I could find more like it. And his piece about Boccaccio should definitely not be missed.Briefly, Denby seems to find a pagan exuberance in Boccaccio, a frank and wholesome celebration of the flesh. In contrast to medieval Christianity's loathing of woman we find in Boccaccio what Denby beautifully describes as &quot;a tribute to the deep-down lovableness of women&quot; (p.249). And today, when so many women are being taught by anti-sex radical feminists to deny their own bodies and feelings, Boccaccio's celebration of the sexual avidity of the natural woman should come as a very welcome antidote. So why the hostility to Denby? Could it be partly because he pointed out that Boccaccio's is a scandalous book, a book that liberates, a book that returns us to &quot;the paradise from which, long ago, we had been expelled&quot; (p.248)?"},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"As a former classics major, I have followed the debate over the western canon with a great deal of interest. But after slogging through Harold Bloom's &quot;The Western Canon&quot; for over a year and a half, this book was an absolute delight. David Denby reminds us just why these books are so important--they make you strugle to build a self, which is (or should be, anyway) the true purpose of education. I am also fascinated by how much his perspective has changed in the thirty years since he read many of the books in college. And in the chapter on Shakespeare--focusing on the parallels between King Lear and Denby's own relationship with his mother--the essay itself actually brought me to tears. I have been recommending this book to everyone I know, and now I'll recommend it to everyone I don't know...read it! It's amazing!"},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Denby's book accomplishes what seems impossible; bringing meaning and life to the &quot;Great Books&quot; in an entertaining and literate way. In &quot;Great Books&quot; Denby, film critic for New York Magazine, describes his adventures as an adult student when he returns to his alma mater, Columbia University to take two &quot;western civ&quot; courses. Over two semesters, he reads works that range from the Iliad and the Odyssey to Plato, Sophocles, the Old and New Testaments, Machiavelli, Dante, Hobbes, Locke, Shakespeare, Austin and Woolf in the company of professors and undergraduate students. Denby relates each work to the text's historical context, to the class, to the other works and, in his most unusual achievement, to his own life and our modern culture by allowing us into his most personal experiences and relationships. You will enjoy this book enormously even if you have never read the &quot;Great Books&quot; and if you have read them, you will probably want to read them all over again. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"David Denby tells us that our everyday assumptions are arbitrary. He says power justifies itself by pointing to powerlessness as proof of incapacity. Gems of wisdom like these appear throughout this book. \\"Being examined is one of the things you become an adult to avoid,\\" he writes. \\"Once you pass twenty-five, you learn how to cover your weaknesses and ignorance and lead with your strengths. Every adult, by definition, is a corner-cutting phony; experience teaches you what to attend to and what to slough off, when to rest and when to go all out.\\" One of my criteria for a great book is finding I dread being finished reading with it. Such was the case with this one. Denby's work is truly inspirational for those who wish to uphold the sanctity of ideas. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"This book could have been called Alma Mater Memoirs. Denby's discussion of various works in the Western Canon is interspersed with recollections of his undergraduate days at Columbia University, and his impressions of his fellow teenaged students as well as the elegant demeanor of his professors (&quot;he spoke the way a good many of the younger teachers spoke, in academic dialect, as if the dangerous subjectivity of language could be tamed by using standard terms, but he had energy and flair&quot;). Denby gives his thoughts on a portion of Columbia's 'Great Books' course, focussing on the likes of Homer(Iliad, Odyssey), Sappho, Plato (the Republic), Sophocles(Oedipus the King), Aristotle, Dante, Shakespeare, Conrad (just name a few). He gives us the general theme and focus of each work while subordinating details. If you want in-depth explication of each work you won't find it here. On the other hand, his approach makes the works much more accessible for the average reader. Let's face it, not that many people (including myself) are going to rush out to buy The Republic to take to the beach. His writing style is readable and, at times, entertaining (&quot;Socrates the great teacher seems to flatter his students and friends, praising them extravagantly. Oh yes, they're so wise, so clever, and his own powers are so feeble, so terribly feeble! But he'd just like to ask them some small question: What do they mean by such-and such a word, such-and-such an idea? And then WHAM! he catches them in some contradiction or confusion, and they're knocked sprawling&quot;).As to why Denby wrote the book in the first place, he states as one reason that, despite his desire to read more, movies, magazines and t.v. had made his mind less able to concentrate, less able to keep &quot;vagrant thoughts (from) charging in&quot;. This sounds a lot like me. Television has destroyed my ability to patiently graze upon the field of literary nourishment. Instead, I gravitate to quick and furious images, pastiches of petty drama and pretty divas rather than profound thought (of course, I'm also fairy lazy).So, give a hoot. Read this book."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I won't echo what other have said - just a couple of personal reactions: I've always read more books than anybody I know, but Denby humbled me. Not only did he &quot;live the fantasy&quot; of going back to school, he did it in the real world, too. No ivory tower, no luxury life - he truly did it in medias res, with kids bounding around the house, ongoing obligations at his job as a freelance writer, and all this in the midst of that barely controlled chaos called Manhattan. Yeah, yeah, he took on a tough task ... but the insights! the freshness of his point of view! This is a book to treasure, and re-read. It made me go back to the classics and read them with new eyes. And, yes, I *still* have that go-back-to-school fantasy in spades. I'll do it, someday, I swear, I'll really do it, even if I have to wait until I'm retired. In the meantime, if you're hugely pressed for time, get Ian McKellen's audiobook reading of Robert Fagles' translation of Homer's Odyssey. It'll keep your spirits up until you can live the fantasy, too. It's doing it for me, right now. Thanks, David Denby, for sharing your journey with us."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I can see that the interest of the author is waning towards the end of the book. No doubt the beginning part of the book was interestingly written, the later parts appears to me to be a mediocre writting, due possibly to the impatience of the author to 'just finish that damn book' or perhaps the pressure from the publisher for a book too long in the making.I find this book rather superficial especially the renaisance philosophers. However, having said that it is still an interesting read and a good introduction on these great western writters. Should you seriously look for a good introduction to western philosphy, I would recommend Sophie's World and Bertrand Russell's History of Western Philosophy."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"To represent this book as being merely (!) about the debate over the literary canon would be to do it a grave injustice. True, Denby writes about the academic (and not so academic) dispute over core reading courses, but he also tells of the love-hate relationship of the educated and the media, the bemusement of a parent faced with a tide of uncontrollable cultural influences on their children, the gnawing worry a lapsed reader has about being able to tackle &quot;real&quot; books, acknowledging the decline and death of one's parents, suriving a mugging in New York, the emergence of self after adolescence, the bubbling undercurrent of memory, the frustrated teacher in all of us, and most of all - epics, tragedies, poems, bibles, tracts...

As the advancing forces of modern society continueto marginalize aesthetic values and ignite fervid culturewars, the need to answer these questions becomesincreasingly urgent.In Great Books, film critic David Denby invites us toexperience the pleasures of actually reading the great worksof literature that at once &quot;dispel the crudities andirrelevancies of the culture wars.&quot; Great Books is aninspired rally to Harold Bloom's late cry, &quot;do not yeild tothe lie that what we oppose is adventure and newinterpretation.&quot;Great books is an invigorating book which excites and opensthe mind to the power of great works, to their ability todisturb, provoke, and offer intellectual pleasure thatgreets the readeron the path toward sorting out andunderstanding one's relation to literature.Denby offers an inspired defense of the classics of Westernliterature by applying the great works and the issues theyconfront to contemporary problems in America while insistingaesthetic evidence, experienced as pleasure in reading,establishes a given text within the body of essentialliterature known as the canon.

Although \`retakes' isn't the right word, he sits in on several different sessions as someone doing a \`project'.So although he does the readings and at least takes one of the exams, he isn't a student. His book is then his record of this experience. There are several threads running through the work: 1. His interpretation of the actual texts being read, 2. His experience of how the reading of these work influence him, 3. And to a lesser degree, how the students in the class interact with the texts and the professors.My favorite part was when he spoke of how the texts influenced his experience of his life. Although I liked this book a lot when I first read it, the further I am from it, the less I like it. I was reading a book on criticism that had the line that someone else can't read the classics for you and in the end I think that is the \`charm' of this book. Someone else reading the classics for you and you get to get the experience without having to face the discipline of doing it yourself, and it doesn't work."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Reading over David Denby's shoulder is an education in itself. The New York movie critic has taken the experience of several fairly pedestrian undergrad courses and transformed them into autobiography of a charmingly intimate kind, an insightful portrait of students and the current crop of young people in general, a critique of academe and academics (and a fairly friendly one, at that), and a literary travelogue that is unparalleled in its sheer friendliness. I have always thought his movie reviews were intelligent, occasionally sublimely insightful (see review of &quot;Schindler's List&quot;), but this book was an unexpected treat for a comp.lit. undergrad. Especially complex and riveting were DD's sudden recognition of himself as a younger student in the form of a nervous young man debating &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in class; flashback to a mugging; surveying the territory of his children's cultural imagination; and revisiting his mother via &quot;King Lear.&quot; His analysis of a campus &quot;Take Back the Night&quot; march was revealing but ultimately formless...but this is my only complaint! Denby never apologizes for his populist tone--what a relief! Harold Bloom's &quot;Western Canon&quot; is irreplaceable, but not as much fun. It's the difference between sitting and arguing at the dinner table and taking notes in a lecture hall. Denby reminded me that lit. lectures were great fun, but with a dinner-table tone."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"This was not a great book, This reader envies and admires the author being able to return to Columbia College and partake in the \\"Great Books Program\\".

Many passages from the classics seemed to drone on, peppered with some side-light descriptions of the author's younger \\"college aged\\" classmates. I can see by the number of five star reviews that this book was a hit with many readers. I thought it provided a narrow scope on classic literature. The book I read previous to this book was Harold Bloom's \\"The Western Cannon\\". Harold Bloom gives concrete examples and rules why a book should be considered a classic in Western Literature.

He manages to convey an excitement about reading and about what is being read that is too often missing from such books, and one finds oneself in a continual argument with the author, his peers, and with society's conceptions of the books. But most importantly, to read this book is to engage in an endless argument with yourself and about what you believe - not just belief about the books, but your beliefs in general. This continual questioning, the search to know more and feel more, is after all why we should read, and why Denby, whilst a little lightweight in some of his analysis, has indeed created a great book himself."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I am currently a returning college student (33 yrs old) who is not majoring in Literature therefore was never required to read many of the classic works of literature.

Denby is a New York film critic; a left wing Jewish intellectual and a graduate of Columbia University. Thirty years after graduation from Columbia the 48 year old D decided he would return to a study of great literary works. He felt an emptiness in his gut. Denby's middle age malaise drove him to open the printed page for deep, enlighting and reflective thoughts on humanity, culture and his personal spiritual odyessey.The book is a fascinating mini-course in great books. Denby takes us into the Columbia classroom where we meet different professors and students. They are a diverse group from African-Americans to foreign students; from liberals to fundamentalists; from young to old. In their dialogue the reader is asked to engage through the printed page with his/her own thoughts. There is much here dealing with the debate over the core curriculum in colleges; Denby's ties the work wit the purpose of education, reading and study in our non-reading, political correct land.Great books by such giants of the Western tradition as Homer, the Greek dramatists; Augustine, Boccaccio; Dante; Machiavelli, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Rosseau, John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Bible;Simone Beavoir, Joseph Conrad, Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf have chaptersexploring their importance to Western culture.Denby's book deserves reading.

Until recently. I had been listening to the tapes from the Teaching Company on ancient Greek literature (go figure) as I drove around town. At the end of the tapes I sought out this David Denby book knowing little more about him than he was the movie reviewer for the New Yorker Magazine.Wow. This books explains why the (selected) classics are classics and where they fit into the canon of western civilization. I really admired that he 're-took' the college classes 25 years later with the Columbia freshmen. The insight, relevance, and yes, struggles of the writer, the students, and even the professors as they come to terms with Homer, Virgil, and the Greek plays were eye openers for someone like me who knows these works are important, enjoys reading them, but never quite understood the depth of meaning assigned by the scholastics and professionals. Having taken the Western Civ classes in college in no way prepared me to actually wrestle with Dante's passion for punishment or Nietzsche sneering effort to convince us that the truth is an illusion.Bottom Line: This is as much a reference book as a New York Times bestseller. (Don't miss his index). It answers the question Who Cares? with eloquence. It shows us the Great Books as being the most radical texts in existence.

I don't say that lightly. His command of the English language, his ability to describe things vividly, his way of expressing his thoughts ought to bring to delight to every reader. I'm thrilled by his writing style. With regard to the content, the book is very satisfying when read on its own terms. If you approach the text expecting, or demanding, that Denby do all the hard work for you--so that you don't have to read the Great Books yourself, then you might get mad and decide to scapegoat him. But if you will just be there with him and listen to his journey, there's a lot to be gained from the book. I appreciate his vulnerability as well as his moderation.

However, while the journey was undertaken with only the purest of motives, the discovery itself will leave anyone determined to live a life of the mind not only cold, but full of sorrow and disgust. Instead of discovering the best that humans have to offer, he stumbled upon a virtual breeding ground of hostility. The students of today, rather than embracing the great books of the past, have been instilled with the unfortunate idea that all works of long ago are to be held in contempt; under suspicion and accused of racism, sexism, exclusion, and deliberate oppression. The philosophers, novelists, and social theorists have become tools of what appears to be (if one believes the P.C. crowd) a patriarchal, Eurocentric, slave-holding, jingoistic elite bent on crushing all minority opinion. Denby's book, which should be read side by side with Harold Bloom, presents the college students of the world for what they are: whining, self-righteous brats with little in mind but an egalitarian revolution where all literature, regardless of merit or talent, is equal; all thoughts, even the most lamebrained and esoteric, are valid and above challenge; and the free exchange of ideas, vital on a college campus, is discarded in favor of a guiding ideology of &quot;bottom-up&quot; virtue.

The surface plot involves Denby's returning to his alma mater, Columbia University, to revisit (some of) the great books of the Western canon as a middle-aged adult, 30 years after first reading them as a young undergraduate.But this is no superficial treatment focused on frivolities related to going back to school. Instead, Denby goes deep, thus making the book intellectually elevated in a manner which befits the great books (mixed metaphor intended). He covers a sampling of these books and probes them with sensitivity, thereby giving us insights which are often penetrating and profound, and sometimes even rather original. He didn't say so, but I imagine that his professors were pleased.An added plus, which is what makes the book uniquely special, is that we get to see the difference between Denby's response to these books as a mature adult versus his younger formative years. For those of us in our own middle years, Denby thus gives us a sense of what we might gain from returning to these books.I agree with Denby's ultimate conclusion. The primary reason for reading these books isn't that we become trained to (ethnocentrically) value Western culture, but rather that, by wrestling earnestly (and sometimes painfully) with these books, we're stimulated to grow as individuals, but still each on our own path.Last but not least, Ed Asner did a fabulous job of narrating the book, thereby rendering the audiobook perhaps even superior in some ways to the print version. And this is on top of Denby doing a fabulous job of writing the book itself.Needless to say, I highly recommend this book to anyone open to the possibility of growing via encounter with the great books (and great books about the great books)."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Mr. Denby's book is not a tour de force of literary analysis, ala Harold Bloom, nor a provocative reinterpretation of the role western thought in education. It is a thoughtful, and at times very personal reexploration of what good literature means to those who read it.Denby's journey of reexploration is set with a map and compass. He goes expecting to find what he found before, but with years of experience and perspective on contemporary issues. He doesn't go expecting to encounter some great profundity (and doesn't) but instead reexamines his own understanding.Much of his experience has come as a critic and magazine journalist and the book shows this form. It is a string of short pieces - reflections - on the text and his experiences taking the courses.This creates some occassionally awkward transitions as well as a lack of momentum. This result of his style makes the book somewhat less enjoyable to read, but serves to reinforce his own understanding of the great works.They provide us with access to, \\"the greatest range of pleasure and soulfulness and reasoning power that any of us is capable of. The courses in western classics force us to ask all those questions about self and society we no longer address without embarassment.\\"Mr. Denby relies on personal meaning and personal experience - transcending race, gender, and religion - in his understanding of the significance of these works. It is the power of the work to connect on these levels which should provide a basis without regard to differences of skin color, sex, and faith.For those of us who treasure literature, and thought, and reading it is a joy to share his experience."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"My new year's resolution a few years ago was to strive to be well read. Basically, I would browse the classics section or look through the Cliffnotes rack until I found something that piqued my interest. Though I found some great literature this way (hey, they call 'em classics for a reason), I also got bogged down with some heavy, tedious, social commentary-type books that just weren't fun to read; especially since I was looking for a good story first, deeper meaning second (in my opinion, this makes for better commentary anyway).When I stumbled onto Great Books, this changed. Denby's observations on some books I had also read were similar to my own -though not always (To the Lighthouse bored me to tears). He led me to other books that I would have otherwise never read: Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Conrad, et al.This is not the greatest book ever, nor is it profound and earth shattering. It is, however, insightful, amusing, and entertaining to read. And as a result, I have become more a little more selective in what I read.If you love books, especially &quot;the classics&quot;, you should like this one."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"If you believe the greatest invention of the last three thousand years is literature, then this book is for you. The \\"classics\\" are generally written by dead white men, however, their works are considered to provide competencies which young people and the society need in the twenty first century going forward. This book is not an anthology. Denby does not try to figure out what happened in the past. He uses the books to illustrate that, in some ways, the human condition is no different now from three thousand years ago. Through the cannon of \`classics' included on the Columbia syllabi, Denby takes modern readers on a journey of discovery by guiding them through the missions, fears, and purposes of humans across centuries. For Denby, reading of the Classics leads to a deeper knowledge of self. The more we know the classics, the more we will understand our humanity.Reading each of the great books takes a lot of effort. Studying masterpieces such as the Odyssey or the works of Shakespeare requires more concentration than picking up the latest vampire book, but, the payoffs can be tremendous. Denby's \\"Great Books\\" is designed to give the average reader an in-depth liberal education. By following themes in the great books, the reader realizes that certain topics are discussed over and over again throughout history: What is our destiny? What is a good life? How can we achieve a good society? Everyone has to forge their own path in this life, but why not see how others conquered the same challenges? \\"Great Books\\" navigates the reader through the conclusions that great thinkers have come to about these questions; however, Denby leaves it up to the reader to wrestle with answers for themselves.A recurrent theme for Denby is whether the \`classics' represent a hegemony. Are we promoting conformity by forcing all students to read books written by dead, Eurocentric, mostly Christian-Judeo authors? Denby illustrates this conflict by giving voice to various classmates from minority backgrounds. Readers are exposed to the classical way of thinking, but, permitted to make their own choice as to rejection or acceptance. Denby's \\"lovely adventure of the mind\\" is a call for personal liberation. The book describes his reflections as a reader over time. Much of the book feels like Denby is reflecting in his personal journal. He conveys extensive personal responses to the readings and expresses his own growth through his reflections on the works. He often compares his 18 year old interpretations to his middle-age interpretations. With lucid style and divergent thinking, Denby ability to articulate the core issues with clarity to can help all readers fulfill their own personal journey."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I read all the time and everything, but I confess to being excited and thrilled by only a few of the books I read. David Denby's \\"Great Books\\" is one of them. His love of great books is plain, and infectious, but beyond that his fondness for his fellow students at Columbia University, young, quirky, opinionated, bright and full of passion, is an inspiration. I'm sixty-four years old now. I'm a member and organizer of a Great Books group, and find myself going back to Denby's Great Books for inspiration. David Denby is able to move from what he reads to how he lives and back again; when we accomplish that now and then in our group's discussions we understand why we read."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I can't tell you how great this book is. It made me want to go enroll in a Classics class myself. Denby has a great perspective on the works he reads. It's also fascinating to read about his time as a non-traditional college student. The Chapter on Simone de Beauvior is excellent!"},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"After reading this book, I can definitely say that Denby has caused me to want to start reading everthing from Homer to Freud. However, I will start with Freud (and go backwards), since reading Freud is the first step to diagnosing Denby, insofar as there must be a deep-seated reason for his dim view of boys and men.For example early in the book, he states that the young women in his class are making intelligent and perceptive statements concerning the work at hand, while the boys are \\"as yet uncreated\\". What the heck does that mean? Your guess is as good as mine. I don't know..maybe the boys are putting off their own creation until after they are outside a five-hundred mile radius of Denby..probably a good idea, since the last thing we need is more misandry in our ideological (er..excuse me - educational) institutions.Concerning the work overall, I'd say it's a very good account of one man's intellectual elevation through reading (actually re-reading) the great books of the western authors. And it is my opinion, that this canon has something to offer to all ethnicities and races, which also seems to be Denby's final impression."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"First off, I should admit that I'm of the age of the college students Denby studied with and not a Boomer. That's probably why I'm not as dismissive of polictical-correctness and believe that it has some positive benefits to today's education. I don't believe examining the classics through the eyes of today's students - as opposed to Columbia in the 1950's when the student body consisted of mainly Caucasian boys - is all that detrimental to the &quot;great works&quot; themselves. Perhaps the author would have been less likely to forget the books from his youth had they been discussed from a less-reverent viewpoint.I don't think reading should be a kind of therapy first and foremost. But I do think women, and other minorities do have the right to study their culture (however, &quot;marginalized&quot; or unimportant) it is considered in relation to &quot;Western&quot; one. At times, Denby seemed to imply political correctness was only some trendy fad and did not have any roots in real discontent. That was a mistake.Anyway, I do admire anyone who goes back and actually grapples with such authors as Hegel, Dante and Conrad, and has the humility to expose his struggles in a book. If I had a quarter for everyone who has said to me, &quot;Someday, I'm gonna read the classics again...&quot; but never actually did, I'd be rich.On a personal level, I did go back and read some of the books I'd missed in college, but not as many as I'd planned while reading &quot;Great Books.&quot; Still, I would recommend that readers sample some of those classics themselves."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"There is much to recommend this book. Indeed, when Mr.Denby gets pedagogic the book is as good as it ought to be.Try reading chapters of authors you are familiar with--in my case those on Austen, Conrad and Woolf--and you willfind it does not get any better than this.However, Mr. Denby defeats his noble purpose by too muchpersonal self congratulation. Constant references to hiswife and two boys, his Upper West Side life style and hisdefence of bourgeois capitalism smacks of self justification,as though he needs to prove himself a &quot;regular guy&quot; in spiteof his academic jouney. There is nothing regular ormainstream about those of us who care about seriousliterature and I resent Mr. Denby bringing it down to thislevel. Had he steered from these digressions and just stuckto the task at hand, as in the aforementioned chapters, theoverall quality of the book could have been improved."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I work in a public library. I'll be honest, I bought this for the library, knowing it would go out like crazy when students had papers. A quick and dirty way to the classics. If you are really into the classics, skip this. You probably wont like it. If you are not into the classics, but want to read this first before checking out certain things, do so."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"OK, I think I can shoot my mouth off here since I attended Columbia University at the same time as Denby and was forced to take the same classes that he took. I give it one-star because I think the book is fluff and that you should read the texts themselves in context and not in a self-serving, self-congratulating work such as this. First of all, while I do agree that some of the works were great, the fact is a lot of us simply didn't read or understand most of them. Columbia is full of uptight, competitive students who went out and bought Cliff's Notes-type study aides to ensure they got an &quot;A&quot; in class rather than absorb anything substantive or meaningful. Secondly, I had two T.A.'s teaching the classes--one who nearly swooned when she quoted a passage from Thackeray--and they couldn't teach worth jack. I spent most of the time doodling and trying to make the time pass during those excruciatingly boring classes. I'm sure the 19-year old Denby felt the same way. Finally, we have to realize how much power Denby yields as a writer who can give the final say while nominally addressing their arguments. For e.g., he dismisses an African American student, a Comp Lit Prof and others who have legitimate complaints about the Core Curriculum by being able to reconstruct and present the dialogue and conversations from HIS point of view. That's part of the problem with CC inthe first place, isn't it? It's always the opinion of a select view that gets the most visibility and credence. For an insightful critique of the Western Canon, read Robert Scholes' &quot;The Rise and Fall of English.&quot;While I do think much of the works of literature in the program are important and great, Denby's opinion and evaluation of them are still contrived, constructed opinions problematically dressed up as an argument for a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; of Western Literature curriculum. As one of the many students who found the courses boring and uninspiring, his argument for institutionalizing a Western canon in colleges strikes me as humorous given my real-life experiences with it."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Denby's &quot;Great Books&quot; is a great book itself insofar as one treats it as a guide to the accepted seminal works of Western literature rather than a thorough investigation of these works. That said, Denby's book is no subtitute at all for a real comprehension and understanding of the books in question nor an appropriate surrogate for the Core Curriculum at Columbia.The Core is the central subject addressed by the book. In between attempting to serve as a digestion of the works in question, Denby explores the rationale for a body of knowledge which, as Columbia would assert, &quot;every educated person should know&quot;. In his search, Denby hits upon a number of notable reasons for the maintenance of the Core and its promotion in society versus the relativist perspective of many liberal students, which he portrays as rather insolent and uninformed reactions. Even faculty objection to the Core is rendered with a certain hostility for such opinion. Denby is writing the book with the clear premise of proving the worth of the Core, rather than the purported search for its relevance. This alone makes &quot;Great Books&quot; a bit of a disappointment.What really drags down the book, however, is Denby's writing itself. Some books, such as Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot;, are treated merely with an allegorical story related to Denby's incomparably mundane daily life. In fact, most of the book is composed of Denby's rather superficial and sometimes even erroneous interpretations of the works he reads.I suggest &quot;Great Books&quot; only as a rather cursory overview of the Columbia Core and nothing more- unless one takes a great interest in the autobiography of a mediocre film critic or wishes to garner ideas for a tirade against liberal relativism. &quot;Great Books&quot; at times is little more than a typical neoconservative reaction to nontraditional ideas- ironic, given the dismissal of the students' reactions themselves as clich&eacute;d."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"Almost every book that Denby defends so wholeheartedly in this book is worth reading. Still, his exploration of the culture debates seems superficial. He is able to attend these classes and come out with basically the same opinions with which he left, having absorbed nothing of the justifiable rage of groups left out of the &quot;core curriculum&quot;, smugly sure that the books he grew up with are the best that are out there. His dismissal of the liberal students' concern as &quot;tragically mistaken&quot; seems glib and self-satisfied, and the book is tainted by the bias of its author, whose purpose (to re-educate himself, to find himself) is defeated from the start by his closed-mindedness."},{"Title":"Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World","review":"I took up this book with no preconceptions, just positive review from people I knew, as a book that might help me find a way to personally rediscover classic book reading in adulthood. I ended up enrolling for the first time in my life in a class on feminism. Female readers: please make sure that you have &quot;fallen off of Daddy's lap&quot; (p. 386) before you read this. Those readers who would like a less bigoted, more normal approach to reading classics in adulthood would be better advised to check out Samuel Pickering's book, A Continuing Education.

But he is very much wrong to claim that Boccaccio (1313-1350) was a contemporary of Dante Alighieri(1265-1321). They were not. In Italy they teach Dante and Boccaccio in every school and everybody knows the difference between the two. But not in the USA, no body knows who Dante was and the few who know Boccaccio is probably because of Hollywood. So he play the part of the teacher and be the \\"Intellectual\\" who knows all and telling others what culture is with false statements typical of Hollywood.

I think that should have been the main focus of the bow. It's like the film critic forgot (or was unable to) to criticize (that is: evaluate, look for different perspective) and not just carbon copying his reading of books.The book is a very personal book, almost a diary. The author writes his personal thoughts about (some of) the books they are reading. We hear about the other students only when it's relevant for his reading/understanding, but nothing else. I thus don't get insight from reading Great Books, just a story, and very simple introduction to the books.The book didn't help me to become interested in Great Old Books, nor gave it me any understanding of them. It's nice talk for people already interested in them, and already knowing the stuff he writes, but he doesn't enable readers to learn.Every objection to the list of books by other students are dismissed without much thought. Every teacher is perfect (he surely doesn't criticize them). It's like it so important for him that the year back at university is his nirvana, that it disables him from seeing anything negative, from performing criticism.

His most famous book was the 1879Progress & Poverty 4TH Edition; this book was written in 1883. He notes, \\"My endeavor has been to present the momentous social problems of our time... without that abstract reasoning which some of the principles of political economy require for thorough explanation. I have spoken in this book of some points not touched upon in 'Progress and Poverty,' but there are other points as to which I think it would be worth the while of those who may be interested by this book to read that.\\"He begins by stating that \\"A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction.\\" (Pg. 8) Democratic government can exist only \\"where wealth is distributed with something like equality... The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man.\\" (Pg. 15) Furthermore, although there are some mental and physical differences between men, \\"we already have men hundreds of millions of times richer than other men.\\" (Pg. 51)He states that \\"the capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist.\\" (Pg. 57) But George would put no limits on acquisition: \\"Let him do as he pleases with his own, without restriction and without suggestion. If he gets without taking from others, and uses without hurting others, what he does with his own wealth is his own business and his own responsibility.\\" (Pg. 87) The functions of government should be restricted to those necessary to the common welfare. (Pg. 171) \\"It is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly.\\" (Pg. 173)He summarizes, \\"The main source of the difficulties that menace us is the growing inequality in the distribution of wealth... In a society where the equality of natural rights is recognized, it is manifest that there can be no great disparity in fortunes... But, in a community where the soil is treated as the property of but a portion of the people, some of these people from the very day of their birth must be at a disadvantage... Our fundamental mistake is in treating land as private property.\\" (Pg. 194-195) He proposes, \\"All it is necessary to do is to abolish all other forms of taxation until the weight of taxation rests upon the value of land irrespective of improvements, and take the ground-rent for the public benefit.\\" (Pg. 208)George's ideas were often viewed as an alternative to 19th century Socialism; and even some modern conservatives (e.g., William F. Buckley) are fans of his ideas---particularly the \\"single tax\\" proposal.

He later went on to work the infamous &quot;Green River&quot; investigation, as well as consulting on other high-profile serial murder cases like the Atlanta child murders in 1979-1981. He has worked with leading law enforcement professionals on the state and federal levels. As such, Keppel is well-positioned to discuss serial murder.Signature Killers focuses on sexual offenders who leave &quot;signatures&quot; at their crime scenes. These individuals are compulsively forced to commit certain acts that will not vary from crime to crime. So while a murderer may change his modus operandi -- climbing in a window one time, picking a lock the next -- his signature will not change. Perhaps even more interesting is Keppel's theory on the &quot;arc&quot; of violence that murderers move through. Included are discussions on sadism, picquerism, and even cannibalism.Many reviewers have complained that Keppel's writing style leaves something to be desired. While this is probably true, I think it should be pointed out that this book almost certainly derives from Keppel's dissertation in pursuit of his Ph.D. Keppel appears to have taken sections from his thesis and added commentary to form a book. The discerning reader can see where the structured style of the dissertation leaves off and the conversational, casual style begins. I don't consider this a fault; I'm glad to have this accessible book to read instead of a dry, stuffy doctoral dissertation. Keppel should be commended for making this material available to a wider audience.Anyone interested in the motives of serial offenders can hardly do better than to turn to Dr. Bob Keppel. Others have said, and I agree, that Keppel's last chapter -- regarding the cause(s) of increasing violence in our society -- leaves a bit to be desired. But Keppel is entitled to his opinion (which, in this case, cannot be proved or disproved with ease) and it certainly doesn't diminish the comprehensive knowledge on serial sexual offenders that Keppel makes available to readers in Signature Killers."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"Robert Keppel presents some of the most terrifying and interesting serial murder cases that he investigated during his long career. In this book, Keppel uses 1 part intuition mixed with 1 part psychological knowledge to explain the signature that every killer inevitably leaves at the scene.Keppel writes in the same tone that he spoke with in my Sociology (Murder) class at the University of Washington-clearly, factually and concisely. This book is a must for those interested in more than just the gory details of a serial murder."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"I found this book to be one of the best on the market on behavioral science with respect to serial killers.

Perhaps if they are seeking entertainment, they should look for Crime Novels rather than True Crime selections.On the other hand, I agree with the other readers in regards to the author's annoying habit of repetition. However, I won't let that stop me from reading his other book, The Riverman."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"I am the Director of Justice Studies at dodge city community college in dodge city, kansas.

But the content is indeed of interest."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"I purchased this book at the same time that I purchased John Douglas's \\"Journey Into Darkness\\". I thought both books were highly informative and fascinating reads.Keppel does a great job profiling the killers. He discusses several killers, their signatures, and, most interesting to me, how they got that way. I cannot stress enough how critical the early childhood years and development issues are for these killers. Here's the recipe for disaster: abandonment/neglect/bad parenting, poor social skills, lack of boundaries, and an uncontrollable rage in their miserable lives.Keppel even outlines how some people suffer from these issues, yet never reach the point of these signature killers. Keppel makes it easy to identify these personality types and you can apply it to any weirdo you've ever met. This book could be very helpful to human resources directors, school counselors, community counselors, teachers, parents, and anyone interested in why these people go so horribly wrong. They should pass this book out in the maternity ward and during parent-teacher conference night.Keppel gives great details - whether you want them, or not, about the murders and the killers. The section on Jeffrey Dahmer is the most horrifying and most fascinating look into a signature killer's mind -- well worth the price of the book. You will ask yourself over and over how in the heck these people were undetected for so long and, moreover, how their parents live with themselves for creating these monsters."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"Okay, Keppel is not as smooth as Ressler, or egocentric as Douglas, but he IS as informative. Of the many serial killer books I have read, this one gave me some of the best information on the whys and wherefores of what is a signiture and how can it be identified, and how it differs from an M.O. Keppel is not condscending, like Douglas can be at times, but tries to explain it all. Although, I must say, as with all the Profilers, he has a way of referring back to his one &quot;Big Case.&quot; There are some decent biography and verbal re-creation of crime scenes, with commentary on how to figure out what's going on in the killer's head."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"As a lover of true-crime books, I appreciated Keppel's detailed explanation of how a signature differs from an MO. Keppel does a wonderful job of explaining the process of determining a serial killer's signature, and exactly what these signatures tell the investigator about the killer. He also uses real cases and the details of the crimes to walk the lay-person through the actual apprehension.As previous reviewers have already stated, and I would agree, Keppel isn't truly a &quot;great&quot; writer. His style does tend to be very factual and rather dry. This probably stems from having to give just hard facts when writing reports but translates to often dry data for an average reader. Moreover, Keppel has an annoying habit of repeating the same thing over and over and over and over... well, you get the idea. Sometimes, it actually felt insulting, as though he thought the reader wasn't smart enough to remember what he had explained a few paragraphs before.Finally, as another reader already stated, the final chapter was truly annoying. Instead of using the opportunity to summarize on the info gained from the book, or to bring out final thoughts for the reader; instead Keppel used this to soapbox his views of the American Family Structure. While much of this may or may not be right on target, I was not interested in Mr. Keppel's opinion on the state of Family Values. I would and have read sociology books to garter that type of information.Overall, however, I would recommend this book. It is a quick and easy read and a wealth of good information for true-crime readers. Just bare in mind that you may find yourself reading the same information over and over at parts.

The book describes piece by piece how a Signature Killer operates by using real life examples. Dr. Keppel hits the mark every time, except the last 30 pages or so.In the last 30 page he tries to explain the rise of sexual signature killers in the use by standing on a soap box and preaching the failure of the family structure in American as the cause for signature killings increase. Shame on you Dr. Keppel! For Shame! There are so many other outside factors that he does not even consider, like say the lose of self worth and belonging in Americans Urban centers. It just seems that he wanted to push his private feelings into what would have been an textbook on the subject. So thus it loses 2 stars for this."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"Robert D.

Although some may compare his book with those of Robert Ressler and others, it is not so easily compared as some might think.

The book explores some very interesting concepts through the use of many famous investigations. However, Keppel seems to write with a real lack of emotion, which I guess is necessary in his job. Which is why he should stick with that job instead of trying to be a writer. The lack of emotion made it feel like I was reading a calculus textbook. Keppel also seems to repeat himself over and over throughout the different chapters.

Yet in Robert Ressler's book &quot;I have Lived in the Monster: Inside the Mind of the World's most notorious Serial Killers&quot;, Mr. Ressler states that he himself is the one who coined the term. Dr. Keppel also takes great liberties in his discussion of the Picquerism signature. He makes no attempt at presenting any data to support his theory that a ie. knife is a secondary sexual characteristic and , therefore, a stabbing constitutes a form of rape. My response to this book is not even luke warm."},{"Title":"Signature Killers","review":"In response to the statements made by &quot;A reader from San Fransisco, August 23,1998&quot;, I believe that the coining of the term &quot;serial killer&quot; was, in fact, first made by Pierce Brooks. Perhaps if he has questions, he should look further then Robert Ressler's book for answers. Also, what Robert Keppel wrote about Picquerism, was as &quot;A Reader From San Fransisco&quot; said, a THEORY. Therefore how could Dr. Keppel present data to support a theory? It was not required, because Dr. Keppel was able to get across his basic hypothesis about Picquerism.

Regardless of whether a must-read turns out to be right, this category of book establishes a vocabulary and logic of action that people will discuss and attempt to implement for years to come, as did &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; and &quot;Reengineering the Corporation.&quot; In contrast, the no-read books, which are far too numerous to count, serve principally as resume builders or as crude promotional plugs for consulting firms. As cynical public relations gestures, the no-reads are entirely derivative, repackaging someone else's ideas while implying that you need to hire the authors to gain deeper insights. Indeed, what they have to offer can be summarised easily on the book flap, beyond which only captive student audiences or gullible clients would ever venture.&quot;Race for the World,&quot; another in the series of books by McKinsey &amp; Co. consultants on how to operate in the global economy, straddles the great grey area in between these two poles. The book starts off with a strong analysis of the &quot;transition&quot; economy, in which geographic barriers are rapidly falling before the globalist wave: world's financial markets converging and digital technologies are lowering communication costs; national governments are &quot;under market pressure&quot; to remove the old legal and regulatory barriers to global competition; consumers are gaining unprecedented power, both to find the best prices through some convenient dot.com company and to vote via their investment dollars. This ongoing race (or &quot;midgame&quot;) will determine which corporations can position themselves to become the &quot;shapers&quot; of the next century.The midgame, the authors assert, offers extraordinary, though rapidly vanishing, opportunities around which to build new corporate strategies. With their new-found access to foreign markets, corporations can create &quot;virtuous cycles of geographic expansion,&quot; simultaneously increasing their scale of operation, lowering their costs, and using new incoming profits to continue to invest elsewhere. Finally, by setting up their own networks of information, corporations can take advantage of cross-arbitrage opportunities, that is, buy goods and services from whatever country offers them cheapest.So far so good. While none of this is particularly new or original, it is in the formulation of strategies that the book will stand or fall. According to the authors, global firms must invest in a variety of intangible capital, including intellectual property, talented managers, networks of able partners, and brand image. If a corporation can integrate these intangible assets into a system that operates as of a piece, the authors maintain, then it will have established &quot;a compelling global value proposition&quot;: while single elements in the system may be replicable, imitating it as a whole is far more difficult for competitors. Furthermore, the authors argue, global firms should &quot;control, [though] not own&quot; the value chain, which represents a reversal from the practices once praised in large, vertically integrated firms. Sensible advice.Unfortunately, at this point the authors cross the line that separates lack of originality from banality. Firms must, the authors solemnly inform us, approach potential deals with the appropriate risk assessment techniques, many of which were developed for investment bankers. These techniques include: 1) &quot;disaggregating&quot; the many risks involved in large business decisions, that is, breaking them down to examine who bears what risks and for what, etc.; 2) focusing on those risks for which the firm enjoys &quot;familiarity advantages&quot;; 3) portfolio theory, i.e. diversification spreads risks; 4) options theory, or the ability to acquire a firm at a specified date in the future for a known price. These techniques, the authors conclude, will allow firms to &quot;overcom[e] confusion (lack of necessary knowledge), complexity (unknown interdependencies), and uncertainty (unknowable future events).&quot; While top executives are perhaps too busy to reflect on these strategies systematically, it is difficult to imagine that they haven't thought about these things already.However, there are deeper flaws at the core of the book. For starters, the seductive rhetoric of globalism is accepted as a given and fails to realistically anticipate any other contingencies, which is a disservice to business readers. The authors' insistence on proper risk analysis techniques cannot capture these complexities. Instead, the authors treat us to a simple extrapolation of current economic conditions. It remains unclear whether the current boom represents a structural trend (a &quot;new economy&quot;) or another speculative financial bubble. Confusing the two can lead to terrible mistakes. Unfortunately, though its purpose is to devise better strategies for managers overwhelmed by global change, &quot;Race for the Future&quot; offers no useful guidance in this regard.Even worse, evidence that contradicts their vision is ignored. The authors naively assume that globalisation is an unalloyed good, that consumers will prefer cheaper, more uniform goods to traditional indigenous varieties.Many of these shortcomings can be explained by the poorly hidden agenda of the book. How, one wonders, could four intelligent co-authors ever agree on a detailed analytic framework? The answer is simple: the book is part of the McKinsey &amp; Co. publicity machine. It promotes a company methodology, the conclusions of which come straight from McKinsey &quot;research,&quot; a kind of parallel universe of jargon, anecdotes, and fierce internal competition for attention between young &quot;associates&quot; fresh out of university. I suspect that, under the steady hand of good ghost writers, &quot;Race for the World&quot; was cobbled together from disparate articles from the McKinsey Quarterly with over-confidence and little critical regard. As a result, the book's &quot;authors,&quot; imbued with the company's mystique, fail to recognise the mediocrity of their ideas and advice.Nonetheless, &quot;Race for the World&quot; is no no-read. As long as the reader is aware of its limitations, it offers a solid introduction to gung-ho globalism. While the book contains more than could be written on a book flap, its ideas could have been resumed in, say, one article in the McKinsey Quarterly."},{"Title":"Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm","review":"This is another McKinsey book on strategy , which looks at strategies for market dominance in the context of globalisation. It covers an important subject well, but it is not in the same class as the earlier book from the Mckinsey stable Baghai et al. The Alchemy of Growth. It is concerned with financial, market segment, and arbitrage (taking advantage of geographic differences in productivity and factor cost) strategies to achieve dominance on a global basis within a preferred field. There is no doubt that these are important, but it is equally clear that they do not provide a full basis for a successful strategy. There is very little sense of concern with customer satisfaction or customer intimacy and surprisingly little concern with attracting and building skills other than to say it is important. Further, little attention is given to strategic partnering - alliances between equals - which is currently the focus of a great deal of strategic attention.My overall impression is that this is another example of a very good extended article that has been expanded into a 300 page book. It also suffers from a lack of summarisation of the main points. The overall impression is of a sharp but rather narrow focus on a few key elements in a successful global strategy, representing itself as the whole."},{"Title":"Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm","review":"This book is a good survey of some of the factors involved in globalization. It also provides some useful perspectives for thinking about your firm's choices. The book's key weakness is in taking a strategy perspective from about 50,000 feet in the air. Most executives will not be quite sure what to do with the principles that the authors outline, as a result.This book is essentially built around one concept: That cross-boundary competition for goods and services will go from 20 percent of world GDP now to 80 percent in 30 years. Naturally, this assumption is pretty critical. Chances are that not all industries will follow this model exactly. Some business areas will stay much more local than others, something this book doesn't talk much about. If globalization slows down or speeds up very much, business plans will quickly get out-of-kilter. Although the authors emphasize not under or overestimating globalization, they do not provide much insight into how one should think about how fast to go.Of the other irresistible forces in the global economy (like increasingly rapid technology changes, currency fluctuations, changing customer needs, homogenized culture, shifts in government regulation) little more than passing references are made except to assume that the cost of capital for big firms will go down and stay there (based on the trend of the last few years).I found that putting globalization at the center for your strategy is a doubtful thing to do. Other factors could easily be more important. How to decide how important globalization is for your company was not well addressed.I also suspect that the authors are somewhat inexperienced in best practice research, which makes me nervous about their conclusions. For example, they were surprised to find that 25 successful global firms relied on different strategies to succeed. Anyone who has done best practice benchmarking knows that best practices are scattered around among firms, not cloned in total into each leading organization. It may also be the case that globalization was only one factor in the selection of these practices. Without normalizing for the influence of the other factors, how do we know what the globalization best practices really are? This book is so qualitative that I doubt if any serious quantitative analysis was done in this area. If it was, I didn't see much sign of it in the text.I think that readers would have benefited from more detailed case histories. I happen to know a lot about how the companies (used as examples in the book) operate. If I had not had that knowledge, I think I could easily have drawn the wrong conclusions from the sketchy information that the authors provide. For example, the development of how Enron enters new business areas is worth a book all by itself. AES is another interesting example, around a somewhat different model, but was surprisingly left out by the authors.If you are an undergraduate business student, you will probably find this book provocative and interesting. If nothing else, you will have a better sense for what kind of executives will be in short supply in the future. As I mentioned earlier, if you are a business executive, you may be fascinated in places, but probably won't find much actionable in it. My 3 star grade is an average of 5 stars for the business student and 1 star for usefulness to the executive."},{"Title":"Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm","review":"According to its authors, this book &quot;offers a new and useful way of thinking about strategy in a world economy that is rapidly integrating....[therefore] the pace of economic transformation will continue to accelerate over the next several decades. In the next thirty years we will see radical econmic structuring in every industry and every national economy.&quot; Strategies are urgently needed to build a great global firm. Race for the World provides such strategies.I like the way the book is organized. First, the sauthors examine the nature and extent of &quot;the race&quot; in terms of the transition economy, running the race, gaining the high ground en route, and (meanwhile) maintaining control to accommodate the market-capitalization imperative. Then in Part II, the authors shift their attention to what is necessary to &quot;winning the race.&quot; Not every reader will fully agree with all of their observations and suggestions; however, all readers will (in my opinion) welcome the authors' circumspection, precision, and attention to relevant detail. This is a very carefully reasoned work.For me, one of the most valuable sections of the book is &quot;Moving Forward: Classes of Ideas&quot; in Chapter 11, the final chapter. According to the authors, there are three &quot;classes of ideas&quot;: those which have high returns relative to investment because they leverage a company's existing familiarity advantage; those which have the potential to offer attractive returns, but require that unfamiliarity be overcome before risks and returns can be reasonably estimated; and finally, those which involve real uncertainty...especially in terms of risk.The &quot;race for the world&quot; will be won by those who formulate and then manage these three classes of ideas, who shape the future by competing in the transition economy in new ways. The authors favor &quot;intangible-heavy, capital light approaches&quot; to building superior value propositions. Race for the World provides no guarantees. (The authors know better than that.) Rather, like a beacon on a foggy day or a dark night, Race for the World suggests a prudent direction to follow...and one then to be followed with both caution and passion."},{"Title":"Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm","review":"Even with the benefit of hindsight, it may not fundamentally matter how much of this book written in 1999 by four McKinsey consultants may seem overtaken by the facts of the post-Internet bubble of the late 1990s. This includes the collapse of Enron, a major McKinsey client which is nonetheless cited in this book as an agile player and adaptator to the inexorbale challenge of globalization which is at the heart of this book. It would be premature for business strategists or policy makers to wholly dismiss this book on account of such obvious errors of judgment.The basic framework within which this book views the future is shared by similar analyses done by other organizations. Because world trade has tended to grow faster than world economic output, the share of world output produced and consumed in global markets will inevitably grow rapidly - accordingly to this book, from about one-fifth of global output in the late 1990s to four-fifths by 2030. Within this time frame, total global ouptut will also grow, from $28 trillion in 1997 to $91 trillion in 2027. Whence the opportunities for a susbtantial reshaping of the competitive space for global corporations.What matters is that the fundamental message of this book (which is not by itself novel) is unchanged by the contemporary drivers of competitiveness for national economies and corporations: a dramatic lowering of so-called interaction costs and of barriers in product and factor markets continues to erode the advanatges of geographic incumbents in the business world, fostering the creation of cross-geographic specialists and consolidation of traditional integrators.Drawing substantially from Mckinsey's own research and data gathered from its Fortune 500 clientele, as well as insights from unconventional non-business sources such as Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, And Steel, the book advises global corporate leaders on how to reshape their firms and create global talent teams. The book is, not surprisingly - given the audience of the book - silent on what policy implications there are for countries which are also trying to adapt to these realities, other than the obvious imperative to open their national economies to world-class suppliers of tangible and intangible capital. There remains an important policy agenda to explore if one takes the fundamental propositions of this book seriously."},{"Title":"Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm","review":"Lowell gives us the inside on the development of new trends regarding global strategy.

The more I can learn about my favorite film maker -as an artist and person, the better. After reading Ken Hanke's unauthorized biography on Mr. Burton, I had learned so much about the man and his films. Hanke did an amazing job with the book.When I picked up this book today, and saw that it also contained a foreword by Martin Landau, and an afterword by Rick Heinrichs, I really was excited. Also, after reading on a Tim Burton fan site that this book was the best auto-biography to have been published so far, I was expecting A LOT. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.Not that Smith and Matthews did not put any effort into the book -I believe they put a lazy effort in cause it just does not deliver. The book is divided into chapters on each Burton film, yet it does not go the traditional route. Each chapter is broken up into categories that the authors feel each Burton film contains: Tagline/Trailer, Title Sequence, Story, Source Material, References, Production, Casting, Burton Regulars, Critics, Music, Cinematography, Plot Problems, Death, Children and Families, Clowns and The Circus, Dogs, Love Triangles, Checks, Stripes, Dots, Autobiography, Just Plain Weird, Dialogue To Skip For/Skip Past, Afterlife, Awards, Expert Witness, Trivia, Analysis, Availability, The Bottom Line.Are you bored yet? I certaintly was after the first few chapters. Not only did it feel like I was reading a 3rd grade book report -only on films, but every other sentence was a recycled Burton quote from past articles, or quotes from actors involved in the project. This would have been fine if mixed in with a great in-depth analysis of Burton and his films written in an intelligent and thought provoking manner with the authors' individual opinions and analysis (like Ken Hanke did). Not to say that Smith and Matthews are not intelligent writers, they just never display it in this book. They basically let the recycled quotes write the book for them -only occasionally throwing in some in depth analysis.Yes, Hanke's book was full of Burton quotes from interviews as well, but it was mixed in with great information and analysis of the man and the films, and really got deep into what may or may not have been going on in the artist's life, etc. It had personality behind it -this book does not.What also bothered me about this book is that there are a few typos -one that especially bothered me is the spelling of the late and great production designer Anton Furst's name. When first discussed, the authors introduce the designer as Anton FIRST, then in the next sentence call him by the correct spelling of FURST.Also, most of the trivia -like all the information given in the book, is nothing new to the die-hard Burton fans. For example -if they really wanted to impress me they would have talked about the scene in \\"Batman\\" where Bruce Wayne is watching The Joker and his henchmen cause chaos in front of City Hall. After The Joker does his \\"The Pen is truly mightier than the sword\\" speech and stabs an official with his pen, gun fire takes place. There is a shot of Bruce Wayne walking closer and closer to The Joker and Wayne is hit with a bullet. You see in the frame the bullet-hole appear on Wayne's coat, yet he is not affected and continues walking. This has always bothered/confused me in the film but Smith and Matthews don't even address it even though they have a category for Triva and Plot Problems. This would have been a perfect place to talk about it.One thing I like about this book is the availability category - that basically vents out at the studios for not putting out special edition DVDs for certain Burton films. Maybe it will wake some of these studios up and make them realize there is a hunger out there for extra features and commentary on many of these Burton classics. Touchstone finally realized it and will finally release the brilliant \\"Ed Wood\\" on DVD (with features) in August. Hopefully something good will come out of this book and getting Special Edition DVDs released of Burton films will be it.Though I believe this book is a total waste of time for a die-hard Burton fan, it is not a total waste if is picked up by someone who is just starting to get into Burton and his films. To me this is like the cliff notes to Ken Hanke's book. This is for someone who has seen every Burton film yet does not know much about the man behind the camera and is slowly becoming a fan or simply wants to know a little bit more about the filmmaker. It will give you a BRIEF glimpse of the man and his art, but will not go into DEEP detail.So in conclusion, as a die-hard Burton fan I was very disappointed with this read. To me Hanke's book, besides \\"Burton on Burton\\" of course, is the best book to read if you really want to dig deep into the mind of Burton and analyze the deeper meanings in his films. So if you're a die-hard like me, don't bother -you won't learn anything new about the man. Just read Hanke's book again, and listen to all of Burton's commentaries on the DVDs -they'll give you more insight into Burton's work and life than this book will."},{"Title":"The Swallow and the Tom Cat","review":"This is one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read.It is a book a child could read.

However, it is a well written book that provides solid all around advice for the new investor.The book touches on many aspects of investing without being biased toward any particular one. It basically gives an overviews of many of the tools available to make investing decisions and leaves it to the reader to choose and learn more. For example, it starts out with an overview of economic factors and then moves into fundamental analysis, charting and buy/sell guidelines. It then touches on options, IPO's and tax issues.Compared to other &quot;newbie&quot; books such as those by the Motley Fool, I think this offers a much more rounded approach. These books (and others) tend to present a biased view of the &quot;correct&quot; way to invest. This book gives a broader view that gives the reader more starting points to continue their learning and ultimately make better investing decisions.One final comment -- there is not a lot of advertising for the thestreet.com in this book.

(But I didn't write any part of the book; I'm busy on two new investing books of my own these days....)That said, I think this is the one book about investing that you simply MUST read if you're in the market now, or considering getting in.The investing landscape has changed profoundly over the past year, and virtually every other &quot;how to&quot; book on investing I know deals -- often very well -- with the way things *were.* This one looks at the way things ARE, and WILL BE this year...and gives you the tools and perspective you need to make money in a vastly more difficult market.Far from the easier and fondly-remembered world in which we invested in 1998 and especially 1999, during 2000 and now in 2001, this has become a market in which stock-picking is much harder -- but good stock-picking is even more important than it was.

Either you love it or you hate it, but there doesn't seem to be much of a middle ground. I would like to make an argument for that middle ground.The book is quite readable. Although it conveys some useful information, it is not as dry as many books on investing. Each chapter is actually penned by a different author, but the text flows well from subject to subject. It reads more like a lengthy magazine article than a book. Although the informal and almost conversational tone of the prose makes for light and quick reading, the authors do convey some practical advice. The book is full of references to various websites (and not just their website, street.com) for researching stocks. Although this is extremely useful for the internet-savvy investor, it may tend to date this book. I suspect it will become less useful as it becomes farther away from its publication date. It covers the major aspects of fundamental analysis well, and has a particularly good chapter on when to sell a stock (and its relative tax implications), which is often missing from comparable investment books. Although it touches upon technical analysis and charting, the discussion is very superficial and is better addressed in other references.Overall, it's a useful book and even somewhat fun to read. It is by no means comprehensive and probably not the only investing book you'll ever need.

The phrase \\"brave new world\\" comes from Shakespeare via Aldous Huxley, who of course used it ironically. It will be the rare investor who can read those words today without a twinge of pain: most of the last two years have been a bad trip for stock owners. Many people with money in the stock market have seen their gains evaporate like snow in Tucson.The more you know about how the market works, presumably, the less you are likely to succumb to the investor's perennial traps - fear and greed - or pay the price for naivet&eacute;. TheStreet.com Guide to Smart Investing in the Internet Era has a splendid pedigree, namely the web site TheStreet.com (and its sister site, RealMoney.com), and Kansas has called on a number of its shrewd writers to contribute sections in their own areas of expertise.The book benefits from most of its writers having been \\"in the trenches,\\" that is, actually having spent years trying to make money on Wall Street. They are not just journalists or academic theorists. The book, like the site that spawned it, has a pleasingly pragmatic quality.It is also easy to read, insofar as a subject with as many complexities as equity investing can be easy. Even the through-the-looking-glass world of options almost seems to make sense in these pages. (But although the discussion includes shorting stocks and buying and selling puts, there is, curiously, no section about selling covered calls - the only form of options trading that is appropriate for many nonprofessional investors. The book's other major gap is that there is nothing about the strategy of indexing, which deserves consideration.)It is evident that care went into this guide. It has been editorially polished, unlike so many quick-and-dirty productions from even supposedly reputable publishers today that appear to have gone directly from the author's word processor to type.Just about all the important topics are covered in enough detail to be useful but not so much as to be esoteric. Also included are two worthwhile features that I have not seen in any other investment guide: a table, based on specific quantitative and qualitative criteria, of the best stock analysts in a variety of sectors; and another table ranking online brokers, based on a reader survey by TheStreet.com.But while TheStreet.com Guide does many things well, and there is nothing particularly wrong with it, I have to confess to being mildly disappointed. The problem is style - or rather, the lack of it - rather than substance.If you are familiar with TheStreet.com or RealMoney.com web sites (which I expect most of those who buy the book will be), you know that James Cramer, the sites' co-founder and frequent contributor, is that rare bird who can write about stocks with color, flair and wit. Many of the sites' other writers have something of the same ability. The web sites flash lightning; they're a gas to read as well as timely and informative. The book goes down smoothly, but it's rather bland. To see what I mean, compare its prose with that of the glossary, which is written by Cramer himself. (Sample Cramer-isms: \\"Dumb money: Slow money, usually mutual-fund or pension money.\\" \\"Flip: When you get a hot stock and you blow it out immediately. The brokerages try to discourage flipping, but in this crazy market where only small bits of stock get floated at the beginning, there are a ton of flippers on these pops.\\")If TheStreet.com Guide to Investing in the Internet Era as a whole had been written with this kind of sass, which appears regularly on the web site, it would have been more memorable. Nevertheless, the book is less work to read than most of its ilk, and will teach you things you don't know or encourage you to think freshly about things you do. For this \\"brave new world\\" of online investing, TheStreet.com Guide is worth its weight in armor plating."},{"Title":"TheStreet.com Guide to Smart Investing in the Internet Era: Everything You Need to Know to Outsmart Wall Street and Select Winning Stocks","review":"The Street.com is just another overhyped dot-com company that couldn't keep its own financial house afloat so why take financial advice from a failure?You also have to wonder whether the 5-star ratings are all supplied by Street.com employees who are trying to look out for their own financial futures and jobs.BTW: The information in this book isn't even original or given in enough depth to do a reader much good.

The internet changed the way people invest, research, buy, and sell stocks or other investments. The authors show readers how the internet can be used during the research process. I liked the information about how investors can use message boards. But the author warns readers that there might be people trying to manipulate prices by writing untrue statements about companies.I also enjoyed reading about the IPO Game. Individual investors have disadvantages when they decide to participate in IPOs. The three most powerful parties in the IPO process are the investment bankers, the corporations being taken public, and the institutional investors who are the banker's main customers. Unless individual investors are able to get in at the \\"insider's\\" price, the changes of making money are slim. But with patience, they might find newly traded companies favorably priced after the 25-day mark or lockup period.

Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"In The American, Henry James attempts to convey the differences between the market-driven republicanism of the United States and the monarchical traditions of Old Europe (France in particular). It seems that whenever anyone explores differences, stereotypes precipitate from the mix, and even the careful craft of Henry James is subject to this law of language. Yet one gets the sense that James is aware that presuming to accurately describe actual differences carries with it the risk of proscribing inferred differences. Thus, the novel seems to be more about the act of writing about differences - and not just nineteenth century differences - than anything else.At the end of The American, neither \\"side\\" truly wins or loses in any definite sense, and this becomes emblematic of Modernity - the inability (futility?) inherent in attempting to reconcile past traditions with new ideas. Ezra Pound's mantra, \\"make it new,\\" gave a center to Modernism, and The American shows us that the desire for newness inherently involves negotiations with the past: Those who carry old traditions desire to render their time-worn customs as eternally of the present while those seeking new ideas must remember the ideas of the past so as to break from them. The overwhelming questions remain: When should one drop outdated customs in favor of something new, and how can one recognize traditions worth keeping?"},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Christopher Newman (Columbus and New Man) is a successful mid-career retired post-Civil War American industrialist in Paris seeking the best of the best. James creates fascinating characters, but they are somewhat stereotypical from a modern reader's perspective. The novel is a joy to read, even if it is slow to evolve at times. This is an accessable classic novel, without direct intrusions from the author's personal life, art or politics. This is a great work of cultural anthropology, providing insight into the declining post-revolution culture of France and the emerging American leadership class. It contrasts old world tradition, honor, family and politics with New World innocence, commercialism and naivete. The core love story is romantic and touching. James was one of the first to paint a picture of the possible end of civilization. The old world was scheming to hold on to its privileges. The new world had no deeper values than profits, activity, travel, imitation art and mindless pursuit of the best. The rich picture of characters and society does not overcome the final outcome, leaving the reader asking existential questions without answers (or even clues) as to how to live a good life in the modern age."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"James hadn't quite reached his top form here. The plot is somewhat melodramatic and improbable and some of the characters (particularly the evil Europeans)are excessively stereotyped. This is,nonetheless, a great novel. The descriptions of France are incredibly vivid, and the writing is so fluent that it is a true pleasure to read, unlike some of the author's later, more mannered productions.

Set in late nineteenth century Paris, it combines a love story with the struggle between a new, wealthy American and an old, traditional French family over the lovely daughter of the family.The story involves Christopher Newman, a wealthy American businessman, during the Paris portion of his European tour. Romance seems be a large part of what he is looking for. The first suggestion that he may have found it occurs in his encounter with the artist, Noemie Nioche. This turns out to be merely a passing fancy. Things get more serious when his American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Tristan put him in contact with an attractive young widow, Claire de Cintre.Madame de Cintre, nee Bellegarde, whose first marriage had been arranged to an elderly nobleman who gave her a title, but little else. Upon meeting Newman, both seem to find what they are looking for in the world of romance. As the story develops it becomes clear that it is sufficient for Newman to win Claire but that he must also win over her family, which consisted of her mother, Madame de Bellegarde and her brother, Urbaine, the Marquis de Bellegarde.The House of Bellegarde was full of pride and tradition, but short of money. As the Bellegardes size up Newman, it becomes obvious that they are weighing the sale of their pride for Newman's money. Ultimately they reach their decision. In their last meeting, Claire informed Newman of that she was to become a nun. Although shocked, Newman could not persuade Claire to break free of her family's rule and breath the free air which comes so naturally to an American.Given one piece of evidence, Newman attempts to recover Claire back through blackmail. When the Bellegardes refuse to submit, Newman destroys his evidence. Up to the very end, the reader is left hoping for the happy ending, but he hopes in vain.For the romantic, this book provides an inspiring love story. For the historian, it provides a glimpse into the life of Nineteenth Century Aristocracy on two continents. For the lover of freedom, it provides a struggle between New World freedom and individuality and Old World tradition and bonds of consanguinity. With something for everyone, The American is a worthwhile read for all."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"OK so it takes half the book to get to the story. In typical Henry James fashion you are completely prepared for the action. Unlike Thomas Hardy, whose surroundings tell us of the character of the person it surrounds, James wishes you to know the depth of his characters as seen through the eyes of others. This of course brings on many minor characters that just seem to disappear, but it is a view of a person as if the reader was on the other side of the mirror watching the story unfold. Yes, James is wordy, yes this is not a quick read, but Henry James has a mastery of language and story telling that is rare.&quot;The American&quot; is a wonderful love story that ends as a real life love story might end. Do not expect roses and happily ever after, it is as much a story of an ancient social system as it is of the life of &quot;our hero.&quot; And the thing that seems to get missed is that Henry James actually wrote this as a mystery, not a love story.This is a novel to contemplate and read between the lines. Good verses Evil, Noveau vs Old Money, Right and Wrong, can literature get any better than that?"},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"A great book. Old World versus New World subtlties. A quiet, stewing story reaches some high points with brilliant ideas of morality and fairness along the way. Virtue versus Tradition, Ambition versus Pride, Status versus Promise. If you appreciate ideas; if you appreciate characters and their circumstances, this book is for you. My favorite line of the book, about old money and old French aristocratic families: \\"Old trees have crooked branches, old houses have queer cracks, old races have odd secrets.\\" You can smell the characters coming off the pages in this book. They come alive. Their weaknesses, their strenghts, their contradictions, their fates. No longer are characters developed, questioned, and identified with, in modern writing, as they are in a Henry James novel. Although James will spend three pages describing a scene in a restaurant, the foundation he lays in terms of characters and mood is unrivaled. One really becomes enthraled in the situation, and eventual outcome. If, for some thoroughly believeable reason, you find the writing to be taxing, and have troubles with the detailed descriptions, please press on. Let yourself absorb what the author is trying to tell you. Your reward will be having read a fine novel."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"This book is nuanced and subtle.The main characters are tangibleand compelling.

It's like a soup that needs to boil all day, so it's kept on low, but when it's done, it's perfect. The book stays at the pace of &quot;our hero&quot; the American Christopher Newman. A smart, educated, rich, yet easy going, simple, and humane veteran of the Civil War and a self made tycoon, who goes to Europe to see the &quot;treasures and entertain&quot; himself.He becomes entangled in what he thinks is a simple plan for matrimony, but is really truly a great deal larger and more treacherous and terrible than that.We spend a lot of time in Newman's mind, paragraphs of character analaysis are sprung upon us, but nothing seems plodding or slow, nothing feels useless. By the end of the book we find that we think like the character and can only agree with what he does. We react to seemingly big plot twists and events as he does, without reaction, and a logical, common sense train of thought.But don't misunderstand that. For a book that is so polite and the essence of &quot;slow-reaction&quot;, it is heartwrenching and tragic. You will cry, you will wonder, and you will ask yourself questions. Colorful, lifelike, and exuberant characters fight for your attention and your emotions, and we are intensely endeared to them. Emotional scenes speckle the book and are just enough. And the fact that something terrible and evil exists in this story hangs over your head from the beginning. It's hard to guess what happens because James doesn't give us many clues, and the ending may come as a surprise to some people. And without us knowing it, James is comparing American culture to European culture (of the day), and this in of itself is fulfilling.Indeed, James uses every page he has, without wasting any on detailed landscapes and useless banter. 2 pages from the end you have a wrenching heartache, but the last paragraph and page is utterly and supremely satisfying, and you walk away the way Newman walks away, at peace."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"I have this friend who hates Henry James. I can't understand it. The style is dated, in that people dont write that way today, but as you get into the book you begin to enjoy the style, as well as the plot, characters, and French/American dual culture shock that still goes on today. (For an update on the theme, look at Le Divorce and Le Mariage by Diane Johnson). I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to these characters and the description of Paris in the Second Empire were fascinating. If you watch the Masterpiece Theatre version without having read the book, you will be totally confused. They moved events out of sequence all over the place and after about ten minutes I shut off the tape and picked up the book. You have to know the whole story before you watch them throw characters and events at you in the first two scenes that only appear 2/3 of the way through the novel, after a foundation has been laid as to who they are and when and why things happened.I couldnt recommend this more for a good read. The only caution I have is for readers who have never been to France. They may get an extremely negative impression of French people from many of the characters in this book. Go to Paris and you will find the city is wonderful, and so are the French people. These characters are not typical!! They belong to a certain class, and the book does take place 150 years ago. If this book doesnt get you hooked on James, I dont know what will. Try Washington Square and dont miss that movie, with Jennifer Jason Leigh, Albert Finney and Maggie Smith."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"This is about a successful American businessman in his thirties who leaves the USA, having made his fortune in copper and railroads, to travel around Europe and to find a wife. He encounters an old friend in the Louvre who takes him home and introduces him to his own interesting wife. Mrs. Tristram takes Christopher happily under her wing, absorbs him into her circle of friends, and tells him of an old friend who'd be just the perfect wife for him - a young and beautiful widowed countess of unimpeachable descent. Christopher meets Claire de Cintr&eacute; and from that moment his one obsession is to marry her.An attractive hero, he possesses remarkable talents. In fact he has pretty well every virtue except exalted antecedents; he is, for example, tall, good-looking, urbane, well-mannered, forthright, intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, persistent, good-natured, generous and rich. At their first meeting he conquers Claire sufficiently to be allowed to continue to visit her, instead of being shown the door. Actually, his dogged audacity is pretty amazing; he simply asks her to marry him after about the fifth meeting, because he wants everything to be above-board. She says No and he promises not to mention the matter for another six months. He then succeeds in making a bargain with her mother and brother, the most rigid and narrow dyed-in-the-wool aristocrats, that they will not stand in his way or say anything against him until she accepts his hand. Marquise and marquis make no secret of their dislike of him (\\"a commercial person\\"), nor of their horror and disgust at the entire proposition. These are two different worlds. Christopher is aware of it but is confident that their differences can be overcome; after all he is very rich and he knows this is important to them. He sees no reason why sensible individuals would not agree in time to a straightforward and sensible offer.Matters seem to proceed well or better than can be expected, and when the six months are up Claire graciously accepts Christopher's proposal. A dramatic turn of events, however, obstructs their happy plans.Henry James is a joy for those who like a sedate plot to unfold slowly, carefully and thoroughly. His psychological observations are minute; his characters drawn with deftest strokes, and one or two lighter subplots fill out the general late-Victorian picture. Bigoted aristocrats, unprincipled upstarts, impulsive young noblemen, impassive secret-keepers, loquacious duchesses, these and many other finely-drawn characters fill the pages of this enthralling story."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Though nothing I've read so far compares to Portrait of a Lady, this novel is up there (with Roderick Hudson, The Bostonians, and What Maisie Knew) with his best work.Yes, it's a page turner with the standard James conventions - the European setting, the culture clashes and faux pas, the decaying nobility with their dark secrets, and wry humor.Very entertaining, and great for a summer read. I heard that Masterpiece Theatre is working on an adaptation."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"What does a confident, energetic, single, self-made American millionaire do after amassing a fortune while still in his thirties? In the case of Christopher Newman, the good-natured, optimistic protagonist in Henry James' The American (published 1877), our hero (as James labels him) takes his money and makes on an extended visit to Europe, in search of culture, amusement and excitement to complement his exceedingly practical commercial past. The primary storyline centers on Newman's tireless efforts to marry a French woman, Claire, who is the woman of his dreams. Although the relationship goes passably well at first, despite obvious differences between Newman's straightforward American ways and Claire's aristocratic family, events abruptly take a turn for the worse about two-thirds of the way through the novel. Ultimately, Newman's \\"commercial side\\" is too much for the class-conscious Bellegardes to bear, and Claire is forced to reject Newman and retreat to the confines of a nunnery.For anyone with an interest in understanding the clash of American and European society, values and culture, particularly in the late 19th century, The American is a worthwhile read. While the language and style of the work are at times a bit tedious, James' classic novel succeeds in elevating a common literary theme--man meets woman--onto a higher, more expansive cross-cultural stage. Though a happier resolution may have made for a more popular work of fiction, the realistic, less romanticized ending, with Newman pensive and melancholic and Claire cloistered away and out-of-touch in the nunnery, is exemplary of our universal human condition--a bittersweet affair in which openness and honesty do not necessarily win out over the inevitable prejudices, societal norms and sometimes even ill intentions of others.One element of the story that I was hoping to find but did not was at least an inkling of how Newman, Claire, the Bellegardes or any other character in the novel go about finding a sense of \\"deeper meaning\\" in life. Newman has money but seeks an ideal wife. Claire appears to have the choice of marrying but is really being controlled by her family and ends up seeking solace (and maybe even emotional freedom?) in religion. The Bellegarde family have social status but are too embroiled in internal strife to be content. Beyond his cross-cultural (American versus European) social commentary, could James also be hinting that neither money, nor status, nor family, nor religion can bring us lasting satisfaction? If not any of the above, toward what higher objective should we all--individuals and societies alike---spend our waking hours striving toward?"},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Having recently been exposed to European aristocracy, I found reading this book, as an American, irresistible. I disagree with reviewers who say there is no longer tension between French and American ideology as manifest on a daily interactive level. It's still there. Many Americans view the French as rude and cynical (not unlike the reviewer from Jamaica, New York), whilst the French, perhaps rightly, view Americans as hopelessly naive and 'gauche'. As James's book attests, this isn't a recent phenomenon, and the exploration of the roots of it is fascinating. I do agree that much of the conflict stems from class distinction, but James' own interpretative notes indicate an interest in exploring the clash of ideologies, and he chose the aristocracy because it was that facet of European civilization most &quot;entrenched&quot; in the old ways of thinking vis a vis' the new, American viewpoint. The narrative style is smooth. I thought the prose more attractive than that in 'Portrait of a Lady', for instance, which was almost Teutonic in its abhorrence of placing verbs at the beginning stages of the sentences."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Christopher Newman, a wealthy, good-natured Western magnate, has retired to Europe in order to better himself. There he is introduced to Claire de Cintr&eacute; as a representative of his ideal woman. He does prize her, and determines to marry her, though the nobility of her family, the Bellegardes, seems to preclude such a bond. His friendship with her brother and easy democratic feeling make Newman regard himself as &quot;noble&quot; as they, though of course he isn't. It's quite a subtle and clever tale; it's not quite a doomed romance, for there's little indication that Newman and Claire really love each other. She finds him novel and he finds her ideal, but would they make a happy couple? And as the book is told mostly from the viewpoint of Newman, it requires reading between the lines to see just what a bumbler the tall, rich, confident American is when it comes to European social traditions. Finally, there is deep suspense when Newman has the chance to damage the Bellegardes' reputation. James draws the question out masterfully, and provides a very correct, if bittersweet, ending. It's a fine novel of manners, written in skillful, deft prose."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Henry James lived most of his life in Europe. When he was 36 years oldhe wrote a novel about an American millionaire named Chrisopher Newman who was also 36. The novel of manners opens in Paris where Christopher(named for Christopher Columbus) is enjoying his fortune, visiting art galleries and looking for a suitable wife. The Civil War veteran is a non-intellectual who is a version of an innocent abroad. He will join the countless characters in Jamesian fictions who are innocent Americans dealing with the old world culture of European sophistication.Through a friend Mrs. Tristam he meets the Bellegard family. He falls in love with the enigmatic Claire Bellegarde courting her for several months. She agrees and then refuses to wed him. Claire retreats to a nunnery in Paris. Claire had been \\"sold\\" by her family to the rich and old man Cintre but he has died. She is used as a pawn by her evil mother and odious older brother. The reader will learn why she rejects Newman, the secret of the Bellegarde family and gain an appreciate of what society was like in the 1870s in Paris.A secondary plot deals with the young Valentin Bellegarde who fights a duel over a prostitute. He befriends Newman introducing him to his formidable mother and brother.The book is very understandable \\"The American\\" is not like the later James works of\\"The Wings of the Dove, \\"The Ambassadors\\", and \\"The Golden Bowl\\" with their dense prose and convoluted pyschological style of probing the consciousness of the major characters.Henry James was a genius who sought to understand the human heart. In this novel of 1876 the master has produced a fine book. This book is a good introduction to the world of James. Recommended."},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"Why read Henry James? He can be quite difficult, and his 19th century world was so very different from ours... or was it? This novel, among other things, poses an eternally relevant question: Can money buy everything? Like Edith Wharton, young Henry James was fascinated by the precise effects of wealth, power and social position on interpersonal relationships. He gives us a character, Christopher Newman, who he calls \\"a powerful specimen of an American\\" - a tall, handsome, charming, intelligent self-made businessman of incredible personal wealth. He comes to Europe to find the one thing he hasn't got -- a perfect wife, \\"the best article in the market.\\" He settles in Paris and is befriended by The Tristams, two unhappily married expatriates. The husband is too much of a boor for Newman to tolerate much, but he develops a friendship with Mrs. Tristam, who claims she knows the perfect woman for Newman: a widow from a semi-impoverished aristocratic family. Claire de Cintre is everything Newman is looking for, and he falls in love during a slow courtship consisting of chilly fireside teas with her creepy family, who make it clear that he is a totally undesirable suitor, in spite of his vast wealth. The mere fact that he has had to WORK for his money renders him too \\"vulgar\\" to even consider marrying into a family with the blood of archdukes, no matter how hard up they are. It's seriously strange to even imagine a world where great wealth could be seriously second-guessed in such a way. Yet James seems to suggest there is something laudable in even such extreme snobbery. \\"I must say, to give the Devil his due, there is something rather fine in that...They wanted your money, but they have given you up for an idea.\\" James, an expatriate himself, foresaw the 20th century American Empire and the triumph of pure filthy lucre over corrupt aristocracy, and (also like Edith Wharton) he was ambivalent about it. This is an early James and easier to read, and much less complex, than his later greater novels like \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" and \\"Wings of the Dove.\\" But it's worth the modicum of effort, because the ending of the story hints at his potential for deeper psychological subtlety and ambiguity. Did Mrs. Tristam deliberately set Newman up with a woman she knew was unavailable because she was in love with him herself? And how much did that very unattainability influence Newman's attraction? \\"I don't believe you would have been happy... I wanted very much to see, first, whether such a marriage could actually take place; second, what would happen if it should take place.\\" -- \\"Say I should have been miserable then; it's a misery I should have preferred to any happiness.\\""},{"Title":"The American [Jimcin Edition]","review":"If you haven't read this book yet and don't want to know how it ends, then don't read Jim Gallen's review, &quot;A Romance for the Unromantic&quot;.

Take Haddou, for example, his somewhat ornery landlord, who in spite of being married for about 30 years, has probably spent less that 3 of those years together with his family.Out-migration is in the Moroccan blood. As one US diplomat says, \\"I hear the Moroccans are the 'Mexicans' of Europe.\\" We learn that before Europe, Algeria was the land of choice for emigration (who would have ever guessed such a thing?). We learn that Spain, formerly a country that Moroccans merely passed through on their way to Germany, France, Holland and Germany, is now becoming a premier final emigration destination, as its GDP moves upward, and as anti-immigrant sentiment grips the colder parts of Europe.Back in Nador, many Nadoris are resentful for the fact that repatriated Moroccans, with repatriated wages, have greatly inflated the cost of local weddings. Not to be outdone, the local Nadoris figure out numerous ways to get back at the \\"nouveau rich\\" for rocking the boat of class distinctions.And through it all McMurray juxtaposes the story of his own family--his son Charlie, born into Moroccan society; his wife Joan (a much needed \\"confidant\\" for that scoop on womens'issues)--against the varied mosaic of Rifi culture.Speaking of womens' issues, the entire time McMurray is in Nador, he never meets his landlord's wife (obviously because of the sexually segregated nature of Nadori society). Indeed, he hardly meets his landlord for that matter, as the latter is in Germany nearly 11 months of each year. But the conservative nature of Moroccan society can't stop a couple of single women from occasionally dropping by, where they entertain themselves in McMurray's kitchen, smoking, letting their hair down, and (un)knowingly?, giving up valuable information for this book.In all, a good read, with lots of colorful characters and rich dialogue that leaves the reader with a true feeling for the dynamics of life in a tiny country crying out for economic equality., , ,"},{"Title":"In And Out Of Morocco: Smuggling and Migration in a Frontier Boomtown","review":"In and Out of Morocco is an account of the many ways migration has impacted a Moroccan border boom town.

The author also investigates the second most important source of change in the town; namely, smuggling. Together these two forces have had enormous effects on the people of Nador. I had to read the book for a course, but even so, I enjoyed the many different ways McMurray talked about socioeconomic changes. He provided a chapter on a work biography of a Nador migrant which dealt with the hardships imposed on families back home when migrants are away. He also devoted a chapter to the folklore of migration, and another to the way migration has even affected the music of the region. Most interesting for me was the chapter on the ways migrants have upset the status and prestige systems back in Nador; that, and the fascinating chapter on all of the smuggling across the local border with the Spanish North African city of Melilla.

It saddens me that there is very little real wildnerness left in this country to the point that nature books are now written about what most of us experience: a totally tamed and domesticated landscape where only a few small creatures can survive.

From the crows and the chipmunk she considers her friends, to the aggressive invasive species (both plants and animals), she provides interesting and informative insights into the history and culture of the American yard.

Tailless squirrels. Weeds as our friends. Crow antics. A Cheeky chipmunk. Drama, comedy, and huge life and death decisions compete for writer Hannah Holmes's attention out on her two tenths of an acre back lawn. This is a wonderful book in so many ways. Number one - it's beautifully written. Passionate, funny, informative, and engrossing, Holmes's prose has been honed as fine as one blade of feral grass on the Freedom Lawn she so treasures in her back yard. Number two - it's chock full of details regarding some of the common, yet extraordinary, things we see every day. The reader may laugh over the antics of Holmes's crows, but at the same time, she is teaching us about crow ecology - what they contribute to our environment and why they're important. She does this with each carefully considered topic - from why weeds are good to how many threads make up Babbette the spider's web in her study. Number three - A Year on the Lawn is an important educational and ecological tool that would be a great asset to high school science classes. Number four - things we idly wonder about while sipping iced tea in our own backyards are honored here in spades. This is a great read, no matter the season, whether you're on a summer-kissed deck or looking out at the piles of snow covering the backyard grill. Move it to the top of your pile."},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"Even though this book was so highly recommended, I had trouble picking it up. A year examining the backyard? What?As soon as I started the book, through, I was hooked on the intense social lives of Holmes's crows, the eating and gathering habits of her local chipmunk, her people-wary squirrel clan (many of whom lost parts of their tails), the oh-so-important bugs, and more. I'm not generally a reader of biology and nature books, so trust me when I say this book reaches across genres to the armchair reader.In fact, Holmes supports her thrilling narrative with citations from many biology books. I can only imagine how dry these texts are, and I thank her for giving us the \\"best parts\\" in narrative form. I learned about the navigational skills of robins and the extensive scientific studies conducted on the species, as well as the fact that hummingbirds have to learn to love the color red for its sugar, and many a baby hummingbird can be found picking at dry brown leaves and stems. Holmes also discusses experiments that were conducted to learn how squirrels know to eat white oak acorns (which germinate before winter) and save red oak acorns (which can be stored through winter without germination). Holmes manages to pack all this scientific information and more into a terrific narrative about a woman and her backyard.This book is highly recommended. I can think of nothing else that compares, and the story of Hannah and her backyard is anything but mundane."},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"This is a really fascinating look at the life that exists in a small suburban lawn---the many stories that play out there, with birds, squirrels, trees, grasses, even fungi! It's written in a light and very readable way, and is enjoyable from start to finish.A few things would have made this book even better in my eyes. I'd have loved a drawing or map of the yard---the author often refers to different regions of the yard, like the Bamboo Forest, and I just couldn't quite picture how the yard was set up. Also, like many people, I didn't have a good idea how big 2/10th of an acre was---It would have been great to have been given something to compare the size of the yard with. At times, also, the author is a little more cutesy that I like, with slangy names for things that seem a little forced, like she was trying too hard not to be technical.The most interesting thing I learned from this book was how huge the problem of non-native species is in this country! I remember doing a report in high school on periwinkles, which were all over the Maine coast I grew up on, and finding out they were introduced to the coast just centuries before. I checked several other sources as I just couldn't believe that to be true---there were so MANY of them! Now I realize how giant the problem is, and how MOST of the life in the author's yard is non-native. I wonder what we can do about this problem?Certainly a recommended read, especially for those who enjoy watching the birds and wildlife close to home and would like to better understand what they see!"},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"Looking for some books to read before going on vacation recently, I was drawn to \\"Suburban Safari\\" for a number of reasons, not in the least because I live in the 'burbs myself, with a backyard, and not much of a gardner frankly.\\"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn\\" is the hilarious tale by the author of how she experienced life in her yard for one whole year. It's amazing what all happens. Bugs, plants, birds, flowers, grass, it all grows and interacts in one way or another. From the book inside cover, I gather that Hannah Holmes has made her name through various science-related writings. It goes to the author's credit that she keeps the book as unscientific as possible, and with a healthy dose of humor. The pages just fly by. In all, if you're looking for a fun yet informative read, \\"Suburban Safari\\" easily fits the bill. Highly recommended, and I know that I won't look at my backyard ever the same way again!"},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"We often think of wilderness as somewhere \\"out there,\\" in a national park somewhere. This book brings wilderness back home. It is sure to give you a greater appreciation and awareness of the expansive wilderness in/under/around your carefully manicured lawn.What makes Holmes a unique writer is her combination of scientific scrutiny and next-door-neighbor casualness. It's evident from her writing that she rigorously studies scientific literature but she does what few other science writers do: she translates the dry science in a way that sounds like a friendly neighbor (rather than a science journalist) is describing it to you. Her style has been criticized as \\"cutesy,\\" veering too close to anthropomorphism, but if it helps us understand and appreciate the science in an accurate way -- and I think there's no denying that it does -- then \\"cutesy\\" is fine by me.P.S. - For a book that brings wilderness closer to home, check out Holmes's other bookThe Secret Life of Dust.P.P.S. - For a book that brings wilderness even closer to home -- your own body -- check outThe Wild Life of Our Bodies."},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"Anyone who's lived for any period of time in any kind of suburban neighborhood, or really any kind of community that has trees and grass, will find this a fascinating and highly educational read about our animal neighbors.The constantly complex and often life-dependent activities of neighborhood birds, rodents, and even ants is broken down in entertaining detail to the point that it even made me want to sit outside for hours and observe these activities for myself, if only I had the time to do so.A highly recommended read for nature and animal-lovers."},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"Ms. Holmes conveys the spirit and joy of the true scientist in writing about her backyard biosphere.

Reed"},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"Although the author has a fantastic vocabulary and writes well, I feel that she veered off the subject of her CURRENT backyard too often. I had no interest in reading about the glacial age and the history of wolves in Maine and an entire chapter was dedicated to it. Nor was I interested in reports about lawns in Arizona and California, where the author had visited, or facts about the insulation in her house, and the way that fuel usage affects the environment.However, there are interesting observations presented in a very readable manner, along the way. If you are interested in native versus non-native plant species, you will learn about them here. And some stories, like the relationship that develops with a chipmunk, are heartwarming.In summation: I felt that many of the subjects written about were not first hand experiences, but rather information that the author gleened from professionals in their respective fields. I expected something along the lines of a journal, and something with a stronger timetable, that would represent \\"A Year on the Lawn\\"."},{"Title":"Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn","review":"This is a must-have for any household: a serious-minded, witty, often hilarious, gorgeously written account of the teeming natural world just outside the back door.

However it was a fun read. I am currently taking an ecology class and this book made such an interesting companion. Holmes writes about seemingly boring topics (at least to the type that don't really enjoy science) and make it interesting.

The authors have developed a mathematical model of the golf club and have used computers to analyze innumerable combinations of head speed, center or gravity, club loft, club length, etc. They have come up with an analysis of what is important and what doesn't matter in golf club design. Here's what works for a driver: long (46 inches), low center of gravity, huge club face, unique bulge and roll, and very stiff light shaft. All the other stuff is of no importance, so forget about it. Outstanding."},{"Title":"How Golf Clubs Really Work and How to Optimize Their Design","review":"Werner and Greig have written an excellent book on club design that is suprisingly practical. Each chapter is short and readable.The subject matter is directly applicable to playing golf. Golfers who have read Pelz and Hogan will enjoy the combination of analysis and golfing tips. The graphs and technical information can be difficult to interpert, but aren't essential to understanding the key points."},{"Title":"How Golf Clubs Really Work and How to Optimize Their Design","review":"Well, it certainly seems that the authors put a LOT of time and effort into this work. They seem to have done a tremendous amount of testing, of clubs in particular. And, then they developed a mathematical model to introduce variables that would take a lifetime to replicate by actual imperical testing with (exhausted) golfers. The result is this work, with lots of experimentation and documentation, and quite a few conclusions. However, I don't think this is the book you want to labor through if you are looking for clear and concise explanations and recommendations for your personal club selection or modification. They say you can learn something from every experience. I have to say I learned quite a few things while reading. But it was a little tough going.The authors have a newer, and perhaps more concise book on nearly the same topic, which I have not read."},{"Title":"How Golf Clubs Really Work and How to Optimize Their Design","review":"Golf club components have changed considerably since this book was published.

Rolvaag's prose is richly evocative of the solitude and loneliness of the wide prairie expanses and the savage elements of winter blizzards and summer locust plagues. His characters are deep and complex, and the whole story reads like a literary soap opera almost impossible to put down. A great achivement, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Per Hansa,the Nordic and absoultley opptomistic main figure has the strength in his heart to help all in the settlement except for his wife Beret. Beret too far from her Norway has nothing to look at but the big sky. No doubt out of her element. She is tormented even by looking outside at the vast landscape. Written in Norwegian and translated into English I have learned that this Norwegian story writing tradiition has alot to teach writers who write from the heart. The text is so mature and inspiring. I always like a strong ending and I'd say next to Invisable Man, by Ralph Ellison this is as extraordinary. Read Giants in the Earth even if you never intended to. You should not miss this tale of bravery on the prarie frontier."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Many and incredible are the tales the grandfathers tell from those days when the wilderness was yet untamed. Tales of locust plagues (of 1873,74,75,76,77 and part of 78) where swarms would land on a fork with a handle of hickory standing and after a few minutes the surface of the handle would be rasped and chewed, a mass of loose slivers; somewhere else a garment might be laid out on the ground to dry - a swarm would light on it, and in a moment only shreds would be left; and crops - if the annihilating devils of Dakota were in the proper mood, they would take anything and leave nothing. Not to mention 80 days of snow that fell and fell and fell starting October 15, 1880. Whole herds of cattle were smothered . They disappeared during the early storm in October, and were never seen again. When the snow let up in April 1881, they would reappear low on some hillside. After lying there for six months, they would be a horrible sight. And what about the human toll? The death and destruction, the abject poverty, the grimy grim unrelenting toil? The evil landscape, the boredom, the too hard life far far from home and civilization drives many (including Beret, Per Hansa's wife) to psychotic depression and others to suicide. How could the good God permit creatures made in His image to fall into such tribulations? Giants is a giant of a novel, the fullest, finest, and most powerful written about pioneer life in America. It is a moving narrative painted with alternating beauty and grimness. But always with hope, the hope of a better future. And so, in the end, when the boys find Per Hansa dead and propped up against that mouldering hay in the middle of the warm month of May with his skis along side him, it is only fitting and proper that his eyes were set toward the west."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I am not a Norwegian American but I grew up in Wisconsin which is heavily populated by them. I actually studied Norwegian for 2 years at the Scandinavian Studies Department at the University of Wisconsin. I had a lot of interaction with Norwegian Americans as well as with Norwegian immigration to WI while I was studying this language (really 2 languages-Bokmal (the formal Norwegian which was Danish imposed and did not follow actual Norwegian day to day speech) and Nynorsk (actual spoken Norwegian)). Rolvaag wrote in Nynorsk with lots of regional variants included, which made translation of his book into English very difficult. The book was first published in Norwegian and was not enthusiastically received by Norwegian Americans. It was only translated into English in 1927. The English translation was much better received. I do not think that Rolvaag ever really got over the fact that his fellow Nordmen failed to accept his depiction of the settlement of ND.I think that the book is a fairly accurate depiction of the privations the settlers went through in sod busting in N Dakota. There is a book which is now out of print entitled \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\" which contains a lot of information about life in Wisconsin in the 1870's. It was brutal. I know that the climate in ND is even worse than WI, but I can testify that WI winters are really awful. I cannot conceive how these people managed to survive the winter in WI. The reason I mention this book is that there are many references in this book to people going crazy, committing suicide, etc. during the settlement of Wisconsin. (It doesn't have its gruesome title for nothing.)Rolvaag refers to similar mental health problems among Norwegian settlers in North Dakota in the book. A lot of people comment that there couldn't have been so many depressed people in the settlements, but the truth is that there were. The life of a settler's wife in a sod hut was pretty awful-the University of KS published a book of letters/diaries from women sod busters which bears this out.Giants in the Earth is a very \\"psychological\\" book. The mental struggles of Per Hansa and Beret, his wife, are the central focus of the book. I am not a psychiatrist but think that the internal ruminations of Beret, the wife, and her slow descent into madness are very well handled. Similarly, Per Hansa's denial of her problems rings true.The descriptions of the physical landscape, the weather, clouds, etc. are simply beautiful. Sheer poetry. The prairie is depicted as a living thing to be conquered. To Beret, the living thing represents sheer malevolence and evil, the opposite of civilization and goodness.The weakest part of the book, I thought, was the characterization of some of the ancillary characters. The real focus is on Per Hansa and Beret, his wife.There is a strong religious element in this book. The Norwegian settlers were of course Lutheran and had a fatalistic view of things-predestination. They saw the various plagues they endured as God's judgment-hard for us to understand today. Even the Lutheran minister who finally shows up has problems with his faith.I regret never having read this book before. If I were teaching American history, especially in the Midwest, I would definitely make this book required reading.To my ears it is beautifully written. Unlike some other \\"emigrant\\" book translations, this one is very accurate (according to Norwegian scholars [Einar Haugen]). Anyone interested in Rolvaag, St. Olaf's and the Norwegian American experience should go to the Norwegian-American Historical Society's website at St. Olaf's College ([...]), where they will find articles re Rolvaag and his literary output."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This classic, written by Norwegian immigrant and professor O.E. Rolvaag, concerns a group of Norwegians who decide to move west from Minnesota. The hardships which beset them are described in detail, from hunger, to grasshopper plagues, to, finally, madness. This book is well written, with language accessible to the modern reader, even though it was written in the 1920's. This is my second time reading it and, as with every great book, there is more to be uncovered with every reading."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This book provides a sturdy portrayal of Scandinavian immigrants living in the Dakota's in the late 1800's. Per Hansa and his wife Hans Ola are tough and determined, having left Norway to become homesteaders in the upper Midwest of the USA. Their existence on the plains includes remoteness, locusts, endless labor, sod homes, and harsh winters. They seem hopeful in America despite the hardships - although she didn't want to leave Norway. But for the many it was an improvement over what they'd left behind. This story is one of realism and determination rather than of joy.Author O.E. Rovlaag, himself a Scandinavian immigrant in Northfield, Minnesota, captures the experience of the many Scandinavians that settled in the upper Midwest. I read this book in high school class and found it a bit stiff, but with a memorable message of grit and determination. Readers might also enjoy the 1971 Swedish film on the Subject, THE IMMIGRANTS."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This is the first in a trilogy of books about the Norwegian settlement of the Dakota Territory. The second book is titled, \\"Peder Victorious\\", and the third and last book is titled, \\"Their Fathers' God.\\" The author, a Norwegian who emigrated to the United States in 1896 and eventually became a professor at St. Olaf's College, wrote it in Norwegian, but it is every bit as American as apple pie.This is a beautifully written, lyrical book about the experiences of the early Norwegians who settled in the vast prairie of the Dakota Territory during the latter half of the nineteenth century. It speaks of their isolation and desolation, as well as of the hardships inherent in pioneering so far West with so little resources at hand with which to do so. Dependent solely upon their inner resources, hard work, ingenuity, and whatever goods they had managed to haul with them, these peasant, would-be-farmers from Norway would be the stuff of which this country was made. Their resilience in the face of relentless hardship, adversity, and deprivation is stunning, as is their belief in a better life.The story focuses on a small group of Norwegians who traveled together from the same small fishing hamlet in Norway and formed a settlement. Pioneers, they paved the way for those who were yet to come. The author details their trials and tribulations, with the focal figure of this group being an individual by the name of Per Hansa, who arrived in the vast prairie of the Dakota territory with his wife, Beret, and their three children. Yet, despite these central characters, all that happens revolves around the land and the elements that sustain it and drain it from season to season.It is Per Hansa, however, who, perhaps, best epitomizes the enterprising spirit of the first settlers to the Dakota Territory, while his wife, Beret, represents those whose coping mechanisms were less able to make a smooth transition to their new environs. Per Hansa, bursting with energy and enthusiasm, is a man who thinks out of the box and refuses to let the elements get the best of him. He is a natural leader upon whom the others rely, a symbol of the pioneering spirit that revolutionized this country and made it great.Beret, on the other hand, symbolizes those who see a relentless uphill fight to try to make something out of seemingly nothing. She fails to see the beauty around her, seeing only the stillness, the isolation, and what she perceives as the interminable loneliness. Therein lies the heart of the dichotomy in their relationship, as Per Hansa sees his cup as half full, while Beret sees hers as half empty.Yet, despite Per Hansa's joy in the land, there is an underlying bittersweet moroseness that permeates the book that serves to underscore the great sacrifice that these early pioneers had to make in order for their settlement of the Great Plains of the Dakota Territory to work. It is grounded in an understanding by the author of the Norwegian immigrant culture and experience. It is a book that is brimming with feeling and written by an author who had the soul of a poet. Those who have read and enjoyed the quartet of books written by Swedish author, Vilhelm Moberg, about the early Swedish settlers of Minnesota, will likewise enjoy this book, as will all those who love lyrically written historical fiction. I very much look forward to reading the remaining two books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"\\"There were giants in the earth in those days....\\" Genesis 6:4O.E. Rolvaag took his title from the Bible, telling a story about the very early Norwegian pioneers to the Dakotas, who were indeed giants--not in size, but in courage, determination, and endurance through extremely adverse circumstances.Four family groups have already made the voyage from Norway to America, finally ending up in Minnesota, when they are stricken with the fever to \\"go west\\" where good land and opportunities beckon. The story focuses mainly on Per Hansa and his wife Beret, as they face unimaginable obstacles in making a home and surviving on the open, flat, treeless prairie. Indeed, the prairie, with its featureless landscape and extremes of weather, is one of the main characters; Rolvaag writes, \\"But more to be dreaded than this tribulation was the strange spell of sadness which the unbroken solitude cast upon the minds of some....It is hard for the eye to wander from sky line to sky line, year in and year out, without finding a resting place.\\"The settlers, living in sod houses, face savage summer storms, winters that last from October through April with 20-foot snow drifts, a pestilence of grasshoppers, a lack of medical help, toil from daybreak to dark, a lack of sufficient food and fuel--and still they survive. \\"They threw themselves blindly into the Impossible, and accomplished the Unbelievable.\\"This is a beautiful book. Originally written in Norwegian, it was translated by the author himself, with the help of some who were more proficient in English. Not restricting himself to plot and descriptions of the many challenges faced, he focuses on the psychological aspects of his characters and the human costs of building a new nation. If a better book about pioneering in America has been written, I have not read it."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I have read extensively about the Westward movement and the settling of the West. I found this book offered a different perspective than most. It concentrated on one ethnic group (the Norwegians) and one settlement in the Dakota territory. It provided an intimate picture of family life and social interactions in this settlement. It was realistic and alluded to having a drop now and again and other behavior not usually mentioned in writings about this era. Written from a male point of view it was interesting to see the male character's interpretation of the woman's thoughts and feelings. It would be an excellent read for people who are caught up in the greed and materialism of today's society. I take issue with the respondent who gave this book one star and revealed the ending in a callous manner. Perhaps when this individual is older and has experienced personal losses he/she will have more compassion."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"The three books in this series are a classic Midwestern epic. This is an telling saga for anyone with a desire for insight into how the Midwest was made. I feel like I understand many of the people in my family (with Midwestern roots) better after reading these books. Of course, it is not the final word on the begining of the Midwest, but is a significant part of the tale of the Midwest also told by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Booth Tarkington, Glenway Wescott, Sterling North, Willa Cather, etc.But even if you don't care how the Midwest came to be, the story of the dreams, struggles, hopes, confrontations of very real human beings will keep you engaged.I was very happy to found these and they delighted me thoroughly as I read them.Though \\"Giants in the Earth\\" stands perfectly on its own, I can hardly imagine stopping there. Read all three for some great entertainment and enlightenment."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Originally written in Norwegian, this novel is a self-proclaimed &quot;saga of the prairie&quot; that traces the Norwegian settlement of southeastern South Dakota in the latter part of the nineteenth century. What is unique about this novel is that it adheres to Norse literary traditions as it tells an inherently American story; and although the results are not always completely satisfactory, the novel offers an interesting reading experience.This combination of Norwegian-American influences makes for some interesting literary devices. Often nature is personified (the sun lives in a house), many of the male characters become combinations of John Wayne and Thor, and the women stereotypically dutiful, loyal, and good-hearted pioneers. One character breaks away from the stereotype. Beret, the wife of Pier Hansa (the consummate pioneer) does not fit the immigrant profile at all. She is constantly homesick, melancholy and afraid. Her first ipression of the prairie is that &quot;there is no place to hide.&quot; During the time she spends in the sod house on their Dakota farm, her melancholy becomes chronic and she begins to withdraw from her family, has visions of her dead mother, and contemplates the sacrifice of her youngest child. Although she has a religious rebirth and regains her sanity in part, religion becomes an obsession with her and ultimately leads to the tragic conclusion of the novel.Rolvaag is interested in the psychology of the immigrant pioneer, and as long as his attention is centered on this aspect of his characters, the author is successful. However, when he becomes concerned with simply moving the narrative along, he is less successful and the novel becomes trite, almost comical in its hyberbolic story telling."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"A saga-like tale of Norwegian immigrants to America, specifically to Dakota territory, travelling in covered wagons, living in sod huts dug into the ground, isolation, blizzards, planting & plagues of locusts, this book will make you feel you were there.This story is also about the marriage between Per & Beret Hansa, a difficult relationship: He wanted to emigrate and she did not but went along with him, unfortunately it is all too much for her and she loses her mind. I think this book presents a very realistic picture of marital relations of that time.The ending was somewhat bizarre and made me laugh out loud though I'm not sure it was supposed to be funny. I intend to read the sequel and will probably reread this one again one day, it's a great immigrant/pioneer classic."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"hi i am 13 years old and i live in california and just finished reading this wonderful and suspensful book. i love the dog and there is a man that seems suspisous when he is trying to take a cat into the car. at the beginning though the girl really wants a dog when she finds one and tries to explain and prove that she is capable of taking care of the dog. if you are a dog lover you're sure to love this book and even if you're not like me you'll sure to become one. the girl is a great independent person who saves a dog and seeks a suspicous man of what he is doing with animals i wont tell you the best part because i want you to read it too and enjoy it as much as i did!"},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"O.E.

Yes, the class had to pick it apart it over a school quarter. I have been over it and over it and read it forward and backwards, and I really don't see the appeal. (I grew up on the prairie, so don't go there.) All I can see is a nagging, terrified and unintelligent (to put it kindly) wife driving her husband to the grave. If that is what passes for good literature, it is lost on me. I'll go back to reading Dickens and Hemingway. Sorry, but I have read better books everywhere I have gone. This is a deeply depressing and dreary story. That's about all I can say. I just can't like it, no matter how hard I try. Maybe it is for Steinbeck fans? If you like \\"Of mice and Men\\" and \\"The grapes of Wrath\\" this might just be for you..."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I grew up around Norwegians and felt I never really knew them. They seemed to be a dour, austere, pensive people. Rolvaag wrote this book in Norwegian for Norwegians, capturing the nature of that character. Per Hansa and Beret can't communicate what they really feel. Tonseten comes off as the stereotypical pompous know-it-all that non-Norwegians find hard to take. I can easily understand why some readers find the book boring. I first heard of the book many years ago growing up around Norwegians. If not for that I never would have read it."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"My 10th grade classmates and I were tortured with having to study this book in high school. Yes it's memorable, as the most boring and painfully slow read ever. Even war and peace was a joy compared to this \\"epic bore\\". I grew up in North Dakota so i know what living in the prairie is like. I know the hard winters and the need to be thrifty. The book was made into a movie which is equally painful. Let's cut to the end where the relief comes with the main character dying of hypothermia by a haystack, frozen to death. Ahhh blessed mercy of death from a painful existance. Sorry Mr. Upton (my English teacher back then) your literary taste is lost on me."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"It's true that I've never read this book and almost certainly never will, but it's also true that this was my mother's favorite book when she was a girl and my mother has excellent taste in literature so, via her, I highly highly recommend Ole Edvart Rolvaag's immortal classic, &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;. Trust her, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"My father died recently, and in clearing out his things I found his copy of this book. As a child, I remembered him showing this book to me. It had been one of his favorites ever since he had read it in high school. I never got around to reading it until now.Giants In the Earth is the story of Norwegian immigrants trying to make their home in the great prairies of the new territories. They choose a spot marked by the huge sky, a duck swamp, a lonely Native grave, and nothing else. The immigrants face birth, insanity, religion, locusts and sickness-- all the time wondering if they did the right thing to have left their villages and boats.The book was enough to move me by itself. Rolvaag is a skilled writer, and Per Hansa is a charming character. Hansa is real and human, and Rolvaag accomplishes that in a seemingly effortless way. I liked him, and liked Beret and it was hard not to like the book-- as hard as was the world that it portrays.I have some quarrels with the translation. The punctuation and sentence structure felt off at times. It almost seemed as though in trying to capture the authenticity of the original language it sacrificed a little bit of the clarity. The notes are well done-- just enough, and with the right amount of information to explain background to the reader.The book should appeal to readers who like either the history or the literature of the early American experience. Even if you question the authenticity of the settler moments, it should provide a good look at the experience of the Norwegian immigration.I only wish that my father was still alive to discuss it with me."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This is a story of Norwegian immigrants to America and how they struggle against the harshness of nature to make new homes in a new land. This work was once required reading in schools in New York State and I remember as a schoolchild reading it with a certain degree of puzzlement and bewilderment. Now I understand to be a work through which many Norwegian Americans feel their own Americanization story is most accurately told. But the farming world of Per Hansa, the many complications of his family's and neighbors' life struck me as in some way alien. Yet the persistence, the courage of Per Hansa and the whole immigrant society did teach a lesson i.e. that the making of a new life in America would only be made through enduring and overcoming extraordinary hardships.The characters in this book are well- drawn, and there is a narrative that moves along if at times with difficulty.But to know a very special kind of American world and character this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This is the first in a trilogy of books about the Norwegian settlement of the Dakota Territory. The second book is titled, \\"Peder Victorious\\", and the third and last book is titled, \\"Their Fathers' God.\\" The author, a Norwegian who emigrated to the United States in 1896 and eventually became a professor at St. Olaf's College, wrote it in Norwegian, but it is every bit as American as apple pie.This is a beautifully written, lyrical book about the experiences of the early Norwegians who settled in the vast prairie of the Dakota Territory during the latter half of the nineteenth century. It speaks of their isolation and desolation, as well as of the hardships inherent in pioneering so far West with so little resources at hand with which to do so. Dependent solely upon their inner resources, hard work, ingenuity, and whatever goods they had managed to haul with them, these peasant, would-be-farmers from Norway would be the stuff of which this country was made. Their resilience in the face of relentless hardship, adversity, and deprivation is stunning, as is their belief in a better life.The story focuses on a small group of Norwegians who traveled together from the same small fishing hamlet in Norway and formed a settlement. Pioneers, they paved the way for those who were yet to come. The author details their trials and tribulations, with the focal figure of this group being an individual by the name of Per Hansa, who arrived in the vast prairie of the Dakota territory with his wife, Beret, and their three children. Yet, despite these central characters, all that happens revolves around the land and the elements that sustain it and drain it from season to season.It is Per Hansa, however, who, perhaps, best epitomizes the enterprising spirit of the first settlers to the Dakota Territory, while his wife, Beret, represents those whose coping mechanisms were less able to make a smooth transition to their new environs. Per Hansa, bursting with energy and enthusiasm, is a man who thinks out of the box and refuses to let the elements get the best of him. He is a natural leader upon whom the others rely, a symbol of the pioneering spirit that revolutionized this country and made it great.Beret, on the other hand, symbolizes those who see a relentless uphill fight to try to make something out of seemingly nothing. She fails to see the beauty around her, seeing only the stillness, the isolation, and what she perceives as the interminable loneliness. Therein lies the heart of the dichotomy in their relationship, as Per Hansa sees his cup as half full, while Beret sees hers as half empty.Yet, despite Per Hansa's joy in the land, there is an underlying bittersweet moroseness that permeates the book that serves to underscore the great sacrifice that these early pioneers had to make in order for their settlement of the Great Plains of the Dakota Territory to work. It is grounded in an understanding by the author of the Norwegian immigrant culture and experience. It is a book that is brimming with feeling and written by an author who had the soul of a poet. Those who have read and enjoyed the quartet of books written by Swedish author, Vilhelm Moberg, about the early Swedish settlers of Minnesota, will likewise enjoy this book, as will all those who love lyrically written historical fiction. I very much look forward to reading the remaining two books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"It's was an amazing start to one of the best journey's I've ever read. I feel honored to have been given it as a gift, an orignial copy, from my mother. I felt more honored to give her the other two books in the series as a gift, she had never known about. It's a series you curl up with on a winter's day that calls for a warm blanket and a serious lack of anything to do but travel back in time."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I read this book in high school and hadn't a clue as to its intent. I found a copy in a used book store recently and read it with much older eyes. It's beautifully written; even tho translated, you can see its beauty. And it addresses such contemporaneous themes--one can easily see Per Hansa and Beret today struggling thru some of the same issues of marriage and family and life.Read the other reviews if you want to get an overview of plot. But, really, go ahead and read the book. I guarantee you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I was completely drawn into this novel and the characters. Rolvaag is able to share a deep understanding of the psychology of the Hansa family as well as the intimate details of their difficult daily lives as they toil to establish their new homestead. The characters have stayed within my heart for many years. I also highly recommend Peder Victorious, the sequel."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Even though there are not enough hours in a day to read all the classics of literature, I am generally aware of what novels are considered classics. About a month ago, however, I came across, by chance, an article written in the 1940s on American agrarian fiction. The article was basically a lament about the sad state of such fiction, dismissing pretty much everything that had been written, including Steinbeck and Cather. It did, however, give _Giants in the Earth_ considerable praise. My main reaction was \\"Giants in the what?\\" and checked it out.Apparently, this novel is still read by those interested in the Dakotas and those interested in the Norwegian immigrant experience but has otherwise been relegated to the status of \`local fiction'. This is a pity because if the insane number of ellipses and exclamation points doesn't make you queasy, then you'll likely appreciate why those that do read consider it a contender for \`the Great American novel'.So what makes this novel so great? The attention to detail and the psychology of the characters are so pitch perfect that it feels like it couldn't have been made up, that what you're reading is pure autobiography. But then you realize that so many different characters and situations are described so well that it's impossible for it to just be autobiography.One detail summarized the extent to which this novel got it right: when my wife was pregnant, I read umpteen books and articles on pregnancy and childcare. I was very surprised when our kid was born to discover how noisily he ate. His swallowing sounded like a little slow motion air compressor. Nothing warned me of this. Everything presented eating as this quiet romantic \`Madonna and child' moment. There's a paragraph in this novel that describes breastfeeding. In a euphemistic way, it describes it perfectly, ending with talking about the newborn grunting.The center of the novel is an odd couple of immigrants, the anxious Beret and her manically optimistic husband Per. Per comes across as the thinner character at first because he is so excited about the prospect of owning his own land that he is initially oblivious to what a dangerous, if not reckless, adventure it is to be a pioneer and to the price to be paid, both physically and mentally. His emotions do not vary much depending on the situation and he comes across as cardboard. But he does evolve and come to a state of painful self-awareness.The character of Beret has changed my view of American history. The conquest of the continent is typically portrayed as inevitable and thus in a sense safe and domesticated. Beret, however, finds the pioneer experience a complete nightmare and from her point of view, Giants in the Earth is a horror novel. To throw aside everything -- one's country, one's friends and family, every comfort and convenience -- to live in a dirt house in an endless sea of nothingness in a place where you can't even speak the same language as most people and where the nearest doctor is hundreds of miles away... it's madness. She feels her life has been thrown away, and she can't seem to get her husband to understand this.The critical response to the novel often talks about the underpinnings of Norse mythology. Honestly, I didn't notice and couldn't care less. What's striking is the near perfectionism of its realism. The opening chapter is this lovely description of a family on a wagon moving through the sea of prairie: an insignificant dot swallowed up by the swooshing grass. Then the second chapter introduces a nagging anxiety: the family, far beyond the bounds of civilization, is lost. No one wants to say anything, but they know they're lost and things could get desperate very soon. This is all so modest and yet so suspenseful and engaging. (I can't help but think in contrast of the millions of dollars that is poured into the opening sequence of every James Bond movie.)There are, however, three flaws in the book. First, the names make it tough to keep the male characters straight. There is: Per Hansa, Ole Hansa, Store-Hans Hansa and Hans Olsa. Surely there are people from Norway who don't have \`Hans' in their name. Second, there's this bizarre episode in which the Per Hans saves the life of an Indian by taking care of an infected wound. This seems unrealistic and feels like a fantasy of whites helping the colonized peoples. Third, the exclamation points and ellipses are intense. I'm sure more than one reader has put it down as a result. In the introduction, the author expresses frustration that so much of the nuance of the book is lost in English. Given how subtle this book is and how lively the English text is, it's hard to imagine that anything could possibly be missing. That said, if there was a new translation, or perhaps a tweaking of the original, that cut back a little on the exclamation points, I think it would allow more people to appreciate why this deserves to be on any list of great American novels. (Hmm... I would have never guessed that I would some day write a sentence talking about translating into English one of the greatest American novels, but, as John Steinbeck would say, there it is.)One final point of curiosity: the events of this novel take place at the same time as and are several hundred miles away from HBO's phenomenal _Deadwood_. It's amazing how unlike they are. They both display rare genius in their depiction of the same milieu but they have nothing in common other than a few references to Yankton and a murdered Scandinavian family in Deadwood. I mean, _Giants in the Earth_ doesn't have a single swear word."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"I found this book quite by accident, looking for information about Norway. My great-grandparents immigrated to eastern South Dakota from Norway in 1870. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided I couldn't wait for it to be shipped and found it in a local bookstore.Wow. What a range of emotions to be felt during the reading of this book. At times, I put it down for days, thinking Per Hansa was a fool and wasn't going to get out of a situation alive. I was surprised at the lack of serious consequesnces for making foolish decisions, such as removing the landmarks of other men's land claims. I wasn't there 100 years ago, but a land dispute should have been taken up in court, not in hand-to-hand combat. (Although it's true that I felt sick about the possibility of all the work of building a home and breaking ground going to waste.) I just cannot imagine that the resolution would have really happened that way (trying to avoid a spoiler!)At other times, I laughed out loud at Per Hansa's response to a situation... \\"the first furrow was crooked as a snake...\\" I can just feel the man thinking that thought.I guess my one main complaint about the book is all the time spent building up to these cataclysmic events (Irish settlers, Indian visitors, ailing Hans Olsa, etc.) and then to resolve the issue with a half page ending. Someone else wrote about laughing at the very end; I cried bitterly. I was not expecting the book to end the way it did.That said, this is an amazing look into the lives of my ancestors. I will be rereading this book and am eagerly awaiting Peder Victorius."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Giants in the Earth is a beautiful tapestry of language and feeling.

So I thought, \\"Even though this is a novel, perhaps it would be a good read.\\".Well, I was spellbound. Finished the book in a few days - just couldn't put it down. It really struck me that even though it is a work of fiction, the events and struggles documented here are very likely close to what the early prairie settlers experienced. I was also reminded of how recently these hearty people took to the barren prairie and made do with so little, facing such difficult and dangerous obsticles. We take these sacrifices for granted now that this hard work has already been done. We forget that our comfortable lives would not be possible were it not for the risks these people bore to turn the prairie into an agricultural gold mine that literally feeds not only our own nation, but many others through exports.Yeah, it is trite at times - and perhaps a little sappy...but I personally gained several new insights into my families' heritage.

It gives some of the history of our nation's western movement and the reader gets an inside look at the hardship some of those Western pioneers went through.The long lonely trek across a seemingly endless prairie, the desperate loneliness of a solitary sod house on the plains, the terror of one devastating event after another; storms, and hail, and locust, and snow and again, the endlessness of the horizon.The book was written by someone who had experienced it all, out there on the plains.It provides a lot of insight into those times and I found it all fascinating."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Study of Norwegian immigrants settling in Iowa - well written and authorative.

The emigrants in _Giants In The Earth_ are seafaring people from Norway who knew each other in the old country. The lead character, Per Hansa, is what many people would call \\"a man's man.\\" He is strong, brave, and full of optimism. Per Hansa has brought along his wife, Beret, who is filled with love for her husband and their children. While on their journey to the Dakota territory in the latter part of the 19th century, Per Hansa and his family, and some of their neighbors travelling with them, experience many hardships. Beret's mother did almost everything in her power to talk her daughter out of marrying Per Hansa and emigrating to America.What gives this novel much of its personal feel is Rolvaag's expert development of his characters. The author has an excellent understanding of human psychology. Beret is wracked with guilt over leaving her mother. Beret believes that she is being punished for this unforgiveable sin. The result is that Beret and the other families must suffer through horribly cold and snow-filled weather, a dearth of food and warm clothing, and unbearable loneliness and solitude during the long, dark winter nights. Just when things start to go well for the families, one of the \\"deadly plagues\\" of ancient times tenaciously strikes without warning. Rolvaag is very creative in discovering the language to speak about these dreaded conditions.In addition, Beret becomes severely mentally ill, which puts a terrible strain on Per Hansa. What is he to do? Their friends, especially the wives of the other families, become very solicitous of Beret. She eventually seeks solace in prayer and religion. Beret, of course, takes this to an extreme, but later unselfishly suggests it as a comfort when one of their numbers becomes seriously ill._Giants In The Earth_ was required reading in one of my high school classes. I am so glad that I have, many years later, overcome my \\"hatred\\" of this book and finally realize what a wonderful work it is."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This is a quality renditon of the struggles of pioneer life.

Excited to keep reading! I also thought it came very quickly (sooner than expected)."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Rolvaag's classic is a treasure. I feel cheated that I didn't discover until I was 48 years old. On the other hand, a half a century of life's experience only enhances one's enjoyment of the book. Rolvaag's characters are unbelievably rich and psychologically deep: Beret, the troubled homesteader's wife, Pers Hansa, her resourceful and cunning husband, their solid neighbor Han Olsa and his able and gentle wife Sorrine, the ebullient and politically crafty Syvert, and his wife Kjersti, who longs for a child she will never have but adopts her little community instead. These core characters and many others give lessons in the mysteries of the Universe, not the least of which are the fine line between piety and insanity, the contradictory emotions that form the bond between a mother and child, and man's lust for a place of his own. Ole Rolvaag was quiet professor at St. Olaf's college with a typical emigrant's bio, but in that mind of his, wonderful and horrible tales raged that invested the flat prairies of the Dakota Territory with fearful storms, mischievous trolls, plagues of Biblical proportion and daily struggles of a man and a woman in conflict in a land that shows no mercy. I understand that this book is sometimes assigned as mandatory reading for high schoolers. In a way that's a shame; this is a book for grownups who know where the characters have been and are going."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"O.E. Rolvaag's epic GIANTS IN THE EARTH is truly an American classic, especially for those of Norwegian or Scandinavian descent or those who've lived in the Great Plains. It seems to be a true description of the life the early settlers lived, the desperation of opressive freedom, and the claustrophobic effect of too much open space.Per Hansa, the protagonist of our story, moves his family from a fishing village in Norway to the plains of the Dakota Territory in the last part of the 19th century. They are homesteaders, the people who settled the untamed prairie and bound themselves to it, sometimes at great personal cost.Rolvaag brilliantly describes both the psychological effect of early prairie life and the Norwegian immigrant culture of the time. Being a new land, there were new challenges, new ideas, and new opportunities. In Per Hansa, Rolvaag invents a character that displays the passion and drive of the early settlers. His wife, Beret, like so many wives of the time, follows him with little idea of the hardships and, unfortunately, none of the psychological tools to deal with them. Their neighbors are wonderfully crafted: Tonesten, the whiner; Kjersti, his strong, capable, disrespectful wife; Hans Ola, the solid, dependable Scandinavian whose success is not so much from following his dreams as it is making no mistakes.One comes to love the settlers even as they deal with squatters, locusts, sod houses, and the endless winter of the northern Plains. Midwestern Americans of Scandinavian descent will know that this is our story - our great-grandparents and great-great grandparents were contemporaries of Per Hansa and Beret.Rolvaag should know this story - he himself was an immigrant and lived in Northfield, Minnesota for many years. The book was originally written in Norwegian and published in Norway, so in translation some idioms and cultural forms are hard to understand, but the translators and editors of the current text do a fine job with footnotes and introductory material."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Rolvaag's Giants in the Earth will forever remain as of the truly epic works of American literature. A descendant of the Trottlander tribe of southern Norway myself, I grew up on a farm in midwest Minnesota and experienced the identical landscapes so vividly described in Rolvaag's masterpiece. Needless to say, I have always felt a profound connection to this work through how its rich pathetic fallacy largely mirrored my childhood fantasies and dreams.Giants in the Earth is a novel about dichotomous relationships. And in a novel that depicts how relationships ultimately define their participants, the central figure in this important work is the land itself. It is interesting to note the order of effects the pastoral loneliness produces in its inhabitants. Beret, like many other non-natives living on the Great Plains, views the land as a lethal threat too pervasively gargantuan to overcome. Per on the other hand, views the land like so many of my father's generation: a fertile blessing that contains some of the most arable land on the entire planet. The attitudes of the novel's central characters towards their situation comes to reveal their strengths and weaknesses in a poignant, bittersweet saga as morose and sublime as the land itself. Compelling, tragic, humorous and underspoken, Rolvaag's Giants in the Earth reflects the feelings and goals of an entire generation of immigrants striven to succeed at all costs. Thankfully for us all, they did."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Kirk F. Sniff said \\"I understand that this book is sometimes assigned as mandatory reading for high schoolers. In a way that's a shame; this is a book for grownups who know where the characters have been and are going.\\" I would have to disagree. I am a 16-year-old girl who has just finished her junior year. I read this book because I saw it on a list of recommended high school reading. And I absolutely loved it. Even I can appreciate the depth, the strength, and the life of the characters. O. E. Rolvaag gives a stirring account of the Norwegian midwest, but he also gives an in-depth perusal into the minds and hearts of the people who settled it. If anyone can enjoy this book, it's us high schoolers who read so many of the other classics that pale in comparison to this story. In summary, I loved this book and I recommend it to everyone, not just adults!"},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"There are better-known stories of the homesteading experience, such as Willa Cather's \\"My Antonia\\" and Laura Ingalls Wilder's \\"Little House\\" series, but none of them hit as close to the truth as did O.E. Rolvaag in \\"Giants in the Earth.\\"It is translated into something of an epic style, somewhat like James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking series, but its subject matter almost demands such a style. Because it tells an epic story, of Per's struggles against the prairie, the harsh weather, and against the burden of his well-meaning wife, who lacks Per's inner resources to thrive, despite the forbidding conditions.But of all the homesteading fiction, \\"Giants in the Earth\\" is the closest to the truth of any I have read, in capturing the beauty and violence of the prairie, and the sincere, honest, hard-working beauty of the pioneers who tamed it. Because the truth isn't the pretty pastels of the Little House books. The prairie homesteader had a bleak, harsh, spartan existence, especially before the sod was broken and the trees were planted. There are substantiated accounts of homesteaders and their young families dying out here--starving in the winters if the food carried over from the fall ran out, or freezing to death in blizzards when the snow covered the sodhouses and the fuel was used up. Waves of diphtheria, tuberculosis and influenza killed still more, sending the remnants of the broken families back East. (But when the truth isn't pretty, it is usually covered up.)So in my opinion, this is a story about greatness, and how even the most apparently humble men can become truly great--daring and achieving things that should be impossible. And as in Per's story, the reward doesn't always recompense the labor when one attempts to wrest a living from the prairie; even 140 years later, many prairie towns still teeter on the brink of existence. It's a struggle that continues today, and there are still men like Per out here, who won't give in, no matter what is thrown at them. Rolvaag had it right; they are giants.As for me, I'm a Johnny-come-lately, only a South Dakotan for 27 years. But I would not want to live anywhere else."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"This is the first in a trilogy of books about the Norwegian settlement of the Dakota Territory. The second book is titled, \\" Peder Victorious\\", and the third and last book is titled, \\"Their Fathers' God.\\" The author, a Norwegian who emigrated to the United States in 1896 and eventually became a professor at St. Olaf's College, wrote it in Norwegian, but it is every bit as American as apple pie.This is a beautifully written, lyrical book about the experiences of the early Norwegians who settled in the vast prairie of the Dakota Territory during the latter half of the nineteenth century. It speaks of their isolation and desolation, as well as of the hardships inherent in pioneering so far West with so little resources at hand with which to do so. Dependent solely upon their inner resources, hard work, ingenuity, and whatever goods they had managed to haul with them, these peasant, would-be-farmers from Norway would be the stuff of which this country was made. Their resilience in the face of relentless hardship, adversity, and deprivation is stunning, as is their belief in a better life.The story focuses on a small group of Norwegians who traveled together from the same small fishing hamlet in Norway and formed a settlement. Pioneers, they paved the way for those who were yet to come. The author details their trials and tribulations, with the focal figure of this group being an individual by the name of Per Hansa, who arrived in the vast prairie of the Dakota territory with his wife, Beret, and their three children. Yet, despite these central characters, all that happens revolves around the land and the elements that sustain it and drain it from season to season.It is Per Hansa, however, who, perhaps, best epitomizes the enterprising spirit of the first settlers to the Dakota Territory, while his wife, Beret, represents those whose coping mechanisms were less able to make a smooth transition to their new environs. Per Hansa, bursting with energy and enthusiasm, is a man who thinks out of the box and refuses to let the elements get the best of him. He is a natural leader upon whom the others rely, a symbol of the pioneering spirit that revolutionized this country and made it great.Beret, on the other hand, symbolizes those who see a relentless uphill fight to try to make something out of seemingly nothing. She fails to see the beauty around her, seeing only the stillness, the isolation, and what she perceives as the interminable loneliness. Therein lies the heart of the dichotomy in their relationship, as Per Hansa sees his cup as half full, while Beret sees hers as half empty.Yet, despite Per Hansa's joy in the land, there is an underlying bittersweet moroseness that permeates the book that serves to underscore the great sacrifice that these early pioneers had to make in order for their settlement of the Great Plains of the Dakota Territory to work. It is grounded in an understanding by the author of the Norwegian immigrant culture and experience. It is a book that is brimming with feeling and written by an author who had the soul of a poet. Those who have read and enjoyed the quartet of books written by Swedish author, Vilhelm Moberg, about the early Swedish settlers of Minnesota, will likewise enjoy this book, as will all those who love lyrically written historical fiction. I very much look forward to reading the remaining two books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"For years, my father repeatedly urged me to read this book about the pioneer life of Norwegian immigrants. Although my father is from Texas and has no Norwegian roots, he read this book in high school and it apparently made quite an impact upon him. Moreover, my great-grandmother on my mother's side immigrated from Norway around 1900 and this gives me some insight into her experience. The author does an outstanding job of conveying the mental as well as the physical struggles that pioneer families faced in the 1870's. I never contemplated that the isolation of pioneer life could be so difficult. The book was a quick read after the first 50 or so pages, and I am now moving on to Peder Victorious. I am glad I finally followed my father's advice."},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"Having grown up on the prairie, I have always found the tales of pioneer life absolutely intriguing. Both sides of my family come from pioneer roots and stories such as &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; never fail to move me.This novel was particularly wonderful. I wasn't sure what to expect when I began to read &quot;Giants in the Earth.&quot; Having never read Rolvaag I was a little nervous, but it has turned out to be an experience that has helped to guide my course of studies over the past year.The character development is extraordinary. One can't help but feel an intimate attraction to the characters and Rolvaag's dramatic portrayal of their lifestyle can't help but inspire empathy in readers.The characters each inspire different emotions - Per Hansa: Pride; Beret - Frustration!I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for an absolutely unbiased portrayal of pioneer life.

It reminded me of just how much we take for granted today. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Giants in the earth: A saga of the prairie","review":"A refreshingly stark view of pioneer life -- the hardships, fear and depression that one women experiences when her husband takes her from her Norwegian homeland and moves her steadily westward across the northern plains. This novel is gothic in dimensions -- the physical landscape becomes the characters' mental landscape -- the vast expanse of snow in winter and grass in summer become a metaphor for boredom and isolation. And yet, Rolvaag's work does not devolve into a catalogue of mental horrors, even while we watch the protagonists slowly fall apart. His book is fascinating and enthralling from start to finish. He writes of a lifestyle and of motivations unimaginable to the modern American, and yet, he writes of a time that was shockingly recent in the history of the Midwest"},{"Title":"Palaces and Gardens of Persia","review":"When I bought this book I expected only to see a book with nice pictures of Persian palaces and gardens.

I loved this book because it explains virtually every aspect of Paganism. The explanations and descriptions of various Pagan practices, ideals, Sabbats, rituals are kept brief as befits an introductory book. And yet, even after having a handful of other intoductory Pagan books, I found myself learning facts here that I hadn't known about before. The author sticks to the \\"Pagan philosophy\\" of \\"Harm no one\\" in describing Paganism.Among topics discussed? Besides the various Pagan Sabbats and pagan ideals, there are chapters devoted to Shamans, Druids, Wicca, the \\"Spirit World\\" and the Pagan elements of fire, air, water, and earth. There are four chapters that discuss Pagan rituals and I found the author's claim that we already do rituals in our lives (high school and college graduation, marriage and funerals, for example) very true. I never would have thought about that. There's also several chapters devoted to \\"Pagan magic,\\" which help to demystify it. The book's last few chapters offer advice on \\"living the Pagan lifestyle,\\" and there's an extensive list of recommended reading at the book's end. One could spend months reading through the list of books alone if one wanted to.The more I read about Paganism, the more I realize other religions over the centuries have liberally borrowed its customs and holidays. For anyone wishing to join this path or those already on it seeking to learn more, this book is a wonderful introduction."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"If you think you may be a pagan at heart, and want to find out how you can decide for sure, seek no further: this book will provide you with a sound, comprehensive, yet undemanding introduction to the entire concept. McColman, a long-time practising pagan, clearly explains what pagans believe and why, how their beliefs carry over into their everyday lives, what kinds of rituals are typical of them, how to deal with the non-pagans in your life, and where you can find out more. Again and again he reiterates the basic tenet that paganism has no single dogma: you're free to practise it in whatever way feels right for you. Among the most useful of his recommendations: follow the tradition to which you feel most closely drawn. (In my case, probably Native American.) After reading this book, I feel more convinced than ever of my basic pagan-ness, and begin to have some idea of how to get my feet more solidly planted on pagan ground. It's true that McColman seems to concentrate most heavily on the Wiccan and Celtic traditions, but since they're apparently the most popular and visible segments of the pagan community, that's probably inevitable. Once again, it's important to remember that you don't have to join them, or any group at all. Paganism, McColman tells us, is for folks who like to think for themselves rather than blindly accepting what the established religions have to say. If you think of yourself in those terms, it's worth your time to look through this book; you may recognize yourself."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"I wish I knew of this book sooner.

I would highly suggest that anyone remotely interested in any earth based religion/group [i.e. wicca, shamanism, druids, etc.] should COMPELETLY read this book straight through without skipping anything as I did. This should really be a mandatory reading for anyone who is new to the occult sciences and paganism thinks about embarking on this wonderful path. Don't let the title [Complete Idiots Guide] get you down. From my perspective, 'most' of the idiots guides I've bought and have looked at, cover more than just your average book on a single subject. Just look at the table of contents, the short version and the long version that lasts for a number of pages. This book not only goes over what the author feels are the 3 main types of paganism , wicca, druidism, and shamanism, it also goes over the god and goddess, the other worlds, elemental spirits, and divination.

I mean really, a chapter on \\"Please Don't Squeeze the Shaman\\"? Are you kidding? I do think the author is trying to be fun and playful, but it does not match the subject. Second, it is obviously Paganism through the lens of Wicca. I still struggle to find general books on Paganism that do not talk about the 4 elements, the three aspects of the Goddess, 8 sabbats, and other \\"facts about Paganism\\" that are obviously Wiccan. These are not accurate for those following the Norse or Celtic paths, and presenting it as \\"Pagans do this or that\\" is misleading."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"I'm not sure if the problem is the title of the book itself or the author's inability (IMHO) to fulfill the giant shoes of answering the question: What is Paganism? A joke in some circles is to ask five people to define \\"Pagan\\" and you'll get 10 answers. Paganism is hard to pin down and clearly define. Overall this is a decent read and if you know nothing about Pagans this is as good a place as any to start. I'm fairly familiar with Paganism and was hoping to get to a deeper understanding of the concept, and unfortunately that did not happen. I was expecting a little more in-depth exploration of Paganism (despite this being a Complete Idiot's book, as some are quite detailed) but this turns out to be only surface deep. It is an attempt, at the most basic level, to define aspects of Paganism through the lens of several religious practices (such as Wicca). Overall the book is well written and easy to read, and is chocked full of good information.While it has some great qualities in terms of providing a good overview of Wicca as well as a nice introduction to Shamanism and Druids, it fails to address the underlying core of Paganism on a few key points. First, Paganism in and of itself is not considered by most to be a religion (a spiritual path, perhaps), but one would not clearly get that from this book. Paganism contains no dogma to which all Pagans as a group subscribe and beliefs vary dramatically; not all believe in Wicca, Shamanism or Druids.My biggest problem with this book is that a novice to Pagan and Wiccan beliefs would walk away after reading this book with the idea that Pagans are Wiccan (or at least Pagans worship a Goddess). Again, that is not true. On page 77, for example, McColman says: \\"Pagans see things differently. Remember that, to pagans, the world isn't bad but is the physical manifestation of the Goddess.\\" That's only true if you believe in a Goddess. Many Pagans are actually atheist or agnostic in their beliefs about deity, or do not recognize a Goddess but only honor a God instead of a Goddess, so to say that Pagans see the world as a manifestation of the Goddess is false and misleading to a reader not familiar with Pagan and Wiccan beliefs.I would only recommend this book to the novice as long as that novice reads with the understanding that the link McColman makes between Paganism and Goddess worship is his own beliefs and is not the reality of Paganism as a whole. If you already have a good grasp of the general nature of Paganism, and how Wicca, Shamanism and Druids fit into that umbrella, you'll likely be bored with this book.If this book title had been \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism as Understood by Wiccans, Shamans and Druids\\" it would have been a more honest title.I gave it 3 stars because it is well written and generally informative, but withheld 2 stars because of his erroneously (and excessively) connecting the Goddess to Paganism (including having a full chapter on Goddess worship) when many Pagans do not believe in any deity, let alone a Goddess, as well as for this work being too influenced by Wicca with the Rede, a God being a Goddess consort even outside the context of Wicca, and for leaving the reader with the impression that Paganism in and of itself is a religion. Paganism is so much more than Wicca (not that there is anything wrong with Wicca, I hold many of those beliefs myself, including the recognition of feminine deity, but that's not the totality of Paganism)."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"If you're looking for just a book that will give information on paganism with little personal connections, this book is for you.If you're looking to paganism for a personal spiritual journey, this book is definitely NOT for you.I picked up this book at the library and couldn't get very far.It definitely wasn't the information that caused me to put it down, as that seemed very accurate and helpful, it was the tone.

From my little bit of research on the internet, I already knew that much or more about the different paths that the author mentioned."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"I bought this book knowing very little of Paganism. McColman did not give me a wonderful first impression of the religion. His book is comprised of what many Pagans would call &quot;fluffy bunny&quot; philosophy, as well as historical misinformation and the occasional bashing of monotheism as a way of making his own path look good. To anyone looking at this book to learn about the Pagan's spiritual path: avoid this one. It's oversimplified and has opinions and speculations presented as fact."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"This is a good book. However, there are better books available. If you are a beginner or inquirer, this is a good book to start with."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Paganism","review":"I've read a lot about religion and find it one of the most fascinating subjects in the world. The pagan path is an honorable undertaking, just as all faiths are. I am no pagan, but I bought the book because it seemed like a good idea. This book contains nothing more than what you could find on a web site. It was, in truth, a waste of money. The book was fascinating, however. This book assumes that you would go into it with an open mind, but to a narrow-minded person the ideas in it may seem absurd. It didn't introduce the material in a believable way; the book was more like reading a fairy-tale than a serious religious book. You have to have a REALLY open mind to read it. If it was written better I'd give it a two stars more, but the author provided no background for why a modern person would practice paganism other than it seemed like a good idea (like buying this book in the first place) and that one would just follow this to attract attention to themselves. This book would get 5 stars with better writing, and better reasons for practice. The ideas in this book also seem absurd to a monotheistic person such as myself. If you don't find this review helpful,you are obviously of low intelligence. After reading that statement, you may want to say it was helpful to appear smarter than your peers."},{"Title":"The Queen","review":"If you are looking for a biography of Queen Elizabeth II, don't bother with this book which is little more than rambling reminiscences of some of the Queen's experiences. Poorly written - one jumps from one topic to another without any sense of continuity, and there are annoying grammatical flaws - the book focuses rather narrowly on the author's experiences as a journalist covering certain royal tours. Rather shockingly, she also uses unwarranted and inappropriately derogatory adjectives to describe certain people. Anecdotes are fun, the photos are nice, but this book could have been much better. Review is based on the hardback edition."},{"Title":"The Trenchcoat brigade (Vertigo)","review":"This is the collected four issue mini-series telling the story of the combined efforts of the four trenchcoated \\"mystery men\\" of the Vertigo/DC Comics universe to save the world. The four are: the Phantom Stranger (first of magicians and messenger of Light), John Constantine (occult detective), Doctor Occult (formost expert on the supernatural), and Mr. E (the tortured blind crusader with the ability to travel through time.)The group is brought together by the Phantom Stranger in response to a string of serial killings. It soon turns out to be much, much more serious- for the very essense of Misery itself is loose upon the world- and it was one of John Constantine's disreputable ancestors who was responsible for unleashing it.Probably the best part of this tale is how the four are forced to live out each others darkest defining moment. By living out the crucial, pivotol moment in each other's lives that made them what they are, they are drawn together in mutual understanding. The ultimate loners are drawn together in the brotherhood of shared pain. In this way they unite to become more than a match for M'nagalah, the Bane of All Worlds."},{"Title":"Avant-Garde Page Design 1900-1950","review":"I was a little skeptical when I purchased it, partly because I was unfamiliar with the author, but also because the price was so cheap. Something good can't be this cheap! However, doubts and concerns were immediately dispelled when I received it. Written in English, French and German means it is quite a heavy book, not one you want to casually take into the office to read on lunch break. It is a nice overview and explains historical events within the context of design and its influences. Because it is an overview, nothing goes into too much detail and sometimes skims the surface. However, what it misses in written content it more than makes up in wonderful colour illustrations and examples. For those interested in Avant Garde graphic design and art generally, this is a very recommended book on the subject. It drops lots of names into the pages, giving their contributions to the particular movements - futurism, constructivism, dada, photomechanical and cinematic contributions, etc. and can act as a springboard for further discovery into the area. Several exciting artist's work were shown which I was unfamiliar with and it has caused me to want to do further research. I understand a paperback issue is waiting release, but for the price difference a hardback is definitely the way to go. If you get bored browsing the pages, you can always combine it with a workout. The book is heavy!"},{"Title":"The Complete Handbook of Garden Plants","review":"This book was a gift in 1986 and it is by far the most useful and used in my reference library. It is illustrated and covers a scope of plants rarely found in one volume. It includes trees, shrubs, perennials, bulbs, annuals, etc. If you can aquire a copy of it, you won't be sorry. It is also small and easy to carry to garden shops and as a field guide."},{"Title":"The Complete Handbook of Garden Plants","review":"This book is the most complete I have ever read. It is out of print and I keep it checked out from the library system. I wish I knew how to get this book re-printed. I know there would be an interest by many gardeners who would gladly purchase this. As another reviewer wrote, you can carry it with you. Every plant that I have read about, or saw at a garden center, I have picked up this book and read about it and enjoy the beautiful drawings linked with each description. I love all of my garden books, but this one I would grab in a mad rush if my house caught fire. It is that valuable to me."},{"Title":"The Complete Handbook of Garden Plants","review":"I have a large library of plant books. If I were forced to choose just one, this wold be it. He has done an amazing job of bringing together a huge amount of information into a very small space. The organization of the book makes great sense for a gardener, with plants grouped by use and then by scientific categories. He references varieties as well as gen/species, gives basic cultivation requirements. This is a classic that every serious gardener should have."},{"Title":"The Complete Handbook of Garden Plants","review":"There has really never been another garden book as compact and informative as Michael Wright's handbook. Whenever a 'new' plant hits the market, I look it up in the handbook, and although the book was originally published in the U.K. in 1984, more often than not I'll find the exact cultivar I'm looking for. The plant identification, cultivation, and descriptions are all right on the mark. Any time I can find a copy of this book, I buy it to give to my gardening friends, and every one of them thinks it's a treasure."},{"Title":"The Big Bark","review":"A surprising amount of information is crammed into this simple little book - seasons, months, prejudice and courage. Little Ann is terrorized for nearly an entire school year by what she assumes to be a great big dog. At least his bark is big. Our young daughter had a similar obsession with storms, and this book, much beloved from my childhood, provided a good platform for discussion about overcoming fears."},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"&quot;The King's General&quot; is a beautiful novel, lovingly written by an author who knows what she's presenting. Set in Cornwall (a trademark of the author), it encompasses the era of the English Civil War by telling the tale through the eyes of Honor Harris, one of fictions's most original heroines.This book was spring water after all of the low grade vintage purple prose I have read lately. Honor is neither beautiful nor rich, but she has strength, gentleness, practicality and wit, all of which serve her better than beauty or money ever could. Her lover, Sir Richard Grenville, is a handsome and proud man who relies on her love and loyalty to get him through the trying times he faces as the commander of Charles I's forces in the West, hence the title.What makes this story so juicy is its spareness. The prose is delicious in its lack of details, much the same as Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; or Jennifer Robeson's &quot;Lady of the Forest&quot; are written. Details are revealed through conversation which might normally be told through description if du Maurier were not so deft with her pen. There is mystery, romance, adventure and comedy within the covers, but it is relayed in such a way as to add to the main story, the sure mark of an author with taste and the ability to draw lifelike characters. And there are such characters to be had: Honor, who is strong and gentle at the same time; Richard, reckless and wild; Gartred, beautiful and calculating; Richard's son Dick, sickly and outcast; and the house of secrets called Menabilly, alone and desolate upon the moor.I came across this book wholly by chance. It is a 1948 paperback that is falling apart, the pages brittle and dog-eared. It is my sincere hope that I will be able to find the story again in a more durable format, but until such time I shall read this lovely novel until it is completely destroyed.I highly recommend &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; and &quot;Frenchman's Creek&quot; as companion novels to this one. Du Maurier's history-based novels have stood the test of time as classics and I am proud to give this one such a high rating."},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"This is a bittersweet love story set against the backdrop of the English civil war... I first read this about 20 years ago. Though I was frustrated with the lack of detail, I was so enthralled by the main characters. I ordered it used from Amazon and re-read it yesterday. I was still enthralled and did not want it to end. I re-read passages from it immediately after I finished!"},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"The King's General is a product of Daphne Du Maurier's love of her native Cornwall, English history, and her superior writing capabilities. She does an excellent job of capturing the feel of 17th century Cornwall in the midst of England's civil war. Even someone like myself with no interest in this particular subject matter found it all to be very readable.I suppose my only quibble with The King's General has to do with its too many melodramatic episodes. The main element of the story involves two Cornwall families with interwoven romances, feuds, and family traumas. While certainly some of the romantic scenes are, well, romantic. But just as often the scenes seem almost comically contrived. Lots of male and female egos going amuck. At times The King's General felt like a gothic romance novel, ... which probably isn't what the author intended.Bottom line: despite some over-the-top scenes The King's General is a very worthy read."},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"When I first read it, I knew it was not your average Barbie Doll Love Story. Why? Because Gartred, the amazing beauty, was far from beautiful on the inside. And the heroine, Honor, was crippled on her wedding day, just before getting married. She wasn't perfect either, but like she said, she got over her new body, it didn't happen over days, or months, but years. And during that time, the man she loved and was to wed, wed another, for money. She wasn't a saint, she felt jealous and happy that the marriage wasn't well. But it was so real and emotional, and the story was written in first-person giving honest and harsh emotions and understanding to why she loved such a despicable man as Richard Grenvile."},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"Passionate, proud, arrogant, selfish and cruel, Richard Greville, a brilliant soldier, is his own worst enemy. His story, narrated by his one-time fianc&eacute; Honor Harris - a spirited and intelligent woman who is crippled in a freak accident the day before their planned wedding, takes place during the time of the English Civil War (1642-1646). Honor remains devoted to Richard despite clearly seeing his many faults - but refuses to marry him, while Richard maintains his passion for her mind and body, brushing aside the reality of her damaged legs with all the brusqueness and self-absorption he demonstrates towards anything he doesn't see as relevent. Richard creates havoc with - but also pays a heavy price for - his arrogance and lack of empathy for others. The King's General is not just a a work of historical fiction but brutally and accurately portrays the heavy cost on individuals and families of a senseless war. It was inspired by the history of the house where Daphne du Maurier was living at the time of writing."},{"Title":"The King's general","review":"This is the third novel I've read written by Daphne du Maurier, she is an amazingly talented writer. I read a ridiculous number of books every year and only rarely do I find myself giving out five star reviews. I love historical fiction and I love Daphne Du Maurier's writing.The King's General is a complex and compelling story. Du Maurier weaves together a bitter-sweet love story and a tale of brutal civil war then adds a dash of suspense. The characters she creates are based on actual people and they are fully developed and realistic.As are her descriptions of war;'The aftermath of war was not a pleasant sight to the beholder. The country was laid waste, for one thing, and that the fault of the enemy. The corn ruined, the orchards devastated, the houses smoking. And in return for this the Cornish people had taken toll upon the rebel prisoners. There were many of them still lying in the ditches, with the dust and flies upon them.''I knew then as I peered forth from the curtains of my litter that war can make beasts of every one of us and that the men and women of my own breed could act even worse in warfare than the men and women of the Eastern counties. We had, each one of us, because of the civil war, streaked back two centuries in time and were become like those half savages of the fourteen hundreds who, during the War of the Roses, slit one another's throats without compunction.'By page forty you can tell this is a story to be savored and that you will be sorry when it is over. It's poignant, sweet, tender, romantic, suspenseful, horrifying and sad. I loved it and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other World","review":"I loved this book. Wynne has a cool, easy, intelligent, original style, unencumbered by the obvious ego that mucks up so many books. He loves his characters, doesn't sentimentalize or trivialize them, just lets us know what's going on in their heads without judgment, superimposed morality or high-flown drama -- these excellent stories show humanity in all its weirdness, beauty and multi-dimensionality. More, please."},{"Title":"The Other World","review":"A friend of mine purchased this book at a library for two dollars. Those two dollars are what we like to call \\"The best worst 2 dollars ever spent\\". This book is horrible. Horrible in writing, plot, and character development. The things that happen in this book are so overreacted, disgusting, and unnecessary that it deems this book unworthy to read, in fact \\"The Other World\\" should be cast into a deep pit. Even then the monsters down there would find it. On that note, it's also really funny in a disgusting, horrible, unredeeming way. Raphael is about an aspiring rich transvestite teen, who has an evil relationship with his limo driver. Halloween Day (or whatever it's called) is about vampires from what I can gather. I forgot some of the other names of the stories, but my favorite one is about a kid who rapes his victims in a variety halloween masks, and then performs a coup d'etat on himself while wearing a rambo mask.In all, I love this book with a sick passion. I will leave you with the best quote in the book:*cries* \\"I JUST WANTED TO GO FISHING, DAMMIT!\\""},{"Title":"The Other World","review":"The review from Booklist promises much.

I'm not quite sure what I expected, but I was surprised at the content of Lady Windamere's Fan. Considering the lifestyle that Wilde indulged in, it was interesting to see his take on the confusions and lack of communication between a husband and wife. He introduced the subject of a possible affair and divorce, but sketched his main characters as honorable citizens who were willing to go against the &quot;impulse of the moment&quot; and instead, stay true and faithful to their spouses. The person of Lady Windamere is interesting and effective. She is one who many women would do well to emulate. She demonstrates great love and devotion to her husband and her child, and shows forth woman's indwelling feeling of responsibility for her offspring.As always, Wilde gives us an interesting little &quot;twist&quot; at the end of the play, just to keep us on our toes and prove again that we aren't nearly as clever as he! Wilde proves himself again with Lady Windamere's Fan-- a job well done!"},{"Title":"A Culture of Fact: England, 1550-1720","review":"In today's world where &#34;facts&#34; are where you find them, and anyone can post a &#34;fact&#34; on Wikipedia, this book is a plethora of information and makes one consider exactly what the facts are, might be, could be and how they may not really be factual..

He claims to have been raised in a Nestorian Christian community in Persia, but to have never been exposed to the Bible except through an outsider(!). He is obviously completely ignorant of the Qu'ran, which he never quotes, but that doesn't stop him from making the most outrageous statements about Persian culture and claiming that \\"The Koran [sic] tells them to do it.\\" He claims that the peoples' inherent fatalism prevents them from seeking remedies against disease, as that disease is supposed to be due to the will of God, then in the very next paragraph he goes on about how ignorant and ineffectual the remedies of the local doctors are!Such bald-faced duplicity is due to the massive axe Adams has to grind. The entire book is devoted to how ignorant and savage the people of Persia are, combined throughout with desperate pleas for aid to the missionary efforts there.Save your money.

We definately need more of his determination and moral character today."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"George Washington wasn't the first president of our nation by virtual acclamation for nothing. Likewise, apocraphal stories about cherry trees notwithstanding, his example wasn't held high for children and adults alike for 150 years for no reason. Finally, someone has dispensed with speculative history and psycho-babble and written and honest, straightforward biography of this great man. His peers are known as &quot;the founders&quot; of the republic. Washington is known as &quot;THE FATHER&quot; of the republic. And with good reason."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"The chief success of Brookhiser's book is its recreation of 18th-century America, and its exemplar, in 200 crisp pages. Brookhiser clearly admires his subject, and skillfully distills his essence in this slim volume.The George Washington that emerges from this book is essentially a moral and theatrical man - one who understood the stagecraft of statecraft as much as Ronald Regan did 200 years later. He paid fastidious attention to his wardrobe, his speech and even his facial expressions. His volcanic temper was allowed free reign only enough to impress upon his audience its existence and then was quickly reeled in. He paid a great deal of attention to his reputation, which Brookhiser shows was considered a crucial component of character for all 18th century men-of-action in America, and needed to be protected 'like precious cargo in the hold of a ship.' His courage under fire was undeniable, even when those under his command ran away. His will to serve seemed to outpace his ambition: he seemed to be just as happy in Mount Vernon as in the White House. He felt the hypocrisy of slave-owning perhaps more than most of his Virginia neighbors; he was the only one of the slave-owning President's who had his slaves freed after death.One significant omission, however, is that comparatively little attention is paid to Martha Washington. Why did George marry her? What was Martha's chief contribution to George's success? What role, in other words, did marriage play in the formation and continuation of Washington's character? These questions are important yet unaddressed.In the end, Brookhiser adds flesh tones to Washington, whose cool visage - in Gilbert Stuart's portrait - peers at you on the cover of the book. Nevertheless, the Father of Our Country remains a remote father, which is apparently exactly what the man himself intended."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"George Washington is to America as Micky Mantle is to baseball; a real life hero, an American legend. I expected a lot from this book. A lot of enthusiasm. A lot of excitement. A lot of thought-provoking analysis. Unfortunatley, it did not deliver. I expected to get caught up in the stories of the war and the writing of the constitution. This enthusiasm never materialized. Mr. Brookhiser's book gets out of the gate well with three interesting, but not riveting, chapters on Washington's role in the war, constitution, and Presidency. However, the book takes a major stumble in the backstretch during the next three chapters on Nature, Morals, and Ideas. Given all that is going on today with the behavior of our current President, I hoped to get an insight into what Washington might have thought about these topics. What did &quot;honor&quot; mean to him? What should it mean to me? Does &quot;character&quot; matter in a Presidency? I did not find these answers or any clear understanding of his real moral bent. Struggling to the finish line, Mr. Brookhiser attempts to analyze the first President's role as Father of the Nation to a paternal fathers' relationship with his sons and daughters. I found this to be a terrible stretch with little credibilty and the comparisons were not convincing.In summary, the book was adequate. It has some useful background information and had some moments that provoked thoughtfulness. However, it certainly did not come &quot; in the money&quot;."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Before buying, read the inside flap carefully, depending upon your level of interest this book could be too much for you. The first third of the book is informative history, but then Mr. Brookhiser gets involved in detailed analysis and evaluvation of George Washington. The author really nails him down (for my level of interest there were too many nails)-- yes, the first president does deserve the title \\"Founding Father\\". If this was not an important question for you to begin with, this book may not be for you. But you may enjoy reading the first three chapters as I did."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"This book is awesome! It isn't very long, but is jam-packed with the interesting tidbits that we all need to associate with George Washington. Highly recommend, especially for anyone who is taking American History."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser's &quot;Founding Father&quot; is an interesting book. Instead of being a straightforward biography, it seeks to extract the moral lessons from President Washington's life. This technique bears much fruit for thought. Particularly, I was struck by Brookhiser's focus on George Washington as the father of our country and how it speaks to us today-in an age of broken and nonfunctioning families. There are many good lessons to learn from Washington's life in this book. The one thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is Brookhiser's tendency to slant how he thinks Washington would deal with modern issues (public education for example) in a way that makes them very like Brookhiser's views. However, this happens only a few times and as it is obvious when he is doing so, does not warrant too much concern. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"If you want to know why the American revolution turned out so much better than the hundreds of revolutions elsewhere during the past two centuries, this book is the place to start. George Washington was the outstanding leader who won the war and started what might have been a fragile democracy in a strong direction. Washington combined the virtues of courage, conviction, and restraint. He attained these virtues through profound self-discipline which was culled from the wisdom of ages past. Revisionist historians debunk our founders today, and romantic historians prefer Lincoln to Washington, if they have anything good at all to say about America and its leaders. After reading this wonderful book you will put Washington into 1st place. The first half of the book is spellbinding. The second half flags a bit, but not to the overall detriment of my enthusiastic recommendation. I wish every eleventh grader was required to read this excellent volume."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser's \\"Founding Father\\" is one of several recent biographies of America's revolutionary generation that seeks too capture what he believes was the essence of George Washington's wisdom and character. Brookhiser offers moral lessons for a new generation of Americans that he believes have not been exposed to these virtues, but could profit by drawing lessons from Washington's life and career. At some level \\"Founding Father\\" is a reaction to Brookhiser's repulsion at the current state of history in the nation's universities.He is reacting, at least in part, to a culture war that has been underway in the United States over the nature of the past, one fundamentally about identity and whether U.S. history would be viewed as a one people, one nation narrative or with a multicultural, in some cases divisive, perspective. That the past might be divisive deeply troubled some national opinion leaders who questioned the reexamination of traditional interpretations, and the more multicultural, relativistic, and conflict-oriented approach to delving into history.This debate represented a battle for control of the national memory. Would it be one that is unified--one people, one nation--or one that was fragmented and conflict-oriented? This is an important issue and fully worthy of consideration by all in the marketplace of ideas. And the jury is still out.Some critics of the dominant approach to the past taken by academic historians reacted by providing their own versions of history that emphasized unity and morality. Richard Brookhiser's biography of George Washington is in this category. Brookhiser, a political operative and scholar associated with the National Review, emphasized on the \\"New Hour with Jim Lehrer on March 28, 1996, that \\"for all the efforts of, of the historians and the standard biographers, there's still this, this blankness to the man's image. So I thought it would be worthwhile to go back and, you know, not to uncover any new, new facts but to just put the ones that we know into a different light and to focus especially on the highlights of this public career and what it was about, about his character that enabled him to do them. You know, I'm not interested in details, if they don't relate directly to that.\\"Brookhiser's selective retelling of the story of George Washington in this book is a blatant attempt to draw lessons from Washington's career that serve the larger public good as Brookhiser understands it. It is essentially a late twentieth century version of Mason Weems's \\"The Life of Washington,\\" but without fabricated tales such as the cherry tree episode included. As a study of Washington's morals and virtues this work is most welcome. Having a point of view is not entirely a bad thing, and Brookhiser offers an eloquent one in this work. At the same time, as a work of history this is a decidedly less useful study of Washington than many others such as James Thomas Flexner's magisterial multivolume biography. Knowing that most people will only read one book on Washington I would recommend a collective biography, Joseph Ellis' \\"His Excellency: George Washington\\" (Alfred A. Knopf, 2004), which is a tour de force of historical insight."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"The author covers a lot of ground in a very limited number of pages. The result is a lack of a general biographical sketch of Washington. I would agree with other reviews that a more comprehensive biography would be a better choice for a first read on Washington."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"I read this after reading Brookhiser's book on Alexander Hamilton, which I also enjoyed immensely. I do not find many books that I am uncritical about, but this is one of them. First, it must be understood, in light of other reviews, that Brookhiser disclaims up front that this is NOT a biography on George Washington. It does not go into detail about any portion of his life. Rather, it is a terrific examination of Washington's life contribution, and our historical understanding of it, from a particular perspective. As with Alexander Hamilton, Brookhiser isolates this perspective with incredible acumen, and then presents it to the reader with great eloquence and sparkling prose. While the first and second parts of the work are at times seemingly rambled and undirected, the patient reader will be rewarded in the end when this skillful author pulls all his points together and presents a wonderful close that fills you with a profound admiration, both for our own fathers and for the father of our country."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"\\"Founding Father\\" is not a long biography (199 pages), but it is an interesting piece of writing. It is split into 3 areas - about one-half of the book is straight biography, about one-third is an analysis of the character of our first president and the balance is an analysis of what it means to be a founding father, how Washington measures up to that ideal and what kind of \\"father\\" he was.The biography section is great - straightforward and written in an engaging and lively style. The character portion bogs down quite a bit and the founding father section is interesting (it asserts that he was the kind of father who was most concerned with preparing his children for life outside of his home - life on their own. He encourage other people to step into leadership roles to fill the vacuum that would be there when he walked away from the national spotlight.)One quote, above all, highlights the best parts of Washington. It comes from Napoleon, who comments in a moment of self-pity after Waterloo, \\"They wanted me to be another Washington.\\" Think of it - Washington was handed the power to be a dictator and he turned it down. In fact, this book mentions that in all of Washington's letters, he only gets truly angry at one man, and immediately writes a rough letter to a colleague who suggests that Washington make himself king when the Articles of Confederation government begins to founder.Brookhiser makes an interesting observation about Washington's impact on American politics by pointing out the length of time he was nationally prominent in comparison with other American leaders. For example, FDR was president for 12 years, Reagan was only politically important for the 8 years of his presidency, Eisenhower was important for the 8 years of his presidency plus his time as a general in WWII (12 years total). Lincoln - 7 years if you count from the time of the famed Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858. Washington, in comparison was a national figure for 24 years - 17 of them as the leader of the country (you've got to count him as de facto leader of the country while he was leading the Continental Army since everybody knew that if he failed the whole Revolution would fail).Brookhiser focuses on Washington and slavery in the character portion of the biography and, while Washington does not live up to modern standards on this issue, he was remarkably progressive for his time. He refused to sell any of his slaves since that would tear apart families. He is the only American president who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington seems to have dealt with the contadictions of \\"All men are created equal...\\" and slavery by mostly ignoring it.So, to sum up, there are 3 sections to the book and I found the middle section to be a bit tedious."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Brookhiser has done two things here. First, he has contributed to our understanding of our first president, who for so many has become just a face on a quarter, or a hairdo on a one dollar bill. George Washington was so big, that his legacy can handle many more books. This book serves as an incisive thematic essay, grounded in the perspective of fathering, and fathering a whole country. The fact that Washington never fathered any of his own children makes this more interesting.Second, we have here a new, more serious Brookhiser, shown by his subsequent biography of Alexander Hamilton. Brookhiser cut his teeth writing for National Review, and wrote some incredibly perceptive essays on the Republican primary contestants in 1980. The good news is that he has deepened as a writer, and now shows that he can also research back in time.This book reads fast, but sinks deep. Buy it, read it."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"I don't profess to be an expert on George Washington, but I have read some (Flexner, Angel in a Whirlwind) and, though I thoroughly enjoyed this rather thin book, would not recommend it to someone who didn't already have some familiarity with GW. The book includes a number of thought provoking commentaries, but I think assumes that the reader is fairly well-versed in the basic life and times of its subject. In reading this book (and other biographies), you can't help but admire the man and marvel at our good fortune in having men of his character when we needed them most. (You also can't help but cringe (or weep) when comparing him to the latest gentleman to hold the office.)"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"This is more a collection of essays following a thesis that Brookhiser lays out and follows. I liked the retelling of things I already knew, and really enjoyed the themes and bits that I didn't know already. Washington is in sore need of rediscovery and this book meets those challenges by keeping the chosen topics to the point and brief enough to finish.I would read this after reading a biography of Washington, as I can imagine a person with no knowledge of him may find the necessary jumping of time to follow the themes confusing.It's one of the top 3 books on Washington in it's readability."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser specializes in concise character studies of our founding fathers. He did a fine job with Alexander Hamilton which followed this very nice biography of George Washington. The book justly identifies George Washington as the central Founding Father and goes on to explain how his character was essential to holding the revolution together and the enduring example he set as our first President.The subtitle of the book is \\"rediscovering Washington\\". I like this approach a great deal because Washington is one of those names that everyone has an image of and thinks they know. However, when you probe that surface picture you begin to realize how little real knowledge and understanding is there. This book hits the important points of essential nature of Washington to our founding, his life, his character, and how he relates to our country today.The book is not exhaustive and there is much about Washington to search out after you have read this book. However, it is short enough for everyone to enjoy and yet offers enough depth of insight to satisfy those with prior knowledge of Washington.Fine job!"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"It is unfortunate that Washington has been reduced to an unsmiling portrait on a one dollar bill, the story that he had wooden teeth, and a fable about him fessing up to chopping down a cherry tree. Here was THE founding father of our country. In an era of great patriots: Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Henry, they chose him to be their leader. It is not unreasonable to state that if it were not for Washington there would be no United States today. Brookhiser successfully examines Washington the icon and gives us insight into Washington the man. Washington's accomplishments are staggering to consider. He had the sagacity to defeat the most powerful military force in his time AND launched a new nation that would endure throughout the ages. This book should be read by every American. In a sense he is a father to us all. I wish the book was larger in scope."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser does an admirable, if Spartan job, of keeping the memory of our Founding Father alive.I bought this book because it occured to me that with all the titles available these days on Jefferson and Franklin, I hadn't seen much proffered on Washington. I suspected, and still do, that the reason is that liberal academians prefer to write about those Founders more dear to their hearts.Brookhiser spends very little time on the intimate details of Washington's life. Martha, his wife, is barely mentioned. This book dwells on the highlights of Washington's careers in service to this country. It makes for a good primer to more in depth biography that I plan to pursue down the road. It could serve that purpose for you too."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"My review title is not meant to be perjorative, but to give you a sense of what this book is and is not. It will give you the highlights of Washington's accomplishments and comments about his personality and character. It is certainly NOT a full length bio., which is fine - there are plenty out there. Hopefully, more Americans will read this book so they don't make the ignorant comment made by a ninth grader (quoted in the book) about how unimportant Washington's presidency was. This is a fresh, uncontroversial look at our first president and makes interesting insights into what made GW the greatest of Americans..."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"I was so enraptured with Richard Brookhiser's brief biography, \\"Alexander Hamilton, American,\\" that upon finishing I immediately launched into \\"Founding Father.\\" \\"Founding Father\\" is actually the earlier of the two books, and is somewhat less well developed, but is very enjoyable nonetheless. If we are lucky, it will turn out to be the first in a series of brief biographies Mr. Brookhiser writes about the founders.Brookhiser describes \\"Founding Father\\" as a \\"moral biography.\\" The book is more an extended essay on Washington's character than a chronicle of his life. Brookhiser's book on Hamilton manages to serve both purposes for that founder in roughly the same brief space, and for that reason is more satisfying. But the examination of Washington's character is satisfying in another way - he comes off as a very worthy father for our country.Fatherhood is very much the theme of this book. Parallel themes of Washington's career and character converge when Brookhiser reflects on the meaning of the term \\"father of his country.\\" He concludes that Washington was the type of father who knew when his progeny was ready to move on without his parenting. For Brookhiser, Washington's greatest contribution was his knowing when to quit. He did not quit in defeat, but exactly at the point when he could have become something like a king (both when he stepped down as Commander in Chief after the war and after he declined to run for a third term). Brookhiser makes the point compellingly - Washington's leadership was to give the work back to the people and to cast dynastic succession out of the American tradition (the other George W should pay attention!)Since the book is short, it isn't a large investment of time to read. It works as a nice, refreshing reminder about a genuine hero from history. If it were much longer, it would have needed some other purpose to work. As it is it works well as a study in character and leadership. I eagerly await Mr. Brookhiser's next installment."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Brookhiser is able to convey the idea that the act of &quot;going first&quot; was an amazing feat. Washington's true virtue is clearly described and provides a hope for revitalizing American politics. Brookhiser reminds us that the origin of greatness in all things, even the political, is the human soul"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"It is puzzling why someone would be motivated to write a book on Washington with nothing new to offer. After reading the great Washington biographies by Hughes, Freeman, Flexner, and Cunliffe (and the quaint ones by Irving and Sawyer), I found this just rehashing old stuff with no particular style."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Lacey Culpepper was born on Washington's birthday, February 22, which made her special. One of her ancestors was at Valley Forge with George Washinston's troops. My sons and I were there in 1976 for a special celebration on our way to Longwood Gardens in Northeast Pennsylvania. The first president of America appeared to Lacy on her 6th birthday. She'd wanted to see him and he came as a 12-yr-old. He explained that the had lived at Ferry Farm, when Mt. Vernon was the inheritance of his half-brother, Lawrence, on the death of their father. He was tall for twelve, and grew into a 6'2\\" adult. At age 15, he was a surveyor.Five years later, he was a major in the Colonial Forces. By the time he got to the crossing at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, he was a general. It was winter when they crossed the river at night, perhaps close to his birthday. He was a good leader of men and helped to convert the thirteen colonies into the country where he was elected as president. He married Martha and had wooden false teeth which irritated his mouth and made it hard to eat.Now, he is honored with a brand-new gold dollar coin. Whatever happened to the Susan B. Anthony coin which a retired teacher gave to all babies she knew. His face is on postage stamps all over the world to compete with the profile of Queen Elizabeth. Even his portrait by Stuart was in the movie, \\"Bundle of Joy,\\" right by the door of the shopgirl's apartment. His portrait is on our one-dollar bill and other U.S. currency. From 1869 until 1923, his profile faced to the left, then it was the opposite for some unexplained reason. He was in his sixties when most paintings were made; some tried to make him look like a perfectly formed hero.Instead of losing height like I am, he went from 6'2\\" at age 45 to more than 6'3\\" at age 67 (for coffin measurements). He always claimed to be six foot. Abraham Lincoln was 6'4\\". At age 26, George Washington weighed 175 lv. up to 210 (lost to 190 at 66 because of illness). He had blue eyes, a pale complexion, and large nose and hands. He wore spectacles from 46 on. He had a leadership appearance indicating power, energy and strength; he moved with grace and dignity.His personal servant was named Christopher (no last name). He was a good master to his slaves, although some reports were that his were badly clothed. Runaways always caused problems for him as with all planters, but Washington offered rewards for their return. His advertisments described in detail what they were wearing. He tried to have his slaves educated and baptized. He reportedly disliked slavery and yet he owned 300 on his properties in 1797 at his death.He was born in Bridges Creek, Virginia; father a land speculator and planter, mother an orphan with a comfortable inheritance. He married Martha Custis on January 6, 1759, but he loved Sarah Cary who married his friend, December 17, 1748. He took up a planter's life on April 6 and on September 1, 1752, joined a lodge of Masons at Fredericksburg. There were no children as he remained in love with Sally all of his life. In 1779, Count Casimer Pulaski was killed during the battle for Savannah. Many towns were named for him, two in Tennessee and Virginia. In 1789, Washington became president on May 14 instead of \\"His Highness.\\"The President's House was on Cherry Street in New York. Washington acted on a spy's report when he crossed the Delaware River. He learned not to enter a confrontation without advance knowledge. Hower, the patriots of his day feared the stigma of being looked down on as not being a gentleman. Everything about being a spy went against the \\"code.\\" Robert Townsend used his store for espionage because of his antipathy for the Redcoats. Twenty-one year old Nathan Hale was the only hero spy as he was hanged by the British quickly (like Sam Davis in Pulaski in another American War). The only way to be glorified as a spy was (then) to be caught and executed \\"on the spot.\\"He is portrayed as the father of our county in the Pultizer prize-winning 'Founding Brothers' by Joseph J. Ellis who wrote other biographies about Washington. Henry Knox was Washington's Secretary of War. John Hancock. governor of Massachuetts was handsome, trim and vain; he had been promised to be the first Vice President by the Federalists. Washington, D.C. became \\"Federal City\\" in 1790. He worked until the end, going to the DC site to see how his capital city was progressing. He inspected his farms daily, the last the day before he died of strep throat infection on December 14, 1797. His will had a provision for a university in D.C. and one of his last letters concerned the creation of an army academy. The Naval Academy at Annapolis came later where Jeff visited during his high school recess one summer. He served as president for two terms. Political joy is one of the strongest emotions of the human mind"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"This book was a fast little read and was mildly enjoyable. I didn't really gain any knowledge or special insight into Washington though. I learned more about Washington from reading Chernow's Hamilton bio. If you know absolutely nothing about Washington, this might be an OK starting point to get a feel for his character, if not much knowledge of his actual life."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"After reading over one hundred books about the people, places, and events surrounding the American Revolution, I never thought that I would be so uninspired with a book as too find it difficult to finish. Brookhiser starts with the premise that Washington has become a myth and so non-personal to us that he is relegated to the image on the one-dollar bill. Washington was not a fascinating man. He was a diligent, quasi-political soldier who knew how to lead men. He knew that he did not have the oration skills like John Adams or even Benjamin Franklin, but he was a man of intelligence. This led him to be a man of few words. He also was reserved in expressing his opinions unless he felt it absolutely necessary for the good of his country. He was selfless. He was not as concerned with posterity as men like John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson. He therefore seldom spoke about his thoughts and impressions to others like the aforementioned. This allows us to know the man less then his fellow patriarchs. Please Mr. Brookhiser, do not try to create this man into something he was not. We know perhaps less about Washington than any other founding father because that is the way he wanted it. He is a myth and a legend of gothic proportions. Unfortunately myth sometimes blurs reality, but that is OK. We know enough to be confident that without his courage and wisdom we might not have succeeded during that difficult time.Brookhiser also is very short on documentation. The one thing that can carry a book of history that was not well written is to present facts and documented quotes so as to make the reader educated, though maybe not entertained.It is possible, however, top be possibble to write an entertaining book about the man. I hope not, but this book does not answer the question."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"This book on George Washington is quite interesting. I read it with enthusiasm, but at the same time, maintaining some reservations. The author seemed to be afraid in a way: he was reluctant to include the 'bad side' of Washington (and some of his co-founding 'fathers' who featured in this book). Even when he dared, his style deteriorated: from being vague to being uncoordinated. Still, I enjoyed reading his book.In contrast, I like being frank in assessing both men and materials. Mr Washington was indeed a freedom-fighter. But, in all honesty, he was a selfish one. I do not see any reason why a man who sought freedom to the extent of waging a war for it, would in turn, run a government that enslaved American Negroes and oppressed American Indians. Such a man is no hero to any unbiased mind. He is unjust, insensitive and self-centered. He would not do unto others as he would like others to do unto him. Another irony of winning freedom!In this biographical evaluation, Richard Brookhiser 'forgot' to tell us the reason why this 'hero of freedom' turned around and denied other people of their (most basic) freedom. Willingly or unwillingly, George Washington mortgaged the lives of Negroes and Indians throughout his life. He would have been a true hero, had he opposed slavery and oppression, and worked towards achieving freedom and justice for all: regardless of skin-colour and ethnicity."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"There is no structure, logic or historical context to any of his material. It rambles all over the place skipping from one subject to another in the same paragraph. If you like reading an editorial version of history you will love this book. This book is incredibly shallow and my evaluation of this book is that it is absolute [junk]."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Veteran historian Richard Brookhiser's 1996 biography of George Washington is a highly readable effort to rescue our First President from relative obscurity. \\"Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington\\" is less a definitive biography than an extended essay on why Washington rates our continuing respect for the unique role he played in the creation of the United States.Brookhiser breathes life into a remote hero whose stalwart leadership, personal morality, and sense of necessary limits served his country extremely well as leader of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, as a key organizer of the Convention that wrote the Constitution, and as the country's first president. Throughout his public service, Washington was extremely conscious that he was setting an example for future leaders in an experiment in democracy that was not foreordained to succeed. In his concluding remarks, Brookhiser explores the various ways in which Washington was a father to his country and countrymen. To his credit, the author does not shy away from an honest assessment of his subject's decidedly mixed feelings about slavery. \\"Founding Father\\" is highly recommended to students of the era and the presidency."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"I love founding father biographies, and this one is a good one. It is not really a biography, but it is not advertised as one. A good brief overview that does not try to tear an American Hero down. Brookhiser digs into the complexities of the once in a millennium leader in a fast pace fun to read book. The author even goes to bat for Washington against some of the modern contrived rumors designed to lessen Washington's character.

It gives a good story of Washington as America's first true hero. It is not a great historical biography. The portion on Washington's morals is good, but is more philosophical and religious than historical. If you really want to learn about Washington, pick up Douglas Southall Freeman's pulitzer winning work (the abridgement is best unless you have a whole year to do nothing but read!)"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"The purpose of this book, according to the author's introduction, is \\"a moral biography\\" rather than \\"a life history.\\" His point is that there is a \\"distancing\\" between ourselves and Washington; that he has become more myth and metaphor than man. The book aims to connect us today with Washington's character and personality.The author goes into great depth about the literary works (such as Addison's Cato, Bollingbroke and Filmer) that Washington read, but I feel Brookhiser is reading too much into these and provides no evidence of how Washington reacted to these works. The effect is to continue the distancing between us and Washington by not discussing the man himself; just the influences around him.I think also the author misses some very important points. For example, in the Introduction, the author says \\"it is not important to Washington's public career...what his stepchildren were like\\" but then devotes the entire last section of the book to metaphorical fatherhood of the Nation without discussing Washington in the role of an actual parent. I'm sorry, it is important! It tells more about his character than do the books he read.Another tool the author uses to connect us to Washington is to use modern-day examples. At first I appreciated references to Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan. However, after about a half-dozen of these it just makes the book seem dated.This is the first biography of Washington that I have read. I finished the book not knowing much more about him than when I started. I learned more about him reading Joseph Ellis' American Sphinx (about Jefferson) and David McCollough's John Adams. Which is sad; it is clear that Brookhiser had high hopes for this book and gave it a lot of thought. I just thought it missed the mark and didn't serve its own objectives."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"In the overall history of the beginnings of the United States, George Washington looms larger than any other participant. The number of books about him are proof of that, if nothing else is. He has been biographied, eulogized, characterized, historied, and fictionalized. And in today's politically correct world, he has even been demonized. Yet everyone who has written about him has had to admit that for good or ill, we would not have the country we know without him.In Founding Father, Richard Brookhiser, examines why and when Washington became known as the father of our country. He divides his study into three major categories: Career, Character, Founding Father. A fourth category, Death, brings the examination to a close.More than most of the Founders, our first President was a self-made man. His formal education was limited, although his experience was extensive, beginning as a teenager in a surveying party in the western lands. He shaped his own character by following rules of behavior which he thought appropriate to a man in his position. Not without faults, such as a fiery temper and being a slaveowner, he strove all of his life to be the best man he could be.Brookhiser describes how Washington worked to be better, and worried about things he could not completely control. He risked everything to free the U.S. from the British. Afterwards, when he would have enjoyed life at Mt. Vernon, he answered the call to serve his country once more as its first president. To the world at large, both in his own time and down through the centuries to today, the most important contribution he made was when he stepped down and went home after his second term.This is a valuable addition to our knowledge of the man some have called &quot;the indispensable man&quot; in early American history. Brookhiser helps the reader get past the portraits, the dollar bill, and enigma, and to better understand the man behind them all.Readers who enjoy this book, might also enjoy Richard Norton Smith's &quot;Patriarch,&quot; James Thomas Flexner's &quot;Washignton: The Indispensable Man,&quot; and for fiction, Howard Fast's &quot;The Crossing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser's Founding Father is interesting read and should be added to any collection on the Founding Fathers. Brookhiser's book is less a biography and more a examinaton of Washington's morals, ethics, and overall character. This is a defense of Washington, but not a white wash. This is a nice compliment to fine bioghraphy's written by Ron Chernow and Jeffrey Ellis."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"A moral biography should accomplish two objectives according to Richard Brookhiser. First, it should explain its subject and then second, if done well, it should shape the hearts and minds of those who read it. A useful moral biography will accomplish these two objectives by showing \\"how a great man navigated politics and a life as a public figure.\\"More of a collection of insightful essays than a full-scale treatment of Washington's life, Brookhiser's succinct moral biography of George Washington accomplishes both of these objectives in a little over 200 pages of exceptionally readable, at times lyrical, prose.Washington had surprisingly little formal education, at least compared to most of the other founding fathers, but he read voraciously and was very close at various times to other founding intellectuals such as George Mason, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton. He supported the foundation of a national university and had over 900 books in his library at the time of his death in 1799.Being an exceptionally large, well-built man for his day, George Washington appeared to have been genetically destined for greatness, but his naturally volatile temper was something that he always had to keep in check. Courtesy and reputation, \\"the medium and the stimulus of Washington's morality\\" states Brookhiser, were the means and objective by which he did so.As a very young man, Washington appreciated \\"Seneca's Morals\\", a collection of moral essays by the first-century Roman philosopher and playwright Seneca, and quoted maxims from Joseph Addison's play \\"Cato\\" all of his life. The maintenance of his reputation, to Washington a measure of one's character, was a lifelong concern.One of the most persistent influences on Washington's character were the \\"Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation\\", a set of guidelines for dealing with others, a collection of rules for living one's life in a courteous manner.One of the great surprises in the book was the fact that Washington loved the theater, attending available performances whenever possible. Washington quoted extensively from favorite plays and Shakespeare, and even had Addison's \\"Cato\\" performed at Valley Forge while encamped there. The language of the theater is readily visible in many of his speeches.In the book's last section, a collection of three thoughtful essays exploring Washington's role as founding father, Brookhiser considers three potential sources of Washington's ideas regarding political fatherhood: Bolingbroke's idea of the Patriot King; Sir Robert Filmer's concept of rights and privileges originating from a patriarch/prince; and finally Washington's own uneasy experience with the institution of slavery and his role as a slave master.Washington was a \\"reticent\\" slaveholder at best, at least according to Brookhiser. He quietly freed slaves while he was president by simply leaving them behind when he returned to Virginia, and he refused to sell slaves without their consent. In 1793 he conceived a plan to divide Mount Vernon into four separate farms, each one being rented out and the slaves being hired out as wage-earning laborers. In his will Washington decreed that all of his slaves should be freed upon the death of this wife Martha, something that she actually did before her death in December of 1800.Near the end of the book, Brookhiser examines Washington's first Farewell Address, \\"one of the most sobering moments in any major American speech\\" according to Brookhiser. The occasion is sobering to Brookhiser because in leaving office as commander-in-chief, Washington recognizes that the success of the American experiment is unclear, problematic. The future success of that experiment would reside with each American citizen.Washington's decisions to step down, first in 1783 and then later at the conclusion of his second term, were not easy decisions for him to make. Much of Richard Brookhiser's fine book deals with reasons why Washington made those decisions, why his life still has the power to inspire."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"I bought this book right before going to visit Washington's home, Mt. Vernon. It is a decent book, but it didn't add much to my visit as expected. It's always hard, I've found, reading bios of the founding fathers as so much time as passed, and there is often limited first hand information about who these men were. The book is correctly advertised as \\"not\\" being a biography, but rather an overview of key times in his life. Richard Brookhiser is a very good writer, but it was hard to come away really feeling like I knew that much more about Washington, again, because of limited first hand accounts. Still, it is worth reading to add to one's collection of great Americans, or great leaders, or great men of the Revolution. A little dry, but a decent,quick read."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"In &quot;Founding Father&quot; Richard Brookhiser attempts a moral biography of George Washington which focuses on his public life, all in order to bring him closer to us 200 years later. While a noble effort, Brookhiser does not follow through. Although mildly interesting, this book is too sketchy and reads as a mere outline of a more comprehensive work. There are better works out there that bring Washington closer to our hearts than this one."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"It is hard to tell what the object of this book really is. Is it to give a good introduction to the layman about George Washington and why he was so indispensable to the success of the young republic? Or is it to add something new and valuable to the history of George Washington?If the objective was the former, I believe it is a good introduction to the man. Probably a good tool for high school students or the general population. However, if the purpose is to improve the sholarship available on our first president, I think it added very little that is not already known and understood by historians.The reader who wants more scholarly writing (yet readable and enjoyable) should read Flexner's one-volume abridgement, &quot;The Indispensale Man&quot; or Forrest McDonald's, &quot;The Presidency of George Washington&quot; (less than 200 pages).Despite the somewhat negative comments on his sources, I still think Freeman's 7-volume work is the definitive biography, but that is obviously quite an undertaking. Flexner's 4-volume work is easier to read and just as good a work of history."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Yes, this book should be read by every American, and it is a sadreminder of the poor state of our education in these modern times.As the author points out, George Washington was a far greaterman, and a tremendously more important aid to our founding, thanhe is currently given credit for.

We haveforgotten that Washington's mere presence at events of those days lent a strength and solidarity that we can't quite fathom.No one in our memory has been able to grasp our minds and emotions in the manner Washington did during our Revolutionand during his 2 terms as the first U.S. President.Everyone should read how his presence on the battlefield affected the Colonial soldiers in their performance underfire and how he could rally the troops and inspire them.Even as the first political parties were being formed, andanimosity was rearing its head, and personal rancor was makingits first appearances in our political history, Washington could, by either physical presence or word, bring everyonetogether.No one else could have brought together Adams, Jefferson and Hamilton to make compromises and get agreements on matters ofnational interest.His influence was so great during those times, it is now hard tobelieve any one man could have been so influencial; plus, Washington usually made his presence known in the most quiet ways, and he influenced decisions while keeping his mouth shutat the same time.How could someone be in politics and pull that off?No one but Washington could have done it, and we, as a people,have forgotten how necessary he was to the success of our Revolution and our new form of representative government.And, as Brookhiser points out, some of the greatest service hedid to the history of our country was to withdraw from hispositions of power and leadership. When the Revolution was over, and Washington was a national hero and virtually worshipped by all, he could have had any position, but he went to Congress and resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief,saying simply that the job he had undertaken was completed.And he returned to Mount Vernon. Later, after being drawn againinto public service, with public and political adulation unceasing, he completed his 2nd term as President, and he announced in advance that he would be leaving office and returning to his home.By that time, 2 political parties had come into existence, butthe leaders of both parties acknowledged that Washington, whohad remained aloof from both parties, could have been elected toa 3rd term if he had any interest. But Washington thought 2 terms was enough for anyone and that a proper republic should have changes in leadership on a regular basis.Brookhiser has a very readable book, and the story moves alongsmoothly, and he retains our interest throughout.The only hesitation possible in reading this book is the author's last section, where he explores the concept of &quot;fatherhood,&quot; and he delves into some psychology that isn'tfounded on fact here. He keeps it interesting, but he skewsaway a bit from the historical facts about the Father of our Country.An A-1 read for anyone with any interest whatsoever in the beginnings of our country."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"If the purpose of a biography is to instruct us on the worthof his subject's life, Brookhiser's book is a grand slam. Hesavors his subject and brings us to realize that we should savorhim too. We owe Washington the man so much, all the more becausehis decisions and his type-castig were for the purpose of molding a country and trusting it to succeeding generations' hands. This is the best bio I have ever read. We understand the character andthe training behind what made him the indispensible and political-military everyman for our country's seminal period. The book isbeautifully organized and to the point. Every thought is carefullyput together and interwoven with the rest - not a word out ofplace. In a world where heroes seem difficult to accept withoutour poking holes in them, George Washington is the whole hero.Brookhiser's is a whole work."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"In all honesty, I'd like to give the book three and a half stars, but it is much more deserving of four stars than three. I'll begin with the positive. The book does what Brookhiser sets out to do: it makes Washington real again in an accessible way. The man who is so often seen - and subsequently dismissed - as an historical legend of the American Revolutionary War and our first president is enfleshed before us, projected as a man of virtue, character, wisdom, dignity, principle, and drive... though Brookhiser certainly does not overlook his struggles, it is his virtue in these struggles and his push to overcome adversity that is so admirable. Further, Brookhiser manages not only not to lose the legendary view of Washington but to make it all the more respectable.The book is structured in three parts, each with subchapters:I. Careera) warb) constitutionc) presidentII. Charactera) natureb) moralc) ideasIII. Founding Fathera) Fathersb) Patriarchs and Mastersc) Father of His CountryA final part recounts Washington's death. The book as a whole is about 200 pages. Up until the end of the first part (almost page 100), I was ready to give the book five stars. Brookhiser writes in an engaging manner and displays exemplary discernment. He is cautious where he ought to be cautious and sober in the judgments that he does make. Though the section on Washington's life is much abridged compared to other biographies (it is not intended to make Flexner's or others' biographies obsolete; it's goal is much different), it is good for the purpose of bringing Washington to life and showing the kind of man he was for any American.The second section is a noble endeavor: Brookhiser takes Washington's character and enumerates what it was made up of, systematizing virtues and traits which might be overlooked in other biographies. The thought may cross one's mind as to why Brookhiser set different chapters for these examinations instead of interspersing them throughout his account of Washington's life. Again, however, this is not meant to be a exhaustive biography but to bring the man to life, showing why he was so great and what we can take from his life to emulate. With these goals, this was an exceptional format for the book. Brookhiser does a very good job (perhaps not masterful, but close) of looking at the virtue and psychology of Washington, making his character and brilliance real.The third section looks at Washington as a Founding Father. Brookhiser examines, here, the way Washington saw himself as a Father of the country and how the country has and does view him. I enjoyed this section the least, finding it not as important or insightful as the previous two, though still worth the read.The setback with the second and third sections of the book is that Brookhiser's style suffers various problems. The shrewdness with which he wrote the first section fell - to various degrees - at different parts. He was more speculative, but this is perhaps necessary in the second part. Still, there are times when his opinions did not seem necessary as there were facts enough to fill the pages. Brookhiser also does two things that really retracted from the eloquence of his text: first, his diction is questionable. He writes odd passages, occasionally using idiomatic phrases that are more approximated to slang than formal writing. Second, he attempts to emphasize or contrast his points with modern examples, a strategy which I found detracted from his style and took the reader away from his subject. It was an annoyance in an otherwise wonderful book with a wonderful aim.In the end, however, the book is worth the read, if not for the scholar, then for less-informed Americans and (especially) high school and college students; the book teaches about virtue and character as much as about Washington, making the man and myth both more accessible and more august, along with the country he helped found."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser, news-magazine editor, columnist, and author, realizes the emotional disconnect between modern Americans and George Washington. While other presidents (Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, F. D. Roosevelt, Lincoln) are more respected because of their emotional condor, George Washington is often thought of as a stone-faced enigma. His resume wouldn't indicate as much: he started the battle that started the French-and-Indian War; he was a wealthy Virginia farmer; served in the Virginia House of Burgess; he served as the head of the Continental Army; he served as the chairman of the Constitutional Convention; and he served as the first President of the United States. His personal gravitas caused even the greatest men of the Americas (Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton, Franklin) to stand in awe of him; one speech, powerfully delivered, turned soldiers from a desire to revolt to a desire to see their government succeed; even his enemies in foreign nations (Britain and France) marveled at the man. So, how could modern Americans be so disconnected from George Washington?Brookhiser's \\"Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington\\" is a \\"moral biography, in the tradition of Plutarch (11)...\\" That is to say, it does not so much examine the life of the subject (what he did), but the mental and emotional makeup of the subject (why he did it). He continues that \\"a moral biography has two purposes: to explain its subject, and to shape the hearts and minds of those who read it (12).\\" So, Brookhiser's lofty goal is to make you a better person by holding up Washington for your examination.The first (and lengthiest) part of \\"Founding Father\\" is a sketch of Washington's career. He shows what Washington did during the Revolutionary War, during the Constitutional Convention, and during his Presidency. During this time, the events are given brief, thumbnail treatments, and Washington's motivations are emphasized. The second part examines Washington's personal character through analyzing his God-given nature, his morals, and the ideas he entertained. The final part examines Washington in the light of fatherhood. How did the fact that he was childless influence him? How did the early death of his father influence him? How did the popular concept that a monarch is father of his country influence Washington? What is the relationship between Washington's morality and the fact that he owned slaves?The overall answer to why Washington is such an enigma to modern Americans (advanced by Brookhiser) is that he was a man of great passion who was prone to lash out in anger, and spent a lifetime counteracting that tendency through emotional distancing (\\"holding his cards close,\\" choosing his words carefully, and being deliberately slow in committing himself). Thus, Washington's constant (and successful) struggle to restrain his passions, his continuous efforts to improve himself (body, mind, and soul), and his genuine love for others makes him an inspirational figure the reader is moved to emulate.Brookhiser has achieved his unique objectives in a unique way. Although modern readers may be unfamiliar with Roman figures (who were \\"pop culture\\" to the Founders), the way slavery suffocated the souls of both slaves and owners, and the details of 18th Century warfare, Brookhiser does an outstanding job in explaining these foreign concepts in such a way as to make them understandable to the modern reader. Indeed, he does the same for Washington.While Brookhiser's prose is a joy to read--high-minded yet accessible and witty--he does tend to contrast 18th century with 20th century culture in such a way as to distract. He takes subtle digs as President Clinton, expresses confusion at Newt Gingrich, and crudely comments on the fact that science has made intercourse unnecessary for procreation. Further, Brookhiser's endnotes are sporadic, direct quotes are not properly cited, and other interesting facts are not referenced. The editor would do well to provide better footnotes (not endnotes) in future editions.In all, this book comes highly recommended. The cultural distance between the late 1700s and early 2000s and the emotional distance Washington established make him an inaccessible man, but Brookhiser accomplishes his goal of making Washington both understandable and inspiring."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"A short telling of the life of George Washington. Brookhiser's writing is difficult to find an audience. He writes short biographies that gloss over and mention items that are not readily understood by those new to the subject. At the same time, those who are knowledgeable on the subject will find the books lacking detail and not enjoy the book as well. This book on George Washington is no exception. The book is well written, but difficult to read because of the information that is packed into this 200+ page volume. One must pay excruciating detail to the book to not miss anything. Not until reading Flexner's \\"George Washington-The Indispensable Man\\", did I feel I understood enough about our first President. This book is a good short primer for those not really interested in in-depth study."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser introduces a new kind of look at George Washington, whose legacy has been all but forgotten in today's society. Citizens today fail to realize the full scope of just how great this man was and the admiration he and his legacy received, not just in early America, but throughout the world. Even King George III said upon Washington's retirement as Commander in Chief placed him \\"in a light the most distinguished of any man living\\" and that he was \\"the greatest character of the age.\\"There have been countless volumes written on the man, and his tremendous legacy provides room for countless more volumes. That said, this is not the book for someone with limited (public school system) education on Washington. Before picking up this book, you would want to read something else, such as Rasmussen and Tilton's George Washington: The Man Behind the Myths, Washington Irving's George Washington: A Biography, or even the great historical fiction by Jeffrey Shaara, The Glorious Cause, part 2 of his series on the Revolutionary War. Not that someone first learning about George Washington wouldn't enjoy this book, but it may a bit \`deep' for the beginner and would be enjoyed more with a good background understanding of the subject.Brookhiser begins with Washington the General during the war, then moves to the drafting of the Constitution and finally, on to his role as President. The second half of the book is dedicated to the character of George Washington. Brookhiser gives good insight into how a man who never fathered children of his own could go on to be such a successful and admired father of a nation.Brookhiser gives the reader a brief look at Washington's Christianity, his proclivity of viewing life as a theatre play, and his establishment of a standard of how things are conducted in our nation's capital. For instance, how Washington refused to turn over to the House, sensitive information regarding Jay's Treaty. The book focuses a good bit as well on Washington's Farewell Address.Overall, this is an enjoyable read for anyone with a sound knowledge of the father of our country. You will surely find a few other books to add to your reading list in the extensive bibliography. Like all of Brookhiser's books, I give this one a thumbs up.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com"},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"In Richard Brookhiser's perspective, George Washington appears to us as a remote and aloof figure, a man whose character is nearly inaccessible to us after the hero- worship of the 19th century and cynicism of the 20th. The author seeks in \\"Founding Father\\" to present a \\"moral biography\\" of \\"the real\\" George Washington. His approach is first to survey Washington's accomplishments (military and political) and second, to explain why he \\"was able to do what he did\\" by reference to \\"his nature, his morals, and his ideas.\\"What results is a series of sketches -- essays on aspects of Washington that add up to much less than a full- scale biography. No new ground is broken by this work in terms of its factual content. If anything, its main goal apparently is to replace current perspectives with a counter- revisionist one more palatable to conservative tastes. Whether the author's approach is any less political than other recent biographies may be a matter of opinion. For my part, I found this account disappointingly bloodless for a book that sought to present the \\"real\\" George Washington, perhaps because it omits most details of the subject's personal life. The result, in my view, is a mildly interesting sketch of an admirable figure who (despite the author's intent) remains remote and difficult to understand as a human being. Readers seeking a true biography can find plenty of others that are likely to be more to their liking."},{"Title":"Founding Father - Rediscovering George Washington","review":"Richard Brookhiser's, \\"Founding Father\\" is a well written informative, most enjoyable look at the life of George Washington. It gives Washington's military and political history as well as discussing his moral values and ideals. It does not go into his family life which I find regrettable. How a man raises his kids or in Washington's case his step kids is extremely important. Especially since he is the father of our country. For this reason I gave the book four stars. Overall, for a short book on Washington it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Best of Brochure Design 6 (Best of Brochure Design) (No.6)","review":"This is one of the worst brochure design books I have ever seen.

It is a bit long, but has quite a surprise ending. I don't run across much sci-fi that has to do with the nature of God, but this one does. Once I got started, though, I had to read it to the end. The last chapter is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Before The Armada: The Emergence Of The English Nation, 1485-1588","review":"First, I would say that Wernham is an excellant writer. He has the ability to lure in the reader and keep the readers attention. This work traces English foreign policy from Henry VIII to the 1588 attack. He does a wonderful job highlighting the political and diplomatic web in the 1580s. Elizabeth struggled with Henry III of France, the Dutch Provinces, and Spain. She had to carefully plan her move on this international game of politics or one slip and Philip could strike, and strike hard. This is not to say that Elizabeth was a grand leader, but that Wernham addresses the complexity of the situation. The court was split between those who wanted to face teh danger and those like Lord Burghley who desired to avoid Philip at all costs. One of my favorite (though humurous) points in the book in when Wernham states \\"Elizabeth than unleashed Drake\\". I laugh because after my own research on Elizabethan warfare, it seems clear that Drake did more harm than good. But, in her eyes, Drake was somewhat of a special weapon for England. His raid on Cadiz was highly sucessful, but he also led a dismal failure into Portugal in 1589. At times, Wernham seems to subtly criticize Elizabeth's inability to act decisively. Also, there seems to be a sense of English Pride in the text when he discusses England as the sole Protestant power in Philip's way. Not that he was wrong, or should be blamed for using such language,because England was in fact the last Protestant threat to Philip; However, it has this Lord of the Rings feel when reading the section. Then again, it was very entertaining.Wernham is a great scholar of Elizabethan England, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the \\"Great Enterprise\\"."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I have no doubt that Basil Pennington is a very loving and well-meaning man,and an expert on his subject. But he is also very maddening.If you want to know about the background to centering prayer then probably this is as good an introduction to that aspect of the subject as any. But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases. I have the impression that Pennington has written something more explicit somewhere, but this book is definitely not it."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"The concept of centering prayer is one that can be alienating to many people raised in the traditional American tradition. Most of us have been raised to be &quot;doers,&quot; &quot;analyzers,&quot; &quot;achievers,&quot; etc. To many of us in that category, prayer is something to pursue actively whether it be at Mass, communal prayer, Liturgy of the Hours, etc. The author presents centering prayer as something different, perhaps even beyond our traditional understanding of prayer. &quot;Centering Prayer&quot;, by M. Basil Pennington, presents a concept well-suited, yet often challenging for our hectic times. The book, written a number of years ago, presents the method of prayer in a new light, combing eastern Christian spiritual exercises with the context of western spirituality, offering practical guidelines for integrating the &quot;way of prayer&quot; into our daily lives.The author presents the concept of centering prayer in a simple format, clearly outlining and explaining the history, status and principles of this ancient, but recently revitalized tradition. We are reminded continuously that faith is a gift from God; our ability to pray depends upon our willingness to &quot;rest in the Lord.&quot; We are called to empty ourselves and allow God to enter our hearts and our souls. Drawing on a number of sources, including Thomas Merton, Thomas Keating, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross as well as the anonymous author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing,&quot; Father Pennington offers a simple, cogent discussion of the various aspects of prayer.Even beyond the text, this book is an invitation. It is an invitation to open oneself to God and the gift of grace. It's neatly arranged chapters offer the reader the opportunity to reflect upon the nature of prayer and reference it frequently as needed. As one progresses in the way of centering prayer, this book is a simple, yet invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"It is with great joy that I accompany the author into the communion of those saints who have mentored both of us; Thomas Merton, to whom he attributes the term, \\"Centering\\", Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, Thomas Keating, Edward Hays, the unnamed author of the ancient classic, \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\", among others. His broad acquaintance with spiritual persons sharing the blessing of praying interiorly introduces many others as well. Having recently purchased the hard cover 1980 edition I'm reminded that, had I read it in its entirety 20 years ago, I would have been fascinated, but unable to grasp the metaphoric descriptions of this indescribable form of prayer. A couple of years ago, after years of trying to \\"make contemplation work\\", I settled into the prayer phrase, \\"Gracious Lord, I surrender to your care.\\" I cannot pinpoint the hour during which God's hug enveloped me to allow the holy privilege of slipping silently into Center, but I recognize that it was entirely the work of God, and not of my dogged determination. Because of the many workshops Pennington has conducted, the last section of the book in response to questions raised both by puzzled and skeptical participants echoed many of my own. Perhaps the question section is the place to begin, because the longings expressed therein may remind all of us of our beginnings. I sense those spiritual mothers and fathers smiling as I realize that intense longing is a Grace, a Gift, and as I discovered, a Promise as well."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I recently discovered Centering Prayer through this book, and I could not have asked for a better introduction to the subject. In Fr. Pennington, I found what I wish for in the ideal priest: knowledge and expertise tempered by compassion and humility.I wish to respond to some negative comments made by other reviewers. One has written that the book contains about one page of instruction on Centering Prayer and 200+ pages of history and theology. This is not quite true, as Fr. Pennington focuses a great deal on the mundane, practical elements of Centering Prayer. While he does make extensive reference to historical writings, I think that is for the best. The technique of Centering Prayer is extremely simple, yet it can be difficult to understand why one should do it and how one should integrate the fruits of Centering Prayer in to the rest of one's life. The thoughts of centuries of Christians who have practiced it or something like it are insightful in this regard.Another reviewer suggests that it is rooted not in Catholicism but in Eastern spiritual practices. Fr. Pennington specifically refutes this view and emphasizes that Centering Prayer has Christian roots. Indeed, he commends Centering Prayer to the many Catholics and other Christians who have found techniques such as Transcendental Meditation lacking and want a spiritual practice of their own religious tradition. While he obviously admires people of all religious persuasions, his sources are the Bible, saints of the Catholic Church, and other Christian writers.Before picking up this or any other book on Centering Prayer, please note the following: Centering Prayer is not a means of instantly assuring oneself an extraordinary experience of God. As Fr. Pennington makes clear, Centering Prayer is a method of quieting oneself and putting oneself in the presence of God. One does so not because one expects any kind of personal experience or benefit, but simply because it is God's due. If God chooses to grace an individual with an extraordinary experience of Him while praying, that is His business.With this in mind, I believe that most anyone who reads Fr. Pennington's book could profitably practice Centering Prayer"},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I bought this book for a friend who was interested in learning Centering Prayer.

Well nature abhors a vacuum--SOMETHING will come in all right. This \\"vacuum\\" is the same major fault with trancendental and other New Age meditations.While trying to make God the center of your life/thoughts is admirable, creating a spiritual \\"vaccum\\" is dangerous.The traditional form of (Christian) meditation is rather to concentrate on something positive--God Himself through the mysteries in His revealed Word. There is never any vacuum created with its concomitant dangers.The Rosary is an excellent way to accomplish this tradional Christian meditation--by meditating on God directly through the Gospel mysteries. This is far better, less dangerous and spirtually more profitable, than emptying one's self and hoping that what fills the resultant vacuum is good rather than evil.Although the author is probably well-intentioned, I fear this book might mislead some, or get others into trouble. It is better avoided."},{"Title":"The adventures of a tropical tramp","review":"A minor gem. This forgotten book is a classic travel-adventure set in 1920 Peru. Hats off to Dixon-Price Publishing for resurrecting it. Pity that the copy-editing was not done a little more skillfully, as there are a number of typo's and mis-used homonyms in the book the product of unskilled use of computer spell checker.Still, this is a minor quibble. (A map would have been nice too). Harry Foster's casual employment in the mines, cities, and jungles of Peru are a classic of early 20th Century travel writing. Some might feel that his characterizations of Peruvian Indians, Peruvian &quot;Anglo's, and the Irish are a bit harsh. However, he presents a well-balanced narrative of the country, and its types. This lost world (the 1920's) is a rough and tumble time, gone forever. A great loss. Foster preserves those days for posterity through his colorful writing and astute observations of people and cultures.Many modern travel writers could learn from his unselfconscious writing style. The book never misses a beat. A combination of irony and genuine love of people, regardless of differing cultures, lifts this book out of the mundane. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The adventures of a tropical tramp","review":"The Adventures Of A Tropical Tramp is the travel narrative of Harry La Tourette Foster, who spent most of his life after the conclusion of World War I wandering the main roads and back roads of the world, from Mexico and South America, to Asia, the South Pacific, The Caribbean, and the Mediterranean.

Landing with no funds or resources, he took a series of odd jobs, eventually becoming a reporter for a Lima paper. He went on to join two missionaries trekking overland to the headwaters of the ..., then continued on adventure filled journeys down the ... tributaries.

This is much more akin to watching one of the old Samurai movies starring Toshiro Mifune with a little mystery thrown in to make it even more interesting! The author really brings to life the customs and history of the period just before the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate with the result that I learned a whole lot of interesting historical tidbits as well as getting to enjoy a really great story. I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who's even remotely interested in Samurai or Japanese history."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"This story is reasonable engaging,not too slow and managed to keep my attention.

After Reading the entire series, why? $$$ is my guess.I love this book(s). One of my favorite samurai movies is Yojimbo. The Character Kaze in the book, is the exact same character from the movie. So I instantly fell in love with read. I read all three books within a week. They are really quick reads, so if you get one, I suggest getting the other two at the same time.For people who may not like to read so much, this is a great book. The language is very plain and simple, no confusing big words or synonyms that nobody uses on a daily basis. The reason for this is explained in book three. Another reason to applaud this book is that you can pick up words in Japanese as well. This is also a great book for those who might not be to familiar with traditional Japanese culture, as he tends to explain a lot of things in the book.Easy and fast read. I highly recommended this to Yojimbo/Sanjuro fans as well as those who are interested in samurai. As mentioned before, each book was so quick, I don't understand the need for three books. But each book can stand by itself because for the most part, it's one story line with three huge subplots."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"Death at the Crossroads: A Samurai Mystery is the first of three books that follow the ronin Matsuyama Kaze. In this volume, Kaze and a villager find a dead body at the crossroad of a small village. Kaze is then thrown into the lives of these villagers as he tries to solve the crime. There is a running storyline that goes through all three books which deals with Kaze trying to find a little girl.Furutani writes pretty well although he does at times meander a bit too much on descriptions of Japanese customs and the like. His characters are pretty interesting and Kaze is a very good protagonist. While many books of fiction that deal with these time periods deal with the big picture of Shogun and rulers and protagonist that gets entangeled in the dealings of powerful men, Furutani concentrates more on the life of a small village and only mentions the most powerful men in Japan as part of backstory. This book could have used a few more interesting characters as only Kaze stands out while the other characters don't really have much going for them.All in all, it's still an enjoyable read. There are a good amount of Japanese customs and factoids thrown in there and although they sometimes serve to bog down the story, they're for the most part pretty interesting. Kaze is a great protagonist and while the other characters aren't too interesting, they do serve their purpose. The mystery itself is pretty interesting but not really surprising and the eventual outcome isn't too thrilling. However, it's still a good, quick read and if you're interested at all in Japan at that time or in decent mystery novels then you might enjoy this. 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"I love this story. I have it in audio cassette format, but can't find it in CD or digital audio. This is a truly entertaining mystery set in feudal Japan. It's equal to \\"Seven Samurai\\" with only one Samurai. Reading it is good too, but listening to it is somehow - better."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"When William the Conqueror defeated Harold at Hastings, Saxon rule ended. Chaos ruled much of the land as forces loyal to the Norman destroyed Saxon strongholds and bandits roamed the countryside.A comparable event has also occurred in Japan in 1603 when the armies of Iegaso defeated that of the ruling Emperor Hidyoshi at the Battle of Sekighara. Matsuyama Kaze, a ronin samurai searches for the daughter of his late lord and lady who died because of that recent battle. This task was the last order given to Matsuyama Kaze by his lady. Until he completes the task, he cannot serve another master. He has had little success so far. Matsuyama Kaze gets distracted when he observes Jiro, a peasant, standing over a corpse of a man with an arrow protruding from his back. Kaze tries to point out relevant facts involving the murder to the corrupt district magistrate. When Jiro is going to be executed for the murder, Kaze, racing against time, tries to uncover the identity of the real culprit.One of the most pivotal years in Japanese history is 1603, which is brilliantly brought to life by award winning writer Dale Furutani. The author provides a different cadence that enables readers to feel a culture that seems so alien to that of the western world. It is especially humorous and ironic to see how alien the Japanese find the customs and culture of Westerners.DEATH AT THE CROSSROADS is an intricately woven and unique historical mystery that stars a hero who will be well received by fans of the sub-genre. Readers know that Matsuyama Kaxe will never quit until he finishes his quest, regardless of the foes he must face. In other words, he is a competent Quixote. Hopefully, this is the start of a long relationship between the character and his audienceHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"Matsuyama Kaze (family name first, then given name) is a middle-aged Samurai, (age 31 was considered middle-aged, 50 ancient) in 17th century Japan. He is a Ronin--which is to say he is without a master, and is wandering in search of employment--although in this story, his wandering is in the nature of a quest, which he has undertaken at the dying request of The Lady--the widow of Kaze's former Lord. He is searching for the Lord and Lady's daughter who was abducted after the Lord was defeated in a great battle.These are chaotic times in Japan. Hideyoshi, the Taiko, has died of old age in his bed, and Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been patiently waiting for his time to come, has defeated those loyal to Hideyoshi's heir and is now the undisputed ruler of Japan. Numerous samurai who had been loyal to the losing side are wandering like Kaze, looking for employment with some Lord before they lose their status as samurai, which means, &quot;those who serve.&quot;On his journey, Kaze happens upon a dead man lying at a crossroads with a distinctive arrow in his back. Kaze takes on the investigation of the crime, which leads him into fairly constant danger.This is a wonderful novel. I would classify it, if I had to classify it, as a mainstream novel with a strong mystery at its heart. In my opinion it is a work of great literary merit.&quot;Around him, mist clung tenaciously to the jagged folds that formed the ravines and valleys of the mountains. Through the low-lying white haze, the ragged black pines and reddish cryptomeria poked through the white curtain, looking like some enigmatic calligraphy of the gods, a message written with the slashing brush strokes of trunks and branches on a shifting silver paper.&quot;The lyrical quality of the writing meshes perfectly with the ambience of 17th century Japan. I lived in Japan for a couple of years and all I saw then, plus all I have read about the history of Japan, the plays I've seen, the novels and articles I've read, lead me to believe th! is is an exact historical rendering of the time. Not only that, it is done in a way that makes it accessible to all readers. In other words, it's a damn good story.Kaze, the main character, is beautifully drawn. As a samurai, he uses violence when necessary, but not unthinkingly, only when driven to it and never without compassion. He has a great sense of humor, superb intelligence and a wonderfully devious mind that he employs in forming strategy with which to beat his enemies. He is also possessed of great charm. Here he is describing himself to Jiro the charcoal seller. &quot;I no longer have a home. I'm a ronin, a 'wave man.' Like the waves of the ocean, I call no land home. Like water on rocks, I can't mix in and settle, I am always pulled back to flow to the next shore.&quot;There is a fairly large cast of very colorful characters, including Jiro, the charcoal seller, Hachiro, a scared boy, Aoi a prostitute, Manase, the district Lord who is also a skilled Noh dancer; and a marvelous elderly woman who wears a white head band that has the kanji character for &quot;revenge&quot;painted on it. She also wears hakama pants and a traveling coat just like a man. &quot;Stuck into her sash were a man's swords and she strode into the room with all the power and arrogance of any real samurai.&quot; All of the characters are meticulously drawn and memorable.Death at the Crossroads is the first of a Trilogy. I'm already impatient to read Kaze's next adventure."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"This is a new series for Furutani. It features ronin Matsuyama Kaze, a freelance samurai, in 1603 Japan. Kaze is on a quest to find the child of his former master. He is following one small lead after another with dwindling hope of finding the child he has been looking for during the proceeding two years. On his way to his next destination, he comes across a charcoal gatherer who is examining the dead body of a merchant. In spite of himself, Kaze stays around to see what happens and finds himself embroiled in the small town's politics and rivalries as he attempts to unravel the mystery of who killed the merchant and why.Furutani's writing is lyrical and the reader finds himself enveloped in a cadence that transports the reader to medieval Japan. Like all first books in series, this one must not only develop the character's personality, but provide us with a mystery and a story as well. The latter is no mean feat in and of itself, but Furutani accomplishes the task with ease. Furutani does not set flaunt his research by using every bit of minutiae he picked up, but, rather, he uses it subtly to advance his story and, in the process, educate his readers. For those who, like myself, do not care for Furutani's previous books, be rest assured that the writing here as well as the characters are a very welcome change. The uniqueness of the setting adds to quality of this book."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"Writing with the longtime eloquence of an established prose-writer, Dale Furutani paints a sweeping, grandiose picture of Japan in the beginning of an oppressive (somewhat backward and yet modernistic) era-The Tokugawa Shogunate- in 1603.The hero of the novel, a ronin (a samurai sans a master), stumbles across a corpse on a misty mountain pass. In the course of his adventure, Kaze (the ronin), discovers a remarkable collection of characters that Dame Agatha Christie herself would be hard to match. The cast ranges from Aoi, the luckless prostitute, to the ultra-refined Lord Manase (who insists on living life as in Heian period Japan, a period six HUNDRED years ago! ), to the greedy and ambitious Lord Nagato. We also meet the humble Jiro and the somewhat noble Hachiro and Ichiro, while facing the aggravating, and shortlived Boss Kuemon.A captivating yarn, with a little too much blood for the elegant story, nonetheless fails to disappoint. Get a copy today!I can hardly wait for the next two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"The first volume in the Matsuyama Kaze trilogy (followed by Jade Palace Vendetta and Kill the Shogun) transports the reader to Japan in 1603, the first year in the long reign of the Tokugawa Shogunate. When the army of Emperor Hidyoshi was defeated at Battle of Sekigahara, hundreds of lords were killed, leading to thousands of samurai becoming masterless warriors, ie. ronin. Matsuyama Kaze is one of these, wanted by Japan's new rulers, he wanders the country under an assumed name on a quest to find and rescue his former lord's young daughter. The book and mystery begins with Kaze discovering a rural charcoal-seller standing over a dead merchant lying at a crossroad. The peasant is soon named as the murderer by the local authorities, who don't seem too concerned with the truth of the matter, and Kaze comes to his defense. For, Kaze is one of the few samurai who feel that peasant's aren't necessarily subhumans, and that justice is worth expending energy on.The mystery is fairly simple, and most readers will and unraveled all the connections well ahead of Kaze, but the book is pleasurable nonetheless. First, unlike so many mysteries, it's a pleasantly compact tale, easily digested in a single night's reading. Secondly, the cast of characters is small and vivid. There's the stoic charcoal-seller, the village prostitute, a nasty bandit leader, and a weirdo lord who lives according to the customs of six hundred years previously in the Heian period. Finally, the most enjoyable element is Furutani's weaving of period detail throughout the book. Often, a ritual or object will lead to a brief tangential discussion of its development and use. These asides are not always subtle, but are fascinating slices of history and custom. On the whole, the book is reminiscent of a Kurasawa film, with a small story, small cast of regular people, and elegant delivery."},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"A very good story wrapped in a parable about feudal Japan. Interesting characters and a noble hero make this a very worthy read. I look forward to the next two title in this trilogy"},{"Title":"Death At The Crossroads","review":"Admit it, we're all told not to judge a book by it's cover but we still do it. I almost didn't buy this book and after just finishing it, I've come back to buy the other two books (love my Kindle) and I'm so grateful that I've found a decent trilogy to fill my week. The story is written in 2nd person (he did this, she said that) and I didn't notice any typo's. I never write spoilers, so if you're looking for juicy tidbits then go & read someone else's review.If (like me) you're a fan of historical fiction and you're running out of books set in British middle ages, this is definitely a great place to start expanding your interests. The style of writing is easy to follow despite the many Japanese terms and customs which are explained throughout. The plot centres around a masterless Samurai who has been charged with one last mission from his late Mistress. In search of his Mistress's missing daughter, he becomes a little distracted by a mystery that he's compelled to resolve.The story not only gives us a colourful glimpse into this ancient culture, it's also a quite sleuthy (not surprising after reading Furutani's \\"Sherlock Holmes in Japan\\" book - he's quite the talented writer). Furutani has got a brilliant style of story telling.... he's managed to share the backgrounds (and therefore the motives) of many of the major and minor characters in this book without becoming sidetracked by those stories.I'm completely satisfied that I got my money's worth. Colourful characters set in a fascinating culture (and time period) written by a great author.

She was only 23 at the time of her European trip, a willing, but not lighthearted soul.\\"The Coldest Winter\\" benefits from a reading of \\"Borrowed Finery,\\" the 2001 award-winning memoir of her childhood, now out in paperback. The impressions of a fairly impoverished American innocent, alone and quiet, though by no means meek, among the war worn people of London, Paris, Warsaw and Spain take on greater heft when you know the trauma and rootlessness of Fox's own childhood.The daughter of glamorous, feckless, disturbed parents, Fox had been left at a Manhattan foundling home days after her birth, \\"by my reluctant father, and by Elsie, my mother, panic-stricken and ungovernable in her haste to have done with me.\\" Her parents were Hollywood screenwriters and her father was an alcoholic of the impulsive type who might insist his daughter visit then leave her with friends - or forget to go the railway station to pick her up at all. Her mother remained consistently hostile and terrifying.There was, however, love in her life. Reverend Elwood Amos Corning, a Congregational minister in a poor, rural upstate community, took her in at five months old and provided unconditional love and safety. What he could not do, however, was protect the child from the erratic claims of her parents. Each week after the comforting ritual of his church service she would have a moment of panic.\\"My unquestioning trust in Uncle Elwood's love, and in the refuge he had provided for me...would abruptly collapse. In an instant I realized the precariousness of my circumstances. I felt the earth crumble beneath my feet. I tottered on the edge of an abyss. If I fell, I knew I would fall forever.\\"This happened too every Sunday after church. But it lasted no longer than in takes to describe it.\\"Eventually the day she dreaded arrived. After a horrific year in Malibu with her parents, from which she was rescued by Uncle Elwood, her Spanish grandmother, Elsie's mother, shows up to claim her once and for all. \\"She is of my blood,\\" Candeleria tells Elwood.\\"It was far worse than a fairy tale enchantment. My parting from the minister was an amputation.\\"Two of Elsie's four oddball brothers live with Candeleria. One of them is almost as terrifying as Elsie while the other is kind and playful. He lifts her out of the depression that has crept over her. But nothing can make her world safe again.\\"The Coldest Winter,\\" has a melancholy, almost desperate aura that readers who have not read the earlier memoir will find perplexing, having no way of knowing that Fox is running off to Europe to escape her New York life and the searing memories of a brief, brutal marriage and a sad pregnancy which ended with an instantly regretted adoption.Though Fox often conveys the impression of being an outsider looking on at the world, this feeling is especially pronounced in \\"The Coldest Winter.\\" In London she gets a job working for a publisher. One day a policeman knocks at her door, asking for her work permit, then takes her to the station to get one.\\"I had heard that one needed a work permit but had not taken the requirement seriously.

Enmeshed with these small, intense portraits is the bone-chilling cold of that winter, the glamour of hobnobbing with real journalists in smoky bars, and the general privation and destruction that prevailed throughout Europe in 1946.The author of six novels and the Newbery Award-winning author of many children's books, Fox's prose is as elegant as it is spare, conveying a haunting, sad beauty that remains with the reader long after the last page is turned.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"The Coldest Winter : A Stringer in Liberated Europe","review":"This is what a memoir should be. The ColdestWinter does not purport to be a history of the immediate post war countries that she visited but, rather, a story of herself, a frightened young woman with ambitions that she didn't understand and her struggle to reach up to a higher calling that was driving her. The writing is exquisite, this is as much about the cold that enveloped Europe that winter as it is about the people or the politics that lurched along uncertainly after the holocaust.

Many of the vignettes are profoundly moving."},{"Title":"The Coldest Winter : A Stringer in Liberated Europe","review":"This book is devoted to a trip the author took in the winter of 1946 to Europe, as a \\"stringer\\" for a news service. The American author went to London, Paris, Prague, Warsaw and Spain.I purchased this book in the hope of getting a feel for Europe immediately following the war. I had thought that the author's visit to Poland right when the Cold War was beginning might throw light on those turbulent times. If these are the kind of insights you seek, this book will not provide them.Many things bothered me about this book. Among them:- The first two chapters (about NY and London) are made up of little anecdotes in the nature of \\"chit chat.\\" In them the author tells us she met this or that person who has this or that job. The anecdotes don't paint a coherent picture nor do they seem to have any significance other than social snobbery.- The book is very short and therefore very laconic. It's telegraphic at times. Paris is covered in less than twenty pages (including three pictures and one out-of-town trip). Did the author really have so few impressions? The author went to Poland to cover the first elections after WWII, but she never tells us who stood for election, who won, what was going on politically and socially. She does tell us about sad, cold and poor people, who have suffered terribly, but it's very clich&eacute;d. Nothing like Frankl or Wisenthal.- In addition to not telling us very much beyond the obvious, the author does not engage in any moral reasoning that would seem to critical when visiting Europe a year after the end of the Holocaust. She never questions who are guilty or innocent, never discusses retribution. She is not interested in the fate of the Nazis and collaborators, nor does she even mention the beginning of the Cold War. I wondered as I was reading this book what the author actually learned in Europe, since so many central issues did not engage her. The author answers this in the end of the book. She says that the trip to Europe taught her how to see \\"beyond myself\\"-that is, how to be less selfish and self-engaged. I am sorry that this is the only lesson with which the author walked away. Other writers have been better able to draw real lessons from the Holocaust-lessons that engage in the moral, political and religious questions that are central to discussions of the Holocaust.- One part of the book that irked me particularly is an unbridled attack that the author launches at a women called Helen Grassner. Grassner was a Midwestern Jewish women sent to assist refugees (I could find no information about her in any other source). As Fox's descriptions make clear Grassner was rather out of her element in Europe, tormented by sorrow and bewilderment. Why this so irritated the author I am not certain, nor can I make sense of why Fox spent so many pages (of her very short book) lambasting this poor soul.I don't recommend this book, which seems to me to be a sad miss without any meaningful information or insight. Had the author not already been a published entity, I doubt this book would have been printed. If you are interested in learning about post-war Europe, you might consider reading Joseph Kanon's \\"The Good German,\\" which is a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Coldest Winter : A Stringer in Liberated Europe","review":"The Coldest Winter is one of Paula Fox's earliest books, and I had meant to read it years ago. It is a memoir of a year spent traveling through Europe when she was twenty-two. The year was 1946. World War II had ended just a year earlier, and much of Europe still showed the ravages of war--heaps of rubble, food rationing and other shortages, a somber and depressed citizenry wherever she went, a gray sky and freezing cold weather to match the mood of the people. She visited London, Paris, Warsaw, Barcelona, Madrid and many smaller villages in the surrounding countryside.When I first read about this memoir, I knew I wanted to read it. I, too, had wanted to travel through Europe as a young girl, so I was eager to read what happened to her as she ventured forth into unpredictable, precarious situations without itinerary or plans, living each day as it comes, willing to be a stranger in a strange country with few, if any, acquaintances and little knowledge of its laws, traditions and customs.I was born in Germany. Though I came to the States at a young age, I often wondered how my life might have been had my family been able to remain in Europe. I often dreamed of returning, to make a trip as Fox had done, to see if perhaps I might feel more at home there than in my adopted country, and might even prefer to live there. I identified with the author and read her stories, her many impressions and observations as though they were my own.Fox had little money for her trip. I also would have had limited funds. She stayed with friends of her parents or distant relatives, took what jobs she could find such as reading scripts for small sums or writing a few articles for a small British news service. I turned every page, wondering what would happen next to this wandering young woman.In her inimitable writing style, Fox relates a somewhat harrowing experience in London one afternoon when she was in her small room reading a manuscript.There was a sharp knock on the front door. I looked through the mail slot, and saw dark cloth. I opened the door with my gut clenched. A bobby towered over me, or maybe it was only his helmet that made it seem so. He touched it with two fingers, addressed me as miss, and asked me if I held a work permit. I shook my head no. He said I'd need to come to the police station with him.Once there, I filled out a form that required me to swear not to take employment that a British citizen could do and, further, to work only at part-time jobs. I had heard that one needed a work permit but had not taken the requirement seriously. Perhaps it was myself I did not take seriously. For a moment I grasped at the shadowy nature of reality; of how one moves through it like a mist, forever thinking of what comes next and how impalpable the present is.I made my way back to my apartment chastened.I held the work permit in my hand, consoled by its meaning: The government protected its citizens and took my presence in England seriously.This bittersweet little story seemed rather typical of how I think about the British people: somewhat severe but with a civility we don't always find in this country. And again, Fox's description of a bleak Paris is as vivid as a picture postcard:A year and a half after the end of the war and the German occupation, Paris was muted and looked bruised and forlorn. Everywhere I went, I sensed the tracks of the wolf that had tried to devour the city. But Paris proved inedible, as it had been ever since its tribal beginnings on an island in the Seine, the le de la Cit&eacute;.I stood on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, down which the black-booted Nazis had marched, some with reverence and cultural piety, I had heard, some triumphant, some astonished that they should be in command of the City of Light. But there was little brightness in 1946, except a sunset on a fair day when the last of the sun's rays struck the roof of Sacr&eacute;-Caeur and the flying buttresses of Notre-Dame and the spindle top of the Eiffel Tower; except in the bright scarves of the Frenchwomen who walk swiftly and inscouciantly as they went about their daily tasks and errands to the baker, the grocer, the butcher, and the open markets that had begun that year to display their wares. Perhaps the women were hoping to find their former lives among the stalls. But though there was no bomb damage, as there had been in London, the old life of Paris was gone.In another chapter one colorful sentence told me the bitter cold she experienced in Warsaw: \\"Cigarette smoke, strong drink, and conversation in a dozen languages sent you off to your narrow room with an illusion of warmth that lasted until you slid between sheets that were like frozen lead.\\"Almost every page of this memoir conveys a kind of sternness in people everywhere, with sour expressions on the faces of waitresses, chambermaids, and the people she met on trains and in shops. The author seemed to be describing a general attitude of pessimism, a kind of bureaucratic rigidity and indifference suspended like a heavy cloud over the lives of war-torn Europe. Nevertheless, when her journey ends, Fox is not happy to be going home. A part of her would like to hold on to her European year. Returning to New York brings up questions of \\"What now?\\" She has no clear idea of how to start her new life, how to find a new direction.Once home, she works with difficult adolescent boys who have experienced the worst forms of abuse. One day, she takes them to view the stars and constellations through a special telescope belonging to Columbia University. She hopes by viewing something larger than themselves, their perspective might shift, and that they might view their own tragic lives with greater objectivity, less anger, as her experience amidst the devastation of Europe had \\"...shown me something beyond my own life, freeing me from chains I hadn't known were holding me, showing me something other than myself.\\"Reading The Coldest Winter shifted my own perspective as well. It helped me to realize that I am a true American, a grateful American who believes that Europe is a great place to visit.

By page-count, the 3000-line poem occupies about 100 pages while the critical essays at the back take up about 150, and there is a preface as well. Whether this preface is from the pen of the editor Erik Gray or is by the previous Norton editor Robert H Ross I'm not fully clear, but I don't suppose it matters. For present purposes I am considering this introduction together with the appended essays.The great and good of lit crit are out in force here. There is Andrew Bradley, there is T S Eliot, there is Basil Willey and there is Christopher Ricks to mention only four of the twelve essayists excluding Hallam Lord Tennyson, son of the poet himself. I myself have a rather low tolerance of literary criticism, much of which candidly seems to me neither here nor there, indeed at times a bit of a self-perpetuating racket. What I look for in it is genuine illumination, and I flogged through the contributions here dutifully if listlessly in search of that. Failing illumination I will settle for good sense, and the main instances of that here are two remarks of the poet's own, to the effect that this is a poem not a treatise, poetry not philosophy or biography. Poetry, said Housman, is 'a tone of voice, a way of saying things'. Earnest analysis of the religious and agnostic elements in the poet's mind is not literary criticism at all, but biography. It is using the poem to illustrate the poet. When this is extended into the further question, as Eliot once allowed himself to extend it, of the relative merits of firm Christian faith vis-&agrave;-vis agnosticism, it is simply extraneous philosophy and nothing to do with Tennyson or with his poem at all.Roughly speaking, the more recent critics keep this basic point in mind better than the earlier do, although often alluding to one another as they go along. The quality of the various contributions does not of course depend on the extent to which they are literary criticism in the proper sense. I genuinely do find illumination here and there along the way, mainly but not entirely in the pieces that seem most relevant to the poem. I found T S Eliot very helpful in his contribution on the dry and academic-seeming issue of the versification, because to me this is not dry but accounts for the extraordinary effectiveness of this great poem to a major extent. To be able to keep a poem of 3000 short tetrameter lines going in their monotonous rhyme-scheme without fatiguing the ear is a phenomenal achievement, and I'm not sure which other English poet could have matched it. Swinburne's anapaests usually have me exhausted after a page and a half, but I can read In Memoriam from end to end at one sitting and finish up not only fresh but elated at its sheer skill and adroitness. On the other hand, Bradley hacks away at the 'structure' of the poem with a determination that leaves me cold. To me, In Memoriam has shape but not structure, in the way a cloud-mass has that. The poet's musings drift through his successive moods as the random thoughts occur to him: Bradley's pedantry would be better suited to some manual.Perhaps the best essay, at least in the sense of covering the most ground, is by Ricks. However one that is particularly interesting is by Jeff Nunokawa, exploring possible homoerotic elements in the expression. He is very nimble-footed in his approach, wisely not over-committing himself and of course understanding clearly that some of the more amorous-sounding expressions are largely literary convention with a pedigree going back millennia. Tennyson's poetry, to me, doesn't usually convey much erotic impression of any kind, and I sense something else entirely here. What I sense is mental and emotional liberation - after his ghastly upbringing I suspect that Tennyson found in Hallam a window into a better and more beautiful world, and that eroticism may have had very little to do with it. Another aspect that needs and receives consideration from the essayists is the epilogue to the poem, and here again I wonder whether something has been missed. This epilogue is completely at variance with the rest of the great poem in tone and sentiment, and attempts to link it with the frequent expressions of aspiration to a better world earlier in the work, while fair up to a point, seem to me to miss the main point. Go back to old Chaucer and the epilogue to his own great Troilus and Criseyde. There also the poet goes off at a tangent, and I think for the same reason. There is an abstract aspect to poetry just as there is to music, and the soul of literature itself finally trumps all the mundane considerations of beliefs, passions, theories and personal relationships.I don't suppose I would dare award this production less than the highest rating, but I wouldn't be right to either. My own reservations are mainly subjective, and what does not convince me often has for others the aspect of great and prevalent truth. As a passionate lover of the great English language and its incomparable literature I shunned like the pestilence academic courses in \`English'. That is precisely the market this edition is aimed at, it has everything and everyone it should have basically, and the 100 pages of the book that matter to me are beyond the reach of all of them."},{"Title":"In memoriam,","review":"In Memoriam may be Tennyson's greatest achievement and is one of the greatest English poems as well as one of the top modern epics. It was inspired by the death of his close friend Arthur Hallam; perhaps his life's central event, this plunged him into depression and made him question many pre-conceived notions. Written and revised as he moved through various grief stages, In Memoriam is his attempt to deal with the struggle - and, if possible - answer the ensuing questions. It is thus in large part a warm, loving tribute that will touch anyone who has suffered such a loss. Queen Victoria was famously comforted by it after Albert's death, inviting Tennyson to see her and eventually making him Poet Laureate. Many others have doubtless felt similarly, and the poem is highly recommended for anyone mourning. Yet In Memoriam is far more than a simple tribute. Tennyson rises to the very height of his near-unparalleled poetic powers, launching a deep meditation on life, mortality, love, friendship, associated theological issues, and more. He essentially uses the death as a pivot for exploring a wide range issues - everything from theodicy to geology. Profoundly emotional, the work moves us as few can and is often black with grief. However, the conclusion is optimistic, even triumphant, basking in traditional Christian-dominated mid-Victorian thought. Later history sadly made such things seem obsolete, even nave, but it is almost impossible not to be impressed by the fervency and honesty, and the poem still manages to touch and solace even if it will never again convince. The form is also notable. Tennyson is known for meter mastery and creative rhymes but here sticks to a simple format that became so famous and influential it is known as the \\"In Memoriam stanza.\\" He manages to make great, multi-pronged use of it, at one point achieving a hypnotic effect, at another rising to sublime lyricism, and at yet another waxing philosophical or theological. His range within such narrow limits is truly impressive. This is simply an essential poem for anyone interested in Tennyson, Victorian literature, or English poetry. It is well worth reading alone, but the fact that many - perhaps most - Tennyson anthologies have it in full makes a standalone hard to justify. The important thing at any rate is to read it in some form."},{"Title":"In memoriam,","review":"Poems are always divided into lines and often into stanzas. Kindle has not been programed to recognize that basic fact. In this case, the spacing is a mess. What's more, the links between the text and the annotations don't appear in any useful form.The sloppiness of ports to Kindle are annoying in prose works. They ruin the experience of reading a poem."},{"Title":"In memoriam,","review":"This book just recently showed up at my house from a second-hand dealer, and I am already in love with it. It was published by the Folio Society in 1975 -- 32 years ago -- yet my copy seems almost new. The binding, typesetting, and editing are all first-rate.They say that Queen Victoria kept two books for bedtime reading -- the Bible and \\"In Memoriam.\\" I think she would have been delighted to have this edition.So much for the physical presentation. The poem itself is a masterpiece, composed on and off over 18 years, as Tennyson tried to reconcile himself to the death of his best friend, Arthur Hallam, a brilliant man who had just become engaged to Tennyson's sister, when a sudden stroke put his light out forever at the age of 31 or 32. Literally full of life one minute, and a lifeless corpse the next.This unspeakable tragedy caused great philosophical and religious problems for Tennyson, which are all set down here in immortal verse.Highest possible recommendation!"},{"Title":"In memoriam,","review":"In Memoriam has always been one of my favorite poetic works.

The Martins are on their way to the country mansion of Peter's partner George Brodie and his wife, Ellen, for the July long weekend. But there are complications. Jillian's mousy, apologetic older sister, Shauna, turns up unexpectedly at the Martins' apartment. Peter insists on taking her along and Jillian wants to leave her behind. We gather this is only the tip of the iceberg in the tensions building between the couple. Over at the Brodies, the weekend is shaping up to be far more than what George, and especially Ellen, had bargained for. Their guest list keeps expanding. It was to include only his law partners and their wives; their son Kendall; and Lorry, a distant relative of Ellen's, whom she hopes to match up with Kendall. But other guests keep turning up, some savory, some unsavory. As the weekend begins, there's lots of action and interaction among the ill-assorted group of weekenders, including the beginnings of unexpected romantic attachments. Events increasingly reveal the shallowness of the self-centred Jillian, which contrasts sharply with Lorry's depth and sincerity. By the end of Part I, there's a body in the Brodies' lovely Japanese garden. The rest of the book, in the best Agatha Christie tradition, keeps the reader guessing about which of the assembled weekenders tightened the noose around the victim's neck. I have only one small quibble. Part II starts slowly, with what I found to be too much detail about Detective Inspector Paul Manziuk and his partner, Jacqueline Ryan, who's been promoted because she's black and a woman--and who's out to prove she can be as good a cop as any in the department. It's well worth persisting through this slow patch because the rest of the book is riveting. I didn't guess &quot;who done it&quot; until Lindquist was good and ready to tell me near the end of the book."},{"Title":"Shaded Light (Manziuk and Ryan Mystery Series #1)","review":"When Ontario police detective Paul Manziuk meets his new partner, Jacqueline Ryan, he doesn't know what to expect. She's black minority, and he's white. She's vivacious, he's reserved. She's been recently promoted; he is a twenty-nine year homicide detective with an attitude. Lindquist's debut cozy mystery marries this unlikely duo into a fascinating, challenging partnership. Their first case begins at an upscale estate in the London suburbs where a guest's wife is found strangled. It's not the weekend party the Brodies had planned.When George Brodie, senior partner in the law firm of Brodie, Fischer, and Martin invites the firm's law partners and their wives as weekend guests, all thoughts of his wife Ellen's matchmaking with their son and potential daughter-in-law are put on hold. Ellen doesn't mind entertaining, but she prefers dinner guests, not weekend guests. To complicate matters, Bart Brodie the black sheep nephew arrives unexpectedly. Although the guests appear congenial, sharp words and dark looks often accompany initial greetings, particularly with Jillian, wife of partner, Peter Fischer. Jillian is bold, beautiful and sassy, which is part of her appeal, but underneath she's ruthless, demanding and calculating, which sets the stage for her murder.Twelve house guests and two housekeepers are drawn into a thick web of lies, murder, and deceit where everyone lies, no one is safe, and everyone is a suspect. When a second body is discovered, the secret relationships that flow beneath the polished smiles, fashionable dress, and genteel manners begin to surface, along with a simmering hatred and potent fear as everyone wonders who will be next. Shaded Light provides dry humor, some romance, and lots of modern forensics as Manziuk and Ryan follow the clues and close in on the murderer.N.J. Lindquist, award-winning author, speaker and teacher writes in the style of Agatha Christie. Her debut mystery showcases her English and psychology background to reveal an intricate, finely tuned plot filled with excellent characterizations, in-depth motivations, and complex storylines. Formerly known for her teen novels, the Best of Friends series, this establishes Lindquist as a mystery writer to watch. Glitter of Diamonds, second in the Manziuk and Ryan, is already in hardback with trade paperback scheduled in October 2007."},{"Title":"Shaded Light (Manziuk and Ryan Mystery Series #1)","review":"a mystery that captures your attention with its integrity.

Another error (in the grooming section) states that &quot;Like the Greyhound, the Whippet's narrow chest cavity can make them vulnerable to illness or even death if the chemicals are too strong&quot; It is true that whippets are chemically sensitive, but it has to do with body fat ratios and metabolism, NOT deepness of chest...

Though written in rhyming verse, the story does not confine itself to the 6-year-old mentality. Even more amazing are the illustrations, rendered in black and white, which really bring this book to life. Gagne truly has a style all his own and I expect him to become a major writer/illustrator.

I would highly recomend this book to anyone who is remotely interested in any field of art. You will learn something. I even felt that the author was more interested in telling the story through design that through simple imagery. If you took out the words to this book, you could still understand the story. I hope the author continues with more books like these."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"The Enemy Stars is Poul Anderson at his best except for the title. When it first appeared in Astounding Magazine, the title was We Have Fed Our Seas. It's a quote from Kipling that will make your hair stand on end when you read it in the context of the story. I can't explain it here without spoiling the plot for the quote gives the theme. Briefly, the story begins by introducing four men from utterly different backgrounds who are going to spend a few weeks doing research manning a space ship. The idea here is utterly fascinating. The space ship carries a matter transmitter that lets people move easily into space. People come and go routinely--and then something goes horribly wrong. The rest of the novel is the four men struggling to cope and find a way out of a hopeless situation."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"Poul Anderson, who passed away in 2001, was one of the true super luminaries in the field of science fiction, and it is unfortunate indeed that much of his writing, amounting to more than one hundred books, is hard to find and thus eroding from collective science fiction memory. The Enemy Stars is one of his earlier novels and serves as a wonderful way for readers to introduce or reintroduce themselves to this science fiction legend. This rather short novel first appeared in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction with the title We Have Fed Our Seas in August and September 1958. The title was changed, for reasons I certainly don't understand, to The Enemy Stars, and the book was nominated for a Hugo award for best science fiction novel of 1959. In 1979, Anderson went back and slightly revised the novel, principally updating the hard science fiction aspects of the tale based on the knowledge gained over the course of the twenty years since the book was written.I can't say I was blown away by this novel, although it is certainly a good read. In my opinion, it is too short; it took me a while to get really acquainted with each of the characters, and by that time there was too little insight left to share before the rapidly approaching ending. There are some wonderful ideas wrapped into this narrative, but I didn't feel as if enough of them were given the time and care to make them truly flourish. The historical context of the drama also wasn't exploited as much as I would have liked. Basically, at some time in the future, Earth and its colonial satellites and planets maintain a tough alliance, with suspicion and dislike seemingly bred into the respective settlers. The government is some type of one-world entity called the Protectorate, but we don't learn much about the system beyond the fact that many men oppose it both philosophically and practically. In this world, a spaceship exists far out in space, a ship launched by a country that no longer exists. Scientists can effectively &quot;beam up&quot; to the ship across vast distances in space, and four very different men do so in order to study a newly discovered dark star. Naturally, something goes wrong, and the foursome must look death in the face and work together in order to survive. Any truths we learn from the novel come out over the course of this life and death drama in space.The Enemy Stars didn't really provide the level of philosophical revelation I half expected at the end, and certain parts of the story (especially that concerning Earth's government) never got the attention they seemed to deserve, yet this was still an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. The science is definitely of the hard science fiction variety, yet the human element takes its rightful place at the core of the novel. Man's infinite search for truth, for a reason for being, is what Anderson approaches via The Enemy Stars, and while he might not have put a spotlight on the true answer of existence, he does manage to sweep his flashlight of imagination over some important and meaningful aspects of that ultimate answer."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"The premise of this sci fi novel is interesting enough: four men are sent out to investigate the discovery of a dead star. They arrive on the ship by means of a matter transmitter (like a teleporting device) because the ship is already so deep into space. Now you know that tragedy will eventually strike, but it's difficult to get around the science to the real reason for the accident. Occasionally Pohl gets too deep into scientific statistics, but then again, some people enjoy that realism. I, however, don't. The flat characters add little to the book. There are lots of conversations between them after the accident, but these are not deep characters; you understand most of them pretty quickly after they are introduced. Although there is a nice dose of suspense, the lack of any interesting plot or characters made this a book I wished I hadn't spent any time on even though I finished in two days. Science fiction fans should look elsewhere for excitement."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"Rear cover: \`The black star was not part of Creation. It was a fossil sun, left over from a Universe that had died before this one was born, circled by an iron tomb than had once been a planet. When the black star called, four men went to the galaxy's edge. Only one came back. But he did not come back alone...'Honestly, that summarizes 90% of the book. There is little left out of the synopsis so that there aren't many surprises for the reader. Even the end tag to the synopsis points to an obvious climax. Being only 152 pages, it's a quick read as many of Anderson's tend to be. His idea of an ancient burnt out core of a star resonates with another one of his novels Mirkheim where humans and aliens politically negotiate over the remnants of a supernova blasts planet. Likewise here in Enemy Stars, the black core of an ancient supernova has stripped the surrounding planets to their respective nuclei.What isn't mentioned in the summary is the four \`spacemen' who are willing to \`mattercasted' to the far-flung starship en route of being diverted to this new found astronomical relic. Once near the star, the ship is disabled by the stars bizarre properties and its' mattercaster is ruined. With limited resources, the dwindling space posse must somehow repair the ship to produce thrust AND create a new mattercaster from scratch. However implausible the construction may be, all items are easy to reproduce except for the 4 kilograms of germanium, which must be sought after elsewhere.As mentioned in the overview, only one man makes it back to earth. What sacrifices did he have to suffer? Each man had their own motivation for self-sacrifice for the greater good of the crew. Though Anderson says that he thinks this is one of his better stories (revised in 1979 from the 1958 edition) I think many of other Anderson's novels can trump this (i.e. Tau Zero, Brain Wave, Star Fox and Planet of No Return)."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"\\"The Enemy Stars\\" by Poul Anderson, 1958, new material 1979.This is a sad story of four men who try to study the stars from up close.

They make some choices and have to adapt and persevere because the choices put them in danger.The fellows are a disparate lot, one rich, one poor, but educated, one ornery and mad, and one sad and reconciled to his fate. These four come together and find out how to live and work together, which is just the first challenge they have.They try to approach the dead star they are studying and it damages the ship.

But upon arrival, the four man expedition finds itself trapped. Their only hope is to build a matter transfer device that will get them back to the nearest receiving station, from which they can be transferred home. They must work together in dangerous conditison to succeed. Not only does the attempt succeed, but the survivors don't come back alone. Nice, quick reading story.Poul Anderson is one of the old grand masters of the science fiction universe. He has updated some of the science without extensively rewriting the 1958 manuscript for the 1979 rerelease. The theme, as he points out in the prologue, remains as true as ever...we must establish humans in space to ensure our long-term survival, if only to avoid the possibility that earthbound humans may find a way to topple civilization. There's no guarantee the survivors could climb back...we've used up too many of the easily accessible resources to get where we are.With the final Space Shuttle launch past, it's difficult to see how the United States, which stepped back from space exploration after the Apollo missions, will ever get the motivation to get things going again. Private enterprise seems to be filling the vaccuum to some degree, assuming the beaurocracy doesn't hobble the effort.Humans may again land on the moon and establish a permanent or semi-permanent base (in the sense that the International Space Station is semi-permanent), but unfortuantely, there may not be an American accent among them. That would be a crime. But our politicians only look one election ahead and most people simply don't see the big prize...they don't grasp the benefits they already have acquired from space exploration, much less the limitless benefits an opening of the Solar System could mean to us.I always did find Captain Kirk's pronouncement of \\"Space, the final frontier\\" to be amazingly superficial. Makes it sound like Alaska on a Sunday night.Everything is out there."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"This one was never in our public library, and since it was written in 1958, it was probably out of print in the paperback version when I started reading science fiction.I learned of its existence recently when I was reading a list of what Anderson regarded as his 5 best books. I knew the other four were wonderful, so it stood to reason a fifth one which I had never heard of was worth tracking down.Perhaps the reason this book wasn't more popular is on account of how the author began by introducing four very interesting characters as the crew of the Southern Cross, but then went on to put them all into a nearly impossible situation. The jacket of the hardcover version broadly hints that some of crewmen wouldn't be returning home, so my mood was quite downbeat at the beginning of this small book.All the dreaded tragedies do eventually happen, but the theme of the book is that the heroism of all concerned made the sacrifices worthwhile.For me it's a keeper."},{"Title":"The Enemy Stars","review":"A few minutes surfing the inter-webs reveals that this 1950s sci-fi work by Poul Anderson arouses some controversy. People looking for Anderson's pulp-infused sprawling space opera works of the period will be disappointed with the simplicity of the plot and the restrained horizons it explores. Readers looking for the social character pieces that crop up in the next decade will be disappointed with the occasionally pallid attempts to create sympathetic characters and moving emotional narrative arcs.For most of the novel a wonderful middle ground is reached between these two camps despite the work's rather hackneyed end (in my humble opinion) which weakens the general effect. Likewise, Anderson's desperate attempts to make us feel for his characters occasionally pushes the novel into the realm of melodrama sci-fi (a la the film version of On the Beach).That said, Anderson's retreat from grand space opera themes does afford at least valiant attempts to create well-rounded/believable characters. And for a 1950s work, he succeeds.... Likewise, the absence of a grand space opera plot means that Anderson focuses on the interactions of his characters in an unusual environment.Plot Summary (limited spoilers)The Southern Cross, a deep space exploration vehicle, is sent off to explore a burned out sun. Humans have discovered technology, as in Star Trek, to matter transport. When, the space ship reaches the sun, a crew is beamed onto the vessel to carry out scientific tasks. The exploration expedition is framed against a future society which spans stars. Each new colony is suppressed by the Protectorate -- tensions which are manifest in the crew. The crew of the expedition each has their own motivations, backgrounds, prejudices, and ulterior motives.Eventually a series of disasters strike the space craft preventing them from beaming back to earth. The crew attempt to solve the problem. In the course of these events, the facades break down between the characters, and the psychological problems of being stranded in space without a way home emerge. Poul Anderson balances the points of tension between characters and the suspense of repairing the space ship quite well. I will not give away the ending...Final ThoughtsDon't expect space opera. Expect a valiant attempt to create well-rounded characters... expect a plot which facilitates the unraveling the characters' prejudices and of course, the laborious finding of common ground... The general mystery of the surroundings is absent from the work. All in all, a worthwhile attempt at breaking from the pulp sci-fi restraints of the 60s. Sections do come of as melodramatic.

When it came to big ideas, he was unbeatable. His \\"Tau Zero\\" is on my top-10 SF list of all times, reread every couple of years. Now, in \\"Enemy Stars\\" there is an excellent idea, 4 spacemen marooned in a disaster stricken spaceship, trying to survive. The story is promising and the science is hard (I read the 1979 revised version) even though a few pages read like an air conditioner manual.So, Poul Anderson was indeed one of the think tanks of the genre. But, when it came to characters, he just... couldn't make it right. His heroes are so agonizingly predictable and clich&eacute;, they can almost give SF a bad name.His Japanese is annoyingly low key and always sorry. His Russian is pathetically vulgar and aggressive. His Anglo-Saxon is cocky. Had his crew included a Puerto Rican, he would be stealing fellow astronauts' wallets and if there was an Italian, he would be running the Galaxy's local arm Camorra branch. Not to mention his female characters (actually only one) where he becomes even more formulaic.Even though this trait is evident in every Poul Anderson work I\`ve read, in Enemy Stars it is so prominent that brings the novel down to two stars.

The ability to see a problem or a situation from your spouse's perspective is what makes Dr. Osborne's book so helpful. He uses anecdotes and scriptural references to help the reader see beneath the surface of our mate. Men and women are different and knowing how those differences affect our interpersonal communication leads to understanding. That, and the realization that marriage is about sacrifice and putting someone else's interest ahead of our own. There is no such thing as marriage being a 50/50 proposition, or even 60/40. Those kinds of expectations inevitably result in disappointment because our spouse rarely has the same expectations we do. Changing our own expectations and our own behavior first is what Dr. Osborne teaches will effect changes in our mate and ultimately our marriage. My first exposure to this book was 16 years ago when my wife handed it to me with the admonition, &quot;Read it or else.&quot; Naturally I followed her excellent advice and it saved our marriage. Since then I have used it as a tool to help others whose marriages are in difficulty. I keep several copies on the shelf to hand out as needed.

Osborne helps us understand the source of inter/personal conflict and strategies to resolve the cause, not just the effect - We cannot change another person directly. We can however change ourselves and give the other person room to respond in kind. The art of a successful Christian marriage is not wait for your spouse to serve your needs, but first to satisfy the needs of your spouse. If your spouse in return seeks to understand and answer your needs, both will be generously fulfilled. This book came into my life when it was most needed and I am grateful.

The Mars book was wonderful in the \\"Letter Writing\\" segment-that helps one vent appropriately. Yet, you can see I had to keep searching for more in a book.Dr. Osborne's book just speaks in terms that after years of marriage did shed light on my husband's perspective, and gave me a sensible voice. My voice as a woman does varies, but to think that we are so numb that we need only in a word and response as, \\"I understand and permission for him to enter the cave\\", goes much deeper. This book shed lights on all aspects of personalities, relationships trials-even death. I think that having a biblical spine helps to know that it is timeless and will surpass the changes in our days; and simply deals with why I wanted the book on the subject of marriage and relationship between male and female.

Osborne maintains (I am not far from quoting) that unless a woman gets married, gets pregnant, and has a bunch of kids she will never be satisfied. A woman's place is in the home, a man's is at the office, and apparently realizing this is supposed to let you and your mate in on your true identities and lead to blissful lives. Furthermore (and perhaps worse), Osborne insists on stereotyping males and females in ways that were very offensive to both me and my husband. Example: women like to fight to test whether their husband will dominate them, because in the end they like to be dominated. The further we read, the more disgusted we became. Unless you live on some other planet or possibly in some other time period, this book will only lead to MISunderstanding each other.

Both of them loved it! It's an art book, as well as an excellent guide."},{"Title":"The Art of Handpainting Photographs (Amphoto Crafts)","review":"\\"The Art of Handpainting Photographs\\" provides detailed instructions for handcoloring black-and-white photographs with Marshall's Photo Oils, which generally impart somewhat muted colors. Colored pencils are often used in conjunction with the oils. Author Cheryl Machat Dorskind briefly mentions other media that can be used in handcoloring photographs, but she does not discuss them. Although there is a chapter on landscapes, Dorskind is primarily a portrait artist, so this book's emphasis is portraiture.Chapter 1, \\"Selecting a Good Photographic Print\\" makes suggestions in how to best photograph for handpainting, including choosing appropriate film and photographic paper. This is the book's weakest chapter. The advice could be confusing to beginning or intermediate photographers. For example, it recommends bracketing exposures, but does not explain that, unless you tell the lab, they will try to print them all the same. And there is not much point in bracketing old chemistry black-and-white film by just one EV anyway. It's better to vary the exposure in printing. The author doesn't mention chromogenic black-and-white film at all, which is less expensive, easier for amateurs to obtain, and would be fine if printed on a fiber-based paper. Dorskind doesn't recommend T-grain films or high speed films, but doesn't explain why. Her suggestion of infrared film is interesting, however, as its characteristic white foliage (when used with a dark red filter) is well-suited to handpainting. A handy chart lists texture, tone and contrast for recommended fiber-based and resin-coated papers. The option of toning prints prior to handcoloring is mentioned, but no instructions are provided. Oddly, I have never seen a book on handcoloring photographs mention digital prints. Most ink jet prints are unsuitable as the ink will run, but I am curious as to how permanent inks and dye-sublimation prints fare. No answer is forthcoming. The information about papers for conventional printing is very good, though.Chapter 2, \\"Materials and the Work Station\\", explains supplies you will need and what conditions provide the best working environment for coloring photographs. Chapter 3 is dedicated to \\"Basic Color Theory\\". There are explanations of the color wheel, complementary colors, hue, value, intensity, color temperature and advice on how best to choose the most appropriate color to convey your intentions.Chapter 4 discusses the five steps involved in \\"Preparing Your Photograph for Color Application\\": Spotting the photograph (retouching spots and scratches), masking the border, making wood/cotton skewers, arranging your color palette, and priming your photograph with Marshall's P.M. Solution.Chapter 5 provides a step-by-step explanation of \\"The Basic Painting Process\\". The example the author uses is a portrait. She explains how to mix colors, paint the photo, and use pencils on top of oil paints. These instructions are very good and would be invaluable if you are handcoloring a portrait, as there are specific suggestions for how to achieve the correct skin tone. Chapter 6, \\"More About Portraiture\\", provides further valuable advice to portraitists by explaining how to best paint red, blond, brown and gray hair. There is also some discussion of painting portrait backgrounds for various effects.Chapter 7, \\"Focusing on the Environment\\" is about handpainting landscapes. The author discusses color, tone, and composition in rural and urban landscapes, but there are no detailed instructions. Chapter 8, \\"Presenting Your Artwork\\" gives advice for how to store, mat, and frame your painted photographs. Chapter 9, \\"Special Assignments\\" mentions some specialized uses of handpainting, such as vintage photographs. There is a list of Resources in the back of the book."},{"Title":"The Art of Handpainting Photographs (Amphoto Crafts)","review":"This is a wonderful book for creating your own handpainted photographs.

Recently, I purchased this book, some Marshall paint, and some skewers. I have always wanted to paint but I knew I had no talent for drawing! I may not be able to draw but I can photograph and do darkroom printing. I am now (thanks to Cheryl Machat) painting everything I can photograph. Not only am I enjoying this as MY hobbie, I am once again photographing for my enjoyment not just for the public. My goal is to practice enough that someday I will no longer have to pay another artist for my painting but I will do it all myself in studio. With this book, I am on my way.

Illustrations are quite much detailed. In fact, following only the pictures, you already have a rough idea of the method. Reading the whole text however, does not add much on top of it. The book doesn't cover different approaches and techniques and focuses on a particular method of the author. In this sense, if the name of the book was &quot;How do I handcolour my photographs using Marshall's Oils&quot; it would have been more appropriate. The guidelines given in the book might be useful for some beginners, however they are too much detailed.

This book is a necessary read for anyone desiring to produce quality plaster work, for it takes the reader through the broad scope of the trade while providing mountains of insightful detail. From raw material chemistry to essential tools, to the proper methods of finishing walls, ceilings, and decorative trimwork, the information is presented clearly, well illustrated, and in a manner that a common laborer with a reflective mind can absorb, retain, and apply. Specific difficulties and job-related uncertainties are developed, especially concerning the bonding properties of plasters to different materials. So much technical information, yet it is presented in a reader-friendly \\"field guide\\" manner.

The author gives a vivid and highly interesting account which is unmatched in other books."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Doesn't take long to read this one. Short on detail which is strange considering the importance of the mission and the training it would have taken. Probably one of the reasons there wasn't alot of detail is because many of the men who captured Pegasus were subsequently wasted away in front line combat shortly after the mission so there goes the eye witness testimony. Still a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"I found this to be an excellent book. It was both informative and engaging; something we've come to expect from Stephen Ambrose. I am not an historian, but I have seen and read many interviews with the principle figures in the book.

In short, if you like history, France, England, Ambrose, or engaging stories you will like this book."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"I have been an Ambrose fan for many years and this book, while not as well known as \\"Band of Brothers\\" is equally compelling. This is an impeccably detailed account of one of the most daring feats of the Normandy invasion, written in the author's typical easy to read style. We are rivited in place on a glider drifting in through the flack as the pilot frantically searches for a landing. Then we are clawing our way through the night and charging onto a bridge deep in enemy territory.

One of the great rarely-told stories of D-Day. Very easy read, great maps and photos. Once started, can not be put down!"},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Stephen Ambrose has done a remarkable job in giving the reader a front row seat to the fighting at Pegasus Bridge. His writing takes you right to the action and flows over into the heat of battle as if you were there at the time of the attack.He vividy describes the training leading up to the assault on bridge in such detail that you may need to set aside the book to rest, and catch your breath from the rigors of the last double time march.Even though this aspect of the invasion (Pegasus Bridge) encompasses such a small area, the high level of detailed research lends itself to a wonderful account of the early morning hours of 6 June 1944.This book is very easy to read and is a must for those intrigued by the battle that took place at this simple stone bridge over the Caen Canal in the Norman countryside."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Having been stationed in Germany for three years I was fortunate enough to travel to many of the WWII battlegrounds that exist in Europe and the beaches that made up Operation Overlord is one trip that I will never forget. Before making the trip I read \\"Citizen Soldier,\\" \\"D-Day\\" and \\"Pegasus Bridge\\" all written by Stephen Ambrose. I carried \\"D-Day\\" and \\"Pegasus Bridge\\" with me during my trip to use as a reference as I visited 4 of the 5 beaches involved in the D-Day invasion.\\"Pegasus Bridge\\" is the story of the men from D company from the Ox and Bucks Light Infantry Regiment of the British 6th Airborne Division. Ambrose does a masterful job of relating the story of these men and tying to results of the battle to the overall operation of D-Day. Ambrose gives the background on the training of the men, personal insights of many of the men, and the man who held them all together Major John Howard.As good as Ambrose tells the story of D company nothing compares to actually standing on that bridge and the feeling that you get thinking that right here is where the D-Day invasion began! Ambrose has included some great photos and drawing of the gliders landing site. When you visit the bridge itself you will find markers indicating the locations of the first three gliders and it is only then you will realize what a magnificent job of piloting Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork did in landing the nose of his glider \\"to break through the barbed wire\\" as requested by Major Howard. Some the machine gun nest are still there beside the bridge and gives you an idea of what the men faced. The original bridge, replaced with a modern bridge, but thankfully was saved and is located nearby as part of a museum.\\"The first place liberated in France\\" is what the Gondr&eacute;e's caf&eacute; has as a label according to a plague affixed over the entrance to the caf&eacute;. If you do not go inside you will miss a stunning collection of \\"Pegasus\\" military memorabilia! If you are lucky, you might even meet Madam Gondr&eacute;e, who was a child at the time of the battle, and was still running the caf&eacute; at the time of my visit. She sat with friends and me and related a few stories concerning the story of the bridge and their current fight with the local government to preserve the caf&eacute; and other local building from a campaign to broaden the canal.As I walk around outside the caf&eacute; and bridge site, I used Ambrose's book to take me through the battle almost moment by moment. I could almost hear Lt. Brotheridge's Sten gun rattle off as he killed one of the two guards on the bridge that night and sadly wonder if he knew what he and his men accomplished that night as he lay dying only moments after engaging the Germans.If have any interest in the D-Day invasion then you cannot go wrong with this book. Ambrose does a wonderful job in presenting the story. The book is easy to read; I finished it in two days, yet does not insult your intelligence. If you do visit the Normandy region make sure you block out at least half a day to visit the bridge and Madam Gondr&eacute;e's caf&eacute; you will not be disappointed. Ste.-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise is another place not to miss, but that is another story."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"If you've seen &quot;The Longest Day&quot; you may recall the scene in which a small band of glider-borne commandos seizes a bridge and defends it until relieved by Lord Lovett and his commandos. What you may not know is that this was a singular event- the very first combat engagement of D-Day and the first and only use of this technique by the Allies in the war.Ambrose is one of the best contemporary historians to write about World War 2, always managing to be both accurate and entertaining. Here, he gives us profiles of the men involved on both sides of the battle, the development of the glider assault technique, a detailed minute-by-minute account of the fighting, and the story of the aftermath of the battle and the lives of the men (and women) after the war, up to the 50th Anneversary D-Day ceremonies in France.If you're a history buff, this book is a must-have for your library. If you're interested in a more accurate verison of the details surrounding the battle than the movie presented, read the book. And if you simply want to understand a little better how ordinary men can acheive the extraordinary when called on to do so, read this book."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Stephen Ambrose states in &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot; that as an honorary member of D Company Ox and Bucks and of E company,506,101st,he has both his flanks covered. Indeed so. &quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot; should probably be read in conjunction with &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; although it is much more the story of a single action on a single night than the odyssey that is the record of Easy Co. Ambrose writes vividly of the night of the 5th June ,his style ideally suited to his subject. One feels the elation ,the fear ,the shock of the combatants as the events unfold.The death of Den Brotheridge ,the key destruction of a mk4 Panzer and later a patrol boat by men armed with only the erratic and makeshift PIAT,the discordantly amusing destruction of a German OP situated on a water tower by means of a captured AT gun, all clearly recreated in the mind of the reader by the concise prose and carefully chosen eyewitness accounts. There are some minor gripes.Most non-American readers will feel that Ambrose has more understanding of the pysche and motivations of G.Is than of Tommies, but this is understandable. While wholeheartedly agreeing with his assessment of the Sten and PIAT as erratic and alarming weapons to use, he errs when describing the Bren in like terms as inferior to the German equivalents. These are not major issues. &quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;, with &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, stands as a wonderful read and a fitting tribute to the young men of 1944 who gave so much for freedom."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"As a military officer I have had the great good fortune to meet the author and two of the protagonists in this account of a pivotal moment in the opening of the Battle of Normandy as well as being fortunate enough to travel to the site of most of the action. While Ambrose captures some of the exuberant personality of Maj John Howard, he most certainly excelled at recounting the herculean efforts leading up to the event -- the training, the organization, the bureaucracy -- and leading the reader through the night of hell endured by the troops on both sides as well as the terrified, suspicious, yet grateful civilians caught in the middle.What I liked most about the book (being an avid WWII history buff) is the immediacy of Ambrose's writing. When I traveled to Caen and saw the bridge's modern replacement and the adjacent glider landing fields where &quot;Rommel's Asparagus&quot; had been &quot;planted&quot; I knew instantly where I was and where the actions took place. I could easily trace from memory what had happened, to whom, and where. Ambrose has the capacity to make his spare prose come alive and cause the reader to see the panzers lumbering into the targeted intersection, only to be knocked out by a man's phenomenally skillful use of a woefully inaccurate weapon. It's all there in this small, rather inconspicuous book.I highly recommend this book for anyone who may be interested in learning some detail about what happened in one small area of the Norman countryside shortly after midnite, in the wee hours of the 6th of June, 1944. I might also recommend viewing a representation of Maj John Howard's exploits as a part of the movie, &quot;The Longest Day.&quot; For those who have seen that film, this book will provide wonderful detail for enhancing their comprehension of the stunning complexity of the invasion by illustrating this one tiny piece of the invasion scenario."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Hats off to Capt. John Howard and D Company of Britain's &quot;Ox and Bucks&quot; regiment. As the first Allied unit to land in France on D-Day, these glider borne men had the job of capturing two bridges that would help secure the flank of Operation Overlord.Stephen Ambrose makes a good case that had these men failed, the German panzers may have had the opportunity to crush first the British 6th Airborne Division and then roll up the invasion beaches. We'll never know, because these men did not fail. Silently landing within yards of their target, they quickly secured the Caen Canal Bridge and an adjacent span fifty yards away over the Orne River. Both had been wired for demolition and were guarded (although not by boys from the Fatherland but forced conscripts from occupied Eastern Europe the Germans had rounded up to fill their need for men). Howard's men literally stole the bridges in a manner of minutes with minimal fighting. They then established a perimiter to beat off any German counter-attack until they could be relieved by paratroopers who dropped shortly after D Company pulled off their coup de main. While waiting for relief, they faced a tank counter-attack. Holding only one Piat, a hand held anti-tank weapon that was not held in high regard by the troops, a sergeant nailed the lead tank at a distance of forty yards. This persuaded the rest of the German column to retreat and wait -- thinking that Howard's men possessed larger anti-tank weapons. Thus less than two hundred glider borne air troopers were able to attack, take and hold two critical bridges -- and right under the nose of a nearby enemy tank regiment.This is a delightful book that moves along at Ambrose's usual fast pace. He fills it with first hand accounts from British, German and French participants -- luckily many of the principals were alive when he wrote the book which gives it an unparralled directness and detail. Ambrose goes into the personalities of the principals and discusses the training and planning that went into making D Company a premeir fighting outfit. Capt. Howard deserves much of the credit for sharpening his unit into what must have been one of the most effective small units in the war. Over a period of almost two years, he put them through his own designed training regimen that earned for them the mission.This is a short book at less than two hundred pages (and oddly shaped -- I've never read a book as tall and skinny and am curious as to why it was published in these dimensions). Perfect if one has the hours to dive into and finish a good war story in one sitting."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"I'm a firm believer that no one can weave together a battle, invasion or engagement that took place in the European Theater quite like Stephen Ambrose. He has a knack for understanding the soldiers, getting inside their minds and allowing them to tell the tale for him. Pegasus Bridge is no different. It's a fascinating account of how one British unit seized the most critical objective in the wee hours just prior to D-Day. Much like Band of Brothers, Ambrose starts with the beginning of the unit -- how it was formed, its commanders, its training regiment and it soldiers -- transitions to the climax of seizing the bridge and holding it and finally flows into the denouement of D-Day plus one. I highly recommend this book as well as Ambrose's other works on the subject of WWII. As a twentysomething who has never experienced combat or war on a worldwide scale, I personally credit Ambrose for my newfound respect for the fighting men and women who have participated in all of our wars."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"This is the story of the Ox and Bucks regiment who captured Pegasus bridge on D-Day. This book is superb it gives an excellent account of the importance of the mission and the training of the men leading up to the actual assault and capture of the bridge. The book then goes on to explain how the bridge was held and includes good detail of when the re-enforcements arrived. The book is written very well and it has lots of eye witness accounts in it by people who were actually there. I recently visited the bridge during the 60th anniversary of D-Day and I would certainly reccommend reading the book if you are to visit the bridge ( I would also reccommend a visit to Pegasus bridge). This book has inspired me to purchase another book titled &quot;The devils own luck&quot; which is about the Ox and Bucks regiment after Pegasus bridge up to the end of the war."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Stephen Ambrose's book tells the story of D company, 6th para. and the taking of the bridges over the Orne canal and river. It is an excellent, if skimpy, telling of one of the facinating stories of WWII. I have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; It is a quick read, and I'd have liked more detail, but it is a good book none the less."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"\\"Pegasus Bridge\\", describes 6th Airborne Division's planning and execution of the seizure of a crucial bridge near Caen in the British invasion sector. Originally written in 1984 in time for the 40th anniversary of Neptune/Overlord, it is a straightforward retelling of this mission, relying extensively on participant's reminisces and memoirs. The most interesting part of the book is the first few chapters, where the commander Major Howard relates how he overcame the personal and institutional obstacles to train his company, and get this mission. In short that mission was to seize the bridge in a coup-de-main operation, and hold it until relieved by ground forces moving forward from the beaches. Otherwise, the story is really not much more than an extended magazine article in terms of what we learn about this operation, and the 6th Airborne Division's role in D-Day. While there's nothing quite like first-person accounts to give immediacy and personalize the action, they are always fret with dangers for historians. Memories fade (especially after some 40 years), chronologies can get confused, and sometimes one's own participation becomes somewhat more important than it was historically. (We're all the stars of our own lives-deservedly so.) At least two other popular histories, \\"The Longest Day\\" and \\"Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy\\" describe this battle and its relevance much better. The work itself is idiosyncratic as the author, an American historian, adopts British expressions and terms throughout his narrative-not just in the quotes and citations. Maybe his publisher insisted on this to aim the book at a British audience, but this seems like pandering to sell books to me.As a way to get a post-\\"Saving Private Ryan\\"/\\"Greatest Generation\\" American readership to realize that the Allies also had a pivotal role in this campaign, and capture some oral-history it succeeds well. As far as adding anything significant to the battle or campaign, it's a mediocre work at best."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"This isn't the greatest of Stephens Books, but it is worthy of any collector and historian. The book recalls the men and eventsthat allowed the British Glider and Parachute regiment to capture the all important bridge crossing the Orne and adjacent canal in order to prevent the 21st Panzer Division from disrupting and possibly defeating the landings at Sword, Juno and Gold Beach.The scene is well documented in the movie \\"The Longest Day.\\" Remember the famous lines, \\"hold until relieved?\\" That is exactly what these men did.What I enjoyed the most was the training the soldiers endured to become one of the elite.

I liked how Pegasus Bridge starts out and was getting the feeling this would be another great book. However, I found Ambrose's telling of the battle for Pegasus Bridge quite anticlimactic. The fight to take the bridge is over before it begins. Ambrose talks about fighting occurring frequently in defense of the bridge, but rarely provides details. More often than not the anecdotes provide more comic relief than a compelling story. The exception is Sergeant Thornton taking out the tank to halt an early German counterattack. Soon after this Company D goes into reserve while the 7th Battalion takes over the defense. Even when some of Company D troops go into the front no details are provided. I was expecting a lot more detail from a book that is purported to be about a single two day battle. The impression that I get from reading Ambrose's account is that taking the bridge was easy and, other than the one perfect shot by Sergeant Thornton, Company D is relieved by the 7th Battalion before all the real fighting gets started.After Company D leaves the bridge to rejoin its regiment, the story goes downhill. This part of the story seems detached and aimless. I think Ambrose would have been better served concentrating more on the fight at the bridges and enlarging his scope to provide more coverage of the 7th Battalion defense against the counterattacks. The Battle for Pegasus Bridge shouldn't be just a story of Company D. Ambrose really relies on too few sources to make the story complete. If he wanted to write a company history he should have changed the title.What I really did not enjoy was several references to Company D men being irritated by being put back into the line after they were initially relieved at the bridge. Especially when they were being asked to come up and support 7th Battalion paratroopers, who were getting hit with the full face of the counterattack. Again later Ambrose tells us they felt they should be returned back to England for refitting and preparing for the next bridge assault instead of fighting with the rest of the troops. I'm sure the other troops in the line wouldn't have felt much sympathy for them. Another part that should have been scratched was the suggestion that there not being a coup de main assault in Operation Market Garden because D company was not available to do it. Simply ridiculous. Ambrose makes it seem that D Company was the only highly trained unit in the British airborne. I hope Ambrose has embellished the story on his own or taken these parts out of context.But, it isn't all bad. Pegasus Bridge is still an easy read with many amusing anecdotes and you will gain an understanding of what occurred at Pegasus Bridge and why it was successful. He does provide some accounts from German sources which add tremendously to the story. The book does contain a good sketch showing the area around the bridges and several good photographs. It also includes Major Howard's actual orders. Some details about the amazing accuracy of the British intelligence are provided. Perhaps they should have given some pointers to their American colleagues who didn't even know until D-Day that the 352nd division had been moved up to the coast near Omaha three month before the invasion. Overall I would not recommend this book. I found Pegasus Bridge fails to deliver fully on its title and left me wondering where the rest was."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Hollywood's resent production of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is a wonderful tribute ot the men who took part in the greatest of endevour of World War II, however, THAT NEVER HAPPENED!

The British gliderborne troops made a perfect landing and captured both their targets in just 10 minutes. Then, when the Germans counterattacked the British knocked out a tank with a good PIAT shot and that was all! The rest of the fighting was done by other units of the 6th Airborne Division and Major Howard's men didn't have much to accomplish.

In the past I have not been disappointed with his work. That positive track record came to an end with this book. To be fair this book was written a number of years ago and before his best World War 2 works - D-Day and Citizen Soldiers. This book also covers an event that was performed by UK soldiers and the author's real strength has been with American forces. With those two books in my mind I grabbed this book hoping for the same detailed account of this particular event.Unfortunately for me the detail level was just not there. He briefly touched on the training and lead up to the event but not in the kind of detail that would really give me some insight into the men. He covered the assault on the bridge, but his coverage of the importance of the bridge to the overall D-Day effort and the German response was a bit lacking. And finally he also touched on what happened to the group for the rest of the war but in such a general way that it left me wanting more and frustrated at the extremely brief overview. I do not want to come off too harsh, overall this is an interesting and easy to read book that gives the reader a better then average coverage of the event. I was just thinking it would be better based on the author's track record."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Having visited Normandy including Pegasus Bridge and Ranville in August 2001 I decided to do some more reading on D-day and read Pegasus Bridge by Stephen E.

Great stuff. If you like Band of Brothers, you'll like this one as well."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot; was the first Ambrose book I read. I had known the story of the British assault on the bridge forever known as Pegasus Bridge after reading and viewing &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, but it was not until I read this book I really understood the rest of the story. The story of this small group of paratroopers is an important one for all who wish to read and study WW2 as it is a real test of the airborne force in this type of commando role and terribly important to the invasion of Normandy. Ambrose is in fine form in this, one of his earlier WW2 books, but he does not get that last star from me becuase he turns around and steals from himself, a lot from this very book, much later in his career. A good companion to this would be &quot; Pegasus Bridge/Merville Battery&quot; by Carl Shilleto for the Battleground Europe series."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Securing the eastern flank of Overlord (D-Day) was the British Airborne. Between them and the British 3rd Infantry Division coming ashore on Sword Beach were two bridges fifty years apart across the Orne Waterways. These bridges had to be held or the airborne troops would have been cut off from relief coming inland. Pegasus Bridge has been at times called the Caen Canal Bridge, the Orne Canal Bridge and the Benouville Bridge. Now it bears the proud name Pegasus Bridge in honor of the valiant men who took it, held it, died on it and who wore that emblem on their shoulder: The 2nd Ox and Bucks. Lead by Major John Howard after months of detailed rehearsals, D Company landed in Horsa gliders minutes after midnight on D-day. Landing within yards of the enemy held bridge they seized it in a short, well-rehearsed and bloody firefight. This extremely brave action was just the beginning of a daylong, tense struggle to hold out against seasoned troops and tanks with only small arms. They held and later joined the other Ox and Bucks near Escoville. When finally relieved on Sept.5th, D Company had fallen from its D-day strength of 181 men to 40. Colonel Von Luck, 21st Panzer, contends that had those bridges been available to him, his regiment would have been able to join the 192nd Regiment of the 21st Panzer and their combined strength would have surely allowed them to drive to the beaches. And the result of that could have spelled disaster for the beachhead troops if not the entire invasion.As expected, Ambrose weaves his talent for detailed research, oral histories and gifted writing into a great account of this major link in D-Day's chain.Richard Todd, the actor, was a Captain in the 1th Airborne and is mentioned several times retelling some of the activities of that unit on the other side of the Orne River. In the movie \\"The Longest Day\\", he portrayed Major John Howard."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Great learning tool.

This is a story brought to you through the the pen of premier historian/author Stephen Ambrose. I love history and especialy WW2 history. I got to know the characters on a personel level. Stephen writes in laymans terms. For someone like myself who does not have military back ground, it offers easily understood nomanclature that makes the story all that much more authentic. \\"The Pegusas Bridge\\" is a wonderfuly accurate document of history, pulling back the curtain to reveal maps, actual military orders given to various officers, as well as recon photos of the bridge and surounding areas to give the reader the whole picture of the entire operation. A definite must read to any authentic WW2 enthusiaste."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"This is a well researched and well written small book about one of the smallest yet most important parts of the invasion plan, Operation Overlord. From the author's point of view, the operation was almost too smooth, as things went almost exactly according to plan. Major John Howard and Glider Pilot Jim Wallworth pulled of one the most important feats of the invasion, capturing two vital bridges on the west side of the D-Day landing area. With these bridges in British hands, the German counterattack, particularly the armored counterattack, was forced to detour many, many miles around the city of Caen, which not only slowed the attack, but exposed the German to additional devastating Allied air attacks. The book not only covers the attack, but the struggle the British glider troopers and airborne reinforcements went through to hold the bridge until British armored units showed up to reinforce them.Jim Wallworth deserves more credit, in my opinion, than he got. Not only did he land his glider in the exact right spot, in total darkness (they landed just after midnight), he actually managed to get the nose of the glider across a barrier of barbed wire that separated the landing zone from the bridges themselves. Howard, months before, had told Wallworth that was exactly where he wanted to end-up, and Wallworth, in what Air Chief Leigh-Mallory, commander of all allied air forces on D-Day, called the greatest flying feat of the entire war, literally put the glider with 1-2 feet of the exact spot Howard wanted. By comparison, most glider pilots used in the invasion were often off-target by many miles, yet Wallworth landed exactly where he was supposed to, within a few inches!The book reads fast, despite the detail that Ambrose puts into it. Recommended.In a fun aside, this attack is portrayed in the movie The Longest Day. In the movie, actor Richard Todd played Major Howard. Richard Todd was actually involved in Operation Overlord and was one of the first airborne reinforcements to reach Pegasus bridge, and played a vital role in helping to hold the bridge against German attacks!"},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"This is vintage Stephen Ambrose storytelling from the days before he became a cottage industry and became caught up in arguments over who wrote what and when. It is also the rarely told story of a single company sized unit in a single important combat, specifically D Company (or Coy as the Brits often say) of the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Regiment here identified as \\"the Oxs and Bucks.\\"The regiment was assigned the role of glider-borne infantry as part of Britain's 6th Airborne Division. Their mission on D-Day, the 6th of June in 1944, was to seize and hold two bridges - one over the Orne River and the other across the adjacent canal. These waterways marked the left flank of the British landing beaches on D-Day and therefore the left flank of the entire Normandy invasion force. It was considered critical that these two bridges be captured intact and held in order to deny them to the use of German tank units in the vicinity and to preserve them for the eventual use of the Allied breakout from the initial beachhead. In the words of John Wayne as the American airborne's General Gavin - this mission was strategic.Ambrose tells the story not just of the battle but of the preparations for the battle being made by both sides for some two years before D-Day. While his focus is primarily upon D Company and its commander, Major John Howard, through good research and a little luck he is also able to include in his narrative the viewpoint and experiences of the German troops and of the local French Resistance members in the vicinity of the bridge.In part because they have long since disappeared from warfare, the glider troops do not seem to get the full share of credit they deserve. As is cited in a number of books on the subject, including this one, those paratroopers who found themselves riding the gliders came away unanimously prefering to parachute and some arguing that the glider troops weren't paid enough. Neither the glider troops nor the glider pilots wore parachutes, reflecting a bond between the cockpit crew and their passengers that whatever happened they were all in this venture together. Losses among the glider troops were high and often resulted from midflight failures of their aircraft or friendly fire from anti-aircraft guns on Allied ships or ground units that in the heat of combat failed to recall their orders or to recognize the aircraft as friendly. And then, of course, there were the losses in combat with the Germans. Ambrose does an excellent job in the story of this one company of setting out the arguments for using gliders and the details of how to use them successfully. This is a history, a biography and memoir, and almost a textbook on glider operations."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Yea, I agree, it's not D-Day or Citizen Soldiers, but it's a good book.

Enter John Howard! Ambroise let's the reader learn a lot about the man, and the men, that are assigned, eventually, to the mission named in the title. You'll read a lot about the Brits training, and training, and training, then you'll say as I did, &quot;I don't want to read about the Brits training&quot;. But, when the book gets to the eventful evening of June 6, the entire training sequences (as in the movie Rocky) make perfect sense. I found myself totally understanding the situation, danger, and thoughts of the attackers. Great words that give you the feel of the action, and even the smell. It's not a book of fighting and battle, but of the men involved in the fight. The fight is not the main thrust, it's people. Remember D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, it's the people from those books you remember as well as the events.A fine short read of under 190 pages, a few nights in front of the fireplace and you'll knock this one out. The shape of the book bothered me, but I got over it. A very good book, it's of lesser strengths then it's other family members. Stephen, you've done it again.Final words: John Howard will live on in your memory as a fine and brave man. Thank him also for D-Day and it's aftermath.

I found the story much less inspiring than 82nd airborne's taking of Nijmegen bridge for example.Howard's company had merely to brush aside drunks and other reluctant garrison troops. I don't like these books that glorify a certain company above other more deserving companies. Stephen Ambrose does it again for Easy Company of 2nd battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Millions of allied soliders fought in this war. It is unfair to glorify a handful over the millions, especially if there are groups more deserving of praise."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"I had lot of expectations in this book. Unfortunately, the most important fight in the early hourd of D-Day were very little covered. Too much silly episodes, rather than a more comprhensive description of the firefight. On the other hand, you can find a very good introduction of training of company, the glider landing and the first minutes of the combat. After all, after LT. Brotheridge died, nothing more is clear, there is not anymore a storyline, it seemed that the author had to finish the book at a glance."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"At last Ambrose begins to tackle the massive British contribution to victory. but it is a disappointingly short and skimpy look.Ambrose (and one notes, some US reviewers below) manages to recognise the victory at the bridge, but understates the non US contribution overall. Remember, approx 50% of all forces in Normandy were UK/Canadian/Polish etc. - and far from failing, as one reviewer below has it, they held, and ground down, the bulk of the German forces in Normandy, enabling US forces to break out against relatively weak opposition (this is a fact, not an opinion -look it up).Perhaps it is a little unfair to direct one's ire at this, his belated attempt to recall a few of the non US troops involved. His book on D-Day might be a more suitable object of one's scorn (4/5 about US troops alone). Yet the frustration millions of non US readers feel at being written out of their own history seeks an outlet.It's not as if, say, UK historians - like Keegan or Neillands - have tried to minimise the US contribution in their books. All the allied armies made a huge contribution to victory. So why the chauvinism on the part of Ambrose, d'Este et al? do they feel insecure, or is it that they have fallen into mere parochialism? Thank goodness not all US historians are as narrow this."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"dry .... too dry"},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"Stephen Ambrose has written a concise tactical story that deserves to be told, that of the superbly planned and executed commando raid by the British on 6 June 1944.Ambrose is no stranger to the stories of D-Day, but readers of his works might be surprised by something so concise (another one of his books on Upton is equally concise and insightful). Ambrose does a stellar job of presenting the importance of intelligence, secrecy, surprise, mass and logistics in any military operation. He further demonstrates the value of a small attack in the grand scheme of maneuver.The story of Pegasus Bridge, since so re-named by the French in honor of the Pegasus shoulder crest worn by the British, is a thrilling one of specially selected men, precise training, superb small unit leadership, and the role of fate in battle. Like the more well known Rangers at Pont du Hoc, the British were all volunteers, specially selected over a year in advance for a mission of which none of them knew anything. They worked hard at cross training in all of the infantry specialties of small unit tactics, teamwork, weapons handling, communications and that intangible, espirit de corps. The local French R&eacute;sistance provided precise intelligence to the British so that, in conjunction with photo reconnaissance flights, the British knew exactly what they were facing in the dark night of 5-6 June 1944.In keeping almost iron clad secrecy about the mission, and using silent gliders in small numbers to disguise the hit as a diversion of some sort, the British achieved total surprise and took both bridges almost without a hitch. What they lacked was the same as all amphibious and airborne assault forces: mass of numbers and logistical supplies. They made up for both of these the way that paratroopers and marines, and centuries ago grenadiers, always have: &eacute;lan, dash, toughness, resolute will and purpose, unflinching courage. They carried it off so well that armored Germans, admittedly not first rate Panzer Truppen, probed, were hit, and backed off to wait for daylight, reinforcements and more guidance. No doubt that had a ethnically pure German leadership group commanded this operation with their traditional leadership from the front and dogged determination, this might have turned out very much differently, but it is always better to be lucky than good, and in that last measure, the British were once again well served.The British participation in OVERLORD is frequently overlooked, and in fact, their failure to seize Caen and break into the French countryside decisively before the Germans could regroup must be regarded as a costly failure. Especially in lieu of the fact that they held Pegasus Bridge which offered exciting penetration and flanking exploitation possibilities, the British reluctance to attack fast and hard should be studied as a failure in command. With the stunning technical success at Arromanches with the Mulberries, and the dash and verve of the successful bridge seizure, though, it is time to also study the great British successes of OVERLORD: commando ops, intelligence, and logistics.Pegasus Bridge is a good quick read, and worth re-reading and contemplation for what it does not tell you, but indicates in absebtia."},{"Title":"Pegasus Bridge","review":"This book is only about 150 pages short but it is long on information and eyewitness accounts of one of the most pivotal battles of D-Day.The British 6th Airborne was tasked with the mission to secure the left flank (the easternmost flank) of the Normandy Beachhead.

It was the key strongpoint in defending this flank.This is the story of how Howard's men trained and trained and executed the plan with a daring glider assault, landing only yards away from the bridge. How they seized this bridge and held on until reinforced is the stuff of legend.The book is fully indexed, well sourced and contains the original orders given to Major Howard.

AmbrosePegasus Bridge is a lesser known book by Ambrose on a lesser known battle on D-Day. It is likely lesser known to me because the British are the heroes of this story. This book tells of the British airborne troops that landed in gliders in the early hours of D-Day. They were the first to arrive on this historical day. They took over this bridge as it was a key bridge for the Nazi army. The Brits' mission was to seize the bridge to protect the Allied flanks on the beaches. If the Nazis would have been able to cross that bridge with their tanks they could have just parked on the beaches and made life a lot worse for the Allied forces. It was also a key bridge to bring the Allied forces deeper into France so they had to take it without it being destroyed.As usual, Ambrose's writing style is superb. His account reads like a story or even a movie script. The armies on both sides had been training for two years for this very day. The Nazis had the better guns and artillery and they had already deeply entrenched themselves ready for an attack. The Brits had two key advantages: the element of surprise and a just cause.

With Pegasus Bridge he does justice to our British allies, relating the absolutely critical roles played by British paratroops and glider infantry in securing the eastern flank of the Normandy beachhead; a feat comparable, but with different objectives, to what the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions did at the west of the beachhead.

He writes of the government sponsored church, the &quot;Three Selves Movement&quot;; he compares the spontaneous &quot;house church&quot; movement. Lawrence discusses where these movements began, and where they are going. He interrupts his narrative only to give testimonies -- amazing testimonies -- mirroring the first century church as described in the Book of Acts.Lawrence's description of the &quot;house church&quot; movement shows his love for the Chinese people. As a result of reading this book, I have a great deal of respect for the writer, a better understanding of the Chinese church, and a greater heart for the persecuted church. I would encourage any Christian to read this book, and to pray for the persecuted Church."},{"Title":"The Church in China: How it Survives and Prospers Under Communism","review":"This series of accounts of christians behind the Bamboo Curtain serves to astound us in the West at how our Chinese counterparts suffer for their faith and service to Christ under such hostile conditions.

I have lived and worked as a surveyor in many of the places he describes. With my memories as a background, this book took me back 150 years.The author describes, matter-of factly, his experiences on the great journey to the Oregon territory. He not only crossed the continnent with a wife and baby, but pioneered homes in Oregon and Puget Sound. These were tough people, who asked no quarter from nature and prevailed.I am interested, particularly, in the use of oxen on the trail. Unfortunately, oxen were common tools for the author. As a result, he felt there was nothing special about them that would cause him to give the details of training and driving oxen.

I expected a bunch of funny tales about the legendary Trapspringer. Although after this book you won't really think that he is very 'legendary'. He seems like your normal average kender. The story is pretty good and often funny at times...(I laughed out loud on more than one occasion). The book does have its minor flaws. I thought that the gully dwarves in this book were a little too intelligent. But besides that, the author (a newcomer to the dragonlance world) did a good job. I thought some of the scenes with the 'evil fiend' were hilarious.

The first 30 pages have nearly nothing to do with the plot. Some story. As it is, I only got past the 30 pages, and am extremely disappointed. Where's the famous Kender humor that we love Tas for? Not present. Dull, boring....TSR's editors and writing staff are decaying. And it shows in this book."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"I read my first Dragonlance more than 10 years ago and I've been an ardent fan since. So when I got my hands on this one, I was full of expectations.However, this book was a real letdown. I had to force myself to go through each page and finally gave up. The narration sounded like sentences in childrens' books. The kender didn't seem to act or speak like kender and the gully drarves were either too smart or too irritating. The death knight wasn't much of a Death Knight nor was Takhisis her usual Godlike self.The author, being new to Dragonlance series should have done her homework better and found out more about the Dragonlance world we all know and love. This was really a waste of such a promising title as a book of short stories on Uncle Trapspringer's adventures would indeed be very welcome to the Dragonlance series."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"I cant believe how much more entertaining this book was than i thought it would be. I was really worried going into this book after reading other reviews here. but I couldnt be more pleased with this book. Its title is absolutly perfect in that the &quot;tales of uncle trapspringer&quot; are hugely important in this story. I think what people are confused about is that the Kender named trapspringer in this book was NOT the actual uncle trapspringer. But i digress, this was a book full of action, LOADS of comedy (how funny is that fiend?) and it even had a fullfilling ending. I also thought it was consistent with the other dragonlance books. While neither Kender is very much like Tas, remember that not every kender is identical. they just have simaler characteristics. I definitly recommend this book if your a dragonlance fan who likes fantasy comedy (example if tas is your favorite character in the chronicles) otherwise if what your looking for a is a serious, no messing around fantasy, this isnt your book."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"I have to say that I am a seasoned reader and am very used to slow beginnings. With great excitement, I turned to the first page. I love books about kender. I disregard the incoherent preamble...I read 50 pages before the idea strikes me that maybe it won't pick up. It didn't. I suffered through an entire book of horrid subplots. Where's the kender humor we all know and love? This book was a complete waste. The heroes were drab, the villains boring, and the entire convoluted basis of the story was not worthwhile. Plus, at the beginning of most chapters, there were confusing nararrator's notes which successfully broke the feel of being with the characters. Additionally, the end was weak and unfulfilling. One more thing...It's incohesive with the rest of the wonderful DragonLance saga. Please, for the sake of your sanity, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! If you want kender humor, try &quot;Kendermore&quot; by Mary Kirchoff. (P.S. This would be a zero-starrer, but Amazon didn't offer the option)"},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"So far I have read about 40 or so books in the DragonLance series and this is the first one I've thrown out after only reading 50 pages. It has been a long time since I've read a book that's so without talent and story. It seems to me that it has been written only to bring in some cash for TSR. Even the name Palanthas has been misspelled. It is as if it was written in a hurry just to publish another book by the name of Dragonlance. I wish Margaret had never allowed those money-hungry fools to take over the name."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"This is a great book, written in a very kender way. Dispite some other negative comments made about the book, I disagree that it was bad writing or a poor view of Uncle Trapspringer. I believe the &quot;disorganized&quot; way the story was told, is EXACTLY the way a kender tale would be told. And I think a point being made was, that Uncle Trap, was a normal kender, just like any other. The story was well written, and in many parts, hilarious. A good read for any Dragonlance fan!"},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"If your a kender fan you should definately go out and grab this book. Uncle Trapspringer makes for a great story. Some people are complaining that he's not like most kender, which is a relief, it's nice to see some originality here. Also people have been complaining about the fact that he did not live up to the stories that Tasslehoff told of him. Well Tas like most kender EXAGERATES! Of course he isn't quite as legendary as Tas's tales said he was, they were kender tales. All in all this has the whole package, good story, some gullu dwarves (a little bit more intelligent than the norm, but like before it's nice to see some change.Over come by wanderlust (like all kender) Trapspringer ends up traversing Krynn, falling into company with a couple of gully dwarves and an evil fiend. The evil fiend is great, it'll keep you rolling with laughter.So give the book a chance, get it fom the library id you can. You'll probly like it more than you would have thought!"},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"This was, by far, the worst dragonlance book i ever read. The language if very poor - suitable for children at best. It seems as if the story was just made up as it was written. Very random events. Keeps reiterating and using the same terms over and over again. Not very logical, even for a fantasy - just plain silly... Read it as a comedy perhaps, but if you want a serious indulging read, forget this book - terrible, terrible, terrible.If books like this can be successful, it makes me belive I could be a sucessful writer."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"Imagine for a second a Kender stops by sits down and tells you a story about his Infamous Uncle. If that's your idea of fun then you must read this book. It's really good with plenty of humor and adventure but you have to remember a Kender finds alot of things interesting that may bore you. If you can put up with those things though you like this book. Excellent and Recommended."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"The book's main characters, Trapspringer and his sister were typically entertaining kender, however, the action predictable and lackluster. If you like kender, you'll like it, if you like a good Dragonlance story, skip it."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"I LOVED this book, most of the Dragonlance books I either just like or couldn't care less for but I really loved this one. I found the characters were well developed and felt like I knew them- the 'good guys' at least- the 'baddies' were pretty weak, physically too. Kinda annoying how easily they beat the bad guys in every fight while not even getting injured.But other than that it was real funny, the plot twists and turns like a kender's rambling, keeps you turning pages. And there is very little to do about the gods (I'm not crazy about polytheism) and no sexual content."},{"Title":"Tales of Uncle Trapspringer","review":"This book started off slow and never picked up. There is nothing interesting or different about Uncle Trapspringer, it is a complete waste of time and money. I found the Kender to be so completely depressing.

They ask Maigret to help clear them of suspicion.He arrives at the border town of Givet in a totally unofficial capacity. The phlegmatic manners of the Flemish family, and the perfect calm and cleanliness of their home and shop, seem to mesmerize Maigret. Will he penetrate their secrets - and the motives of the townspeople who hate them?Maigret does some unexpected things in this novel, including warding off an attacker, a rare display of physical fitness!Simenon had some Flemish ancestry himself. It's interesting to ponder that in relation to the peculiar atmosphere in the Peeters household."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"This is the first book of a set of four (as of this time only three have been released) Diane's first book &quot;The Door Into Fire&quot; is full of magic and character, where mere sorcery is boring, and bumping into god (actually the goddess) is not only normal, but expected.

The Door into Fire is the story of a prince with a quest sets out rescue his freind, who is king in exile of the neighboring kingdom.

I've checked, the first one is due in Sept. 2001."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"i was a fan of duane's first few wizard books, so i picked this up. i guess i'm in a minority here, but i wasn't very impressed w/ this book. granted, it was one of duane's earliest efforts, but the plot is predictable and book lays on the mythology really thick. also, duane's dialogue feels out of place with its constant, very american-sounding vernacular. there are just a few interesting twists. the most interesting is the way she explores sex and sexuality, and the ideas of open relationships, bisexuality, and sex in relation to religion. it's also nice to see a (mostly) homosexual character in the main role, but the last herald mage series by mercedes lackey is much more poignant. be aware that this edition (1984) is a revised edition and slightly diff. from the original 1979 edition."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"The Door Into Fire (1979) is the first novel in the Tale of Five series. Herewiss is the heir to the Brightwood, a principality within the Kingdom of Darthen. Herewiss has the potential to be the first male in centuries to use the Power of the Flame; the fire is within him, but cannot be expressed in any meaningful way without a Focus.While training with the Rodmistresses, he has tried various forms of Rods as his Focus, but they all burst. Then he tried swords of wood, ivory and bone, but they all burst. Finally, he tries to imbue steel swords with a form of pseudolife, but even they all burst.In this novel, Herewiss is working on yet another steel sword in the smithy that he has constructed in his bedroom when he receives a message via pigeon that Freelorn, his loved, and his small band have been trapped by a thousand or more armed men in an old keep south of Madeil. Freelorn wants him to come and use his sorcery to save them once again. After getting permission from Hearn, his father and Lord of Brightwater, Herewiss leaves to rescue Freelorn. He rides out on Dapple, who has been blessed with the talent of being at the right place at the right time, but finds another mount at a wayside shelter during a torrential thunderstorm.Sunspark is a fire elemental in the form of a red horse with a golden mane. Since it is newly come to the planet, Sunspark spends too much time absorbing the energy from a brush fire and the rainstorm catches it away from shelter. The water is gradually eating away its energy, but it hears Herewiss calling and almost reaches the shelter before it is unable to move anymore. However, Herewiss and Dapple carry and drag it out of the rain, where it soon recovers.This novel is a tale of adventure and character development. Both Herewiss and Freelorn mature during this novel. Segnbora, another one frustrated by an almost inexpressible Flame, exhibits some changes that might blossom later in this series. However, the major changes occur in Sunspark, the energy being who knows nothing about humanity but is very curious.This novel expresses a philosophy of Life that underlies every aspect of the story: the only way to cheat death is to maximize Life and Love in all its forms. When he has his epiphany, Herewiss finds that he is just a small part of the Life that permeates the Universe. This worldview also underlies the Young Wizards series.This novel incorporates a variant of the Triple Goddess religion as the major spiritual influence; in fact, the Mother and the Maiden play a significant part in the story. This religion promotes various forms of sexual experiences, of which heterosexual sex is special only in that it produces offspring. The Goddess herself has Twin Lovers, her own children by parthenogenesis, who are originally both male, but who die and return, sometimes as male and sometimes as female.Other aspects of the story show a definite Irish influence, but one that antecedes the Celtic infusion. The Fyrd, the aboriginal fauna in the Middle Kingdoms, include horwolves, nadders, and keplians. However, there were no Sidhe nor any other sentients occupying the land prior to the coming of the humans.This series is being republished after being long out of print. The Door Into Fire and The Door Into Shadow were issued as an omnibus edition in 2002 (see The Sword and the Dragon) and the other two (including the hereto unpublished The Door Into Starlight) are scheduled to be released in 2004 (or later).Highly recommended for Duane fans and anyone else who enjoys tales of sword and sorcery with some serious character development.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"When this book first opens, it seems like it will be standard sword-and-sorcery -- heros, villans, quests, and magic. But the deeper one gets into the book, the clearer it becomes that this is something special. Imagine a world in which the deity is not a matter of faith but of fact, because everyone has met her. Imagine a world in which who one loves is not important, as long as one does love. Imagine as hero not the usual charming but amoral rogue but a thoroughly decent, kind and generous man. Imagine a book that teaches us that our own fears are the biggest obstacles of life and that overcoming our pasts and accepting our true selves are the truest victories. Except that you don't have to imagine all of this, because Diane Duane has already done it for you.I've bought a dozen copies of this book, and I press it on friends at every opportunity."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"This novel is one that I've read and reread in both the editions I have -- the original paperback and the Bluejay books edition. It is a story of enduring love, the triumph of love over fear and hate, and most of all, the best truly different fantasy world I've ever seen made up. It is culturally, historically, and religiously different without being dry, like some science-fiction books that try to portray another really different culture get.It's main character is Herewiss, a man who has the potential to wield great magic but cannot break through to connect with it and manifest his magic. He joins forces with Freelorn, the exiled heir of a neighboring kingdom and his lifelong love, Segnbora, a mysterious troubled woman, and some of Freelorn's faithful friends (Harald, Moris, and Dritt) in an adventure that leads them to the edges of their world, and involves door into other worlds and the mastering of a fire elemental whose favored form is that of a horse!The next two books in the series are The Door into Shadow and The Door into Sunset. At last, I hear news that Ms. Duane has written the fourth (The Door into Twilight) that I have hounded the bookstores about now for years, diligently searching in the \\"Du\\" section of fantasy and science fiction with every trip.For those who really love the world of the Middle Kingdoms, there's a little-known short story by Diane Duane published in Flashing Swords! #5: Demons and Daggers (edited by Lin Carter, Nelson Doubleday 1981) called \\"Parting Gifts.\\" It is about an older rodmistress, the Shadow, an young swashbuckler, and a kitten. It features a wild hunt and facing down the Shadow in his lair. I cry whenever I finish it. If you can find it, read it and add it to your knowledge of the world setting.I've used Ms. Duane's Middle Kingdoms setting as the basis for my personal D&D; campaign for years now. Sure, my campaign is by no means her books, but she provided such a rich tapestry (and map!) that I didn't have to go far to have a solid foundation for a whole world."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"&quot;Door into Fire&quot; is one of the best first-novels I've come across--and there have been many since the time I picked up a battered copy at a used-bookstore many years ago. Just reading David Gerrold's &quot;Overture&quot; introducing the book was a treat. He lets you know that this novel is uniquely special. Diane Duane conjures up a believable world that is a little brighter--and better-- than ours, complete with a Goddess who appears in different guises (when you least expect), impossible (or are they?)quests, enduring love, and plenty of magical derring-do. Above all, this book has its heart and soul in the right place--you care deeply about each character throughout the series in their search of self, and you yearn to visit time and again the realm of the Middle Kingdoms. To my delight, she has long since turned the story into a series. Ms. Duane, if you're out there, I hope you will decide write the fourth book someday. I will be looking forward to it!"},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"By a stroke of extreme good fortune that I did not even appreciate at the time, my mother picked all three books of this trilogy up for me on a whim just before they went entirely out of print. Having learned to be wary of Mom's book choices, I wasn't at all certain that I would enjoy them, but I dutifully picked up _Door Into Fire_ and started reading. What a benediction to my mind this chance gift has been!It's worth noting that on first read, this book is confusing; Duane has succeeded in making a society that's truly *different* from our own, and the rules may occasionally surprise. However, persevere! This is a tale of spirituality, romance, magic, loyalty, sacrifice, and power, all the things that a fantasy series must have these days--and all of them done *well*. The portrayals of sorcery and religion are new twists on older ideas, making them at once familiar and startlingly new. And Herewiss's explorations into his soul and those of his companions give plenty of food for thought--what would we see, if we had the ability to look into our own that way?If you can find this book, *buy it*. There is so much that is appealing about it that surely everyone will find something worthwhile between its covers; if all else fails, it's a spirited, intriguing story, and one which will linger in the memory."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"Loved this series, seems like forever. My view of a deity I could speak to and not flinch from , came of this world... go read it and you'll see why.Everyone else told you about the characters and world. I think I memorized huge parts of this book before I even knew I was doing it. That's how special it is.IF you want another bit of this world, she wrote a story honoring Andre Norton [Moonsinger's World?] with a Rodmistress who always makes me cry. And that's not all bad, either. Won't even let my mother keep this book long, and part of why is Diane's story!You'd also love her beings in \\"So you want to be a wizard\\" series.

At last, at last!"},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"Of all the books I have read in my life that have drawn me into their worlds, this is probably the one that I will remember above all the others. The world that Diane Duane creates is so different from ours and yet seems so incredibly right - a place anyone would want to be. Her characters are so real, drawing you in so you experience all they experience, but doing so with a fantastic sense of humour throughout. This is a book I will never tire of reading, and would recommend to anybody. Once you have read it, you'll want to read the others... and like the rest of us, will hope that Diane manages to finally decide she has finished the last one and publish it!"},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"I was unable to get this book from the library and am so glad that I own it.This universe is complex and interesting."},{"Title":"The Door into Fire: Tale of the Five Volume 1","review":"(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)If you just love action-packed, breathtaking sword and sorcery, this is not a book you might be willing to buy, going through the trouble of digging in second hand book stores.The plot itself is rather thin and would barely fill the first three chapters of any other book; it is not original and therefore easy to guess in advance.What makes this book worth reading is the author's attempt at establishing a very different kind of world animated by its own, highly original, rules.In this world, created by a powerful but fallible (and therefore very endearing) goddess who loves her creation but is aware of its flaws, magic is the ultimate result of harmony: that between the sorcerer/ess 's will and nature. Only through real understanding can a person achieve real power.This concept and many other throughout the book may sound very wiccan, but just take a short look at the original publishing date to realize that Ms Duane follows no literary fashion but establishes her own.Herewiss' (the main hero) quest for his birthright blue fire magic is a phylosophical journey to awareness: though charming and beautiful, he is also self willed and sometimes even dense.The other characters of this first volume are more functional than really well rounded, with the possible exception of Sunspark, who is deeply entertaining.Ms Duane's writing is never easy and not always proficient: some theoretical pages tend to be a bit convolute and dull, but generally speaking she manages to express her idea(l)s in clear, challenging paragraphs. Some are even lyrical, deeply moving: one really feels the depth of her motives even if one does not share them.A word of caution for touchy people: there is a lot of sex in this book, never graphic, but it is not only essential in the author's Weltanschauung but for the plot too.Every single character (even the goddess) has a very no nonsense attitude regarding any kind of mating: Herewiss is deeply in love with another man, a childhood friend, but both of them \\"share\\" with other people following their instincts.In Ms Duane's world this is perfectly allright because the goddess encourages any kind of love and once in a while she descends among her creatures to share her love with them.An interesting book, worth reading because of its depth. Therefore the four stars."},{"Title":"Gumption: Sought-after Common Sense And Intellectual Training for Inquiring Employees, Managers And Business Owners.","review":"As a reader with a longstanding interest in the work of motivational authors like Dale Carnegie, Brian Tracy, Denis Waitley and Tony Robbins, I love the way Lisa Rose has created a synthesis of the very best advice these authors (and many more) have to offer.

Even within the confines of these necessarily short romance books, authors can create good, memorable characters and write realistic, witty dialogue and good plots. This story, about a princess in a fictional country who runs away to avoid marrying an undesirable man whom she has to prove is a traitor to her country, had none of these positive things. I thought her bodyguard came off all right, but the princess herself sounded fake and stiff whenever she talked. I didn't particularly like her and that's not good when she's the lead character. It was kind of nice that she and her bodyguard got married for convenience and then fell in love for real (I like romance like that) but the whole story seemed like a fake prop for something (what, the rather explicit and not very romantic love scenes)? Just because I'm reading a formula romance doesn't mean I don't want a good story and good characters.

However, this one has some serious weaknesses apart from the fact that I personally don't like made up kingdoms and princesses. Part of the story is set in Austria and therefore there are some supposedly German parts mixed into the dialogue. However, Ms. Barton should do a little more research to offer correct German. Only because there are Umlaute does not mean that every vowel gets two little dots on top. The question 'How are you\`, when literately translated, asks for a characteristic of a person rather than being a polite formula. The answer to this question could be something like nice, fat or stupid.So, I found this booh really quite boring and way too far fetched.

But he is also very maddening.If you want to know about the background to centering prayer then probably this is as good an introduction to that aspect of the subject as any. But if , like me, you actually want to know how to do centering prayer, then don't bother with this book. It tells you just about everything you could wish to know about the history, benifits, and application of centering prayer (it even tells you how to structure centering prayer retreats and seminars). But unbelievably, within its 254 pages Pennington devotes little more than one page on how to actually do it, and what he does say is vague and interspersed with latin phrases. I have the impression that Pennington has written something more explicit somewhere, but this book is definitely not it."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"The concept of centering prayer is one that can be alienating to many people raised in the traditional American tradition. Most of us have been raised to be &quot;doers,&quot; &quot;analyzers,&quot; &quot;achievers,&quot; etc. To many of us in that category, prayer is something to pursue actively whether it be at Mass, communal prayer, Liturgy of the Hours, etc. The author presents centering prayer as something different, perhaps even beyond our traditional understanding of prayer. &quot;Centering Prayer&quot;, by M. Basil Pennington, presents a concept well-suited, yet often challenging for our hectic times. The book, written a number of years ago, presents the method of prayer in a new light, combing eastern Christian spiritual exercises with the context of western spirituality, offering practical guidelines for integrating the &quot;way of prayer&quot; into our daily lives.The author presents the concept of centering prayer in a simple format, clearly outlining and explaining the history, status and principles of this ancient, but recently revitalized tradition. We are reminded continuously that faith is a gift from God; our ability to pray depends upon our willingness to &quot;rest in the Lord.&quot; We are called to empty ourselves and allow God to enter our hearts and our souls. Drawing on a number of sources, including Thomas Merton, Thomas Keating, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross as well as the anonymous author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing,&quot; Father Pennington offers a simple, cogent discussion of the various aspects of prayer.Even beyond the text, this book is an invitation. It is an invitation to open oneself to God and the gift of grace. It's neatly arranged chapters offer the reader the opportunity to reflect upon the nature of prayer and reference it frequently as needed. As one progresses in the way of centering prayer, this book is a simple, yet invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"It is with great joy that I accompany the author into the communion of those saints who have mentored both of us; Thomas Merton, to whom he attributes the term, \\"Centering\\", Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, Thomas Keating, Edward Hays, the unnamed author of the ancient classic, \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\", among others. His broad acquaintance with spiritual persons sharing the blessing of praying interiorly introduces many others as well. Having recently purchased the hard cover 1980 edition I'm reminded that, had I read it in its entirety 20 years ago, I would have been fascinated, but unable to grasp the metaphoric descriptions of this indescribable form of prayer. A couple of years ago, after years of trying to \\"make contemplation work\\", I settled into the prayer phrase, \\"Gracious Lord, I surrender to your care.\\" I cannot pinpoint the hour during which God's hug enveloped me to allow the holy privilege of slipping silently into Center, but I recognize that it was entirely the work of God, and not of my dogged determination. Because of the many workshops Pennington has conducted, the last section of the book in response to questions raised both by puzzled and skeptical participants echoed many of my own. Perhaps the question section is the place to begin, because the longings expressed therein may remind all of us of our beginnings. I sense those spiritual mothers and fathers smiling as I realize that intense longing is a Grace, a Gift, and as I discovered, a Promise as well."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I recently discovered Centering Prayer through this book, and I could not have asked for a better introduction to the subject. In Fr. Pennington, I found what I wish for in the ideal priest: knowledge and expertise tempered by compassion and humility.I wish to respond to some negative comments made by other reviewers. One has written that the book contains about one page of instruction on Centering Prayer and 200+ pages of history and theology. This is not quite true, as Fr. Pennington focuses a great deal on the mundane, practical elements of Centering Prayer. While he does make extensive reference to historical writings, I think that is for the best. The technique of Centering Prayer is extremely simple, yet it can be difficult to understand why one should do it and how one should integrate the fruits of Centering Prayer in to the rest of one's life. The thoughts of centuries of Christians who have practiced it or something like it are insightful in this regard.Another reviewer suggests that it is rooted not in Catholicism but in Eastern spiritual practices. Fr. Pennington specifically refutes this view and emphasizes that Centering Prayer has Christian roots. Indeed, he commends Centering Prayer to the many Catholics and other Christians who have found techniques such as Transcendental Meditation lacking and want a spiritual practice of their own religious tradition. While he obviously admires people of all religious persuasions, his sources are the Bible, saints of the Catholic Church, and other Christian writers.Before picking up this or any other book on Centering Prayer, please note the following: Centering Prayer is not a means of instantly assuring oneself an extraordinary experience of God. As Fr. Pennington makes clear, Centering Prayer is a method of quieting oneself and putting oneself in the presence of God. One does so not because one expects any kind of personal experience or benefit, but simply because it is God's due. If God chooses to grace an individual with an extraordinary experience of Him while praying, that is His business.With this in mind, I believe that most anyone who reads Fr. Pennington's book could profitably practice Centering Prayer"},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I bought this book for a friend who was interested in learning Centering Prayer.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form","review":"I believe that the author is well-intentioned; however, the \\"centering\\" in this book seems to refer to clearing one's mind and hoping that God will come in. Well nature abhors a vacuum--SOMETHING will come in all right. This \\"vacuum\\" is the same major fault with trancendental and other New Age meditations.While trying to make God the center of your life/thoughts is admirable, creating a spiritual \\"vaccum\\" is dangerous.The traditional form of (Christian) meditation is rather to concentrate on something positive--God Himself through the mysteries in His revealed Word. There is never any vacuum created with its concomitant dangers.The Rosary is an excellent way to accomplish this tradional Christian meditation--by meditating on God directly through the Gospel mysteries. This is far better, less dangerous and spirtually more profitable, than emptying one's self and hoping that what fills the resultant vacuum is good rather than evil.Although the author is probably well-intentioned, I fear this book might mislead some, or get others into trouble. It is better avoided."},{"Title":"Awakening Beauty","review":"I think i've only read one of her books i didn't like.

All religions imply achieving the upper worlds after one's physical death. Our generation, however, wants to be happy here and now. Instead, many people feel 'kinda bored and empty'. Little pleasures of this world alone (food, sex, money, power, knowledge, etc.) do not seem to fulfill their needs anymore, and they don't want to die to feel something bigger or better. Where is the way out?Kabbalah teaches us how to achieve and enjoy the upper worlds while still living in this world. The book \\"Attaining the Worlds Beyond\\" helps you prepare yourself for this journey, to perform some necessary improvements within. As you read it you will realize that Kabbalah is a rather practical, experimental science. You are the researcher, and the subject of the experiment is your own soul. Of course, you will learn something from this book alone. But using it as a practical guide, you will discover much more within yourself. Good Luck!

All of these principals are brought by Rav Laitman in easy to follow format and yet it is easy but not oversimplified. I felt like the mystery was unveiling in front of me.

I also purchased other books by this author that were described as more introductory works. Rav Michael Laitman is a teacher/author that should not be overlooked. This material has had a profound effect on me. There is a lot here, and it seems like every time you read it there is a lot more you missed. There is much more information available at Bnei Baruch- Kabbalah Research and Education Institute website.

Written by someone who was at least not a charlatan. Like thousands of other people I have always been plagued by this question \\"What is the meaning of my life ?\\" So many books have been written on the subject already and none of them that I have read, have really struck a chord with me, nor did religious explanations.This book was very different from the moment I started to read it because it really hit me like the proverbial ton of bricks. I didn't always find myself agreeing with what the author had written - I actually found some of it very hard to accept. But actually the more I read the parts I didn't agree with, the more I realised there was something genuine behind them. The more I read this book the harder I found it to actually put it down. It became quite apparent that the author was genuine and sincere in his writings, and had no ulterior motive.The book is a practical guide to how a person can come to a realisation of a completely different reality in a very practical manner.

As an \\"evening's read\\" I felt like Harvest was sitting next to me having a conversation about her grandmother and the wisdom she passed on regarding sacred plants. As a reference work, I found Sacred Smoke to be filled with well documented herbal facts and sources that are organized for easy reference.One of the difficulties any author faces with works of this type is how to impart knowledge on paper that can really only be learned through experience. Harvest succeeds marvelously in this by introducing concepts, then directing the reader to other sources for further research - including the internet - all the while continually reminding us to seek out our own elders and find our own traditions.In short, Harvest has crafted a book that should be of great interest both to beginning students and experienced herbalists.It's been a long time since I've found a book I was so happy to have in my library for many years to come!Voice of Golden Eaglemusician, dreamer..."},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"I have long been interested in the use of plants by various cultures around the world, and it was this fascination that led me to Harvest McCampbell's wonderful book.Sacred Smoke details the sacred practice of smudging, the ceremonial burning of aromatic herbs by many Native American tribes.The book offers detailed information on eighteen plants: Balsam Fir, Bayberry, California Bay, cedar, Desert Sage, Epazote, Fennel, Hemlock, Juniper. Mint, Mullein, Mugwort, Pine, Spruce, Sweet Grass, Uva Ursi, Wild Tobacco and Yerba Santa. Information includes cultural uses, growing tips, a list of nurseries where plants may be obtained, and even an extensive listing of related web links. The information is detailed and very well organized.However, it is the personal accounts by the author that makes this book so special. I particularly loved the section on suffering. She writes of embracing suffering instead of trying to rise above it: \\"The mosquito suffers in the dragonfly's jaws so that there will always be dragonflies. The dragonfly suffers in the little bird's beak so there will always be little birds. The little bird suffers in the hawk's talons so there will always be hawks. I suffer the bite of the mosquito, so there will always be dragonflies, little birds and hawks.\\"In short, this is a beautifully-written, insightful book that deserves a space on every nature lover's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"All that you need to know about the art of smudging (purification with sacred plants and fire) is contained within the pages of this well-written, informative, and interesting book. One of the most highly respected and nationally known Native American herbalists today, Harvest began her training at the knee of her Native grandmother. She has been healing and educating others for over 20 years, and few herbalists today can claim the scope of knowledge that she possesses. Harvest wrote this greatly expanded second edition of her popular first self-published work from the seclusion of her home in a small northern California native community. As an herbalist and an educator, Harvest is unsurpassed in her knowledge and skills as well as her ability to relate to people of all ages and backgrounds. If you buy one book about herbs this summer, let it be Sacred Smoke."},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art Of Smudging For Modern Times by Harvest McCampbell (who began her studies of herbs, smudging, and ritual with her Iroquois Onondaga Oswegatchie grandmother) is an informative and informed, step-by-step, \\"user friendly\\" guide to the spiritual practice of burning herbs, as undertaken by Native Americans for generations. A deeply respectful accounting of this enlightening and meditative practice, Sacred Smoke is a unique and enthusiastically recommended contribution to Native Am-erican Studies reference collections and Metaphysical Studies reading lists."},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"I recommend Sacred Smoke for anyone who is interested in American Indian rituals, herbs, and smudging. This book gives a brief overview of which plants/herbs one can use to smudge, make tea and/or crafts, and use as a healing aid (i.e., poultice). This gives a great insight as to how each plant is used in Native Medicine. I'd keep a copy on hand to refer back to, and would purchase for a friend. Namaste!"},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"If you are looking for a book that gives you comprehensive information on performing the act of smudging, this is NOT the book for you. It has about 2 pages on the act of smudging and about a third of that is in the context of Native American and other culture rituals. What this book does very well is to give you historical and Native American cultural information related to smudging. Thee bulk of this book is about how to gather and prepare the resources you will use in smudging with a particular perspective on the spiritual aspects. If that is what you seek, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"After not being able to purchase a Sage stick I bought this book based on other costumer's reviews in order to not only learn about performing the cleansing with Sage, but how to do my own Sage stick as well.I was so happy that I got to learn about the culture, knowledge and rituals from the Native American People with this book, as well as many other plants that can be used for incense and how they are used in other ways; for example: in cooking, crafts and herbal medicine!I am so glad I purchased this book it was useful and beautiful, it exceeded my expectations!"},{"Title":"Sacred Smoke: The Ancient Art of Smudging for Modern Times","review":"This book is exactly what I was looking for.

Very educational and uplifting."},{"Title":"Persuasion and healing: A comparative study of psychotherapy","review":"Jerome Frank published the first edition of this book almost fifty years ago. Its message is still very relevant, perhaps even more relevant today. Psychotherapy is a form of persuasion and healing and as such, shares many features with other ways of influencing found in different cultures. Its essence, therefore, may not be located in the specific techniques that distinguish one brand of \\"evidence-based\\" (or not) therapy from another, but in over-riding considerations, such as the power of a given therapist to engender hope, the vividness of the therapist as a modifying vector, the alliance between therapist and patient, the fit between the tools of the therapist and the conceptualizations of the patient. It is important for a therapist to be solidly grounded in one or more theoretical approaches, but this mainly because such grounding increases the probability of the aforementioned influences on change becoming manifest, or strengthens them. This is a politically incorrect book if you subscribe to the limited medical model of psychotherapy presented as the only paradigm in most psychology programs today. However, if you take a longer view, and actually a view better supported by the evidence carefully considered, this book is a standout in the field of psychotherapy theory."},{"Title":"Persuasion and healing: A comparative study of psychotherapy","review":"This is an outstanding book for anyone interested in how people think, and how people can change the way they think, feel and relate to others. A wonderful survey of the research literature on psychotherapy, but also a great overview for anyone interested in changing others' attitudes and behavior. The topics are relevant and the authors' writing is succinct, clear and engaging. The models of depression, anxiety, inhibition and psychological change are very helpful to anyone in any of the helping fields."},{"Title":"Humanization and the Politics of God: The Koinonia Ethics of Paul Lehmann","review":"This book is a great tool for better understanding Lehmann. After several weeks of slogging through Ethics in a Christian Context, I was relieved to find this book. However, I was really disappointed to find that it did not have a topical index. I had to search all through the book for things I was trying to look up. I happen to know that an index was written, I just don't know what happened to it. But I would definitely recommend this book if the concepts of humanization and koinonia are confusing you."},{"Title":"Kipton and Gruff (Kipton , Vol 1)","review":"but I want to anyway. This is the begining of a series in a neglected area of writing... Science Fiction for young girls. When I was growing up, if you were female and liked science fiction, you read the boy's books because all of the younger girl's books were fantasy. This award winning series was begun for Fontenay's granddaughter, so that she would have something to read with a strong young female character that was science fiction. It's a complete break from either his esoteric writings or his adult science fiction. The stories are enjoyable and realistic with well drawn characters and thought provoking plots. In this first of the series, Uncle Charlie is killed and Kipton is the only one who can find out how... and more importantly why... while going through her own struggles of being somewhere between a child and adult. It's a really good mystery, set on Mars, with great, loveable characters. My house is now populated with Gruffs...."},{"Title":"Kipton and Gruff (Kipton , Vol 1)","review":"This is the opening story in a series of YA books about the character named Kipton, a 14 year old girl living in an earth colony on the planet Mars.

The pair follow the trail that leads them to many interesting twists and turns until they solve the case."},{"Title":"All Fall Down Pb (Big Books)","review":"This book is a great book that even the kids can tell the story themselves! My son loves this book, and I will keep it forever for him, so we can have the many memories of the first book he ever told the story himself! Great fun!"},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"Former major league player and coach Tom House's work is a guide for both pitchers and pitching coaches alike. He explains why a different pitch only effects a change in neuromuscular sequencing for the forearm, wrist, elbow and fingers and that is only a change in the angle. The different angles of the forearm, wrist, hand and fingers alter the speed, spin and path of the pitch (velocity, rotation and flight). The angle is more important than the actual grip in effecting the pitch as every pitch leaves the middle finger last. The ideal book on velocity and rotation optimization."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"Tom House combines science and experience to develop a pitching technique that minimizes arm injuries and maximizes an individual's strength. Debunks several commonly taught techniques while showing optimum throwing position. Taught myself how to pitch AFTER pitching in college and wanted to learn &quot;correct&quot; way to teach my sons how to pitch!"},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"A FEW YEARS AGO I MOVED DOWN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE LEVEL. THAT FIRST YEAR I LOST ALL MY GAMES. I FELT TERRIBLE. I TAUGHT THE PLAYERS EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT DEFENSE AND HITTING. I REALIZED THAT AT THE LITTLE LEAGUE LEVEL MORE TIME SHOULD BE SPENT ON PITCHING. I LOOKED FOR HELP AND FOUND TOM HOUSE'S BOOK THE PITCHING EDGE. THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND THIS LAST YEAR I MADE IT TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER COMING IN LAST THAT FIRST YEAR. I'VE PLAYED BASEBALL FOR YEARS AND PITCHED, BUT THIS BOOK ALSO SHOWED ME NOT HOW BUT WHY. THIS IS WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I UNDERSTOOD WHY AND THEN THEY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE BODY MUST MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS. HIGHLY RECOMENDED."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"Tom House first breaks down the mechanics of pitching into frames and/or steps. He illustrates what is happening to the legs, torso, head and arms (what both arms are doing is important) at each step. Tom presents all of this in a simple, understandable manner. No scientific mumbo jumbo. Even a Father whose last baseball was high school 35 years ago can understand how to help their young pitcher.Dr. House has updated the book and video based on kinetic computer studies showing that the glove hand does not &quot;drive&quot; down on the good pitchers. I reccommend both the book and video together as each complements the other."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"This is absolutely essential reading. This book represents a new generation of thinking about sporting biomechanics that is scientifically based. Although some of the old pearls of wisdom based on intuition have been confirmed to some degree, too many past teachings handed down by word of mouth seem like old wives' tales. In fact things such the glove arm driving down are worse than old wives' tales because they can lead to excessive stress on the pitching arm, and so will lead to injury. From now on the critical pitcher will demand that any hypothesis about pitching mechanics be scientifically proven to be safe and sound rather than uncritically swollowing any old snake oil that could lead to a devastating career ending injury.It should be bourne in mind that the language used is also scientifically exacting such that many younger readers may encounter difficulty. A glossary of terms such as &quot;supination&quot; and &quot;pronation&quot; needs to be provided in a future edition. This is really serious reading for the serious player and coach to be read again and again."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"I wish this book was around when I was pitching in high school and college. It would have helped me in countless ways (better fundamentals, skill work, and specific exercises for pitchers). Now I'm 44 and pitching in an over 40 league!If you are in high school or older I highly recommend this book. Dad, it would be good for you to read and then use it to teach a younger baseball player. If you are a high school or college coach, you OWE it to your kids to read this and help them.Good Luck."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids. It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches. For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, &quot;A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball.&quot; What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"The pitching edge is a very good book for pitching coaches and high school-collegiate athletes. Tom uses a lot of material that might be to complex for younger readers. Tom does a great job in research and describes and shows why and how to use proper pitching mechanics. He also decribes how to use different cycles for different pitchers and this would help the inexperienced pitching coach."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"Tom House covers everything in this book. From strength training to mental training. This is the best book to buy if you are interested in improving Your pitching. The book is a great help for both the pitcher and the coach. I made my league's All-Star team thanks to this book."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"If you're just starting to pitch or have been pitching for years this book is defiantly for you. This book defiantly answered some of the questions that I had about pitching. My arm had been hurting early in the season for about the past three years. As I was reading I came upon a section that told you how to take care of your arm but, it also told you how to make it stronger in the off season. If you're having trouble getting guys out on a 0-2 pitch they give new pitches to try.The person that wrote this book, Tom House, is defiantly in front of his time when it comes to pitching. He was a major league pitching coach for a number of years, so you know that it's going to be valuable things that you're learning. One of the best things that I liked about this book is that it had major leaguers telling their experiences with the book and that it actually helped their pitching game.In this book it doesn't just tell you how to keep your arm in shape or throwing new pitches. It also teaches you how to make your arm stronger so you can get more velocity on your fastball. It gives you about 25 different lifts with dumb bells that work your rotator cuff. It also gives you stretches that can make your arm much more limber so you can get more velocity on your ball.I really like this book and I think that it's is perfect for all pitching ages. I liked it because it gave major league advice. It was a book written by a very respectable pitching coach that defiantly knows his stuff. You know that when you pick up this book you are going to get very valuable information. I know that if I ever have a question about pitching then I know where to look."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"I've been coaching my son in his pitching for the last four years now, and this is definitely the best book on technique and skill development I've ever encountered. It really breaks down the sequence of motion, gives pertinent and effective drills to use and deals with both the physical and mental aspects of pitching. Tom House really knows his stuff!"},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"The Pitching Edge was written by the former pitching coach of the Texas Rangers. He was innovative and sometimes controversial. This tome is comprehensive, covering the physical, training and mental aspect of being a quality pitcher. The book is not necessarily aimed at youth, but I have used the to help my under 10 year old player learn the basics.I found that some of the language in the book to be loosely used and obtuse. Therefore I doubt that a young reader would get everything the book has to offer. However, especially when used in conjunction with the companion video, this book is a great springboard for the young pitcher when guided by an adult. (See my review of the video for more detail)One qualifier is required. House does not agree that young pitchers should be restricted from throwing breaking pitches. That was against convention when the book was released 10 years ago and convention has not changed. For further reference you could check the USABaseball web site for a great positon paper. Simply add (slash)med_position_statement(dot)html to the root url to see the page. These athletes are at beginning of their pro careers and this statement is about how to get them to this state.I give my ranking about all the other items in the book exclusive of the breaking pitch advice for youth pitchers. I have not allowed my young pitcher to start throwing those types of pitches for fear of arm injury."},{"Title":"The Pitching Edge-2nd","review":"Again, Tom House gives excellent advice and scientific information to help coaches and parent develop good healthy young pitchers. A must read for pitching coaches and parents of potential pitchers."},{"Title":"Diana: A Strange Autobiography","review":"On the PBS show, \\"History Detectives\\", July 2010 (Episode 806, Story 2), the history of this book is researched. History Detectives confirms that the book was written by Frances Rummel, who died in 1969. Rummel's niece confirms that Frances was Lesbian and that the story is based on Rummel's real life experiences. For instance, as in the book, Rummel studied in Europe, became a French professor, and then a writer. Ms. Rummel was living in New York in 1939, the year the book was published. It is thought that the book would have been less likely to have been censored if published as an autobiography.Her niece does not believe the book is an autobiography, but rather a novel based on Rummel's life. Even so, her niece believes the book is Rummel's \\"emotional autobiography\\".Link to the transcript of the History Detectives episode: [...]."},{"Title":"Diana: A Strange Autobiography","review":"This book was originally published in 1935. I was surprised to find that it was an honest, realistic telling of one woman's journey to accepting her orientation and owning love. No sensationalism here. One of the scenes was so startlingly similar to an experience of mine that I felt the hairs on the back of my neck raise. A lesbian-positive book that really brings forth the idea of authentic living and how to get there.

It has now found a place of honor on my shelves. It takes you on Diana's journey through her self-discovery as a lesbian, through her brother's rejection of it, to the pain of heartbreak, to the lover that was a recurring interference, and to finally resting comfortably and contendly in the arms of the love that would be to stay. The book takes you through her childhood, her travels, and her education. She presents the story of a lesbian who is not out to emmasculate men, nor to promote women as the supreme goddess. She simply walked the road of her soul."},{"Title":"Diana: A Strange Autobiography","review":"This book had me curious to begin with. It was written in 1939 and I was just fascinated with how it was like for a lesbian in that period. I loved the way the chapters were written and her introduction to the characters made me want to turn the page even more. I loved her psychology references as she attempts to explain why she and other's in her life are lesbians. It was enlightening to read her perspective of that time of life. I really enjoyed this book, however the words and lingo used in 1939 are quite different than the way we talk now. Even though I was expecting this.....I was marveled by how much I didn't know. This book I was going to share this book but I am keeping this one for my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Diana: A Strange Autobiography","review":"This tells it like it was at that time for a Lesbian or questioning women.

I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to learn more about the Lesbian community and how the world tends to see/treat it."},{"Title":"Diana: A Strange Autobiography","review":"I have recently read this autobiography and I must say it was a wonderful book. It was a real page turner and I read it in one sitting. The author tells the story of her life as a lesbian and the various relationships she went through. What was most poignant I thought was how the authors story is one which I believe many lesbian women can relate to and even though it was written in 1939 it just as well could have been written today with perhaps a few minor exceptions.

He was my favorite teacher, and the favorite of many of my fellow law students, for several reasons: first of all, he had an excellent command of the law. There wasn't an aspect of it he didn't know. Secondly, he taught in a clear and concise manner. Many of my law professors were \\"hide-the-ball\\" types: their clumsy use of the Socratic method left students lost and confused. When Professor Beyer lectured, you knew exactly what point he was trying to make. You didn't have to guess at it. Finally, he was a warm, friendly, humorous guy - very approachable and not at all intimidating, a rare trait in a lawyer. This book is everything Professor Beyer is: knowledgeable, approachable, and clear. And as a rookie attorney in the field of wills, trusts, and estate planning, this is the book I turn to first and foremost as a reference. That said, I believe this book is most appropriate for law students, paralegals, practicing attorneys, and others who need a serious grasp of wills, trusts, and estate planning law. Those who want a simple, cursory introduction may find themselves overwhelmed by all the legal jargon - as was mentioned by a previous reviewer."},{"Title":"Wills, Trusts & Estates: Examples & Explanations, Second Edition (Examples & Explanations Series)","review":"it's a good book but you should keep in hand a law dictionary."},{"Title":"Nobody's Home: Speech, Self, and Place in American Fiction from Hawthorne to DeLillo","review":"Arnold Weinstein is one of our most gifted literary comparativists working in the academy today, and Nobody's Home is Weinstein at his absolute best.

His ability to link these seemingly disparate texts in such convincing fashion is quite extraordinary (the web never falters), and allows Weinstein an entry way into readings that make these texts utterly relevant to our lives today, and that reawaken texts that have been relegated to dusty bookshelves, or that were thought to have been plumbed.

From Descarte's turn inward to Kant's radical autonomy, the Enlightenement gave birth to our understanding of freedom. Here, the Western intellectual tradtion separated the self from Nature and God, from any determining context. Essentially, it was the isolated self which gave meaning to, instead of finding meaning in the world. There are some that claim, however, that a self requires and is a causal function of Larger contexts like Culture, Family, Tradition and Religion (to name a few). Thus, it is dangerous and misleading to separate a self from the very material it requires to live. On this reading, the expressions of self are necesserily embedded in a context which presupposes a social world and shared set of meanings - a set of meanings that cannot be created by an isolated, radically free ego. To the contrary, an ego is a function of this world and requires it as a context for expression. Without these objective situations which enframe self, freedom and speech, the self is emptied of necessary content and confronts [our modern illness of] loneliness and despair. At this juncture, one could, vis a vis existentialism, search out the subjective depths of human angst, or one could assume a number of ironic postures in hopes of illustrating the human struggle with, and possibilities for freedom and meaning in a meaninglessness age. NOBODY'S HOME, somehow, shows a unique strain of literature that does both.

One other bonus to this installment in the Jillian Jiggs series is the instructions in the back of the book on how to make your own 'Wonderful Pigs'."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Pigs of Jillian Jiggs","review":"Greatly disappointed that I paid over $6.00 for a book that turned out to be a pamphlet size booklet."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Millionaires","review":"A wonderful book with many real life examples on how to make every dollar work for you, how to set and achieve wealth goals, get organized for success, apply the principles and laws for success.

Well, all your questions are answered in this wonderful follow-up to &quot;Lucy's Bones &amp; Sacred Stones.&quot; This book like the previous one has me wanting to visit the worlds museums to get a glimse of these amazing artifacts from our history.

Highly recommended for a fun and easy read."},{"Title":"Jumbo's Hide, Elvis's Ride, and the Tooth of Buddha: More Marvelous Tales of Historical Artifacts","review":"Rachlin has again compiled a wonderful hodgepodge of historical trivia and lost artifacts. Those of you who read his first book (Lucy's Bones. . . ) will find, however, that his approach to the collection has changed. In Jumbo's Hide, Rachlin has included much more side information and background on the objects instead of sticking to what is promised: what happened to the artifcats, who possesed them, and where are they now. This book reads more like a historical textbook than the collection of mysteries that it is. In fact, Rachlin sometimes adds the actual ownership history of the artifact as a footnote to the story.If you are just an amateur historian, this collection is interesting. However, if you already know your world history, you will find this book much more tedious to read than his first."},{"Title":"Jumbo's Hide, Elvis's Ride, and the Tooth of Buddha: More Marvelous Tales of Historical Artifacts","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Kolawole's essays do an excellent job in capturing one African woman's perspective. I gave it 4 stars because she asks us not generalize and group all African women's experiences, yet frequently makes overarching statements about African women's values.Great academic text and is very helpful in my analysis of other ways African women operate in the private sphere."},{"Title":"The Light Shall Set You Free","review":"I am about midway through this volume and wanted to take the time to share my thoughts on it.I find that the material discussed is extremely helpful. An open mind is needed, I believe, to assimilate the ideas. A desire and an interest in rising above the common historically accepted understanding of reality is also needed.Material (energy) comes into our existence when the time is beneficial for us to have it. If this subject interests you, there is a good chance you are meant to understand it at this time. I know this book would be written off as \\"New Age Fiction\\" by many that are not ready to receive its powerful messages. So be it.The messages, if you are ready, will help clarify what seems to be a chaotic existence. Once clarification and understanding come, we can then begin to consiously create our existence. We are creating now, although many of us do not know it. Everything in this material world, all the events that happen to us, be it negative or positive, are created by us first on our mental and spiritual levels. Nothing happens to us by chance, it is all a result of our actions on the mental and spiritual levels. Our thoughts are the \\"creative seeds\\" that blossom into our reality. If we can understand this, or at least consider it worthy of investigation, then isn't learning more about it worth our time?Taking responsibility for our creative power and using it to bring happiness is one of the central themes of this book. I found it to be most helpful. We can learn to create our utopia, if we do not, we are tossed around like a small boat in waves of energy, with no direction and a feeling of helplessness.Spiritual development isn't easy. It is, however, vital to peace and happiness. A house will not stand without a strong foundation. Ascending is our right, it is our very purpose. Whether you choose to is up to you (which is also your right).I know of no one volume that will universally explain reality to all that read it. Teachers are sent to us, as we as teachers are sent to others. A teacher to one is may be perceived as nothing but a \\"looney\\" to another. Personally, I found that I've needed to research a lot of material to begin to \\"put the pieces together\\" in terms of what really is. This volume is one of those pieces for me. It has been of great help to me."},{"Title":"The Light Shall Set You Free","review":"I thought I'd add my review to this short list of reviews because I found my everyday life and my Dreamtime experience to be greatly enhanced when I read this wonderful book by Norma Milanovich.After I read 'We The Arcturians', I bought 'The Light Shall Set You Free'. The first time I opened it, I was on a short solo camping trip to a favorite spot in the Zaleski Sate Forest near Lake Hope here in beautiful Ohio. That night, I read about 30 or 40 pages and then went to sleep. I am someone who love and uses crystals, and I had some with me that night. I set them up at the 6 corners of my hexagonal tent. I also had one hanging straight down over me from the roof supports and one around my neck. Well, that night my body was full of electricity as I was visited by 8 Ascended Masters! My dreams were all lucid as one Master after another would come to me (in the tent!) and deposit geometry into my body. Can you believe it! I tell you, this book contains very high vibrations and those vibrations are trasnsmitted into your 4 bodies (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual) when you read it, much like the channeled material of Barbara Marciniak. I recommend these books by Norma Milanovich because she has a direct link that she shares through these books. I understand she has workshops also, but a healer may want to have the reward for healing to just be the fact that she is able to do the healing and not have it be alot of money for further information installments. This same experience recurs whenever I open the book and read another chapter, another Universal Law. In any case, get this book and launch your earth-bound self to heaven as your Higher Self gets grounded here on the planet Earth... OK? It's worth the small donation to her bank account only if you believe the material as I do.

The Cosmic Laws and sub-laws are clearly described. The list in the very front of the book about Light Workers' Code of Behavior alone has such profound logic which cuts right through societal negative programming that it makes the investment price a total bargain!

I do not spend my Saturdays going from mall to mall on the quest for the perfect pair of slacks. I rarely enjoy a trip to my corner market unless they are giving out free tastes of their wares around each aisle corner so as to keep the kids busy. And, I am not going to fill up my already-full house with more stuff from garage sales.But, I am a frugal woman and I enjoy the hunt and fresh kill of a good bargain! Ms. Moore sounds like she truly enjoys her shopping adventures, and her little stories that accompany her tips are quite fun. The meat of this book is written within the stories, giving advice from how to find the diamond in the rough from a re-sale clothing store, to how to buy the best items from the comfort of your living room.Marlene gives you tips and anecdotes for nearly every imaginable shopping adventure, so there&#65533;s surely something within the covers of her book for everyone. My husband got a big kick out of the thong advice, and I even caught him repeating it to his mother on the telephone! I shook my head with understanding over the chapter on bras; and 30 years after needing my first one, I have still not found the ultimate comfort supporter. But, I sure have a drawer full of duds!I recommend you pick up Hunting for Mr. Good Bargain, and enjoy this fun read while you are making out your next &#65533;I want&#65533; list.

But what each one wanted was very different. Monica wanted home, family, loving husband while Daniel wanted fame. They had a fight in which Daniel walked out on her and they never spoke again... but what Daniel didn't know was when he walked out, Monica was pregnant. She never told him about the baby. After becoming a believer she decided that it was unfair to Daniel and her daughter to keep it a secret any longer. He returned to Boise (where they grew up) for some R&R and she contacts him and over coffee she breaks the news. He's shocked, angry and now ready to meet his daughter. He finds himself warming to both Monica and his daughter. They have fun together and enjoy each others company. But will it last. He is due to return to Chicago (where his business is).

The sequels a all the same... boring."},{"Title":"Llana Of Gathol (Mars #10)","review":"\\"Llana of Gathol\\" is the oddest book in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Martian series for a couple of reasons. First, it is not a novel per se, but a collection of four novellas that ERB wrote for \\"Amazing Stories\\" in 1941. Consequently, it has more of the feel of a sequel than most of the Martian books. Second, there is a healthy suspicion that Burroughs was having a bit of fun with the formula he had made so successful in his pulp fiction yarns set on Barsoom. In other words, if you think of these stories as being parodies you are going to enjoy them a lot more than if you try to take them at face value as adventures. Llana is John Carter's granddaughter and the daughter of Gahan of Gathol and Tara of Helium and she is the requisite damsel in distress.\\"The Ancient Dead\\" (originally published as \\"The City of Mummies\\") begins with John Carter out for a ride in his flier, saving a white man with yellow hair from a horde of green men, and ending up the prisoner of Ho Ran Kim, the Jeddak of Horz. Pan Dan Chee, the man Carter rescues, becomes his friend and while playing jetan with Carter's personal set, Pan Dee Chee falls in love with the piece fashioned to look like Llana. You have to admit this is a funny idea, and you have to laugh at the twist ERB comes up with for the \\"hero must fight for princess\\" bit that is a staple of his adventures once Llana literally pops up in the story.\\"The Black Pirates of Barsoom\\" picks up where the previous story left off, with our trio walking back to Helium, and is basically one of those stories when John Carter and his group are enslaved and his fighting prowess gets him sent to the arena. There is an imaginative machine that helps keep the slaves in line, but overall there is nothing here that we have not seen before in this series. Meanwhile, Llana continues to act like a brat and put Pan Dan Chee through the wringer in clearly tongue-in-cheek fashion.\\"Escape on Mars\\" (originally published as \\"Yellow Men of Mars\\") finds the gang in the vicinity of Gathol, which is being attacked by Hin Abtol, the self-proclaimed Jeddak of Jeddaks of the North. This is the story where Llana has to be rescued (come on, you know it was coming) and finds John Carter being rather glib when it comes to the \\"to be continued\\" climax.\\"Invisible Men of Mars\\" has Carter trying to deal with Llana's romantic problems and the fact that he needs to have the fleet of Helium teach Hin Abtol a lesson about trying to conquer the world. He also has to deal with Rojas, a girl he picks up on the way and who keeps throwing herself at him in a way that makes La of Opar look like a nun (keep in mind, John Carter is a grandfather at this point). The big climax is standard ERB fare except the author is clearly having too much fun.As I indicated above, if you take these stories seriously you are clearly missing the point. During this period Burroughs was into the idea of self-parody, and you can find similar satirical stories in both the Tarzan and Pellucidar series. I like the contrast between Carter being in the forefront with the heroic deeds while Llana toys with Pan Dan Chee in the romantic subplot. The results are not great, but certainly enjoyable, as is the wry sense of humor that the Warlord of Mars has suddenly developed (e.g., at the end of the first story he confesses to Pan Dan Chee, \\"Well, I never did understand women\\")."},{"Title":"Llana Of Gathol (Mars #10)","review":"\\"Llana of Gathol\\" is the 10th of 11 John Carter of Mars books that Edgar Rice Burroughs left to the world. This book is comprised of four linked short tales that first appeared in \\"Amazing Stories Magazine\\" from March to October 1941. Each of these stories is around 50 pages in length and is made up of 13 very short chapters. In the first tale, \\"The Ancient Dead,\\" John Carter goes for a spin in his flier to get away from it all, and winds up in the ancient Barsoomian city of Horz. This long-dead city, however, turns out to be anything but. In \\"The Black Pirates of Barsoom,\\" Carter discovers an enclave of the First Born (last seen in book 2, \\"The Gods of Mars\\") and is forced to fight in their gladiator-style games. In \\"Escape on Mars,\\" Carter goes to the aid of the besieged city of Gathol, and winds up stealing a battleship and putting together an untrustworthy crew of mercenaries and assassins. Finally, in \\"Invisible Men of Mars,\\" Carter and his granddaughter, the eponymous Llana, come upon the lost city of Invar, and its invisible inhabitants. Space does not permit me to go into the remarkable plot twists and surprises that this book offers. Each of the tales is a little gem of swift-moving action, but this time presented with a decidedly lighthearted touch. For all the serious goings-on, this Carter volume features the most humor yet seen in the series. This combination of deadly action, presented with a light tone, is a very appealing one. The book is also something of a nostalgia piece; of all the books in the series, this one refers back to events in previous volumes more than any of the others. Indeed, I can hardly see how a reader could really enjoy this collection without a thorough knowledge of ALL the previous entries in the series. And in addition to previous events being referred to, we also see, in \\"Llana of Gathol,\\" the return of several characters from earlier volumes: Ptor Fak from \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" Tan Hadron from \\"A Fighting Man of Mars,\\" Zithad from \\"The Gods of Mars\\" and so on. This harking back to old events and characters strikes me as being not repetitive, as some readers have claimed, but a nice, almost nostalgic tribute to past events. The book also features one of the longest and nastiest sword fights that Carter has ever engaged in; the one with Motus, in the city of Invar. This is one memorable sequence, indeed. Carter is told several times during the course of this novel, by one or another of his many enemies, that \\"Resistance is futile.\\" I can't help wondering whether the creators of Star Trek's Borg menace were Burroughs fans! Anyway, these short-story gems will certainly entertain any lover of fast-moving sci-fi/fantasy.All of which is not to say that the book contains no problems, however. Like ALL the previous books in the Carter series, this one contains some doozies. For example, the use of outrageous coincidence, while frequent in past volumes, is waaay overused in this book. I refer here to the coincidence of bumping into Llana in Horz and the coincidence of meeting the brother of Janai (heroine of book 9, \\"Synthetic Men of Mars\\"), not to mention the coincidence of meeting all the other \\"old friends\\" mentioned above. Worse still is the fact that by the book's end, the fate of several of the main characters remains unknown; e.g., the fate of Hin Abtol, the main villain of the saga, and of Tan Hadron and Fo-Nar. We are told by Carter at one point that he will soon explain how the First Born have come to be in the lost rift valley, but he never gets around to it. There are the usual inconsistencies that pop up, too: Why do the CLOTHES of the invisible inhabitants of Invar become invisible also? Why haven't the CLOTHES of the living dead in Horz not long since disintegrated? How is Carter able to read the hieroglyphs on the king's crown in Invar, when in previous books Burroughs has told us that each city has its own written symbols? Why is it necessary for Hin Abtol's ships to drop men with equilibrimotors (flying belts) into the besieged city of Gathol, when these soldiers could just fly in themselves? I should perhaps add at this point that I have been told by one of the founders of the ERB List (the best Burroughs Website that any fan could ever hope for) that many of these errors and discrepancies are absent from the original versions of the Carter books, but only added later by addle-brained copy editors. I can only speak of what I have read (the Ballantine/DelRey paperbacks from the early '80s), and these books are something of a mess. Still, the vision of Burroughs does manage to shine through, and despite the glitches, this book is a veritable packet of wonders."},{"Title":"Llana Of Gathol (Mars #10)","review":"\\"Llana of Gathol\\" is an excellent volume in the Barsoom series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the last published during ERB's lifetime. The case could be made that this is not merely the last novel (or collection of novellaes as some would have it), but the literary apex of the John Carter of Mars series. Although it is divided into four main sections, and the chapters bear the earmarks of serialization, there is a clear continuity throughout the book, and this work displays the most sophisticated literary approach of any of the Mars books.But not too sophisticated, and not so sophisticated as to drain the pleasure out of reading, the optimism out of the writing, and the courage and heroism out of the characters.John Carter, Warlord of Mars, goes off exploring the dead sea beds and ancient cities of Barsoom, only to find that an abandoned city isn't as abandoned as he thought. He runs into the oldest race of Mars, escapes from them to be taken by the Black Pirates of Mars, frees himself from them to find one of his allied cities under seige by an upstart who wishes to conquer all of Mars, and ends up at the mercy of the invisible men of Mars. Along the way, he rescues his granddaughter (Llana of Gathol) from kidnappers, makes snide remarks about her smitten suitor, kills a bunch of bad guys, steals aircraft, and generally acts in his customary heroic fashion.Generally, John Carter alternates between being the Warlord of Mars, a slave, a fugitive, and a mercenary with gay abandon, crushing his enemies, seeing them driven before him, and listening to the lamentations of their wives and daughters as he embraces them (the wives and daughters, not the enemies). A rollicking good time for all.This is among the best of early science fiction, and all swords and leather jockstrap fiction.E. M.

These can be read individually, but of course they are really meant to be read in order to get the full story.The first one, THE ANCIENT DEAD, was my favorite. Where John Carter and a new ally are found in a dark pit where there are strange lights and laughing sounds.When Llana of Gathol makes an appearance, you can probably guess what happens to her . . . yeah, THAT . . . again (yawn).Only this time it happens to her twice.For all of John Carter's braggy talk of being the \\"best swordsman of two worlds\\" he sure is dumb as a brick when it comes to preventing the women from getting kidnapped!Fortunately, this book covers A LOT of territory on Barsoom, revisiting old destinations and often meeting up with old friends. Although this was not the last John Carter story, it feels like it should have been because it does give a lot of closure to the series.Parody or not, this story is very entertaining, but it may still leave one wishing that ERB could have been just a TAD more creative than to whip up a plot of \\"Our Princess Has Once Again Been Kidnapped\\"."},{"Title":"Llana Of Gathol (Mars #10)","review":"This is book 10 in the Burroughs Mars series.

It surprised me that there are so many men's hairstyles, but this is a funny book, nonetheless. I do think, though, that there could have been some more modern atrocities included with the 60's and 70's hairdos. To me, it seems natural that the worst looks would have come out of those decades. Everything else seemed ugly, too. I also noticed, in reading the credits in the back of the book, that some of the 'bad hair' came out of some of London's hippest salons. HA!"},{"Title":"Bad Hair","review":"I thought this book was quite entertaining. The only drawback was there was at least 1 hairstyle that looked... acceptable, not great, but still. I would recommend it as a funny gift to anyone!"},{"Title":"Bad Hair","review":"Bad Hair...what possessed me to buy this book? What possesses me to do anything I do? Who knows? But I am glad I dropped some coin and took a chance.You know those pictures they have in salons and barbershops that display different hairstyles? Have you ever seen any that looked like they've been up for quite awhile in that the style has gone out of fashion maybe two or three times since it was posted? Well, James Innes-Smith and Henrietta Webb went scavenging in hair chop shops to collect the worst of the worst of these pictures and compiled them here. What was their inspiration? Maybe the same thing that got me to buy the book.Within the pages of this book, you will see some of the most awful hairstyles, mullets, mutton chops, bobs, beehives, sideburns gone wide, more mullets, perms that defy description, and so much more...the horror...the horror....It's a smallish, hardbound book, just a bit larger than a Reader's Digest, and the one thing I noticed right away was there is absolutely no text (I'm quick like that). Just pages and pages of really atrocious hairstyles. Once you start looking through this book, you will understand why there is no text...it's not needed. Each picture speaks volumes. About two thirds of the pictures are black and white, with the other third in color.A fun little book, this would go nicely on your coffee table, if you're weird like me. Also, if you were ever interested in being a member of the Doobie Brothers, at least now you know where to find an appropriate hairstyle. I hope the authors come out with another book entitled Bad Combovers..."},{"Title":"Bad Hair","review":"What a brilliant idea for a book--a compendium of some of the more horrific hairstyles from the 1960s and 1970s, as taken from hair salon magazines and posters. Though there is practically no text accompanying the photographs, that's OK--this is definitely a case where a picture is worth 1,000 words (or 1,000 startled gasps!).I don't know why, but probably the first 3/4 of the book is men only--but the latter 1/4 of the book makes up for it with some of the weirdest, least flattering women's hairstyles you've ever seen in your life. You have to wonder if these poor women were drunk when they agreed to have these crimes committed on their heads. One of the more, um, interesting styles features a lovely model with gorgeous glossy hair--but the hair has been pulled forward to form a sort of chokehold collar around her neck, complete with Pop Art flower accessory. Then there are the woven helmets of hair--intricate braided and twisted creations that must have taken hours to put together but which are not flattering in the least.This would make a terrific gift for your favorite hairstylist, trendoid niece or nephew, or anyone who enjoys a good snicker. At this price, you can't beat it!"},{"Title":"Bad Hair","review":"This is the funniest book you'll ever SEE. You can't really say READ since there is no text. This book lives up to its name: it's just, soley, only comprised of screechingly funny photos of people with reaaaaaaaally BAD HAIR.Most of these unexplained pix clearly come from old hairdresser photos or product books put out by hair products. Most of the photo subjects are supremely self-absorbed -- thinking they look handsome, beautiful, cool but actually are, to use a modern word, &quot;dorky.&quot;The humor is not only in the truly rotten hairdos, or rather, the hair-don'ts. What's funny is how these folks think they look so good, proving that some peoples' taste lies exclusively in their mouths. You will be convinced that these model photos are really stills from Saturday Night Live or Mad Magazine -- but, no, these models enjoying Nirvana (how &quot;great&quot; they look) and the horrors on their scalps are for real.SO THE QUESTION IS: What use is a book that has no text and that only shows vile and putrid hair? Well, it makes a good and unusual gift. It's hard to see anyone selling their copy since it is the perfect &quot;bathroom book&quot; (right next to the mirror). Some of these follical creations are unfortunately not out of style. Looking at it will boost anyone's self-esteem (unless they are in the book). And if you have enemies give them a copy, paperclip a page and say, &quot;Hey, I saw this and it reminds me of YOU!&quot;So remember, this is a book you won't have to read -- just look at...and you'll laugh (unless you see an old photo of yourself or see a hairstyle that looks like what you have today).Bad Hair is just that -- a book of photos showing bad hair, proof of the eternal triumph of bad taste and a convincing argument that, in some cases, Bald is indeed Beautiful..."},{"Title":"Bad Hair","review":"I picked this up at the store wondering what kind of book is this?

These models were meant to look GOOD, that's what is so funny.

If the book didn't say MAGIC on the front, you wouldn't be able to tell it was based on the card game by reading it. Free of the constraints that writing a theme-based novel presents, this story was fun and exciting. The land of Cridhe was wonderfully vivid and the storyline progressed at a good pace, never becoming too slow, but still have enough meat to make the reader feel some attachment to the characters.By assuming a certain amount of freedom in her writing content, and not really trying to get elements from the MTG card game into the novel, McLaren produced a better and more unique work. Just as the writers and artists for the cards themselves have the ability (and neccessity) of creating new creatures and places, authors of these books should be allowed to expand the world of Magic the Gathering. There shouldn't be any limitations on the possibilities of MTG."},{"Title":"The Cursed Land (Magic: The Gathering)","review":"Teri McLaren weaves a tapestry of incredible proportions before the readers' eyes in The Cursed Land. It's beyond words. Her book is a must-read - even for those who have never heard of Magic: the Gathering.Sunshine wafts upon the villages with the opening. Teri's brilliant descriptions bring vitality and resplendence to what would normally be mundane. The author is also concise and unwasteful of words, even though her tale does not lose any flair or get too &quot;skinny&quot;. By the end of the first chapter, the life force of the Island of Cridhe has been destroyed, a few people meet unfortunate fates, the stars have fallen and the earth has turned inside out...and yet the story is still amazingly coherent and pleasurable to read. In the space of a few words Teri can create a chasm the size of the Grand Canyon and a villain who makes all of those slimy bad guys from other books seem tame.With her winding and sinuous story the author keeps the reader from falling over the rail. When you flip to the exhilarating ending (which is probably the best possible closing to the story there could be), you'll feel like you've been through a long journey...and you'll want to go back again.The Cursed Land warrants repeated reading, for who can hear the deadly lullabies of the magical shrouds, view the shimmering acorn of the Clan Tree, and witness the equinox itself only once?"},{"Title":"The Cursed Land (Magic: The Gathering)","review":"If you're familiar with Magic: the Gathering there's usually two kinds of books. There's the three book arcs that explore the newest plane described in the latest card set, and then there's stories set in and around Dominaria. This book is a one shot exploration of a place that has nothing to do with any of that. That really got me interested. It's a brand new unexplored plane filled with refrences to other planes (Ilcae, The Storm Lines, The Death Pools) and planeswalkers (Tempe, the Thorn, Platon, Krimon) you never hear anything about. No offense to giants like Urza and Nicol Bolas, but I really loved hearing about someone new for a change.Not to mention the book itself is a good deal better than I was expecting. The setting is nicely fleshed out and filled with all sorts of fun fantasy creatures--giant carrion beetles called shield bugs that fight corpse collectors for bodies, big cat sized spiders that web found objects onto their backs for camoflage, shapechanging shrouds that can look like a blanket or sleeping bag and then devour you in your sleep, big eerie stalks of fungus that give off a shriek like a weeping girl when people stray too close--leading them out into bogs to drown and become nutrients. The locations are fun and distinctive: from Loch Prith the magical subterranian paradise of the elves--painted caves full of flowing springs, fireflies and magically sustained lush undergrowth; to the damp soot-covered streets of Inys Nohr where hack plagued peasants fish for eels in the murk and the buildings cling with mold and lichen; to misty Inys Haen where the people dress in colorfully woven bhanas and burn sod in thatched buildings to stave off the chill, surrounded by thorn gates--living through the same unchanging pattern generation after generation.Plus I really enjoyed the politics--everyone's agendas and motives playing against everyone else's, some plans clicking together like clockwork while others just come completely unspooled in ways that were really fun to watch. Plus I have to say, there's something really touching about the way the story resolves--a real moral to it that comes off very genuine and not sanctimonious. Hard to do.Anyway. I'm the sort of person who has a hard time picking up a book again once I've set it down. I've maybe finished a half-dozen books, the rest with long forgotten bookmarks stuck somewhere in the first third of them somewhere. I don't think I've ever gone through a book this fast. It took me just over three days. I never stick to a book like that.So yeah, big recommendation."},{"Title":"The Cursed Land (Magic: The Gathering)","review":"This is the story of a girl named Aylith who has to change Nazir from evil to good and save the land of Cridhe from destruction."},{"Title":"The Cursed Land (Magic: The Gathering)","review":"I first started playing Magic a few months back, and I didn't even know at the time that there were books to go along with the game.

It's been a long time since I've read such a wonderful book. The charater of Aylith is believable, she is not just your ordinary, run of the mill type heroine. She's beyond that. Her desires were that of an ordiary 20 year old, and she doesn't fall into the pattern of a mage immediatly, like so many have their magic workers do. Nazir was a remarkable villian, if you can call him that. In short, a wonderful, must read for any serious fantasty lover, even those that don't read or play Magic.

As A.S. Byatt explains in her Introduction, &quot;This figure bears little relation to what we have about the real Katharine . . .&quot; and thus the reader should be conscious that Ford's Katharine - a young, pretty, pious woman who yearns for a return to Catholicism after Henry's split with Rome - is strictly fictional. That said, the only real failure of this work is that Katharine is the least appealing, least interesting character; we first meet her as a dispossessed ingenue seeking entrance to Henry's court around the time of his disasterous fourth marriage to Anne of Cleves, and it is this description which will follow her throughout the book. Even as she becomes Queen, it is almost by accident, surviving the machinations of Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal and the recklessness of her devoted cousin Culpepper. She is Queen by default. She constantly protests that all she seeks is a Catholic England - the &quot;old ways&quot; - and yet throughout she resigns herself to letting events happen to her, as if she cannot control the consequences of her own life. Indeed, her final speech to Henry where she confesses to an adultery which did not occur, becomes her last fatal act of passivity, for which she pays with her life. She cannot see that there are those who wish to help her and that her naive, narcissistic piety does not have to be her ruin. What holds these novels together is the rich supporting cast: the aforementioned Cromwell, who has his own sovereign Protestant image of England, free from the entanglements of Rome. There is the brooding Princess Mary, Henry's daughter by his first wife, who knows how to carry a grudge for her mother's divorce, the super-spy Throckmorton, the lecherous Magister Udal and more. Ford uses Katharine to show that the blind commitment to an ideal - any ideal - will only result in failure, that this world is more than ideas and faiths, but of people who are imperfect, people who will fail. It is a world five hundred years in the past, but it is also our own."},{"Title":"The Fifth Queen","review":"Intrigue and romance in the court of Henry VIIIKatherine Howard, armed only with education, wit and honesty, becomes the Fifth Queen, Henry VIII's fifth wife in this amazing historical trilogy. The plot-ridden court comes to vivid life as everyone high and low maneuvers for advantage. Everyone except Katherine Howard, whose unwillingness to scheme will make her queen and defenseless at the same moment. Even knowing the general story this is a fascinating and occasionally shocking novel, with a stunning ending..."},{"Title":"The Fifth Queen","review":"I read this book about ten years ago. I bought it at a sale out of idle curiosity, having once read that it was one of Ford's three best works, though much less well known than \\"The Good Soldier\\" and even than \\"Parade's End.\\" Until I had it in hand I had no idea that it was about Tudor England, a subject about which I had no prior interest. It took about five pages for me to get into the narrative, and after that it was spellbinding. Every character in the novel is interesting, and most of them are deeply engaging, most particularly Katherine and Henry. The sense of fear in and around Henry's court is palpable, and this is a great suspense novel, though certainly a curious example of the genre. The novel opened my eyes to the deep ambivalence felt in England about the Reformation and the loss of the Catholic church--something which must be understood to make any sense at all of the era and of the life of Elizabeth I. I can't praise this novel highly enough, and I am bewildered that it remains so far under the radar. While not an easy read, this isn't challenging modernist prose. What makes it hard is the strangeness of the milieu and of the preoccupations of the characters--and this is exactly what makes it great historical fiction, far superior to \\"Wolf Hall,\\" which despite its merits has a set of characters who think like our contemporaries. How true can the novel possibly be to the life of the historical Katherine Howard? It hardly matters. Ford has invented a new fifth queen, and given her a gripping and convincing story."},{"Title":"The Fifth Queen","review":"I'm a Henry VIII nut. I have quite a few books on him - from the recent historical fiction ones to old library tomes almost too dry to read. And I love historical fiction about England, particularly when the - what's the word I'm looking for? it's eluding me at the moment - their speech is true to form.This is not quick reading, and yet it seemed like the book was finished in nothing flat. It does for Katherine Howard's reputation what Sharon Kay Penman did for Richard III's and the twins in the tower (the antithesis of shakespear's play.) Who's to say what the truth is? Because history potrays Richard as a power hungry, murdering rogue (except for a sect of people these days who are out to clear his name), and Katherine (except in this book) has always been said to be a wanton and promiscuous woman.In The Fifth Queen, however, her character is wise and virtuous; but that Henry would have her as his wife, she'd have gone to a nunnery by choice. She believes strongly in the Catholic God and sees it as her mission to return Henry to Rome and to Catholocism and to persuade his daughter to reconcile with him.But she's too innocent and good-hearted for those at court, who are always thinking of themselves and what's to their best advantage. As restoration of the Catholic faith would re-instate to the church lands and riches previously taken, those who are Lutheran would be left without what they gained when Henry became head of church and state. So Katherine must be dispensed with by whatever means possible.Thus Ford's quite rational and lucid explanation for history's version of her background.It's no secret that Henry was \\"not such a one who {could} stay the wind,\\" as she puts it, and indeed, throughout my readings, that seems the essence of him: big and powerful on the outside, small and unsure on the inside; a man who has the power to get what he wants when he wants it, but best walk softly because he may change his mind tomorrow. Mercurial at best. I wonder if he'd be on prozac these days?He's under the impression he's saved her and now they'll be together, but he's missed the irony of what he's put forth and arranged. Her speech in the final pages of the book is moving and borne of a wisdom you'd be hard pressed to find today, especially in one so young.On an entirely different note, she was apparently beautiful. But have you ever noticed the paintings from that era? Check out the paintings of her - and his other wives by various artists. There doesn't seem much difference in the attractiveness of Anne of Cleves, Catherine of Aragon, Katherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, for instance. And Hans Holbein, who did quite a number of portraits of royal family members, was supposed to be the finest painter - and easy to belive that. His portrait of her is far superior to any of the others (not the miniature that is apparently actually Jane Seymour's sister), and Cromwell and Moore practically jump off the canvas. I dunno. The \\"beautiful\\" woman all look rather unattractive, if you ask me."},{"Title":"The Fifth Queen","review":"Fans of Tudor history will enjoy this meaty volume which delivers a very different take on the life of Queen Katherine Howard...she is hardly the hysterical and promiscuous girl so often depicted.

It was given to my husband by his aunt, Louise Long who grew up on McCormick Blvd. in Clifton Forge. She resided in the same home over seventy five years. There is a picture of her father, Clarence L. Long in the C&O; Band so this is personally a precious book to us.Elizabeth Hicks Corron carries us through the early history of Clifton Forge from 1880 through 1965 and the ride through history is delightful!Although this is the history of a specific town, it could be any town in the United States of America in the same time period. I laughed at the quote of a little boy's perspective of the necessity of horses in the era of the new motor car and cried when tragedy struck a young couple and the entire town mourned.If you love reading about history, you will enjoy non-fiction book.

The question has been posed by scientists and philosophers for millenia, but only very recently have we accumulated enough physical and astronomical knowledge to be able to discuss these issues in a serious and quantitative manner. And, lo and behold! what modern cosmologists began to explore in earnest is a sort of necessary link between our own existence as intelligent observers evolved from the simplest procaryote lifeforms over billions of years and the properties of universe (and other universes!) at large. This link is technically called an observational selection effect, and if from now on anybody wishes to seriously study these matters, \\"Anthropic Bias\\" is without question an excellent place to start.Bostrom's book makes amusing, although at times quite exacting, reading. Early on, he gives a splendid overview of the entire field of anthropic reasoning, much used and abused in the last quarter of century. Then, almost imperceptibly, he passes on to several instances in which the nature of the anthropic selection effect becomes clearer and clearer. From quantum cosmology to annoying traffic jams, from quantum mechanics to Adam and Eve thought experiments, from freak observers created by black holes' evaporation radiation to the (in)famous Doomsday argument of Gott, Carter and Leslie (not to mention future totalitarian world government and paranormal causation), the book reads as an exciting detective novel, as you rapidly change settings following the same thread of evidence to the main culprit: the universal observational selection effect, explained in detail in the Chapter 10, arguably the culmination of the drama. Here, Bostrom develops a theory which promises a unifying treatment of observations, in particular in cosmology, explicating in detail the accompanying Bayesian methodology. The unity of the underlying analysis is emphasized in the final Chapter, where new theory is aplied in several fields of contemporary research.Probably the worst thing one can say about this book is that it is too short. After finishing it, the reader is left with the impression that the very scope of the new theory is such that there is enough material for entirely another book, or at least reconsideration of many issues treated previously. The re-reading potential is thus very strong. The reader will also find some consolation for finishing the book in a detailed and cleverly composed bibliography. In any case, she or he will probably never think about the relationship of man and the universe in the same way as before."},{"Title":"Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (Studies in Philosophy)","review":"This is a powerful unification and expansion of a number of papers Bostrom has written. He's usually many steps ahead of most other thinkers on whatever subject he's considering, and this appears to me to be the case here as well. I'm not fully comfortable with the conclusions about the relativity of one's choice of reference class, but I don't currently see any better solution. This book has made it much easier to think about the issues clearly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (Studies in Philosophy)","review":"This book discusses selection effects as they affect reasoning on topics such as the Doomsday Argument, whether you will choose a lane of traffic that is slower than average, and whether we can get evidence for or against the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. Along the way it poses some unusual thought experiments that at first glance seem to prove some absurd conclusions. It then points out the questionable assumptions about what constitute \\"similar observers\\" upon which the absurd conclusions depend, and in doing so it convinced me that the Doomsday Argument is weaker than I had previously thought.It says some interesting things about the implications of a spatially infinite universe, and of the possibility that the number of humans will be infinite.It is not easy to read, but there's little reason to expect a book on this subject could be both easy to read and correct."},{"Title":"Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (Studies in Philosophy)","review":"Nick Bostrom's ideas are interesting and relevant where apparently chaotic scenarios are applicable, but the reader should bear in mind that he fails to take into account the fact that an anthropic explanation for the fine-tuning of the universal constants is supposed to be embedded into humans by the universal scale mechanism that enables or requires human existence. That justifies the selection effect, in this case, because anthropic bias is supposed to be an innate characteristic of the universe.The Anthropic Principle notes that Anthropic Bias, by definition, is the Natural Expression for universal scale favoritism toward humans.Nick seems to say that anthropic bias is unwarrented, because the interpretation of evidence is necessarily subjective, and it is subject to observational selection effects, but anthropic bias is perfectly necessary and justified if the mechanism behind anthropic prejudice can be identified and then independently supported by the most conservative representation our best cosmological theories.The Anthropic Principle then becomes a very powerful reciprocating source of support for the validity of those theories, rather than a continual nagging thorn in their side.Nick Bostrom tries to eliminate anthropic bias by way of relativism and random observation, but 'the coin ISN'T fair' if there is frame independent mechanism that acts in favor of intelligent life.I disagree with his claim that, &quot;existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories&quot;... and this is why:He correctly notes that there can be areas of low entropy, (which are necessary to life), within the greater whole of our entropic, expanding universe, but he failed to equate the predominant entropic prejudice to the anthropic bias, as supported by conventional Big Bang Theory and The Standard Model of Particle Physics.A valid natural design hypothesis can be derived from the anthropic bias of entropic favoritism toward intelligent life, where it is observationally proven that order increases with the potential for grand scale entropic efficiency.Nick gives prejudicial credence to Big Bang Theory and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, but he misses the fact that human intelligence enables a highly efficient mechanism for satisfying the second law of thermodynamics on a universal scale, and this was and still is, (since the big bang), the predominant inclination of every object in an expanding universe, ultimately. This tendency was instilled into every object at t=10^-43, so an entropic anthropic explanation is natural in context with conventional Big Bang theory and the Standard Model of Particle Physics.There is no way to set yourself apart from this, because the underlying direction of all action in a big bang induced expanding universe is ultimately entropic, per conventional Big Bang Theory as supported by the latest confirmed observational evidence. Any occurrence within the system is, therefore, a result of the tuning of the constants that were set at t=10^-43. This includes humans in all their glory, and the weak entropic anthropic argument would support this via the fact that it is observationally proven that the human is comparitively one of nature's more preferred methods for satisfying the second law of thermodynamics... on a grand scale.But humans also represent a very specific path of action toward the pure symmetry of the universe, having the capability to produce particles from the energy of the vacuum, (per quantum theory, as proven in the lab by way of the creation of Dirac's, antiparticle). There are only three known systems in nature that have the capability for this form of contribution to the effort toward idealistically pure symmetry; The Entropy of a Neutron Star in the formation of a Black Hole, Black Hole Entropy, via, &quot;Hawking Radiation&quot;. Humans are the only other known system capable of isolating the release of enough energy to create real particle/antiparticle pairs.According to conventional big bang theory, the need for human entropic efficiency has necessarily pre-existed in our universe since the forces decoupled and caused the event to occur over time, due to these less-than-perfect results that you get from inherent asymmetries. The principle of least action on a grand scale in an expanding entropic universe requires that &quot;asymmetries&quot; or imperfections in the energy at the moment of the Big Bang are the reason for every increase in the potential for entropy in our universe for the duration of the event, as supported by an entropic anthropic principle, which indicates that &quot;imperfections&quot; are convolved perpetually forth to higher orders of entropic efficiency, per human evolutionary theory.The coin can never be fair as long as the universe expresses grand-scale entropic prejudice."},{"Title":"Vanity Fair: A Novel Without a Hero","review":"Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece."},{"Title":"He Done Her Wrong : The Great American Novel And Not A Word In It - No Music, Too","review":"I'm not sure what Milt Gross would have made of contemporary critics and their claim that he was the father of the modern graphic novel. I'm guessing his reaction would have been akin to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT director Richard Lester's famous reply to MTV. (When the music network hailed him as the 'Father of Music Videos', Lester responded by insisting on a blood test!)One of the great American humorists of the 20th Century, Gross was a brilliant New York-based newspaper cartoonist whose creations included DAVE'S DELICATESSEN, BANANA OIL, THAT'S MY POP, PETE THE POOCH, OTTO AND BLOTTO, COUNT SCREWLOOSE FROM TOOLOOSE, and GROSS EXAGGERATIONS - classics, all. His original, wildly cartoony drawing style and hilarious \\"Yinglish\\" dialogue, still funny after three quarters of a century, held not a hint of modern-day pretentiousness. Comparing him to Frank Miller and Art Spiegelman can only demean him. (Sorry, fanboys!)HE DONE HER WRONG is a bona fide classic, like all Gross' books - and one that seems impervious to time, since it was deliberately anachronistic from the git-go. Originally a burlesque of Lynd Ward's wordless woodcut novels of the 1920s, that point of reference is lost on modern readers because, like Lewis Carroll's song parodies, the spoof has become more famous than the original! A felicitous turn of events.This book was notoriously censored (and re-titled HEARTS OF GOLD) when it was reissued in 1983, further indication - as if we needed any more - of America's contempt for its own cultural legacy. Luckily, the wise folks at Fantagraphics will publish the restored, uncut version - rather than dignify all the self-appointed P.C. Thought Police out there. (You KNOW who you are!) Hopefully - although it's a facsimile of the first edition from 1930 - they'll find a way to include Al Capp's affectionate tribute to Gross from his introduction to the 1963 edition.Also, hopefully, it'll pave the way for the wholesale republication of other Gross classics - like NIZE BABY, DUN'T ESK, FAMOUS FIMMALES, I SHOULDA ATE THE ECLAIR, HIAWATTA WITT NO ODDER POEMS, DEAR DOLLINK and DE NIGHT IN DE FRONT FROM CHREESMAS - all of which have been too long out-of-print.A definitive, coffee table art book on Gross and his contributions to American comic strips and animated cartoons is long, long overdue.

I first encountered this work in the early 1960s and have off and on over the years read it again and again. As the author so well puts it \\"The Great American Novel Told Without Words.\\" Ths illustrations are of course pure Gross and there is humor in every frame, from the first to the last. This is certainly a work that proves that a picture is worth a thousand word, although in this case, the pictures cover many more words than the saying goes.

Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"This book blows the dust off of old cultural images we have of American first ladies. These women evolved an unelected and unpaid role largely without precedent and succeeded in creating their own job descriptions. Dolley Madison acted as a facilitator between French and English ambassadors, Edith Wilson assumed stewardship of the affairs of state, Nancy Reagan became the one person her husband could absolutely trust, and Hillary Clinton tore the mask off of convention and showed herself openly as a political partner. Rating the First Ladies offers a great lens with which to re-view American history."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"I am so sorry I spent money on this book. What a dopey premise - that one can compare and contrast these women. There is almost nothing at all known about Margaret Taylor, Jane Pierce, Abigail Fillmore, Eliza Johnson, Eliza Monroe. The papers of women like Ida McKinley and Bess Truman have been destroyed by their families. There are no biographies at all of most of the First Ladies. So how in the world can these women be fairly judged when contrasted with modern activist women like Lady Bird, Hillary and Betty Ford? I saw none of this addressed in the text at all. This is ahistorical and does much damage. Also, the role of women is different. And there are no specific duties of a First Lady like there are for a President - so they are all different. You cannot compare First Ladies. This book should not have been written. Just a bunch of candy."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"I have read books on First Ladies most of my life, and I eagerly anticipated reading this one. However, it isn't nearly as well done as Margaret Truman's First Ladies or the Smithsonian Book of the First Ladies. The information in this book is just a rehash of things I've read many times before. And the rating scale is the silliest thing I've heard of in a long time. How can you possibly compare modern first ladies who reap so much media coverage to those about whom nothing is known? And how can Nancy Reagan have been worse than women like Jane Pierce who spent her White House years grieving for her lost son? In spite of her press-propagated shortcomings, Mrs. Reagan did many good things during the 8 years her husband was in office -- not the least of which was offering solid support to her husband. Jane Pierce was more of a hindrance to her husband than a helpmate, yet she rates higher. Who pays people to make judgements on others like this? This book was definitely not worth the money."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ... He makes incredible errors of historical fact-well known historical fact, at that. For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article.

Once I started reading I was hooked by the biographies and the way the writer places each woman in the sweep of the history and politics of her times. I found the rating system easy to understand and the author explained it in great detail in the book's introduction. John Roberts really brings politics to life, instead of the dry boring subject I always thought it was.

I plan to give this book to many on my birthday list this year."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"Why haven't other authors probed the hidden political history of first ladies like this book does? There is no other single book about first ladies which comprehensively examines the contribution each and every woman has made in shaping our history. This is the best and most concise analysis of first ladies and their political influence in the White House. The book uncovers the involvement of 19th-century first ladies in political campaigns, congressional debates, legislation, and even war. This book really hits its stride when it comes to 20th centiry first ladies, from the adventurous and globe-trotting Lou Hoover to the manipulative Helen Taft and the neurotic Betty Ford. Edith Roosevelt carries out secret diplomacy for Teddy, helping him earn a Nobel Prize for peacemaking, Edith Wilson learns codes and ciphers to translate diplomatic cables and intelligence reports for Woodrow, and Eleanor Roosevelt flies into combat zones to rally troop morale. Roberts doesn't have much sympathy for the public images first ladies project as glossy fashion queens, charity dilettantes and fundraisers for non-profit organizations -- he focuses on the meatier role about how political spouses help determine presidential fortunes -- and misfortunes. His analysis of Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush presents completely new information about these first ladies and their influence. The book gives a panorama of U.S. history and many interesting political anecdotes that are glossed over, buried, or simply ignored in other accounts of first ladies."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"I would not normally review a book that I had not read in its entirety, but when I saw the glaring error in the section on Dolley Madison, I felt I needed to inform potential readers about it.Lately I have been doing quite a bit of research on Dolley Madison and therefore I was surprised to see Mr. Roberts state that she was the one who saved the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence when the British burned the White House in 1814. This is a commonly told myth. While she did save as many documents as she was able to at the expense of her personal items, neither the Declaraton nor Constitution were kept in the White House. They were kept in the State Department.In Richard N. Cote's biography, Strength and Honor, the Life of Dolley Madison, he states, \\"Some have credited Dolley with being the savior of the Declaration of Independence, but that honor goes to Stephen Pleasanton, a brave clerk in the secretary of state's office. Despite the scorn of Secretary of War Armstrong, who scoffed at any danger of invasion, Pleasanton and other clerks \\"stuffed bags with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, international treaties, and the correspondence of George Washington.\\"Anthony S. Pitch's book, The Burning of Washington, the British Invasion of 1814, also tells this story although he spells the last name \\"Pleasonton\\".In the website, The Dolley Madison Project, it states that she saved \\"the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington along with official papers, silver, and other valuables.\\"I am quite a fan of Dolley Madison, but it is Stephen Pleasanton or Pleasonton to whom we owe the survival of those two most treasured documents."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"I'm an avid reader of first lady biographies, but this is the first book I've come across that treats first ladies as equal partners in the presidency. This book won't please hardcore feminists, who want us to think most first ladies were helpless victims of male oppression, nor will it please male chauvinists who think a first lady's place should be confined to charitable causes. What these essays show is that throughout our history women have been a vital part of the presidency. This book brings a much needed sense of historical balance to the story of the women who have shared the White House with our presidents. It isn't written by a historian, but by a political consultant with hands-on experience working in the White House. It's the best contribution to the history of first ladies in years."},{"Title":"Rating The First Ladies: The Women Who Influenced the Presidency","review":"This book really delivers. It's enjoyable history, with short chapters on each first lady that read like short stories. Don't be fooled by those who say you can't compare first ladies simply because modern ones get more media coverage. That's like saying you can't compare presidents because television didn't exist when Lincoln was in the White House. Throughout history, first ladies have been chronicled in letters, books, newspapers, and accounts from their contemporaries. Later radio and television were included. This book relies on these and many other sources, but gives a unique viewpoint that only a political insider can add. There are many new revelations here about Nancy Reagan (whom the author clearly admires) and Barbara Bush, among others. I liked it because it adds a whole new dimension to presidential history. But if all you like about first ladies is the fluff, skip this book.

Now that my time is more my own, I was delighted to learn about this book but was somewhat cautious in the overall assessments of the first ladies since I read that the Siera Institute (?) had been the vehicle for the ratings. Knowing that the vast majority of college professors are liberal, I wondered how much of these ratings were skewed to the left, literally. Then, when I finally got to almost the end of the book and read the assessment for Nancy Reagan, the author warns that this first lady instead of ranking second-to-last, should have rated in the very top of the rankings....but due to liberal bias of the raters, she had a very low score....so, where does this leave me, the reader, in all that I had read beforehand? All of the prior ratings were null and void or to accepted with a grain of salt? Well, why didn't he say that in the very beginning? - Instead of telling the reader that it was hoped that more conservative academics would participate in the Siera poll? Did I waste my time reading this book? I don't really think so. Much of the book describes the events during each president's administration and how it affected his first lady. How she dealt with the events, and how her personality impacted the course of events. That was the history lesson. I can evaluate the rest for myself."},{"Title":"Classroom Language Skills for Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Teachers (Topics in Down Syndrome)","review":"This book picks up from where Dr. Kumin's earlier book, \\"Communication Skills in Children with Down Syndrome\\" leaves off. Aimed at the elementary and middle school years, this book is about developing good communication and learning skills. Parents and teachers interested in reading skills will want to look at, \\"Teaching Reading to Children with Down Syndrome,\\" by Patricia Logan Oelwein. I have had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Kumin speak and she is undoubtedly one of the leading expert on communication skills in children with Down syndrome. The book starts with a look at what language skills a child will need in school and then goes on to discuss building a team and a curriculum to reach that goal. The main topic of the book is how to help the child with Down syndrome learn in an inclusive environment. Dr. Kumin shows us that children with Down syndrome can learn and can succeed but they may need to have the curriculum adapted to their needs. For example, she shows how worksheets can be confusing for a child with Down syndrome but she also shows how they can be easily adapted to make them less confusing. Many children fail, not because they don't understand the material but rather because they have trouble following complicated multi-step instructions. One specific example she discusses is math word problems. The complex language of the word problem can be very difficult for the child to understand even though they have no difficulty doing the actual math problem. Dr. Kumin discusses how IDEA requires that children with disabilities be given accommodations in order to help them be fairly assessed. As a parent or a teacher you will want to read this book. The research discussed and the many ideas put forth can help a child succeed and build self confidence where before there was fear and failure. If you are a teacher of a child with Down syndrome, buy this book. If you are a parent of a child with Down syndrome then buy two copies, one for yourself and the other for your child's teacher."},{"Title":"Classroom Language Skills for Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Teachers (Topics in Down Syndrome)","review":"This book clearly explains how to understand and successfully navigate the many complicated intricacies of school system practices, federal regulations, and classroom environments, for helping children with Down syndrome, and other children with special needs in this area, to develop language skills during their elementary school years.

One the hardest hurdles is loading the Personal Web Server. If you don't already have a favorite HTML or ASP editor try UltraEdit32 and do yourself a favor from the beginning download the Script Debugger if your using Internet Explorer. It's free and like so many other things that go into learning Active Server Pages &quot;it's better than nothing&quot;.Overall I like the book and the humor is tolerable. If he ever wants to write another I'd be happy to provide some additional JScript examples. I know enough to get buy for now and in the end that's what I wanted. I had a project that needed to get done by the end of the year and it looks like I'll make it.Thanks to all of you who have written these reviews in the past. For the most part they have faithfully guided me to the most useful and most useable sources of information available."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages for Dummies","review":"I was wondering when will an author come out and write an ASP book that everyone can easily understand. Fortunately Dummy Series came out with this nice book. This book is a really good resource for a starter ASP programmers. The layout will prevent you to get bored of the book.

The book gets you off on the right foot, and that's all a Dummies book should have to do. You'll need to get more advanced than this to do professional work, but this book answers the simple/stupid questions you might feel too foolish to ask otherwise. The code examples are good, and the book remains handy as a quick reference long after you've finished reading it straight through. Eventually, after you've moved on to more advanced ASP/web development books, coded some real-world apps and become an expert, you can snicker and look down your nose at the next ASP newbie.Or you can hand them this book."},{"Title":"Active Server Pages for Dummies","review":"I have experience with PHP and Perl-based CGI programming. I needed to learn ASP in a hurry to get started on a new project. This book was suitable for my circumstance by providing an inexpensive, easy-to-read introduction to ASP.If you are already familiar with some form of web-based programming (knowing Visual Basic also helps), this is a great way to get started quick with ASP. It provides a clear, concise explanation of the essential ASP classes (Session, Request, Response, redirecting, etc.)If you are a beginner and know nearly nothing about creating dynamic web pages, there is a steep learning curve. I would also recommend getting Sam's Teach Yourself Visual Basic .NET if you are unfamiliar with Visual Basic programming, because there is a lot of VB in ASP.&quot;ASP for Dummies&quot; does not cover .NET, but that is not really important, especially if you already have another reference book such as for Visual Basic .NET. ASP is well structured and I doubt there will ever be much urgency to change your code for .NET. For those of you unfamiliar with .NET, it is a series of classes and methodology that sometimes can make your programming easier.The cheap shots at humor could make this book annoying at times, but it does put you at ease while you're learning.

The &quot;try this&quot; samples in the book are great hand holding tools and in the beginning the explanations are very clear. Unfortunately, the author really loses control toward the end of the book and it gets very complicated very fast. The most disturbing thing of all was the CD which accompanies the book and contains the really complex sample ASP applications- applications that one would hopefully like to adapt and use. The problem is the scripts on the CD do not work and the coding is very very sloppy and error ridden. Also there is a lot the user must do (on his own) to try and get the scripts to work. What infuriates me the most is the author leaves it up to his readers to find all the problems and then debug his code for him.(Authors Web Site) This is totally unacceptable for someone making money off a product and holding himself out as an expert in the field. And it drops my rating from what would probably be 4 stars to 2 stars. As an example I would give HTML: The Definitive Guide by Musciano and Kennedy a 5 star rating.

This book helped me there too - at least for beginners. If you are a Web technology pro, forget this book. And why are you looking at a Dummines book??Thirdly, I'm a great believer in &quot;having a go&quot;. This book provides examples apt for an appropriate exercise at the &quot;dummies&quot; level.My complaint is more a recognition of the fact that I have progressed with ASP. There is much more involved with ASP than what this book touches on. I find this book assumes that I have some intelligence to work this out for myself.If you are new to computers, I advise you get other books to help you with this topic. Successfully explaining Active Server Pages is reliant on the reader being relatively familiar with computers, the Net, and the development mindset and culture. The latter two are the keys to securing a measure of success with ASP.I doubt I can write a review that is precision tuned with your situation. That said, if your gut instinct is that you need the treatment of the &quot;Dummies&quot; brand, buy this book.

It seems that authors of this genre of books are either: (1) completely out of touch with how the legal marketplace actually works; or (2) understand how the legal marketplace works, but do not want to explain things clearly for fear that they will frustrate the hopes of readers.This book is little different from the others. It starts out by offering a few \\"insights\\" into the legal marketplace today--i.e., large firms increasingly have both equity and non-equity partners, smaller firms have stepped up hiring, etc. The actual finding a job component of the book tells you nothing that you probably would not have thought of on your own--network with friends, former professors and graduates of your school, be aggressive but polite, etc., etc. You probably will have gotten this same advice elsewhere. There is nothing new in these pages.I am waiting for the day when an author will state that landing a legal job nowadays generally requires either that: (a) you have good grades from a good school; or (b) you wear a yarmulka. Instead, authors refuse to tell it like it is and instead offer platefuls of bromides like the ones contained in this book."},{"Title":"Jobs for Lawyers: Effective Techniques for Getting Hired in Today's Legal Marketplace","review":"This book provided fairly useful advice.

Check your map. Several towns argue that they stake their claim in being what Masters asserted to be this mythical town. Petersburg and Lewistown, two towns of otherwise minor repute seem closest... but it is so much better we haven't an actual town... Spoon River's residents are our next door neighbors, whether we live in Central Illinois or Central Florida, or southern Alaska.Masters has written not fables, but the essence of American life. He hasn't captured the life and times of 1915, but has instead recorded in 1915 the life and times of our present day America.The same reason the paintings of Norman Rockwell makes sense is why Edgar Lee Masters poetry makes sense. To read the quick messages on the gravestone of one man, learning a little bit him, and something about a neighbor or two, we can learn a little about how we live in communities today.Our lives, like Jimmy Stewart's character in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" found out, interact and impact everyone we meet. Who we love, who we should love and who we reject. And when we die, others feel the loss. Masters has aptly put this in a humorous, yet insightful way into short verses.The poems don't rhyme. The meter is not solid, and the poetics aren't intricate. They aren't poems like Poe's or Dickinson, not in the way they wrote American poems. Don't expect iambic pentameter-based sonnets or villanelles. Expect a conversation, and listen in.The poetry here is in the subtle use of social nuance. In the nuances are his insight and wit. Two readings will bring to light what you miss in the first.Buy this book, read it slow. It reads faster than most poetry book, but don't get caught in the temptation to zoom through each poem just because you can.After you read it, see the play if it happens to be performed in your town.I fully recommend it.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"Spoon River Anthology is an American Classic. It has touched me since my grandfather read parts of it to me more than thirty years ago. Ostensibly it is a collection of autobiographical poems of the silent inhabitants of the town's graveyard. The broad theme, the book's strategy, is the great sweep of what America was like in the nineteenth century. The stories of their lives; joys and sorrows, successes and failures, loves and hates, and secrets of those people in the graveyard are the tactics. Above all, E.L. Masters exposes the hypocrisy and denial in which people have always lived their lives. Even today, in a much worldlier time than the turn of the century when it was written, the brutal honesty of the citizens shakes our complacency. This is no mellow reflection on the good old days. Its citizens corrupt and are corrupted. They suffer loveless marriages. Men run away to war to escape jail or rejection in love, women suffer stifling lack of opportunity and equality. The citizens die in childbirth or from lockjaw contracted from a cut by a rusty knife. Yet in reading about these lives we understand a little more about what it is to be human. None of us could fail to find some stories that in ways match ours to a greater or lesser extent. An in doing so, be granted in life the level of insight into ourselves and others that these storytellers achieved only after their lives had ended."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"I use the Dover edition at Buckhannon-Upshur High School with my ninth grade students each spring.

Regrettably, Edgar Lee Masters would not be on many of those lists.It is a shame because Spoon River Anthology is such an American collection of poems. Masters is as a poet, what Norman Rockwell is as a painter: a man who captured the spirit of America. An exercise in Americana? Undoubtedly. But Master's is not whose eye were blind to the faults and foibles of America.His America, embodied in Spoon River, IL, is an America with faults, with problems; it is at the same time an America with hope with a future and at its core--a basically good nation.If for no other reason, I am an advocate of Masters because he is the poet who made me fall in love with poetry."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"I am now 36 years old.

In an era when the mores of polite Victorianism were still lingering in an America concerned with all things proper, Masters dared pen a book in which the dead of a small Midwestern town lie not in a state of reservation before Christian resurrection, but in a condition of stasis, ruminating on their lives and speaking with candor on all they may have done. The dead who speak from their graves in these wondrous poems reveal their secrets, their unfulfilled dreams, their disapprobation at humanity's conduct. The dead are to varying degrees wise, ironic, witty, bitter, content, confused, and moralistic. They have regrets, they mock the values of we who are living, they seethe with longing, they confess universal truths at long last, they await they know not what, the arrival of eternity or a continuation of their suspended state of evaluation, in conditions of calm, content, fright, or regretless joy. There is one thing none of those who have passed away from the streets of Spoon River to its hallowed acre on the hill, are and that is quiet.One of a dozen or so American poetical achievements that most fully justifies our nation's pride in its own literary accomplishments."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"Spoon River Anthology is one of the books that everybody who loves literature ought to read. Even though the Editorial Board of the Modern Library didn't include it in their top 100 list, it belongs there. Like Our Town which came later, Spoon River Anthology captures the small town perspective and like Winesburg, Ohio (which did make the Modern Library list) it evokes another time and place which contain the roots of many of us today. This book is very rewarding."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"The wondrous folksinger, Claudia Schmidt composed a song with that line in it and since I read this back in college, her song spoke to me. The recent Richard Buckner CD (The Hill) was loaned by a friend who didn't know who Masters was nor had heard of SRA, and it too is outstanding. The town of Spoon River is indeed fictive, though there is a Spoon River Community College near Peoria. The characters were real enough, however, to be very angry at ELM for generations following publication. A college roomate descended from one such family (he's from Pekin) and the mere mention of Mr. Masters name evoked strong responses similar to how parts of my family (from GA) don't allow the name Sherman in conversation. That obviously means Edgar got it right. It is a fine book, on par with another fav, To Kill A Mockingbird, and it will become one for your permanent collection."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"There is something fascinating about looking at life backwards, from end to beginning. That is what Masters offers us with his biting, poetic vision of the human experience. Many poems, all of which are delightfully concise, often conclude with proverbs that rival those of the Bible itself. &quot;This is life's sorrow,&quot; he writes in &quot;Herbert Marshal,&quot; &quot;That one can be happy only where two are/And that our hearts are drawn to stars/which want us not.&quot; Masters, perhaps unknowingly, includes occasional glimpses of eastern philosophy as well, such as in &quot;Griffy The Cooper,&quot; in which he writes, &quot;You are submerged in the tub of yourself/Taboos and rules and appearances/Are the Staves of your tub/Break them and dispel the witchcraft/Of thinking your tub is life/And that you know life!&quot; The essence of Taoism or Buddhism is hidden within the little tightly woven masterpieces of this poetry collection.

But Masters is just not a good enough poet. He attempts blank verse monologues in the style of Robert Frost (as in North of Boston) but succeeds only in demonstrating how difficult a form it is and how it takes the brilliance of someone like Frost to pull it off. I can see that a few of them are worthwhile and would themselves make good anthology pieces, but mostly they are simply second rate prose poems of no significance.In my review of Winesburg, Ohio I compared Sherwood Anderson unfavorably with Masters, saying that he lacked Masters' humanity. But - like most people, I suspect - I had only read selections from Spoon River.

However Masters version of this is a particularly difficult and depressing one, as the frame device involves each character telling his story from the graveyard. There is no ' they all lived happily after' or no ' happy ending ' here. The bitterness, pain , failure frustration of many of these lives makes the whole work extremely for me anyway difficult to get through. Nonetheless there is a lot one can learn about small town Midwest American life, about its conflicts and passions from this volume. The poetry however as poetry is not at the highest level, the level where the language itself means more to us than any one reading can give. This seems to me in a certain way more valuable as a social document than as Literature."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"Inspired by The Greek Anthology, a collection of brief poems from the Hellenistic World including epitaphs written from the perspective of the deceased, Edgar Lee Masters wrote a series of monologues spoken by dead townspeople (some more fictional than others) who inhabited Spoon River, the area in Illinois where Abe Lincoln once lived. Real people include Anne Rutledge (Abe's first girlfriend) and Fiddler Jones, who worked in Lincoln's general store as a boy.But this book isn't about Abraham Lincoln. It's about the trait that we will all, both saints and sinners, one day have in common: death. And it is about the small triumphs of life that the dead remember. Just as William Carlos Williams was a doctor, and his poetry was informed by his contact with everyday people, so too Masters. He was a lawyer and a keen observationist. He writes directly and frankly, especially about male-female relations, which earned this book a bit of a scandalous reputation in its time. Of course, it is mild enough today that the book is assigned reading in junior highs, even in the South.I've read this book three times through, and often re-read individual favorites. And I have it in easy reach on my shelf because I plan to keep re-reading it. There is something about the people of Spoon River and their sentiments that keeps me coming back. As May Swenson says, in her introduction to this edition, Masters \\"bequeathed to us a world in microcosm.\\" A world, in my opinion, worth exploring again and again."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"THE SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGYIf anyone has ever visited a cemetery overlooking a small town, there is a mystical milieu which permeates the place. When a gentle wind blows and the leaves flutter, one can almost sense a faint hint of the collected wisdom entombed there. This collected, faded voice is just barely audible to the listening ear.For the denizens of the town cemetery, the sunrises and sunsets; the four seasons and life below just roll into days, months and years. Changes take shape and before you know, another generation has passed into the stream of time.Each marked or unmarked grave has a story to tell. Their story is unique regardless of the length of the life which each person had before being laid to rest in the cemetery.Edgar Lee Masters takes these faded voices and tell their gripping tales of joy and woe. The different layers of society from the rich to the poor; the righteous to the unrighteous; the joyful to the sad are all here expressing their final sentiments before they begin their sleep without dreams on the hill by the river. Their fading voices forever lost in the silence of the wingless void.The Spoon River is a metaphor for the river of life. Life is like an old riverboat that drifts along the ebbs of the winding river. For on this riverboat you have an assortment of characters-good and bad, but mostly mediocre lives toiling to survive a mundane existence.Masters takes these faded voices by he river and bring them to the ears of the living. Some of these voices are quiet like a whisper while others are like jubilee trumpets.Each voice is important because each voice represents a man or woman who shared a place in this cosmos called Spoon River. Like the distant light of stars which greet us each cloudless night, these voices stir the winds about us until we are enveloped by them like a river fog which drifts about us. These disembodied thoughts are the last vapors of the lives touched by the elements of nature and the cruel hand of neighbor and family.For there can be no greater tragedy for a life, then for it to be forgotten by those individuals touched by it. Masters demands that these faded entities should have their obelisk of immortality. Their words will be still read and pondered long after the human frames of dust are mingled with the soils of time.Spoon River is not a myth. It is a reality which faces every human soul. For one day each of us regardless of our standing in our own society will be entombed in the cemetery on the edge of town.What will we have to say from our final resting place? Perhaps, words like these:Chase Henry: In life I was the town drunkardJudge Somers: I lie here unmarked, forgottenMinerva Jones: I thirsted for love! I hungered so for life.Dorcas Gustine: But silence poisons the soulMargaret Fuller Slack: Sex is the curse of life!Robert Davidson: Remember the acorn. It does not devour other acorns.Editor Whedon: And abortions are hidden.Elizabeth Childers: Death is better than Life!Before you read the book, visit your local cemetery and walk among the graves and read those slabs of stone with bits of information about the ones beneath.

Masters was speaking about that area because he was writing about what he knew. Like any great literature, it transcends time and place to have more universal meaning. Some characters are small town folk, others aspired to grow beyond and were thwarted by circumstance, while still others grew beyond Spoon River and were brought back home from their travels for eternal rest. \\"All, all are sleeping on the hill\\". Each character narrates his or her own brief story in a free verse poem, one per page. Some stories intersect as characters mention each other. It's interesting to cross reference characters in this regard. Sometimes the compliment of mention isn't returned. Upon first inspection, this might seem to be a rather morbid format. However, the characters speak more about their lives and human struggles than they do about death. Theirs are timeless tales about joy, accomplishment, pain, betrayal, discovery, loneliness and atonement.This book is a real classic. It was given to me for my seventeenth birthday and I've collected several different volumes of it since then including one signed by the author. I think the dramatic format might still catch the attention of alot of teenagers and give them pause to reflect upon the deeper meanings in life.

But to read this work in such a manner is to avoid its essence.Read more carefully. Spoon River Anthology is a timeless portrait of the human story. Each character is different, yet all are part of the composite of a small town. It could have been a big city or a widespread area with few people. The stories would differ in fact, perhaps, but the tale would be same.You will meet over a hundred matchless, never-to-be-forgotten characters, including George Gray, who wasted his life by shrinking from it, A.D. Blood, the town prohibitionist, who hated liquor so much he killed a man who was drunk, a politician, Hamilton Greene, whose mother was actually a servant girl to his father, but who never knew it, people who scorned life and were scorned by it in turn, people who loved life despite its adversity, people who wantonly ruined the lives of others, people who were dashed against life's shoals by the ruthless, people who were buried in the wrong grave, and on, and on, and on. Each page is a precious gem reflecting someone you know, or even part of you, large or small. The English is beyond merely superb. It is simply scintillating, and so astoundingly good in terms of word and vocabulary selection as to leave the reader amazed.One facet that was most enjoyable was the number of attorneys and judges who spoke. Masters, of course, practiced law for a number of years, and used this experience to depict realistic portraits of many lawyers, all of whom anyone in the law knows all to well.Carefully perused, the work is truly a novel, not a mere series of poems, and a great novel. Masters apparently poured his whole being into the effort, since he never remotely produced anything of its quality again.Buy, read it a bit at a time. You will treasure it always.

A collection of short poems, written in the early 1900s (1917?), the people of a small town in mid-America speak to us from the grave. It does not take much of an imagination to be able to see us, each of us, those we know and ourselves personnally, in the words spoken by these long dead people. The poems are wonderfully related and well illustrate how one life can effect another life or many of the lives around him or her. I will be the first to admit that I am not an \\"expert\\" in the realm of poetry, but on the other hand, I know what I like and I do like this work. Granted, as one reviewer stated, this is not a happy work by any means and can be down right depressing at times. This is okay though, not all of life is a daily string of happy events. Not all lives are happy lives. We all share certain sorrows, we all know grief and we all have regrets. This works pretty well illustrates that we really have not come all that far, and our lives are not all that different from those of the past. People really do not change all that much from generation to generation. Masters' show true insight into the human condition of any age and in any era.

Eliot. What Masters has done for us(when he was alive) is write a collection of whispered epitaphs,voices silently crying out from the graves the ironies, sadnesses, wastes, agonies, and miscalculations of their spent lives.This is not poetry to turn a phrase, necessarily. Nor is it poetry to enchant. Instead, it is Wisdom Poetry. Poetry that carries the weight of mistakes of the twisted lives, creating their own kind of hell (Hobbes: &quot;Hell is truth too late learned&quot;).Written in 1915 and written as if for choral voices--wouldn't this be a great piece for a dramatic interpretation in which several voices perform each poem? Collected, it becomes overwhelming, just as a visit to a cemetary to mourn the losses of one of your loves can also be overwhelming.No, it is not sad, though. Somehow, hope still survives, like the shoot stabbing through the cracked granite toward the sun."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"Originally published in 1915 this anthology is a series of free verse monologues written from the perspective of the deceased inhabitants of Spoon River. Most of the monologues are from rather pathetic people who were either wronged by others or who wronged others. The book concludes with \\"The Spooniad\\" which gives something of a story summary of the events that you have been reading about from the perspective of the various characters.My favourite part is comparing the monologues of the various parties involved in the disputes. This can be quite funny at times to see the irony of their lives from the perspective of death. The monologues are also quite philosophical at times and I conclude withGriffy the CooperThe cooper should know about tubs.But I learned about life as well,And you who loiter around these gravesThink you know life.You think your eye sweeps about a wide horizon, perhaps,In truth you are only looking around the interior of your tub.You cannot lift yourself to its rimAnd see the outer world of things,And at the same time see yourself.You are submerged in the tub of yourself-Taboos and rules and appearances,Are the staves of your tub.Break them and dispel the witchcraftOf thinking your tub is life!And that you know life!"},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"Edgar Lee Masters's &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; is a poem in long form comprising over two hundred free-verse sketches, each representing and narrated by a deceased resident of a fictional town located on the Spoon River in western Illinois. The dead talk not so much about their town as they do about themselves and the pivotal events that either transformed their lives or caused their deaths. Like Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; the book exposes the depression, restlessness, and corruption that lurk behind the facade of small-town middle American sanctity with an almost constant focus on death that makes it even more grim. If you're looking for something cheerful to read, you might want to pass on this.&quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; has perhaps the highest character-to-page ratio of any work in literature. Many of the narratives are interrelated in the sense that different people involved in a particular situation present their respective arguments which may be defensive apologies or rationalizations or vindictive taunts. The names of the characters are often indicative of their personalities; appellations like Isaiah Beethoven, Voltaire Johnson, and Percy Bysshe Shelley show that Spoon River is hardly a haven for subtlety.The most commonly mentioned character is the wealthy Thomas Rhodes, the failure of whose bank had caused financial ruin to many of the town's residents, although we learn later that the culpability rests with his son Ralph's bad loans and speculations. George Reece, the innocent cashier, took the rap and was sent to prison; his wife in her narrative advises the reader of her epitaph to &quot;memorize some bit of verse of truth or beauty.&quot; She did so herself, taking a line from Alexander Pope, which enabled her to raise her children &quot;clean and strong&quot; in the face of hardship.In Spoon River, lives of quiet desperation result in a cemetery of yapping corpses, lamenting wasted youth and lost chances. Margaret Fuller Slack tells us that she aspired to be a novelist &quot;as great as George Eliot&quot; but marriage and motherhood cost her all of her time; her death from lockjaw is &quot;ironical&quot; because presumably she had so much to say. Searcy Foote confesses remorselessly that he murdered his invalid aunt for money and personal freedom. Zilpha Marsh, the ouija-board reader, was regarded as a fool when she would report to the townspeople that she had made contact with the spirit of a notorious figure from the past; the present tense of her narrative suggests that she is unaware that now she, too, is merely in the past.Every single narrative in this fantastic collection is worthy of commentary; to mention just a few risks a skewed impression of the whole because the &quot;Anthology&quot; really must be read in its entirety to grasp its context. However, there is one more feature which must be noted: The &quot;Anthology&quot; ends with a fragment of an epic poem by Jonathan Swift Somers, one of the deceased. Apparently it is a parody of the Iliad, and naturally it is called the Spooniad, drawing a parallel between the fall of Troy and that of Rhodes's bank. Somers did not live to complete this ambitious project, which is just as well since in Spoon River death affords a distinction few living poets can hope to attain."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"I performed in this play in my early college high school, in NC.At first, I was skeptic. I couldn't believe people would listen or understand this. But after more rehearsals and tedious reading, I began to appreciate it.Actually, the best way to appreciate or at least understand this play is by performing it or watching the performance. No lie. There is no way you can gather the real experience by reading it.I played as four characters, the first one on page 18 (can't remember his name, Eugene Carmen, Willard Fluke, and Reverend Sibley.I literally had to transform my character four times, respectively, from frustrated and desperate (1st role), to irate and irked (2nd role), to sad and disillusioned (3rd role), to cynical and aspiring.That's a heavy load if you ask me. I'm a seasoned actor at my high school but it took weeks of continous reading and performance. We did a good job. But if you plan on using this for your high school and church event, here is the truth:It's not easy. As a matter of fact, I hope you are an experience director and skilled actor. I only did fantastic because my director taught us how to teach ourselves.Set and props are not really needed (except for chairs and costumes and music) but it all weighs on the actor. If you wish to study this for a research paper, go see the play. If you plan on doing it, you better have a good team or a group of actors willing to learn.On our performance, half of our actors were new. About 80% hit their role about right while the other 20% did OK. The rest of the half (which included me) did good but it was still not easy--we had to learn something. There is very few parts were actors converse, but the rest are just monologues. Comic relief is scarce (but still there) so we had to depend on our voice and body to catch the audiences' attention.It's a good play to learn and to teach to others but only if they are willing to understand poetry. But it takes time and a lot of patience. I have done The Crucible and The Sound of Music. Both of those two are NOT as intense character-wise as Spoon River.Cheers to everyone!"},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"A book ahead of its time,Spoon River Anthologycaptures over 220 epitaphswritten as poems..Stories told about their lives..Poetry about the peopleof the Prairie,frontier America,failure, the breakdownof the American dream,Spoon Rover Anthologycaptures America around the turn ofthe 20th Century & before the first World War,this is a book of poetryas much as also American history,Edgar Lee Masters did histhing withSPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY.."},{"Title":"Spoon river anthology,","review":"I saw a theatrical production of The Spoon River Anthologies and fell in love with the prose.

Author mentioned for example that USB2 is brand new think in computing; I have USB2 for several years and the copyright of this book is 2005! Also while writing of this book, author use Mac computer and not PC as mentioned in the title of this book. In examples of software, author works with Mac software costing $1000 and another software (Pro Tools) that run on both, PC and Mac. Author mentioned in the book, that 32 track recording software is not sufficient. The version of Pro Tools that is not limited to 32 tracks starts at $4000. Author should use examples for Sonar or Cubase to keep trend with home recording engineers. Those software are professional quality and financially friendlier. About $500.I would like to conclude my review. If you want a book that explain you basic of home recording and you are willing to do extensive research about software and hardware through Internet or other sources, the book is for you. From the other hand, hardware and software for recording is changing so rapidly that you would have to make some research anyway, though, this book would be actual about 5 years ago.

For example, 1G or 2G RAM is quite common these days, but the book still staying in the 256-512M age. But in general, it is a great book on how to start out on PC recording."},{"Title":"PC Recording Studios For Dummies","review":"In a world of rapidly advancing technology, it is understandably difficult to write a book based upon technology that is not quickly outdated. As such, the 2005 copyright might incite some immediate hesitation. Unfortunately, there is not a significant amount of comparable reading material with regard to this subject matter which has been written more recently. However, in this case, there is relatively little to fear. In my opinion, the core concepts still apply, and the reader is simply forced to replace the written \\"currently available\\" this or that with what one knows to now be available in terms of both hardware and software.This work is a legitimate help to inexperienced readers who are seeking to wet their palate or gain a better understanding of the home recording process. In fact, the material found within ranges from the most basic of basic to fairly complex subject material, and much of what should be between. The only drawbacks might be (other than the date issue) the fact that the author focuses primarily on Pro Tools and Logic; however, if the reader prefers either Pro Tools or Logic this would be a significant advantage. Even this is understandable when considering the veritable plethora of available software options, and I commend the author for even covering two of the major players at such great depths. Furthermore, the author, at least, attempts to take an unbiased approach while explaining processes involving both Macs and PCs. Overall, if the title appears to pertain to what it is that you are looking for, the purchase is probably worth it if not only until an updated version is available."},{"Title":"PC Recording Studios For Dummies","review":"I picked up this book after being interested in trying PC recording for months. I had previously tried browsing the internet, searching forums, etc, to figure out where to get started - if anything, I just found myself more confused.

It assumes you know very little and presents the information in an easy-to-understand format.The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I felt like there could have been more information added to the book. Granted, it is a book for beginners who want to get started, but I still felt like it was a bit sparse in parts.

Fuller Torrey and examines the issue of the increase in worldwide cases of insanity since the eighteenth century. The book is at once both a scientific study which attempts to explain certain statistical data from different parts of the world, including Europe, the United States, and Canada, as well as a history of the mental asylum. Torrey examines in particular the issue of insanity and it's two principal forms - that of schizophrenia and that of manic-depressive psychosis. He also examines the role of insanity within literature, examining writings of such figures as Edgar Allen Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville, among others of course. Data from successive censuses taken in various countires seem to support Torrey's conclusions that insanity is indeed increasing, though with the era of deinstitutionalization this becomes more difficult to prove. Thus, according to Torrey, this issue may be covered up, because where formerly patients were admitted to asylums today they are not. Explanations for this increase have traditionally varied. Torrey also discusses some of the theories as to the causes of insanity - all biological, including genetics, stress, and environmental factors, as well as toxins and microbes in the environment. While the warnings in this book may appear alarmist, this book offers an informative introduction to the issue of insanity, which continues to plague the modern world despite its ancient origins. As a history text this book is good in that it reveals some of the developments which were responsible for the birth of modern day psychiatry and the state mental institution or asylum. Perhaps we can see in insanity, a reflection of the larger struggles of civilization as it makes its way from its birth pangs in ancient times, to its growth development, and eventual old age and decline."},{"Title":"The Invisible Plague: The rise of Mental Illness from 1750 to the Present","review":"This is a fascinating review of the history of mental illness for periods of time that are usually rather hard to research.

Instead, it is an attempt to support the authors' belief that the incidence of 'insanity' has increased in the last three centuries due to 'urbanization'. The authors eventually define what they mean by 'insanity' in an appendix but even here there is no mention of differences in diagnostic criteria that have existed in different places at different times and still do exist. There is certainly no dearth of information in the book and some of it is accurate in itself but much seems to have been included more for 'padding' than for relevancy.

Yes indeed, we certainly are, according to The Invisible Plague by Dr. Edwin Fuller Torrey and Judy Miller. This book provides an illuminating history of insanity, focusing on the last three centuries in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, and the United States. \\"Insanity\\" here refers to two conditions, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (manic-depressive). Today, \\"psychosis\\" is the proper term for describing insanity and lunacy, but the authors preferred to use history's word, insanity.The objective of this book was to convince us that an epidemic of insanity has been growing in Western society, based on a small mountain of circumstantial evidence. Insanity seems to be one of the many unintended consequences of the Industrial Revolution. In the four regions studied, the last 300 years have been an era of turbulent change on a colossal scale.By the end of the nineteenth century, the British Empire had spread to every corner of the world. The news coming back from frontier outposts consistently reported that insanity was rare or unknown in \\"primitive\\" societies, where folks enjoyed a far slower way of life. Long-term stability was the opposite of crazy.In Britain, a number of observers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were well aware of a growing insanity epidemic, and some actually linked it to civilization -- it was simply an acceptable cost for the wonders of progress, wealth, and luxury. Living in such amazing times over-excited the minds of those who were mentally fragile, and this was simply unavoidable. Some even saw rising insanity as a badge of honor, indisputable proof that civilization was thriving. Lunatic asylums were booming, praise the Lord!By the end of the story, the authors concluded that insanity was growing at a much faster rate than the population. In the 200 years between 1750 and 1950, the rate of insanity increased 700 percent, and even more in the US and Ireland. There is an invisible plague all around us! What can we do?A specific cause for the insanity epidemic has not been discovered, but contributing factors might be associated with diet, alcohol, toxins, medical care, and/or infectious agents. It's more common in men and immigrants, especially when the immigrants are a small minority in the community. There is a clear association with the rise of industrialization and urbanization.In the British Medical Journal, Marco Picchioni reported that schizophrenia \\"is more frequent in people born in cities -- the larger the city, and the longer the person has lived there, the greater the risk.\\"An observer in 1877 commented that the rate of insanity was growing so quickly that it was only a matter of time before the majority of people were insane.

Now, as a 42 year-old mother of two young boys, I am sharing the resumes and fun of baking with my children. Though the pages has become a little tattered, our favorite cookie recipes are right in this book!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My mother received this book from my grandmother and we always used it growing up.

I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"We originally got this book from a neighbor for a Christmas present years ago. My little girls enjoyed making Christmas cookie treats from it. This year we bought a copy to hand on to someone else who we thought would enjoy it. These are old recipes, but I haven't come across a single one that wasn't just as marvelous as the ones in modern gourmet magazines and cookbooks. It has just about every type of cookie you could ever want to bake: fancy, comforting, or quick!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I grew up with this cook book, making snickerdoodles and candycane cookies with my sisters and friends for Christmas. My Momstill has her original copy, loose pages, notations on favoriterecipes and clippings inserted everywhere. I think we even usedit to help earn our Girl Scout cooking badge! I have alwaystold my mom if she ever sees it available for sale, get me one!Mom, my search is done!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Betty Crocker's Cooky Book is a rediscovery from childhood for many and an entire world of delicious cookie treasures for anyone who loves baking, especially in the holiday season.Each year at Christmas my grandmother would take out about 20 (it seemed) cookie tins and bake until each and every one of those tins were filled with cookies during the winter months and especially near Christmas.This is also the book we loved as children. I fondly remember spending hours just looking through this book and wishing the cookies I wanted to make would magically appear on a plate. Soon, I was old enough to cook the Peanut butter Cookies, Russian Teacakes and Candy Cane Cookies. My favorite page as a child was page 56. A page filled with storybook cookies that were painted and iced sugar cookies.The contents include:Drop, Bar, Refrigerator, Rolled, Pressed and Molded Cookies.Holiday Cookies for Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas.Cookies for Children, Lunchbox treats, Cookies that will travel, Heritage cookies, Cookies for Special Diets.Brownies, Date Bars, Ginger Cookies, Cookies made from mixesTeatime Cookies, Cookies for a Crowd, ConfectionsBest CookiesIn this cookbook, they say you can use either the traditional or the sifting method. We always used the traditional dip and sweep method for measuring the flour. Then, on the next page they explain why your cookie dough might be too soft. I've always found this rather amusing, since you see...if you use the sifting method, you will possibly not have enough flour, at least in my mind. Most cookbooks say to use one OR theother method for all the recipes and some don't really give you the choice and this is eternally confusing.Some of the cookies you might enjoy:Old-Fashioned Oatmeal CookiesButterscotch BrowniesHoliday SpritzSnickerdoodlesChristmas BellsCream WafersNougat BarsDefinitely a collectable Betty Crocker Cookbook. For a Facsimile Edition from 2002, look for ISBN 0764566377. My mother recently bought me the newer edition and it is wonderful to have this cookbook all in one piece. This is the type of cookbook you will truly use and that is why our family has been through numerous copies over the years.~The Rebecca Review, already dreaming of Candy Cane Cookies..."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Remember that cookie you made long ago... but you just can't remember where you got the recipe? Most likely you got it from this book.I had this book while growing up. My mom and I made countless cookies from this book. One of them called for a box of cake mix (which was one of my favorite to make). Years later the book disappear and thought to be lost forever. I could never remember where I got that cookie recipe from.. 'til we found this book amongst my brothers books! There was my recipe: Butter Mix Press Cookies! amongst all the other family favorites: Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Crinkles, Bonbons, and more!After getting this book you will never need another cooky/cookie book again!!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My sister gave me this cooky book when I was in my teens. I loved it, and used some recipes over and over and over. When my kids were little, they got hold of it, and eventually I lost it.

I am SO glad I found this reprint!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My mom has an original copy of this, and I inherited my grandmother's copy when she died.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"A friend of mine had one of the original copies of this cookbook. I went to copy some recipes and there were just too many good ones in this book, that I had to get my own copy. I have made 4 cookie recipes so far and have been pleased with each one of them. There are old recipes I remember my mother making and some my friends still make and love. This is a great book that no kitchen should be without."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I had my mother's original exact copy of this book from the 1960's. It contains the same recipes, on the same pages, with the same pictures, as the originals (as I memorized page numbers for certain cookies). Lots of proven recipes with the original ingredients. Quite possibly the only cookie book you'll ever need. Though don't ask me why they spell it Cooky! Also contains brownies, etc."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Opening this book to see the very same pictures I drooled over as a kid was a warm and fuzzy flashback to happier times.

I have the original one that I have been using and love it."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"When I was six years old, I told everyone who would listen that I wanted this book for my birthday. My Nana got it for me with Green Stamps (remember those?). This started a cookie cookbook collection that is embarrassingly large and spans over forty-four years. I still love to get this book out and look at the pictures. I remember making the Tiny Fudge Tarts and Candy Cane Cookies with my mother. My Aunt Mary and I made the Holiday Apricot Balls ( she preferred no-bake cookies). Just recently I made the Banana Jumbos and they were heavenly! This book is a classic and anyone who loves cookies should own it."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"So glad I found this! It's exactly like the one my Grandma had (minus the written notations and cooking stains!). I love the recipe for Ethel's sugar cookies. It's my all-time favorite."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I had this book when I was a little girl, and pretty much learned to bake from it. The recipes are clear, the instructions are easy to follow, things turn out as they're supposed to, and they taste delicious. Would love to see a reprint. I know some of the recipes are perennials that appear in other Betty Crocker books, but one particular feature of this book is a series of Best of the Decade cookies -- from the 1920s, \`930s, and so on, that I've never seen anywhere else. Anyway, it's a great collection that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I bought this book as a shower gift for my daughter. I had an original for years and years and replaced it in 2002. I love it! I love the pictures most of all. I also bought a copy for my daugher-in-law and son. It is a tradition for me.

We had a blastmaking cookies--the hardest part was choosing whichones to make the first!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I loved this cookbook as a child. Loved looking at all the cookies and helping choose the ones to make for special occasions. Now, as an adult, I find that this old cookbook is in some ways better than newer ones. For traditional, seasonal and old-world inspired cookies and bars, this is a great book to have. Simple to make recipes and comfortingly consistent results, using simple ingredients that never go out of style. Lacking the on-trend low-fat substitutions and fusion creativity of newer recipes, it is classy and transporting to make these classics.Outstanding book for young and aspiring bakers of all ages and skill levels."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I own an original copy of this book. When my daughter found it on your website I ordered one for each of my three daughters for Christmas. They were thrilled. The recipes are a lot of old favorites, easy and fun to make.

We grew up with all these cookies. My mom has an original Betty Crocker Cooky Book that she still uses. She copied a few of my childhood favorites for me but it's not the same as having your own copy. This has so many great recipes. They are not lowfat or healthy so if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. A few of the recipies call for shorting which I never use, but most seem to be butter recipes. This is a great book for those of us who are nostalgic about Mom's cookies."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers, I did not grow up with this book, although I did grow up in the 60's. My Mother was a fan of the Red Plaid Better Homes and Gardens Cookbooks. There are some good recipes there, but seriously, the woman did not know what she was missing! I bought this book because I have an interest in old cookbooks, but I was delighted to discover that the recipes were nothing short of fantastic. The snickerdoodles recipe alone is worth the price of the book -- sheer perfection. I've tried quite a few of the recipes, and I've had no failures. None. Even the pumpkin cookies were devoured by my daughter's fellow elementary students. When you add great recipes to pure nostalgia you have a perfect winner. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to bake and eat cookies. Yum!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My mom had this cooky book when I was a child and many cookies were made throughout the years from this cookbook.

I have made the Haystacks for years, the Noodle Clusters, the Kisses which I learned something new from: These are drop cookies that are dropped on to an ungreased paper on a baking sheet. When they are finished baking, you remove the paper with baked kisses; lay a wet towel on the hot baking sheet. Place paper of kisses on to the towel; let stand 1 minute. The steam loosens the kisses.I am now eyeing the Lemon Puddin' Candy Clusters. They sound easy to make and delicious. This is a great cooky cookbook loaded with so many choices.I love the look of this book - it reminds you of the past, the pictures are dated and I enjoy that.

One of the ladies told me about the bout being re-printed, she sent me the link to Amazon. THERE IT WAS! I purchased 1 for myself, as well as 1 for each of my 5 adult children. When I asked each of them if they would like a copy, they all said yes. They had very fond memories of sitting and browsing through the book and helping me make cookies from the book, as children. Needless to say, all 6 of us love our new books. You are a lifesaver. Oh--and I ordered on Christmas day and they were here 2 days later! What service!!

I wore out my first copy and was lucky enough to find a reprint in 1974, which I have been using up till now. My own girls were raised with that edition, they too always loved the pictures and would choose which ones they wanted to try. Many pages are loose and the cover is half off.

It was used so much, hand written comments from family members, and in many cases there were proportions re-written to double the favorite cookies. This was my standby book for all occassions from after school snacks to Christmas parties and everything inbetween. It became so well loved and used that there were drops of various ingredients, like drops of vanilla, smears of chocolate, turned down corners and such, that the cover finally fell off. I continued to use it, but then figured I owed it to myself to invest in the new edition and I am so pleased that it is just the same as the old original. The peanut butter cookies and the Snickerdoodles were my kids very favorite and they are all grown and have families of their own now, but those unforgettable recipes continue on.

Being the cooky baker in the family, I remember the countless hours I spent browsing through all the wonderful pages, literally reading our Cooky Book from cover to cover. Through the years mom would loan out her book when it was cooky baking time and some time ago it ended up lost in action. We couldn't find a reprint copy to replace it. It was a family treasure we truly missed. Sure, I had some of my favorite recipes written down and filed away, but I really missed the holiday ritual of browsing through all the beautiful color pages of cookies. This year my sister presented me an early Christmas gift of my very own copy of The Cooky Book. I immediately began browsing its' pages, sharing old cooky baking stories with my daughters. Everytime I see its' cover staring at me from my kitchen shelf, I feel a bit nostalgic as I recall the happy moments throughout my childhood when I discovered yet another favorite cooky recipe. It was the best gift my sister could ever have given me. Now that a copy of The Cooky Book is back within the family ...in my possession... I have been designated the official cooky baker.

I have purchased over one dozen copies for my coworkers for Christmas. It's so nice to have a cooky book that shows pictures of all the cookie recipes. The toffee bars, spritz, thumbprints, cut outs, gingerbread men, gingersnaps, are all excellent. I haven't found a bad recipe yet.

It is a must have for anyone starting a collection and was often my choice for giving as a bridal shower gift. I will be purchasing copies for my kids because I have loved this book and passing on my favorites from it has been a joy."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I could not believe my eyes when I saw the cover of this book and the spelling of \\"cooky\\" - it is identical to the one my Mom has used for years. The cover is half ripped off and the pages stained, but it is still used. All of the recipes for the cookies that I bake come from this cooky book. I cannot tell you the compliments that I get on my cookies. I am so excited to see that they have reprinted it. All I can say is buy it!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I've used this book for over 40 years, and it is my go to cookbook for cookies. It has lots of colorful pictures, many tips for baking, lists of cookies that mail well. It is divided in sections, such as Quick 'N Easy, Holiday, Favorites, Company Best. My family's personal favorite is the Holiday Fruit Drops. Even after 40 years I haven't tried all the recipes, so I plan to try some new ones from my new copy. The best thing about the new edition is that I don't have to learn new page numbers."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"A great variety of cookies and sweets for Holidays or any time of the year. I grew up eating cookies my mother made from the recipes in this book and find that it is now a staple in my home as well as my daughters."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I got this book because my mother has had this book for over 30 years and every year we make Christmas cookies from the recipes from this book. Its an exact copy of the original which is nice to have in my recipe book collection. The pages do stick near the binding but other than that I recommend it with my highest regards."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Love all the old recipes. Fabulous book. Tried a couple this year for Christmas baking and they were an instant keeper."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is a great cookbook. I really like the fact that it is spiral bound--it makes it easy to perouse through the pages, and then the book lays flat when you settle on a recipe. All the information and directions needed to make the cookies in this book are clear and easy to follow. I am counting on this cookbook to get me through the holidays!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is a MUST-HAVE cookbook for every kitchen. I have an original copy that is falling apart. When I got married, my mom bought me the newer Cookie Book by Betty Crocker and I was so disappointed. The book was updated with healthier recipies, they removed the history section, and for me, removed all the fun. I found a copy at a flea market for $2.50 and was overjoyed! It's now tattered, torn and stained... I couldn't be happier to see this reprinted in it's original spiral-bound form! When I first saw the reprint, I bought all the copies they had on the shelf as gifts. Not enough for me to keep one, sadly. SO, I'm now treating myself to a new copy and will retire my original treasure.My favorites include Mary's Sugar Cookies - made with powdered sugar rather than granulated sugar. DELISH! Make the Egg Yolk paint and make it an art project for your kids - or make some beautiful, personalized cookies for a bake sale (sold out at our school fundraiser and we were able to charge an outrageous amount for them). Much better than frosting cookies in my opinion.Toffee Squares, Russian Teacakes, Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Crinkles, Merry Maker Cookies, Lemon Bars, Lemon Cheese Pressed Cookies, Rosettes - the list goes on and on.Treat yourself (and those who can sneak cookies out of your kitchen) - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Our family bought this book when it first came out as a gift for our Grandmother. She used it plenty and when the time came the book was given back. Since we received it back in 1982, my twin sister and I have been doing the family baking and this is our number one choice. Many favorites our covered in this book, ours is falling apart from use. How many can say that today about a cookbook? Now in 2008, I am asking for another for Christmas. If a member of your family loves to bake, this is the bible of cookies. To my knowledge not many cookbooks are reprinted due to requests. All the standard favorites are included in this book! You will not be disappointed. To which there are no others."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is the third copy of this book that I have owned, beginning with the original one back in 1963. I wear them out.

Great \\"Ultimate\\" cookie cookbook."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Betty Crocker's Cooky Book is one of my favorite books. I purchased my original copy in 1967 and have used it for YEARS.

Thank you for letting me find another copy of this book."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is the cooky book I grew up with (we won't mention how long ago!). Brought back many memories and the recipes are still yummy and relevant. I bought this as a gift for a very good friend and put post-it notes with little comments by my favorite recipes. My friend really appreciated that. Now I'm thinking I should buy three more and do the same for my kids, or even write directly in the book."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Great cook book. A lot of great, tried and true recipes, like the standard Chocolate Chip Cookie and Peanut Butter Cookie. Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"In 1963 my Grandma got this cookie book. I remember sitting with her and deciding what cookies to make as we watched it snow in our tiny town. I was given her cookbook before she passed away filled with notations and extra recipes she printed in the back. I make the Merry Christmas cookies yearly and so many others. I started a tradition with my own family and to this day 48 years later this is the book we open first. Buy it you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My mother has had this cook book since WAY before I was born. I was thrilled when they re-released it and bought copies for my self and my sisters.

It's the same \\"cooky\\" book my mom had me look through to pick out recipes to make together, only this one doesn't have pages falling out... yet. Many of the recipes are dates and sometimes ingredients aren't as available as they were in the 1960's, but it adds to the fun. It's a great resource and while there are some recipes I would never make it's nice to know I'm making them the same way now as I did with my mom many years ago. :)"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I haven't baked any of the recipes yet, but I do love to read the whimisical comments scattered throughout.

Not just because I used to love making cookies with my mom years ago, but the variety of cookies make this book one of the best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I grew up in the era that used this cookbook, so it is a real treat just to sit down and browse through this book. I love the way old cookbooks are worded and illustrated; it was definitely a simpler time.Despite my enjoyment of this book I have yet to make any of these cookies, and I probably won't make them as written because of one very fatal flaw: the vast majority of them call for shortening (Crisco) instead of butter. Being a fat, shortening carries the flavor of other ingredients but does not bring any flavor to the recipe (See for yourself: taste Crisco, then taste butter. Which do you think will make the better-tasting cookie?). I have no doubt that the recipes in this book will bake up pretty much they way they should since it's far easier to get good results with shortening than with butter, but they will be on the bland side. However, in a lot of recipes you can't merely substitute butter for Crisco, since they have different percentages of fat.Don't get me wrong--I enjoy reading this book, and I realize that nobody wants his or her nostalgia tampered with. Of course these recipes will give you exactly what you remember, but if you want your cookies to be more than just a trip down memory lane there are better books out there. Allow me to recommend one book that delivers the goods: The King Arthur Flour Cookie Companion. You will get great-tasting cookies and will be given loads of invaluable tips on the science of cookie baking so you won't get anymore failed or bland cookies."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment. None of the pictures of cookies in the book actually look good to eat. They look like they would be ideal in decorating the witch's house from Hansel and Gretel but I wanted cookies to eat not enjoy visually. I like the retro look but for cookies that are meant to be eaten, I recommend the Cookie Bible. Everything in that book looks and tastes great."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My mother owned an original edition of this cookbook (note the spelling of \\"cooky\\" versus \\"cookie\\"). It was her favorite resource especially at Christmas. The recipes are well written, clear and concise. The pictures show exactly what your creations will look like. I bought a copy for each of my kids so that they can create the same delicacies for their guests that their grandmother did for them."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I was presented with the Betty Crocker's Cooky Book as a gift the first year it was published. I was delighted to find that I could still purchase this edition through Amazon. I actually ordered three, one for my daughter and one for each of my daughter in-laws.

This book is, indeed, a dead ringer for the original edition, and I'm sure that anyone who remembers the original with fondness or who just has a liking for 50s and 60s vintage cookie recipes will love it as much as I do. I'll be buying another copy of this eventually, so that my daughter, who grew up on these recipes, can have her own copy to take with her when she leaves home."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is my very favorite cookie cookbook. I have been married for 42 years and have had this book the whole time. Two years ago my daughter requested it for Christmas as it was also her favoriter after using mine for so many years.

This book has it all for those that want bar cookies, drop cookies, formed cookies, and special occassion cookies. If you can't find something to make in here you are not looking for a classic cookie book. Now here is what this book isn't: A fancy book with complicated ingredients or one that has a bunch of new things you haven't heard of. This is comfort cooking to the maximum. This is cooking with mom or grandma in your kitchen, cookie swaps for Christmas and getting back to those times when people baked and life was a little slower and a little sweeter.My absolute favorite cookie cookbook!

I fondly remember spending hours just looking through this book and wishing the cookies I wanted to make would magically appear on a plate. Soon, I was old enough to cook the Peanut butter Cookies, Russian Teacakes and Candy Cane Cookies. My favorite page as a child was page 56. A page filled with storybook cookies.

We always used the traditional dip and sweep method for measuring the flour. Then, on the next page they explain why your cookie dough might be too soft. I've always found this rather amusing, since you see...if you use the sifting method, you will possibly not have enough flour, at least in my mind.

We thought it was the best present we had ever received and waited with bated breath for each year's box.

With luck, they may start their own traditions."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"When I was doing my holiday shopping, I was overjoyed to see that Betty Crocker's Cooky Book had been reprinted for the 2002 holiday season. Betty Crocker's Cooky Book was originally printed in 1963. Yes, it's cooky, not today's cookie.The 2002 reprint includes only two short paragraphs of introduction on the title page. The new paragraphs provide warnings about today's ingredients and food safety concerns. They encourage you to ask your mother or grandmother how to make them if you don't understand the ingredients or the recipes. What a great way to share a family heritage, by baking cookies together!The cookbook is divided into 6 sections: Cooky Primer, Holiday Cookies, Family Favorites, Quick \`N Easy Cookies, Company Best Cookies, and Betty Crocker's Best Cookies. The Cooky Primer section includes instructions on how to \\"measure flour by dipping,\\" Necessary Utensils (including a \\"rotary egg beater\\"), Baking Hints, and a Q&amp;A section which covers self-rising flour, correcting cooky dough, and how to prevent soft cooky dough.The Cooky Primer section includes a color picture at the bottom of each page, showing the finished cookies and brownies. On page 11 of the Cooky Primer is a recipe for Butterscotch Brownies. This recipe is my husband's favorite. All the recipe calls for is butter, brown sugar, an egg, flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and walnuts. This brownie recipe spells out the secret to baking perfect brownies: \\"Do not overbake!\\". My Uncle Glen is a commercial chef, and he taught me that little gem at the precocious age of 10. These brownies have a wonderful butterscotch flavor, and come out of the oven chewy and golden brown.In the Heritage Cookies section, I baked the Old-Fashioned Sour Cream cookies on page 79. This recipe is a little more complex, it calls for shortening, sugar, an egg, vanilla, flour, baking powder, soda (that's baking soda, not tonic), salt, nutmeg, and \\"commercial sour cream.\\" These little cookies retain their shape beautifully, without using parchment paper! Their delicate texture is accented with a touch of nutmeg, making them a wonder for lovers of spice cakes. One batch made 53 individual cookies.The authors truly saved the best for last with this cookbook. The final section, Betty Crocker's Best Cookies, features favorite cookie recipes over time. Betty Crocker's time begins with Hermits from 1880! Starting with 1880, the cookie recipes move in 10-year increments. For example, 1890-1900 Cinnamon Jumbles. 1920-1930 Brownies. 1930-1935 Molasses Crinkles. These heritage recipes are accented by historical highlights and humorous anecdotes such as \\"the first brownies were a fallen chocolate cake.\\" This section is made for cookbook lovers of all ages. If you ever wondered what children ate for cookies in 1900 when they got home from school, you'll find your answer here. Cinnamon Jumbles!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I have the original version of this book and thru almost 28 years of marriage it has served me well! Early on, my copy got wet. The cover is warped and it isn't very pretty, but it's still the one I use time after time. Every kitchen needs a copy of this classic, especially if there are little ones around! There is no better book to use to teach them the basics of cookie baking......and all Moms need to take time to make cookies with their kids!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I've had a copy of the original Betty Crocker's Cooky Book, 3rd printing since 1966. I use it almost exclusively when baking cookies - it has all the favorites we grew up with! Pictures of each cookie are included and all recipes are fast and easy. An exact copy (same printing) went for big $$ on e-Bay. I wouldn't trade mine for anything. I highly recommend this cookbook to all cookie lovers, especially now when it's back in print and you can get your own new &quot;original.&quot;"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I grew up on the cookies my Mom made from this book. They are marvelous! When I was a teen, I got my own copy in paperback, for $3.95. 30 years later, I'm looking forward to getting a spiral bound book since mine is falling apart. Three all-time favorites are Plantation Date Bars, Butterscotch Brownies, and Raisin-filled Cookies. There are so many very good recipes, especially ones with chocolate. And often, there are details on the origin and lore of a particular type of cookie. I'm not put off by the use of shortening, as is called for (and commented on by another reviewer). Using shortening does in fact serve a purpose without being a flavorful component, and is therefor not a shortcoming of the cookie collection (in my grandmother's day, she used lard). But if one decides to substitute, there's always butter-flavored Crisco, or butter and oil. But for the most part, I ask why? Cookies are delicacies not a staple, not diet food. Live a little and have fun making yummy cookies from a wonderful-to-look-at book!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I grew up with this book and have my mother's original copy. It is completely falling apart from her use and mine. I have several other cookie cookbooks and they do not even come close.The Christmas selection, in particular, is quite good. The candy cane cookies are always a big hit with everyone I make them for. They are so easy, yet everyone is so fascinated with them.The main recipe I grew up with from this book is Snickerdoodles. Until recently I couldn't even find anyone outside my family who knew what they were...the most delicious cookie known to man and this recipe makes the perfect snickerdoodle. You'll never want to have store bought again after you make them.Actually, if you make any of these recipes you'll have a hard time going back to Oreos and Pepperidge Farms. :-)"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I got this book in my Christmas stocking when I was a kid. It was my first cookbook. It is still my favorite. I still have my stained original copy but it fell apart years ago. This cookie book has all the classic cookies. It also has a collection of holiday cookie recipes from other countries. I'm so excited to be able to own a new one!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is a treasure trove of wonderful cookie recipes. Pecan crispies are light and elegant. Thumbprint, Russian teacake, meringues and sugar cookies are holiday favorites. Shamrock cookies become witches' fingers for Halloween with just omission of food coloring and a different rolling technique. Almond butter, French lace, nut crunch cookies. Of course, there are hundreds more--your favorites, no doubt! I recommend buying this book if you bake, or if you hope to. But I will add, it's not the \\"original\\" Betty Crocker cookie book. My mother has that--from the 30's or 40's I think, smaller and with fewer recipes, but awesome. This version has vivid color photographs so you can drool--or occupy your kids with just visuals--while you consider what to make next!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I bought my first copy in 1972 - it has grease stains, dog-eared pages, and copious notes. I've made many of the recipes, and tweaked some to create new ones. One of my favorite things about this book is all the pictures, labeled with the cookie name and page number. Paging through this book is like paging through a photo album, as I remember making the Moravian spice cookies or the coconut butterballs. I was so happy when this was in print again. Each of my four daughters will have a copy, and they will page through it remembering the cookies of their childhood. Another feature is the spiral binding that keeps it flat on the counter as you work. This book is a gem."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Betty Crocker's Cooky Book was published in 1963 and has always been one of my favorite cookie cookbooks. I used it when I was a teenager but between raising children and moving from here to there, I lost my copy--then I found one here in December! I was so thrilled to have a brand-new copy, but it was immediately snagged--my college-aged son has already flagged some of the pages with his favorite recipes!This wonderful book is in an easy to read format--hard cover with sturdy spiral binding inside--and thick pages, hard to tear. It includes a Cooky Primer--hints for the best procedures when making refrigerator, pressed, molded cookies, etc. Each page of the primer has color photos of representative cookies with a page reference to the recipe. There are also sections of Holiday Cookies, (e.g., Love letters for Valentine's Day), Family Favorites, Quick 'N Easy Cookies, and recipes for entertaining or just showing off. The Holiday section has cookies from around the world--Lebkuchen and Springerle from Germany, Kringla from Norway, Zimtsterne from Switzerland, AND tips on the best types of cookies to ship and how to pack them.Truly a treasure, this book is jam-packed with full-color photos as well as easy-to-understand directions. I've never had a failed cookie from these recipes--and I've made many over the forty years since I first saw the book!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I love this cooky book.My mother always used this book when we where kids.Its a great book to use with children just learning to cook the recipes are great and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I received this book for my 9th birthday almost 30 years ago. This book is so fabulous that the book is falling apart from 30 years of use. This is the best cookie book ever. I remember looking at the pages and recipies and planning which ones I would make. I still use this book for all of my cookies! I have purchased one for each of my daughters to use as they grow up. My favorite cookies: Old Fashioned Sour Cream Cookies."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"My copy of the Cooky Book belonged first to my Grandmother, then my Mom, now me. My daughter and I pull it out often and make all the favorites. Chocolate Crinkles are the best.

Mine has the cover missing and many of the pages are stained. I'm not replacing my book but want to get one for each of my daughters. We love the Sour Cream Sugar Cookes, Snickerdoodles and Toffee Bars!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I have the 7th printing of the First Edition of Betty Crocker's Cooky Book. I have been using it for 35 years, and many of the pages have come unglued, but all the recipes are still great, and include many of my favorites. I've been baking cookies for more than fifty years, and this is by far my favorite book of cookie recipes."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I just received my book after ordering it shortly below my last review and I have to say I am not dissappointed. This is the best book out there with so many of the cherished recipes from the past. Lot's of the old German cookie favorites too that I had forgetton and aren't as popular anymore, at least not with their original names. I am impressed with the fact that it appears to be a reprint also and not a repackaged and changed newer book. I love the recipes in their original form, the pictures as I remember them with the old dated wallpaper in them(I did not have this books, but there were similar pics in my mom's '69 red and white BC book):-) The cookies aren't perfect like today's magazines, but they are as they come out which makes you feel better when yours come out the same as the books. Why even the historical recollections in the book were as they would have been in 1963(the history section and favorite cookie only goes up until 1962). It truly is as if time stood still. I like the reprint so much because I know the recipes are untouched and original.Well, I am off to make a list now of what we will be baking just for Christmas so I can get some supplies. I can't tell you all how giddy I am--Anyone who wishes to relive their past and remembers this book, or the recipes in it, it is money well spent, even if you only plan to flip through it and stroll down memory lane."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I've been trying to find this one for my grown-up kids for 30 years! We always baked many, many recipes from this book every Christmas season. The newer cooky books by Betty Crocker just didn't \\"add up\\", so now I can send each daughter one of the originals so they can enjoy for my grand kids. THANKS!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I have been using the original book for as long as I can remember, and it is well loved as well as being well worn. My copy is falling apart at the seams!!

This has some of the best cookie recipes ever and it's like a childhood on spiral bound pages. It's not just that most of the recipes are good, the book is set up so that it's easy to read and use and pictures of the finished product abound. If I could own only one cookie cookbook, this is the one. My faves: Spritz, Ethel's sugar cookies, Snickerdoodles, Butterscotch shortbread, Chocolate nut wafers and the Mexican wedding cakes. And hardly a winter goes buy that i don't make at least one batch of Molasses Crinkles. I can highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I have had a copy of this book for decades and it came up missing.I was so happy to find this one...it came promptly and in good condition"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I stumbled across this cookbook at a local bookstore and was immediately drawn to it, when I pulled it off the shelf I was flooded with memories of my childhood. How could this be? I remembered this cookbook or one similar to it and once I started thumbing through it's pages was compelled to purchase it for my collection. My cookbook collection started out with a few basic cookbooks, then I started collecting cookie cookbooks and it now contains about 250 different cookbooks encompassing all ethnic varieties. I showed the book to my sister and the same thing happened, our mom did have this exact cookbook when we were children (back in the 60's and 70's) and this is what she baked all our Christmas goodies from, we came across recipes that we have not had since our childhood and are planning a baking weekend to prepare all of our childhood favorites for our kids this Christmas. Thank you Betty Crocker for republishing this timeless classic!! Our mom passed away to cancer 8 years ago and we have no idea what happened to her original copy but are both pleased to have copies of our own to enjoy, although the original would still be treasured with all its stains, folded pages and marginal notes in mom's writing."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This book is full of precious memories for me. I can not remember a Christmas or occasion that my mother didn't pull this Cooky book out and flip threw it with me looking for the perfect cookies to bake. I'd spend days in the kitchen with my mother baking the most wonderful smelling and tasting cookies in the world to me. I'm now 33 and still flip threw this book finding cookies to bake for all occasions with my mother and friends. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants easy to make great cookies and great memories with family."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"This is exactly like the original cook book I had since my children were little.

Thank you Betty Crocker"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I grew up choosing christmas cookies out of this book. I have wonderful memories of paging through it; I'm not sure, but I think every cookie is pictured (not individually, but in groupings), this is great for the little kids that want to choose a recipe, they just say, \\"I want that one\\". A few years back when I had my daughter, my Mom looked into getting one for me off ebay and was impressed that they were collectable, and expensive (the older ones anyway). Between this and her inexperiance with the internet she never got me one and isn't ready to give up hers yet. So now that I have two daughters and the first is at an age that she enjoys dumping ingredients into the mixer I just ordered one so we can choose and make cookies together this christmas."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I love to bake pies, cakes and cookies.

For years, she's baked more than 120 dozen cookies around Christmas and this is the book she used. She gave me a copy three years ago and I've used it religiously to bake cookies ever since - not just at the holidays - but for school events, parties, hostess gifts and other functions (fortunately, my mother-in-law does not expect me to bake 120 dozen). :-)This book is an invaluable resource for the most basic (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, etc.) cookies, to the less common (egyptian rose leaves, cherry coconut bars, etc.) and will appeal to beginners and experts alike.

It included many of the favorites we made that I see here. I got a newer version of the gingham cookbook when I first got married in 1996, but many favorites were missing like Chinese Almond cookies(our first Christmas cookie baked each season!). Maybe it's because lately people just don't have the time or inclination to share this wonderful holiday tradition of cookie baking from scratch--it was certainly a much thinner section than my mothers edition(also covered in butter spots, flour, and falling out of the book;-) I am so excited to find this and expect it will be a more thourough book full of those favorite Christmas recipes. I am buying two(one for me now and one for my daughter when she is a little older). What an exciting tradition. By reading these reviews, I hope whoever printed this understands what a wonderful service they did to our beloved holiday traditions and hearts.

I learned to bake many of these great cookies and swore I'd learn to bake them all. Well, that never happened, but I still use this book when I want a favorite sugar cookie, gingerbread cookie or fabulously decorated pressed cookie. This book helped me create wonderful cookies in the 60's to send to my Dad in Viet Nam, to my boyfriend in the Marines at Camp Pendelton, and to bring as gifts at Christmas to friends throughout the years. The front cover is torn off, but still here, some of the pages have the crayon and pencil marks of my then 4 year old sister and 2 year old brother. A few tears, splatters and tons of memories.

You won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"I remember my mom making cookies from this book. This was her book and was published in 1963. I loved reading the recipes and seeing the marks she made next to the cookies she made.There are recipes in here that I have never even seen before. This book is great for all levels of bakers. The beginning goes over some basic utensils, measuring and even some hints. I highly enjoyed seeing the variations to many of the recipes in the book, just by adding a different spice or adding nuts.The best part of the book for me was the section called Betty Crocker's Best Cookies. My version has the best cooky of certain 10 year or 5 year periods starting at 1880. I enjoyed reading the blurb about the cookie and the historical highlights of events that happened during those periods.So if you need a new cookie recipe or just want to find an old favorite then check out Betty Crocker's Cooky Book!!"},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's cooky book","review":"Ahh, this book takes me back!

Once you delve into the delightfully colorful pages of this classic cookbook, you'll be lost in its delicious charms. I remember as a child simply looking through it, mesmerized by cookies of all shapes, sizes and hues. Rolled cookies, drop cookies, filled, cinnamon, sugar, Christmas--they're all here.The recipes are easy to follow and include interesting tidbits regarding their history. For cookie neophytes, a comprehensive section in the beginning of the book details kitchen utensils and useful baking and storage tips. Section headers explain the finer points of drop cookies, pressed cookies and other techniques. This is particularly useful information since the book itself is so vintage. Who uses a cookie press anymore? If you want to, there are plenty of ways to do so here.This book would make a great gift for anyone who likes to bake cookies. It's useful and a fun read to boot.

Infants near death were revived by vitamin C injections, and the 50% death rate (hence the title) in the region dropped to near zero during his 8-year practice. Deaths rose to former levels after he was drummed out by the Australian health authorities.Dr. K found his clinical observations and conclusions ridiculed &amp; ignored by the authorities, and still suffers hostility, persecution and shunning by the medical establishment.His work is deservedly praised by other medical heretics including Pauling, Klenner, Cathcart and others who challenge the myths that shots are health-giving and that vitamin C is good only for preventing scurvy.A great book by a great doctor, it should be read by every caring current or future parent. Pediatricians and MDs in general too."},{"Title":"Every second child","review":"I knew for some time how close I got to having a vaccine-caused catastrophe with my oldest child. When I read his account, I was even more sure. And I cried for hours as I read his book. A tragedy came close to me and my life. But thousands and thousands of others have already been touched by the tragedy of childhood vaccines and I believe that millions more will need to be sacrificed before the big money making pharmacies are controlled and no longer permitted to continue to kill our children and continue to create a generation of neurologically damaged children. ADD is running at 1 in 5. Autism is running at 1 in 150. Why isn't everyone startled at a striking percentage of an entire generation being neurologically damaged?My impulse when I don't know what is happening medically is to give vitamin C. This is a legitimate medical response promoted by some wholistically oriented medical doctors. So when my child was reacting SEVERLY right after each vaccine and my physician said that it was NOTHING, I gave vitamin C. And I gave more and more as she went back on a dramatic downward slide with each new vaccine. As I read the book, I saw that the same thing that almost killed my child was the same thing that killed thousands of children referrenced in this book: vaccines. And I saw that the same thing that saved my child is the same thing that saved many children under the care of the author Archie Kalokerinos: vitamin C. I find myself crying even now as I recall my experiences and recall reading this book. It is an eye-opener.By the way, my daughter is fine now. She had a very rough start to put it mildly. It took years of wholistic remedies to detox her, always including vitamin C. She is towards the top of her class academically, a wonderful piano player and by far the very best athlete in the school, boys included.This book MUST be made into a movie -- a major movie with big stars which people will pay attention to. Because the vaccination paradigm lies at the very core of allopathic medicine an understanding of its profound weaknesses by enough people could revolutionize modern medicine."},{"Title":"Every second child","review":"Vitamin C and zinc don't seem terribly important until they are lacking. This book, telling the experiences of a doctor who saved lives in Australia, should open the eyes of professionals and lay persons."},{"Title":"The Rector's Daughter (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"Mary Jocelyn is the middle-aged daughter of an elderly clergyman, who has spent all her life in Dedmayne, a quiet English village. The arrival of Mr. Herbert, son of an old friend of Canon Jocelyn's, brings much excitement for Mary, who falls in love with him. But life is much more complicated than that, and Mr. Hebert marries Kathy, a younger woman who is Mary's polar opposite.FM Mayor novel is character-driven rather than plot-driven. It seems as though all her life, Mary has been waiting for something--anything to happen to her. Her life at the vicarage in Dedmayne, severely curtailed by her father, is constricting. And yet Mary spends most of this novel (covering a period of about ten years) letting things happen to her. I found it very hard to like Mary at times, considering she's not really an active participant in what goes on in this novel. She's not like her friend Dora, a really engaging spinster who's embraced her unmarried status with perhaps a little too much gusto. It seems as though Mary wastes her whole life catering to the needs of other people, rather than doing things for herself. And yet, there's a quiet passion about Mary, a desire in her to see more of the world.The book also highlights the contrast between two generations: one of the late Victorian period, the other of the early 20th century. Although the book takes place presumably at the time it was written (1920s), the feel of the novel is very Victorian, and it may have something to do with the more or less repressed Canon Jocelyn, unable to express the way he truly feels. Mary is stuck between the two generations, unable to escape the confines of her own narrow world. It was very hard for me to understand why Mr. Herbert does a 180 in regards to his feelings for Mary; it made me dislike him all the more for being shallow. Still, FM Mayor really gets to the heart of her characters' emotions (or lack thereof). Susan Hill put this book on her list of 40 books she'd take to a desert island. While I enjoyed this for the most part, this isn't that kind of book for me. But it's still very good."},{"Title":"The Rector's Daughter (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"this is my favorite book. beautifully written, enthralling plot, characters so real you could touch them, poignant message. it meets all my requirements! highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rector's Daughter (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"Virago Classics at its best in this engrossing tale of plain middle-aged Mary, daughter of a stern but loving clergyman. Mary's spinster friend Dora is cheerfully resigned to her lot of church and charity work but Mary secretly yearns for more:' \\"I have longed for it...I have sometimes thought\\", Mary said with feeling \\"the kisses-\\"And then Mary's life seems to be changing...Interesting to compare the different lifestyles available to young people when this was written (1924)- from the Victorian upbringing of Mary to the fast-living young set who crop up later in the book, with their slangy talk and casual affairs.A heartily recommended read; and the end is so beautifully written."},{"Title":"Transactional Six Sigma and Lean Servicing: Leveraging Manufacturing Concepts to Achieve World-Class Service","review":"!After having read this book in greater detail a second time I felt obligated to rewrite my review!Transactional Six Sigma and Lean Servicing is an easy read and laid exceptionally well. If you want to learn how to apply six sigma without all the rollout hoop-la this is a good book for you.Too many of the newer books spend too much time discussing the road map of a full blown roll-out but lets face it, most of the people purchasing six sigma books are probably trying to apply the DMAIC problem solving approach on their own. If you're one of these people this book is for you.Since I work in a transactional environment, I thought the Lean Servicing portion of the book, one chapter, would contain some good tips or new insight that I could apply to my gigs, but I was disappointed. The chapter simply describes how to perform a good process analysis.However, I did enjoy the chapters (1.5 and 1.6) that discussed the history of quality and six sigma. These chapters are very well written and very, very interesting.Betsi did a masterful job describing DOE and basic statistics in simple terms.I can't believe how many times I find myself using this book as a reference tool!!"},{"Title":"Transactional Six Sigma and Lean Servicing: Leveraging Manufacturing Concepts to Achieve World-Class Service","review":"Finally, a book for the rest of us! I work for a large urban hospital who is thinking about implementing six sigma but everything that's out there is geared toward manufacturing. Ehrlich's book on transactional six sigma is exactly what our management team needs to understand how the six sigma methods can be used in our medical center. The writing is clear and understandable, the examples are great, and she takes the time to explain to those of us without a heavy statistics background the underpinnings of the statistical tools used in six sigma. As the Quality Assurance manager who has been tasked with researching the benefits of six sigma, I plan to have our entire executive staff read this book and expect them to be as enthused as I am after gaining a greater understanding of how the program works in a service organization."},{"Title":"Transactional Six Sigma and Lean Servicing: Leveraging Manufacturing Concepts to Achieve World-Class Service","review":"I bought the book to learn about Lean Servicing.

It was very pro breeder overall. The main reason there are so many wonderful dogs in rescue , is that breeders pop out many pups to make money, but never educate people on the specific needs of these dogs.If you are looking for an ig book, go elsewhere. If you want a book on how to train your puppy to sit and stay, and look at some cute pictures of iggy's , then , maybe you'll like it."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"This book is not written with enough detail, to generalized missing a lot of breed specific info that I already knew. I was not happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"As a veterinary hospital manager and owner of a 5 yr old IG, I am always looking for new material on the breed. I adore my IG, but she definitely has some \\"issues\\" that separate her from other breeds. This book does not mention the horrific difficulty owners have trying to potty train their IGs; this is by far the major reason that they are surrendered! The book says that they can be trained to go outdoors in the cold....I say \\"good luck!\\" This book says that they aren't fragile, but IGs are known to break their long, thin legs without doing anything out of the ordinary - mine has broken the same leg twice just jumping off the bed (which she does multiple times per day). The book mentions they have special dental needs, which is true, but it does not indicate just how costly this can be. IGs may be sweet, but they are also prone to neurosis. The fact that the book does not mention any of the above issues is irresponsible in my book;this is not an easy breed to own and it is important not to mislead readers BEFORE they go out and get a pup.I was even more upset that not once did this book discuss spay/neuter of your pup, nor did it mention rescue organizations as an option for adopting an IG. Almost every state has an IG rescue group (for all of the dogs given up due to behavioral issues, potty training, etc). As far as spay/neuter, I know several male IGs that were neutered later in life and have to wear a sock velcroed around their middle because they mark everything in sight. It is careless to write a book that does not discuss sterilization at a young age - if nothing else than for health reasons such as mammary and prostate cancer.As wonderful as they are, I consider IGs to be \\"special needs\\" dogs - not once is this portrayed in the book."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"I bought this book after I had decided I was interested in Italian Greyhounds. It was pretty good, has lots of information if you plan on purchasing an Italian Greyhound puppy, however, there are a few statements made in this book that I disagreed with.One statement was on the fact that you should buy an Italian Greyhound puppy instead of an adult because &quot;you can train it the way you want to.&quot; He did not bring up the topic of the Italian Greyhound Club of America rescue.The author seemed rather one-sided and wrote only on how he did things, not other possiblities. For instance--crate training. He did not mention that Italian Greyhounds can be litter box trained as well, or even go into that subject.The book was whoppingly based on his experience, while I appreciate that, what works for one owner does not work for another, and I was looking for more research, which I did not find.Also, there were no &quot;further resources&quot; for further information on Italian Greyhounds, such as the Italian Greyhound Post, IGCA, or other resources.It is still a pretty good book if you are interested in the basic information of the breed, such as breeding and show standards, and there are some nice pictures, but I don't think it's worth the cover price."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"This is the first book that I have read soley dedecated to the Italian Greyhound (IG).

My IG &quot;Gus&quot; would also give it 5 doggie treats."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"This was probably the first book we read before getting our IG, and we found it very helpful. If you talk to a responsible breeder about IG's, they should tell you what you need to know about them. Also, one search on the internet and it will bring up the IGCA. We have several books related to IG's and this book is just fine. IG's definitely aren't the breed for everyone. And they aren't very hard to potty train, you just have to be willing to teach them."},{"Title":"Italian Greyhound: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete Handbook)","review":"This is a good starting point for anyone interested in the breed however I do not feel it is worth the cover price.

I tended to see the conflict as a simple matter of Israel expanding its borders at the expense of the native population. I still can't say that I wholeheartedly agree with Kahane's solution but his motivations are beautiful.In this book written with the style of a poet and the intensity of a machine gun, Kahane again and again asserts that he is a Jew and he is a Zionist and that the two are inseperable. Because he is religious, he can only see the state of Israel in a religious context and that is that G-d gave Jews the right to the state of Israel and the duty to settle the land, and anyone who would impede it is going against the will of G-d. He discusses what Judaism means in a religious context, why Judaism is needed in the world and why non-Torah-based versions of Judaism aren't Judaism. He bristles with indignation at Christians who want to sweep centuries of murder, pillage and mayhem under the rug and he mocks parents whose children have gone to become Jews for JC stating that that is the end result of assimilation.When he gets to the history of the modern state of Israel, he uses the pre-state riots and the British oppression for maximum effect. He uses the quotes of &quot;respected&quot; politicians like King Faisel and Sadat to maximum effect as Faisel is accusing Jews of blood libel while Sadat is threatening to have another Holocaust.What makes this book refreshing is the counterpoint to Arab propaganda. Over and over again, Palestineans declare that Israel is an illegal state, bring up the U.N. resolutions that were &quot;violated&quot; and throw words like state-sponsered terrorism, unchecked aggression and Holocaust around without understanding for the context. Meanwhile Jewish defenders of Israel have to talk about concessions, Palestinean rock throwers and pleas for calm. Meir Kahane is meeting the battle head-on. No returning of land won during a war taht was supposed to wipe Israel off the map is giong to make peace. As long as Palestineans want to remove Israel once and for all, Israel must respond in kind.What makes this book troubling is the anger involved. It is propaganda and should be read as such. Kahane is silent about laws of gerus and settlement statutes that would make the Palestinean presence in Israel acceptable from a religious standpoint (although they wouldn't please Palestineans), he doesn't mention that the page of Kesuvoth that he cites is also used by the Satmir Rebbe as an argument AGAINST an Israeli state settled by secular Jews.Regardless, no matter what you feel about Israel - whether you are Palestinean, embarrassed American Jew, Israel hater, Israel lover, Israeli - you owe it to yourself to read this book, if only to know what you are fighting against."},{"Title":"Listen World, Listen Jew","review":"If you want to know what Zionism is, this book is must reading. It did not start with Theodore Herzl in 1895. It started almost 2,000 years ago, when the Jews in the Land of Israel were defeated by the Romans and chased out of their land.The story of the long Jewish exile, as 'guests' in other countries, is told here in an exciting manner. It all leads up to the return of the Jews to their own land in the late 19th century and early 20th century.If you read this book, you will understand why the Jews returned to the Land of Israel."},{"Title":"Listen World, Listen Jew","review":"In this book, Rabbi Kahane's main goal is to show that zionism is inherent to judaism and to the jews. By comenting historical events of jewish persecutions, he afirms the necessity of the jews having a place(land of Israel) to dwell alone and self-government. The Rabbi urges the jews not to assimilate and also makes severe critics to the american jewish stablishment.It's a very meanfull book for the modern jew and for anyone who wants to understand real zionism."},{"Title":"The age of discontinuity;: Guidelines to our changing society,","review":"Drucker shares so much knowledge about the early to mid 20th century global economic situation. He predicts the coming era of information technology. He suggests our advanced economies must shift to depend on knowledge work rather than industrial might. He explains why barriers to trade must fall in order for the most productive companies/countries to thrive. The Government's role diminishes as multinational corporations grow. Isolationism and protectionism hurt an economy in the long run. There are great concepts explained in this book, but it is like drinking from a fire hose. I needed to go through it twice, and will probably make a third attempt in the next few years."},{"Title":"The age of discontinuity;: Guidelines to our changing society,","review":"this is an absolute MUST READ for really anyone out there. the principal of the book being of use in one's own private life as well as when coming up with business strategies and trying to evaluate impact on existing ones. never out of time, for sure an lesson best learned!"},{"Title":"The age of discontinuity;: Guidelines to our changing society,","review":"I read this book many years ago and loved it. I remember Drucker's prophetic comments that a computer didn't make a revolution; you have to have an interlocking network to change people's lives. Electricity, for example, was much more than a light bulb; it was a network that linked people's homes to a source of electricity.

It was originally published in 1934. Robertson provides short comments on most verses in the NT. Most of the notes are technical in nature, but some are devotional. He often gives the Greek word underlying an English word, parses some Greek words, and at times, provides an alternative translation to the KJV that the work is based on.Unfortunately, he also supplies some textual notes. I say unfortunately as in his comments he assumes the newer (at his time) Critical Text was more reliable than the Textus Receptus. Personally, I prefer the TR and even more so, the Majority Text. I detail my reasons for preferring the MT in my bookDifferences Between Bible Versions.But other than this textual deficiency, Robertson comments are generally helpful. I purchased the hardcopy set years ago and referred to it often in my personal Bible studies. When I started working on myAnalytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament: Third Edition(ALT), I purchased the BibleWorks software program, which contains Robertson.

They are hardcovers, and are smyth sewn. The paper is not ANSI certified. The text is clearly a poor reprint, as the words are not clear and sharp, however it is still readable.Robertson is one of the best Greek grammarians of the 20th century. His large grammar will forever remain a standard reference, but this work is marred via his theological views, views which are everywhere injected into his text. Hence it is a very subjective work. If this is kept in mind by each reader, then some good use can be made of the work.Unfortunately, Robertson skips over many important points, and he seems to dwell on many which seem very minor. For example in volume 1 (Matthew page 78, 79) he discusses the message about the &quot;coming kingdom&quot; which was spoken to Israelites by the apostles. Robertson then declares that this SAME message isneeded TODAY. Many Baptists seem to think that the 1,000 year reign is the next event on God's program, but for us it is the &quot;rapture&quot;. The message for today is not just to Israelites, but should be for all peoples!Baptists are also disturbed with the clear literal meaning of Mark 16:16. As a Baptist, Robertson would rather remove this portion of scripture -- thus his religion influences his commentary in these and many other passages. In Acts 2:38 he seems to throw good grammar out the door in order to support (or try to support) his Baptist consorts.At times his grammatical skill shines through and benefits the reader, but again one is left to wonder why Robertson even composed this work, it is too theologically motivated and hence disrupts an objective use. Great for support of Baptist doctrines, but poor for objective textual data.courtest of Mr. Gary S.

In fact, the talents of herb and flower recognition that Mikko possesses in his garden are indeed a source for authentic happiness and serenity: \\"Grandfather Tarek saw how much his grandson really did know, and how much there was to learn in Mikko's garden.\\" Although it is a bit philosophical, it is a story worthy of reading."},{"Title":"The Happy Hedgehog","review":"One beautiful day the little hedgehog Mikko is sent out of his beloved garden by his Grandfather Tarek.

I know some of you are thinking \\"hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up\\", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up.

Even if a planet with abundant oxygen and water is found, its weather may be unsuitable; tides or seismic activity may be extreme; narcosis due to excessive carbon dioxide or nitrogen may occur; day lengths may be difficult to tolerate. The chapter &quot;An Appreciation of the Earth&quot; is practically redundant, because after studying the earlier text, the reader is sure to be glad of living on the third rock from the Sun!"},{"Title":"Habitable planets for man (A Blaisdell book on the pure and applied sciences)","review":"This glorious book is virtually identical to the first edition, published in 1964. And while it is a little dated, it is simply terrific. I wish I had read it when it first came out.Even the opening page is a treat, showing where our Sun would appear if we looked at the night sky from the vicinity of Alpha Centauri. It would be the brightest star in Cassiopeia! But what if we were in the vicinity of, say, Eta Cassiopeiae? Well, in that case, our Sun would be in the Southern Cross.Now we get into the meat of the book, looking for habitable planets. What do we mean by \\"habitable?\\" Even before the book was written, the term \\"habitable zone\\" was used to refer to a region around a star in which a rocky planet could have liquid water on the surface, and that's not a bad definition. But Stephen Dole wants a little more than that. He wants the mean temperature extremes in every season to be between 14 degrees F and 104 degrees F so we poor humans won't freeze or get overheated (personally, I think we could survive a little outside this zone: we do on Earth). He wants between 0.2 and 30 lumens of light per square centimeter so we can grow our plants.What about gravity? Well, sure, we'd get uncomfortable at much over 1.5g. But as Dole points out, there may be a stronger limit. Once a planet is above about 3.2 earth masses, it is likely to capture plenty of helium, so much that it will then capture hydrogen and become a gas giant. Too much atmosphere for us!How about oxygen? I might settle for a place that lacked oxygen and try to \\"terraform\\" it. Not Dole: he wants us to be able to breathe on that planet! And he computes some acceptable partial pressures of oxygen.Of course, we'll need water. Oceans! But we don't want more than about 90% of the surface to be covered by oceans: we need some land as well. And there are other requirements: not too much dust or wind, not too much radiation, a mass of at least 0.4 earth masses (so it can retain a breathable atmosphere), a day of less than about 100 hours so it does not get too cold at night or too hot during the day, decent values of inclination and eccentricity, and so on. We also need to be careful about \\"tidal locking,\\" with a year slowly becoming equal to a (sidereal) day on the planet. That planet might have part of its surface overheat to the extent that the oceans start to boil, with the water being lost by photodecomposition followed by a loss of the hydrogen to space (with the exception, perhaps, of some ice retained on the \\"dark side\\" of the planet).Next comes perhaps the finest part of this book, namely a table showing, for each star spectral type: the mean star mass, luminosity, radius, number of such stars per cubic parsec, years of residence on main sequence, and habitable zone boundaries. He eventually calculates (or estimates, by each spectral type) the total number of habitable planets in the Milky Way to be 645 million!That is a worthy and pioneering piece of work.Dole then gives a table of the stars within 22 light-years that he thinks might be candidates to have habitable planets. Since then, we've looked at some of these stars a little more carefully, and in the next few years, I think we'll know much more about them and the potential for habitable planets orbiting them. My guess is that we'll find at least one such planet.I highly recommend this classic on the habitability of planets in the Galaxy. It got me to remember a popular motto (which Dole, to his credit, does not use): \\"The meek will inherit the Earth. The rest of us shall go to the stars.\\""},{"Title":"Habitable planets for man (A Blaisdell book on the pure and applied sciences)","review":"This book was written in 1970 as an analysis of what sort of planet would be inhabitable by humans on a permanent basis (colonization), and what are the chances of finding such planets around nearby stars. The book looks at human requirements, such as temperature, gravity, atmospheric composition, etc. Then other factors are reviewed, such as solar system organization, stellar properties, satellite relationships, special properties of binary star systems, etc.This book makes for some very interesting reading. It is rather dated, though, with the mass of Pluto being placed at equivalent to the Earths, and with water oceans being speculated about for Venus. Admittedly, this probably does mean that some of the conclusions are suspect. However, the depth of information in this book does make it an interesting resource for science-fiction authors, and other interested in speculating about extra-solar planets for man."},{"Title":"Signs of Life","review":"Cherry Wilder's novel \\"Signs of Life\\" details the events surrounding the emergency landing of the crew of the Serendip Dana, a World Space Organization \\"transport\\" on it's way to Arkady. Presumably Arkady is a human planet somehow associated with the World Space Organization, which the reader can infer is an institution based on Earth that manages at least one \\"transport\\", the Serendip Dana. As to what exactly they were transporting we can't be entirely sure, at one point livestock are mentioned and there are a whole lot of reguler crew, silver cross members (repair crew organized along traditional military ranks), Auxiliary Support personal (andriods) and a media team accompanying a high ranking member of a popular religious movement.EDIT: I know now that the name probably came from the \\"Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations (SERENDIP)\\" project started in the seventies by the SETI organization. This adds a little more depth to the world and I thought it worth mentioning.There, you now know everything there is to know about the Wilder's Universe outside of the planet of Rhomary. Seriously, that's it. The entire rest of the novel has to do with how the survivors interact with each other (and much later the natives) after crash landing. The survivors split into more or less two groups, the regular crew who are more or less normal and the silver cross members who being more \\"military\\" are made stereotypically disagreeable, violent and power hungry.None of the characters change much over the course of the novel. And after the crash landing Wilder doesn't really throw any external challenges their way so you can't really blame them. It's just 300+ pages of social drama.So why two stars instead of one? For starters I found Wilder's writing style in Signs of Life to be refreshingly different from the mainstream. Alot of times she makes the reader fill in details within the storyline that normally would need to be explained by the author. The world is kept vague enough that whatever you imagine will fit with the storyline. It was almost like I was helping her write the story, this grew tiring after a while but I enjoyed the change.If your a Cherry Wilder fan or really enjoy reading about social dynamics in fictional environments, this book my be right for you. If you are detail oriented or believe sci-fi requires high entertainment value and should contain interesting new concepts, ideas, ways of looking at things, etc., then I would advise passing this book up."},{"Title":"Signs of Life","review":"I hate people who don't explain their abbreviations.

The immediate establishment of the military guys bad, us civillians good, was also irritating, since neither side was able to prove themselves anything other than their labeling.

A part from the usual descriptions of mars and venus placements and general astrological compatibility comments, Arroyo makes a vast number of deep and interesting observations that are much more subtle in nature and that make this book a real gem. For example, he looks in depth at the ability for a person to engage in a relationship at all, from the individual chart. He sees this as the first port of call of the astrologer. Can this individual, with this chart, have the ability for intimacy, committment, sexuality, etc that will allow for a successful relationship to occur?Arroyo looks at the aspects between charts, the elemental compatibility, at the Sun/Moon aspetcts and aspects with the outer planets as well as the nature of transits in synastry. Much of the book is taken from live lectures and there is such a rich exchange of questions and answers that deepen the material as well as bringing it to life with examples from his practice and from the lives of the participants. Excellent fun...One of the things that I really enjoyed was the case study example he examines towards the end of the book. He explains step by step how he approached this case and i learnt so much from this example.

Invaluable aid as it is, I recommend it highly to those wishing to understand more about synthesis in their interpretations... chart comparisons may be especially useful also. A &quot;relaxed&quot; attitude about difficult transits of the outer planets will put many minds at ease concerning these difficult times we all must face, &amp; this section alone may be worth the price of this book!"},{"Title":"Relationships and Life Cycles: Astrological Patterns of Personal Experience","review":"Another masterful volume of contemporary astrology by Stephen Arroyo. All his books stand out as being amongst some of the very best astrological literature published in the last 25 years. Early on in the prologue, Arroyo explains his approach with this one: \\"Sometimes one must concentrate on tuning in on the LIVING nature of ideas by having fun with them, and this can often be more significant for students of astrology than systematic and dry attempts to be deep and meaningful\\".The majority of \\"Relationships And Life Cycles\\" is comprised of workshop transcriptions, much of these being naturally presented in a question and answer format. There are five sections: The Individual's Capacity For Relationship, Techniques Of Chart Comparison, The Use Of The Houses In Chart Comparison, Understanding Transits, Some Thoughts On Astrological Counselling.Numerous astrological perspectives on common everyday relationship experiences are scattered throughout the text. At the same time, all the theoretical basics are covered e.g. the Sun and the Moon, Venus and Mars in the different signs of the zodiac, aspects between the charts of two people (particularly involving the planet of commitment, Saturn). The \\"Understanding Transits\\" section could almost be a separate book in itself, there is an excellent few pages here on the journey of Jupiter and Saturn through the different houses of the birth chart. A truly great book."},{"Title":"Relationships and Life Cycles: Astrological Patterns of Personal Experience","review":"Whenever I want a different approach or perspective on astrology, I read Stephen Arroyo. His in-depth knowledge and lecture style makes it easy to extract and apply what he has to say. It's like you're right there in front of him and the whiteboard. :o)"},{"Title":"Relationships and Life Cycles: Astrological Patterns of Personal Experience","review":"I saw this in the Astrology Shop in London, after perusing about a half dozen other synastry titles and indeed, the shop owners highly recommended this over any other one. This one clearly stood out. It is an awesome read. Pick this one up. It's so in depth and accurate.
