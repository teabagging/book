Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"WOW! What a book! Bugliosi takes the reader through each step of the story as it unravels, it is as if you are there! Nobody has ever probed Manson's mind the same way Bugliosi did. He sees Manson's not as a nut, but as an intelligent human being who put on an act to try to have charges against him dismissed. What I find most disturbing about this book is the mind control Manson had over his family. These misfits of society were willing to do anything for Manson. It makes me think of today's isolated teen who sits behind a computer in isolation. When will the next disaster strike? You and I do not know, but this is an example of what happens when we don't care for our children. I'll get off of my soapbox and tell you this is an excellent book. If you are a real true crime fan, the only thing to ask is &quot; why haven't you read it??&quot;"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"1969. What a year. The last year of a decade that began so innocently and by the end, America had lost its innocence, this crime and the story by the District Attorney who prosecuted the guilty in this tale, definitely represents the innocense lost in America. Vincent Bugliosi did an outstanding job to present to the world the bizarre and terrifying account of Charles Manson and his followers AKA &quot;The Manson Family&quot;. In the late summer month of August of 1969, some of the followers committed a gruesome crime spree of cold blooded murder. Bugliosi does a thorough job of going thru the background of the guilty and the victims and the events that led up to the horrifying nights of death. The trial afterwards is no less interesting. Remember all of this happened 30 years ago, yet the book is still as gripping now as it was when it first was published. Highly recommended to all who like to read True Crime."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"When i tell people that this is one of my favourite books, i often get weird looks, because they know that it is about the Charles Manson murders. This is the main focus throughout the book, but it is so much more as well. Helter Skelter is spellbinding, and keeps you entranced throughout the book, from the murders, to the 'motive' to the courtroom scenes, as well as everything in between. It was recommended to me because i am a Beatles fan, and it is interesting to see how it was interpreted and twisted by Manson. With all the talk about violence in the media, violent toys, etc, causing these spectacular school schootings, it is interesting to see how the Beatles' music could be interpreted as being one of the causes to these murders."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is the definitive read on the Manson Killings.It traces the roots of the Manson Clan and its various members, and manages to show its machinations behind the murders.Bugliosi is prone to rambling, especially in some of his other works, but in this book he does not which is a real relief.This is the sort of book that you will find difficult to put down and despite the sheer amount of facts that are put across it reads smoothly and sensibly.It shows yet another instance of police buffoonery too - the police search for one of the murder weapons in the Tate Murders, finding out that they had it for months.Thankfully though justice was served eventually and the Trial segment of the book is fantastically well written with enough twists and turns to satisfy any Perry Mason fan.A must buy!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is an in your face account of the Manson family murders. Brought to you straight from the courtroom as Vince Bugliosi, the prosecuter who tried Manson and his &quot;family&quot;, tells you this horrific story piece by piece.

Having it on my Kindle will allow me to have it forever!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read thousands of books in my life and this one is among the top in terms of gripping and holding my attention. After I started reading it, no spare second was used for any purpose other than reading it. I read it sitting on the toilet, in the bathtub, while riding to work, surreptitiously while at work and for a couple nights fell asleep with it in my hands. It is the story of the Charles Manson \\"family\\", who they killed, why they killed and how they lived. Written by the district attorney who compiled the case against Charles Manson and his bizarre group of followers, it describes in complete detail how Manson was such a controlling figure.After I completed the book, I couldn't help but think that in another place, another time and with another set of circumstances, Charles Manson could have founded a powerful religious cult. His hold on his followers was incredible; they truly believed that he had godlike powers. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, his methods were too brutal and violent to survive long as his philosophy carried within it the seeds of its own destruction."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I loved the book &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; Vincent Bugliosi did an excellent job writing this book. It was great because Vincent Bugliosi knew it all. He was the prosecuting attorney, knew all the facts, and is on top of at all an excellent writer. Manson was a crazy cult leader who commanded his followers or &quot;family&quot; to kill for him. The amount of murders still to this day is unknown. The largest spree of murders happened in August of 1969. Sharon Tate and four of her companions were savagely murdered for prize and pleasure. The following night a millionaire couple was again savagely murdered. The Helter Skelter was suppose to begin, but the hard work of detectives and the drive of a leaving family member led the murders to Charles Manson. This book is great for anyone intrested in the criminal mind, and reasons they did it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Highly recommended for anyone that wants to know the workings of a human mind. It covers the story very well, and tries to go 'deep' into why Mason thought the way he did. Covers Mason's history and the evidence that was uncovered by the author in his case against the man and his 'clan' of 'ladies'.Not for the quaint at heart though, because there are areas within the book that are very detailed, but if one can get past the details of the muders the book will be quite rewarding."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"A good book written by the prosecutor.

He guides us through the crime scenes, describes the police investigation, and finally his own investigation when Charles Manson, Tex Watson, Linda Kasabian, Patricia Krenwinkle, Susan Atkins, and Leslie Van Houten were arrested, and preparing for trial.Not only do we learn WHAT happened, but Bugliosi makes his famous search to uncover the complex motives that allowed this to happen: Charles Manson's mission to cause &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;Bugliosi clearly lived and breathed this case day after day, and he recounts it so vividly, the reader is part of the invesigation.-He also gives us valuable information on the trial process.

I enjoyed it but I highly doubt the complete accuracy of it. For one thing, the author seemed to play high and mighty quite a bit. While criticizing the work done by LASO, LAPD, and other attorneys at multiple points, he portrays himself as intimidating Manson (something that hardened criminals and correctional officers to this day can't do) and even putting a judge in his place (read the chapter about the Tex Watson trial). Furthermore, he makes factually inaccurate statements such as \\"psychologists are not doctors and cannot make medical diagnoses.\\" Although psychologists are not medical doctors, they are \\"doctors\\" and as far as \\"medical diagnoses\\" are concerned, he was referring to Schizophrenia in this case and psychologists are absolutely qualified to make such a diagnosis. While I fully believe that the crimes themselves were not sensationalized or minimized, I have no doubt that Vincent Bugliosi's portrayal of himself was sensationalized and his portrayal of others minimized."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"On The Very First Page Of Vincent Bugliosi's Novel \\"Helter Skelter\\" Is Simply Written \\"The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You.\\" This Was No Idle Boast.No Other Novel Scared Me More,Except William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist,A Horror Story Of Demonic Possession Sprinkled With Overt Satanism.But The Difference With Helter Skelter?THIS IS A TRUE STORY !In The Late 60's,Charles Milles Manson-An Aspiring Musician-Approached Doris Day's Son,Record Producer Terry Melcher In The Hopes Melcher Would Buy The Rights To His Songs And Have Them Recorded.Melcher Refuses.7 People Will Die Because Of His Refusal.In The Interim,Manson Leads The Typical Hippie Life.With The Promise Of Sex And Drugs Manson Assembles The Infamous \\"Family\\"-An Assortment Of Like Minded Hippies Who Will Help Him Take His Revenge On Melcher.Little Does Charlie Realize Melcher Has Sold The House To Director Roman Polanski And The Actress Sharon Tate.He Sends \\"Family Members\\" To \\"Creepy Crawl\\" The House And Kill Everyone In It.The Shocking Aftermath Ended With More Murders And All Of Hollywood Living In Terror-From Peter Lawford To Candice Bergen To Dyan Cannon To Many Others,Including-Understandably-Doris Day As Well.No One Felt Safe.Until Vincent T.

It's clear that Bugliosi is a gifted prosecutor with a keen eye for detail and organizational abilities worthy of an Army quartermaster on campaign. The guy didn't miss a trick, and his version of events is compelling.The book, however, would be more compelling by far if Bugliosi understood the meaning of the word &quot;humble.&quot; In every facet of the investigation, in every recorded moment of the trial, he is right, and anyone who didn't have his ability with details and organization is wrong. I suppose the problem with exceptionally gifted people is that they often have little patience for those who operate at lesser levels.Bugliosi's descriptions of the trial and the Everest-like proportions of evidence that needed to be sifted through, make it clear that it all he could do--with the help of LAPD, LASO, and other jurisdictions' police departments--to get his fact investigation taken care of. Certainly, had he not had different police detectives working for him, he never would have been able to present the case as he did. Yet he seems to think that the Manson Family defense attorneys should have been able to keep up with him and realize the significance of everything just as he did. He gives barely a nod to the fact that it was one's first trial, another had never won a trial before, all of them were working hard in a situation where they were probably under threat of their lives, and *none* of them were getting paid much if anything for their work.Bugliosi had police protection, a guaranteed salary, and information that trickled in over a period of months, leaving him time to assess it for worth. The defense attorneys had clients whose friends just might do more than threaten them if things went bad, wre making little if any money while expending much of their own, and were given information in huge batches that likely overwhelmed them and likely dimmed the significance of any one particular thing. The prosecutor, regardless of discovery rules, has far more of an advantage over the defense than Bugliosi seems willing to admit.If you take the book at face value, you will probably come to the conclusion that everyone involved in the Manson prosecution and defense, except for Bugliosi, is either foolish, lazy, or stupid. However, if you read it with the intention of picking up the facts of the case and the details of the trial, you will come out of the experience with a great deal of knowledge and the opinion that Bugliosi, maybe, just can't help coming off sounding like a tool."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I liked Helter Skelter, a very interesting book written byVincent Bugliosi. The book is about Charles Manson and the otherkillers and victims of the Tate-LaBianca murders. The bookHelter Skelter also talks a lot about what happened throughoutCharles Manson's life. As I read, I wondered if the killingswere going to stop and if he was going to get caught. This bookcame with a 64 page photographic record of the victims, thekillers, and the evidence.This book is for anyone who wants to learn why or how CharlesManson became what he was. I would recommend this book to anyonewho likes reading mystery books and anyone who likes to learnabout the lives and minds of killers."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry paint a riveting portrait of the Manson murders and the Manson \\"family\\". Being the lead and, later, sole prosecutorof the Manson gang for those vicious murders puts Bugliosi in the ideal position to tell the real story in all its gory detail, and he does it in such a spellbinding fashion.

He is forthright in his personal fellings toward the murders and his perception of the Manson &quot;Family&quot; including their theology that &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, the final war between the balcks and the whites, is the most outrageous in all of history, which made everything in connection to the murders just as strange."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Fantastic! I have read this book twice. I love the way the author narrates the real life drama of these murders, murderers and inefficiency of the LAPD. It is probably one of the scarriest books I have read so far. The author does a great job of explaining the psychological influences of Charles Manson and the crazy/hipnotic behavior of the Manson Family. He also paints a very clear picture of the long and difficult trial and the obstacles that needed to be overcome to convict Manson and his followers. It's a very interesting book from a psychological and legal stand point. I probably will read it again some time soon because the second time around helped me understand even more, the real-life occurences and legal complexities of this case."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Wow... This book is amazing. It's an in-depth look into the Manson murders and Manson himself. Bugliosi is a competant writer, who writes clearly and descriptively. As the prosecutor of these cases, he needed to study up on Manson; this is clearly shown. It also is a great example of the mistakes made by the LAPD.Anyone interested in true crime would be fascinated with this book. If you are weak of heart, however, take caution; the first sentance written in this book is true: &quot;The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"In the begining of the book it reads &quot;This book will scare the hell out of you&quot; and was that ever an understatement. Charles Manson and his crew will always be the ultimate in evil.

I actually had nightmares after reading about the first section of the book, describing the discovery of the 2 crime scenes, and the unsettling panic that began to set in over Los Angeles in the following days.The trial portion of this book is written masterfully, and it keeps the reader very interested in what is happening.I highly recommend that everyone who can stomach the grotesque nature of what is contained in the book to read the book. It is a genuine masterpiece of literature, which has deserved all the praise it has got.The story is twice as scary because, it is 100% true."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This warning appears on the first page of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and I never realized how true the statement would become. This is a TRUE story, and the events, characters, and descriptions are so frighteningly real you wish it were a work of fiction. A superb account of the criminal justice system, of cults, of the sway that one man can have over an entire group of people, and of the darkest sides of humanity. &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is an excellent read and an enthralling story."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read this book cover to cover 4 times. It is the most chilling murders I personally think ever took place in this country. Everything from how, when, and why they did it will simply take your breath!!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Most of my complaints with this book center on the author. I've read other things by Bugliosi and not been impressed, so it shouldn't really have surprised me. The book itself is good, and chock full of information. Bugliosi, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.To start with, he's a poor writer; his writing is very choppy, and doesn't read well. He also often makes grammar and spelling mistakes. He several times uses the word \\"fixed\\" when he should be using \\"fix,\\" for example. He also says \\"pleaded\\" when he should be saying \\"pled.\\" Yes, a minor detail, but it bothered me a little bit when I was reading it. I think a better editor would have helped the book a lot.In addition, Bugliosi is just plain obnoxious. For one, his self praise is really annoying and detracts from the message and the story he is trying to get across. It starts with his self praising bio toward the beginning of the book and continues throughout as he does everything possible to make everyone around him sound incompetent while making himself sound like God's gift to criminal law. It really, really got old. He also seems to give in to exaggeration a lot, which is not a good sign in a non-fiction novel. In particular the relish he seems to have for throwing others under the bus really makes him hard to like by the end of the book. This makes him hard to like, and it's always hard to read a first person book if you don't like the narrator.Beyond that, he actually did several things that bothered me as attorney. For one, why is he collecting his own evidence and conducting searches himself? Is he trained properly to do these things? Beyond that it creates potential conflicts of interest - which he as much as admits to himself at one point when he says something about it making him both the prosecutor and a witness. Getting involved in evidence collection often gets lawyers into ethical quandaries and complicates things; it's inadvisable and inappropriate. With the background he has, he should have known better. It's ironic that he spends so much time lambasting others for their inappropriate and unprofessional behavior when he's doing similarly stupid inadvisable behavior himself.I also question his legal conclusions sometimes - a lot of it is probably just things that have changed in the last 30 or 40 years, like missing what would now be obvious hearsay exceptions. I assume the law has changed in this area, but I think he was engaging in some self aggrandizement at times, talking about the time he spent researching hearsay exceptions that anyone who has graduated from law school and passed the bar would know off the top of their heads. The glaring legal issue was the statement that cops could smoke pot under cover and it wouldn't be a crime. I have no idea what he is basing that on, but I have never heard anything to make me think that is true - and I doubt it's changed much in the last 30 years. I am sure prosecutors look the other way, but that doesn't make it legal.Bugliosi's self congratulations continues throughout, trying to use regular things like legal research and restating questions etc. into brilliant feats of a brilliant lawyer, when in reality they are things that any lawyer can/should be doing during the course of a trial.I do appreciate that he makes an effort to explain some legal concepts, as the public often misunderstands what the law says and why things happen the way that they do. I do think his explanations were often lacking or incomplete, or he neglected to explain important things while explaining really minor details, but I did appreciate that he made the effort - and I am guessing lay readers probably got a lot more from the book because he took the time to do that.Last, when he is setting the Manson murders in context he tries to sound like an expert on serial murders when it seems he doesn't really know what he is talking about. I am no expert, but I have a lay interest and some of what he says seems to contradict everything I've ever read from other experts in the field. He says Gacy is the only one with more than thirty victims, but Bundy (who he also mentions) had at least 36, probably more. He also implies that serial killers are usually stupid, which is incredibly inaccurate according to any material I have ever read.When it comes to the actual story and the detail he uses in covering the Manson case, this is really a great book and highly recommended. Bugliosi does do a good job of creating suspense and making you feel thoroughly creeped out, and he provides a wealth of information on the case and all the principles involved. Just be ready to deal with Bugliosi's egotistical crap while you're getting that information."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I had to do a research paper based on an event that happened in the 1960's. So I decided to do my research paper on Charles Manson. I remember going to the library, checking this book out and looking for some good info to put on my paper. And thanks to Vincent's book, This helped me out a lot and I ended up with a B+ on my paper.If you're interested in learning more about Charles Manson and what happened in 1969 in the state of California, then I would really recommend this book to those who love learning about serial killers (like myself) and to those who love a true crime story that shocked the USA"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is very interesting.

It's four hours later and he's still reading it, pausing every now and again to tell me some other disturbing connection that was made between music and the murders. This was his perfect gift!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Read this when I was a kid. It was the scariest thing going in the 70's. Read it again in my teens and lost my old copy somewhere along the way. It's a very rigid, factual account of the case, the people and the events. I like it and always have. But it always left me wanting to know more about the whole case and the people involved. Other books offer more info that may be true or false or the accounts of others involved. This subject has so many twists, turns and side stories happening. It's just an incredible story. My picks in order on this subject are - 1) The Family, 2) Shadow Over Santasusana, 3) Manson: In His Own Words, 4) Will You Die For Me?, 5) Helter Skelter."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Charles Manson had a crazy life. His childhood was shrouded in mystery, and by all accounts he seemed to have developed his unique social skills at an incredibly early age, while bouncing around from one foster home to the next.I recently finished listening to the audiobook, and must admit that this was one of the most enjoyable and entertaining audiobooks I've ever listened to. The narrator was great, and the story kept me on edge from beginning to end.If you're considering listening to the audio (or textual) version of the book--I'd say give it a go, you certainly won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Today was decidedly a kickback day so I randomly pulled this book out and decided to reread it. It has been at least 10 years since I first read it and I have to say that it is every bit as terrifying as I remembered it to be. Bugliosi and Gentry go the distance in detailing the actions of the Manson family prior to their murderous and seemingly senseless rampage as well as documenting their activities on Cielo when they killed Sharon Tate and her friends and then went on to kill the LoBiancos. The details get gory at times but are essential when telling this story. The subsequent trial and the antics of the family recount a time when everything was peace and love but the Family was the antithesis of the era and put distorted and crazy behavior on view. During the period of the trial, the activities of the Mansons were covered extensively.Once front page news, today the Mansons and their leader Charley are merely footnotes to the period. They come up for parole periodically and I am sure that many people who weren't alive or weren't old enough to experience it wonder what all the fuss is about. This book is so well written and detailed that it resurrects their crimes and offers explanation why some extremely dangerous people need to stay in prison. As I read it I felt sickened and then anxious. This is one of the most frightening books I've ever read despite the fact that a certain amount of the book deals with legal procedures and prosecutorial strategies.It brings the past and present together and reintroduces Charles Manson and his groupies in startling detail."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent does it again with another amazing book. I always enjoy his books that go buy the dates everything occurred and you get a feel of how everything went down. I couldn't put this book down, at times i was disgusted by what the Manson Family did, but it is a part of American history and hopefully we can learn and become better people from this. It also gives a insight to the mind of Charles Manson a bit. Some of the things he said did make sense, but he was a crazy!!!!!! I kinda wonder if he was able to put his intellect toward something positive what could he have accomplished. Well if you are interested at all in the Manson murders you cant go wrong with this book. Enjoy.................... LOOK OUT FOR HELTER SKELTER!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book in the late 70's - early 80's and am very fimiliar with the Masnon case.

It was just as good the second time around.It amazes me that out of what was supposed to be a time of love & peace that cold blooded murder such as this could erupt. That minds of (almost) children could be altered by one man. Manson knew what personality traits to look for in the people he chose to join the 'Family'. Thanks goodness that at least one had the courage to ensure that he and his followers may never walk the streets again."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"as a young child growing up in the 70s one of my memories of it is the helter skelter paperback my mother use to read over and over and i always wondered what in the world this book was about, i use to look at the pictures and they never failed to scare me,a man with long scraggly hair and piercing eyes,guns,dead people etc,as i grew up and was exposed to the manson case and put two and two together i made miself a promise i was gonna read this book at some point in my life,i finally got around to it and realized why my mom liked it so much, bugliosi doesnt fail to deliver and the book is written in plain language, no fanciness here, no shakespeare stuff, straight english and to the point,if you ever find yourself feeling pitty for tex or charlie or pat etc just read this book and you will be assured why these people are still where they have been for the last 41 years, buy this book, you will really like it, unlike the paperback of my youth i had to get the hardback edition,dont like paperbacks,a little more pricey for me but looks a lot better on my bookcase,hope this review helps."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Definitely one of the best true crime books I've ever read. Certainly compelling and page turning. Its a chilling portrait of murder, obsession, violence, and the myth that is Charles Manson. There were times I just couldn't put the book down. Even though it's over 600 pages long I zoomed though it. A must read for any fan of true crimes books."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter starts out with a page that simply says \\"The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you.\\" That is an extremely accurate statement. No if's, and's or but's about it. This book is terrifying!While I was born a couple of decades after Manson and his \\"Family\\" committed these murders, I still had a general idea of what exactly took place at the crime scenes and the havoc that Manson and co. wreaked (plus my interest in criminology had me seeking out tons of cases that were featured on the TruTV website a few years ago and this one was the most prominently displayed). While Manson and/or his followers are very rarely in the news nowadays (unless one of them is up for parole), the crimes committed were so horrific that they are still brought up today (mainly in procedural shows i.e. Criminal Minds, Law & Order, etc.).Reading Helter Skelter, there was one thing that was stuck in my mind and that was the ages of most of Manson's followers. We're talking about young people from ages 16 to about 28. Now I'm 21 and I can't even fathom how a human being can commit an atrocious crime like this. Let alone when they are so young and have their whole lives ahead of them, yet let themselves be brainwashed by Charles Manson and his skewed perception of love. It's truly a shame and if not for them, then certainly for all the victims and their families.Helter Skelter is definitely not a book for the faint of heart. It's gruesome, terrible, and unflinching. It doesn't shy away from the brutality that the victims suffered at the hands of their murderers. And like the first page said, this book will scare the hell out of you. I was extremely paranoid while reading this, always double and sometimes triple checking my locks. It just shows how human beings have the potential to be incredibly evil.However, Helter Skelter is an extremely compelling read. While it didn't exactly fly by for me (but that's mostly because I had to keep putting it down to avoid jumping out of my skin too much everytime someone knocked on my door past 5:00PM), it kept me enthralled when I was reading it. While I didn't exactly enjoy it, I did find it to be a well-written read that was incredibly gripping. And while I haven't read much true crime, I can tell that Helter Skelter is true crime at its best."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Though those involved in the slaughter at the Tate & LaBianca homes are now behind bars (thank you, God), at one point the entire city of Los Angeles was in terror until the author gathered all the evidence and wrapped it up, probably saving many more senseless deaths.Some claim Helter Skelter was not the motive which the author claims, but that is irrelevant. The author explains, \\"all murders have a motive\\" and when he saw \\"Healter Skelter\\" written in blood at the LaBiancas, he settled on that for the trial. In time it is obvious that Manson was having some sort of mental breakdown as his senseless world was collapsing around him.Feeling powerless for no one wanting to record his mediocre music, he lashed out by having his brainwashed, blindly devoted followers murder for him. Sort of like a childish temper tantrum gone wild. He was also terrified of revenge by the Black Panthers for shooting a black drug dealer who was angry because Manson ripped him off (like he ripped off anybody who trusted him).I remember this misreable story back in 69-70... the women who acted like fools defending Manson in the court room & out on the street. Manson couldn't have cared less about them and they had no effect whatsoever on public opinion in favor of Manson. Anyone who defends Manson to this day should be in serious therapy. Maybe he provided some drug induced orgies where you got the clap, but in the long run what do you have? Nothing. Great Book!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Well written, great TRUE story, fascinatingly frightening. This book will chill you to the bone. It scared me worse than any other book I've ever read. It makes Blatty's \\"The Exorcist\\" seem like a Disney Book. Trust me, I do not mean to discredit Blatty because I loved his book, but \\"Helter Skelter\\" scared me to the very core."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I've enjoyed reading just about anything written by Vincent Bugliosi, and \\"Helter Skelter\\" is certainly no exception. Within these pages, Mr. Bugliosi paints an excruciatingly-detailed account of this unique and compelling murder case. You're able to almost get inside Vince's head and see up close how he successfully prosecuted this famous Hollywood case.Hollywood seemed to be a fitting backdrop for the Manson trial too, because the whole case sounds like something directly from a screenwriter's notebook instead of a real-life tragedy. I guess that's what made the case and the trial so compelling -- it sounds too freaky to be real. I mean, lyrics from a \\"Beatles\\" record album becoming a major focus at the trial??And the tremendous overkill tactics employed by the killers, as they obey their \\"master\\" with zombie-like precision. Just simply unbelievable! And yet it happened just the same.\\"Helter Skelter: The True Story Of The Manson Murders\\", originally published in 1974, is \\"the #1 best-selling true-crime book in publishing history\\" (per the blurb printed on the cover of the 528-page\\"25th Anniversary Edition\\"of the book that I own, which came out in 1994 via W.W. Norton & Co., Inc.).That '94 \\"Anniversary\\" edition is highly recommended by this reviewer due to its original 1974 content plus the inclusion of a new 26-page \\"Afterword\\" by author Vince Bugliosi, which was written in June 1994.\\"Helter Skelter\\" tells the fascinatingly-bizarre tale of how a crazy man by the name of Charles Milles Manson ordered several of his seemingly-brainwashed followers (aka \\"The Family\\") to arm themselves with knives, ropes, and a gun and break into two Los Angeles-area homes on two consecutive nights in early August of 1969.Manson's additional orders to his robot-like \\"family\\" members were to \\"kill everyone\\" who happened to be in those two houses. It didn't make any difference who they were or how many were there -- everyone in those two homes was to die, simply because Charles Manson wanted them to die.At the end of those two senseless evenings of murder and mayhem, seven innocent people (who had never even met Charles Milles Manson) were brutally slaughtered. The seven vicious killings, known collectively thereafter as the \\"Tate-LaBianca Murders\\" or \\"The Manson Murders\\", sent Hollywood into a panic for many weeks afterward.Three months after the killings, 35-year-old Los Angeles Deputy District AttorneyVincent T. Bugliosiwas assigned as the lead prosecutor for the State of California in the case against Manson and three of his \\"family\\" members (Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Van Houten).Charlie Manson, himself, initially wanted to serve as his own attorney at his murder trial. Manson finally relented, however, and hired Irving Kanarek as his main attorney. Per Vince Bugliosi's comments in this book, Kanarek could easily have been identified by another name -- \\"Mr. Obfuscation\\" -- due to his continual frivolous objections and delay tactics utilized in the courtroom.Kanarek, as pointed out in this volume, is a lawyer who once took 1.5 years on jury selection and pre-trial motions during a case where he ended up being fired by his client before the first witness was even called to the stand.I took note of a laugh-out-loud passage placed in the book by Mr. Bugliosi regarding Mr. Kanarek -- \\"Kanarek once objected to a prosecution witness's stating his own name because, having first heard his name from his mother, it was 'hearsay'.\\" &lt;LOL>Mr. Bugliosi, even within the grim subject matter that the reader encounters in a book like \\"Helter Skelter\\", which revolves around seven grisly murders, has the ability to interject a little bit of humor into his publications as well -- with the above Kanarek example probably being the best such instance of humor that I found in this book.Turning an about-face now from that humorous anecdote mentioned above to the more serious nature of \\"Helter Skelter\\" --- As a result of Charles Manson's warped mind, these seven people died in August 1969 in California:1.) Sharon Tate-Polanski (age 26). .... Sharon was eight-months pregnant when she was stabbed 16 times in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969. It's always been my personal belief that Sharon's killers should have been charged with eight total murders, instead of just seven....with #8 being the murder of the soon-to-be-born baby inside the womb of Mrs. Polanski.2.) Abigail Folger (age 25). .... \\"Gibby\\", as she was affectionately known, was stabbed 28 times.3.) Voytek Frykowski (age 32). .... Mr. Frykowski suffered the most wounds at the hands of Manson's relentless inhuman killing machines -- being stabbed a total of 51 times, shot twice, and repeatedly beaten over the head 13 times with a blunt object. The savagery of it is still mind-boggling today.4.) Jay Sebring (age 35). .... Jay was shot once with Manson's very own \\"Buntline\\" revolver and received seven knife wounds.5.) Steven Parent (age 18). .... Steven was the first to die at 10050 Cielo Drive in Hollywood's Benedict Canyon. The teenager was shot four times in his car as he was trying to leave the Tate property.6.) Leno LaBianca (age 44). .... After Charlie Manson had personally tied up Mr. and Mrs. LaBianca with rope inside their home at 3301 Waverly Drive in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, Manson sent his murderous monsters into the LaBianca house to kill them both. Leno was stabbed 12 times with a knife and was stabbed another 7 times with a fork. A knife was found lodged in Mr. LaBianca's throat, and the word \\"war\\" had been physically carved into Leno's stomach by his bloodthirsty murderers, while the double-tined fork used to create that word in the flesh of the victim was left protruding from Mr. LaBianca's abdomen following the grisly act.7.) Rosemary LaBianca (age 38). .... Mrs. LaBianca was stabbed with a knife a total of 41 separate times. Both of the LaBiancas were found with pillowcases over their heads.----------------------RELATED \\"MANSON\\" TOPICS:Mr. Bugliosi's best-selling book \\"Helter Skelter\\" has also been made into two television movies, produced in 1976 and 2004 (both of which have been made available on DVD; links below).I highly recommend each of those film adaptions of \\"Skelter\\" too, with the original1976 movie(starring George DiCenzo as Vincent Bugliosi and Steve Railsback as Charles Manson) being my favorite of the two versions.Unlike the first film, the2004 remakeconcentrates less on the actual court trial, spending more time on the activities of Manson and \\"Family\\" in the weeks and months leading up to the morbid events of August '69.Both versions are worthy additions to the DVD-Video library, in my opinion. Mr. Bugliosi himself is credited as one of the three \\"Executive Producers\\" of the 2004 movie.----------------------I often wonder what would have happened if Charlie Manson and Family had heard the words \\"Not Guilty\\" when the verdict was announced in Los Angeles on January 25, 1971. Thankfully, though, they did not hear those two words spoken by the court clerk that day, due in great part to Mr. Bugliosi's fine work in piecing together the potential (albeit crazy-sounding) motive for the Tate-LaBianca murders.But if Manson and his faithful gang of unfeeling killers had walked out of court free and clear, I wonder if other innocent people might have ended up like Sharon and Jay and Voytek, et al. It's a chilling thought....to be sure.I'm just glad Mr. Bugliosi was ultimately successful in his prosecutorial efforts, and got the killers off the streets and behind bars where each of them belongs.Anyone who reads the disturbing and chilling first chapter of \\"Helter Skelter\\" will no doubt want to keep turning these pages till the end.David Von PeinJanuary 2006March 2008"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter was the absolute best true crime book I have ever read. From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the \\"family\\". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book intrigued me from the first moment I started reading. I had never heard of Charles Manson or his murders before reading this book and immediately fell in love with the whole story behind it. Vincent Bugliosi presents the book honestly with clear facts. He doesn't shy away from uncomfortable topics and gives us the truth. I've read this book twice and would read it again anytime. I think this book would be of interest to anyone no matter what their usual, preferred reading is."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I was only a toddler when this happened but now have read and re-read this book a few times and always find it VERY interesting and hard to put down. How they put all this together I find, just fascinating. Although they had a few &quot;squealers&quot; that gave them some breaks but they also had to work very hard to convince a jury of their guilt.I have watched interviews on TV of Leslie VanHouten and Patricia Krenwinkel and even though they seem re-habilitated as long as there are Tate family members alive, I don't think they will ever be let out. And then there's Charlie, what a nutcase!!How one man, (with the help of drugs) could have brain-washed so many people to do whatever he said is mind-boggling.You won't be sorry you read this book, even though at times it will scare you half to death. It is very well written and extremely interesting."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Little wonder that \\"Helter Skelter\\" is the top-selling true-crime book in publishing history. Here, more than 30 years after the decade of free love was essentially drowned in a literal pool of blood, the sense of horror then is resurrected in stark reality. The author, who also prosecuted the case, gives us not only a graphic description of the overkill of the Manson Family's victims but also lays out the legal complexities that threatened a successful prosecution. Of the former, the sheer brutality of Manson's henchmen, namely \\"Tex\\" Watson and Susan Atkins, is simply numbing while, of the latter, the legal issues educate us that the case then wasn't as open-and-shut that we perhaps have come to assume. The reason for the slaughter of the Tate-LaBianca victims is detailed, but whether evil or insanity fueled that reason is best left to the reader. Whichever, Charles Manson, or as he empowered himself as \\"Man's Son\\" to his susceptible clan, emerges not only as a vicious murdered but a master manipulator of other people's human failings. That there will always likely be those who pervert those failings to their own ends makes this book an important study in both human behavior and legal scholarship. Beyond that, the unmitigated brutality, i.e. overkill, of Manson's victims is paralyzing."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I LOVE true crime novels, and TV, and movies.The high point for novels, artistically, is probably, \\"In Cold Blood\\" by Truman Capote. \\"Helter Skelter\\" is not the same type of novel artistically, but the facts and the trial are hair-raising and jaw-dropping in a way that \\"In Cold Blood\\" is not.\\"Helter Skelter\\" blows back your hair and drops your jaw. The defendant attacked the Judge: literally attacked the judge mid-trial. Witnesses had suspicious accidents. A lawyer died.The Manson Family was a crazy cult, that's for sure. What blows my mind is how poorly equipped the justice system was to deal with this cult. I don't think it was their fault; they learned from this horrible horrible trial.It seems that \\"criminal harassment\\" did not exist at the time, and it didn't. That was the problem, in my opinion. It wasn't the fault of the justice system, and they learned from this. But the account of this trial is still disturbing, b/c of the people cowed and scared to get involved and to do justice.Things have improved so much since the Manson trial. It is fascinating to learn about how that trial happened, though.There were many brave people who were focused on the victims and who marched along, all the while feeling the sharp threat of personal harm.Anyone who is interested in true crime should read this book - it will surprise you."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"All of the good things said about \\"Helter Skelter\\" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have always been a true crime novel fan. I have devoured Ann Rule and Joe McGinniss. I am not alone. Over the holidays I had a conversation with another fellow true crime fan. She asked if I had ever read Vincent Bugliosi's novel, Helter Skelter, the true story of the Manson Family murders. I hadn't. Truth is, I had kind of been afraid to read it. When the murders took place I was only a toddler. I do however, remember the TV mini-series \\"Helter Skelter\\", based on the book and feeling, well, freaked out. I've had the book Helter Skelter on the back-burner of my brain for years to read. Well, I finally took the plunge.The book Helter Skelter embodies my two favorite reasons for reading true crime. Number one, I love to learn the psychology of the murders - why the murderers may have done what they did. Number two, I love to read how the prosecutors and detectives used their knowledge, experience, and hard work to solve the crimes and prosecute the criminals. For those unfamiliar to the case, and really, how could you be, The Manson Family headed by Charles Manson, went on a killing rampage in Los Angeles in August 1969 brutally murdering seven people. Vincent Bugliosi, the author of the book, was the prosecutor at the trial and investigator on the case. It was the most horrifying murder spree in US history and the longest, most grueling trial the country had seen to date. Some say the murders put an abrupt end to the 60's spirit of free love and ushered in a new more sated era.The book itself is a great read. It is well-written and tells the story of what occurred, how the case was solved, and how the case was successfully prosecuted. In addition, the writer provides the back story as well as reporting on the pulse of the country as the trial proceeded. It is a real glimpse in to the history of the country. I learned that my original perceptions of the case were not accurate. The book accomplishes the herculean task of sorting through hundreds of witnesses, several police department's participation, and reams of testimony while at the same time managing to keep readers interested and informed as the investigation and case unfolds in chronological order.I am particularly fond of the author, Bugliosi. He sounds like a brilliant guy who worked his tail off. His constant reference to the hours of preparation on both the investigation and each stage of the trial is inspiring. He mentions more than once the \\"100 pages of notes on yellow pads\\" reminding me in the words of James Michener, \\"It is not just talent alone, but disciplined talent that makes for success.\\" Taking the time to be prepared is half the battle, isn't it?Although Helter Skelter was first written in 1974, more than 35 years ago, it is still very relevant. Why? As Vincent Bugliosi himself says in the book and I am paraphrasing here,\\" The reasons behind the murders are so important to uncover because we do not want such a thing to happen again.\\" That's true of all history, isn't it? Check out the book if you have the chance. It will teach you something, I promise you."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is absolutely riveting! It seems that only a couple of books a year can hold my attention like this one - which is a shame. I always have a sense of loss after reading a great book. The whole Manson paradigm is so bizarre and twisted that it just blows your mind. I read this book over a long rainy weekend and could not put it down. If you like fascinating stories where reality is stranger than fiction, this is THE book you should read. Top notch!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I suggested to my 14-year old son, who wanted to read a non-fiction crime/courtroom book that he try \\"Helter Skelter\\" by Vincent Bugliosi. He not only read the entire 400 page book, he was mesmerized and wrote the following review for his fellow teenagers:From Douglas:\\"Helter Skelter\\" by Vincent Bugliosi is about a madman, a cult, gruesome murders, and a spellbinding criminal trial. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in true crime or suspence thrillers. This book is about a man named Charles Manson and a string of muders he and people he called his \\"family\\" committed. I am recommending this book to all teenagers who have never herd the name, Manson. I am also recommending this book for adults, for it is a hair-raising and gruesome experience that will leave you begging for more.The book is written by Vincent Bugliosi, who was the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who prosecuted Charles Manson and his followers. He documents , in the book, how he became totally consumed by this extraordinary case. He writes about how Manson actually \\"played mind games\\" with him during the trial. Although these murders took place almost forty years ago, I believe that it is important for us to know about this case because Manson and his followers are still in prison and still come up for parole. It is also important for us to see how one man managed to control the minds and actions of so many, so that maybe we can prevent it from happening again.This bokk is written in a very readable style; you won't be able to put it down. I highly recommend it to all teenagers, who enjoy crime stories - fiction or non-fiction. It's hard to believe it really happened!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Charles Manson along with Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houton, and Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson, gives us an insider's look into the Tate-LaBianca murders of 1969. Described by Manson himself as a &quot;judicial genius&quot;, Bugliosi personally (and tirelessly) gathered most of the evidence himself. He takes us through the murders, the manhunt, the capture, his struggle to build his case, and finally the trial. A very frightening read, when one considers the savagery of the murders along with Manson's dangerous (and powerful) personality. Also sad, not just because how you come to feel for the victims, but also because the flowerful 1960's ended this way. Sixty-four pages of photos and a 1994 update, which clears up some unanswered questions as well as detailing the post conviction lives of the killers, all of whom are still incarcerated save for Steve Grogan, who was convicted of a different murder. A must for any true crime buff, and you probably won't make it past the first chapter without checking to see if your doors are locked."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter goes into great detail of how graphic and horrific the Tate/LaBianca murders were. Bugliosi does an excellent job describing the crime scene and recalling how the murders occured. The Trial portion of the book is incredible. Bugliosi does a superb job on piecing together an airtight case for the prosecution. Bugliosi made a great sacrifice of his personal life while putting in time working on this case. Helter Skelter really helps explain how Manson created his &quot;Family&quot; and how he brainwashed his followers into believing his deranged philosophies. The only thing more riviting than this book is idea that their are still people who believe in Manson's teachings."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I recently saw members of the Manson &quot;family&quot; interviewed on television, and I have no doubt that the remorse displayed by Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel is real, and that they now see the reality of what Manson was and still is, but I also have no doubt that they owe society a great debt, and must stay in prison for the rest of their lives.But Manson? Manson is a different story. I don't get scared easily, but because he remains so paranoid and because of his virulent psychopathology, he is a truly frightening individual, and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is the best assessment of his life, psyche, and crimes ever written.&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; is a blow by blow account of the gruesome Tate/LaBianca murders written by the man who, as the prosecuting district attorney, had the disturbing job of being forced to immerse himself in this grisly case for over two years in order to convict the killers. As a result, no one knew, and indeed still knows, the intimate details of this story better than Vincent Bugliosi, and that is why there was no one better qualified to write this book. It is a compelling story which is almost too horrific to be true, but the blood, gore, and savagely mutilated corpses testify to the harrowing sadness of the reality that these crimes really did occur. Indeed, no horror movie could be as frightening, as gory,or as disturbing as the Manson murders, and this book paints a compelling and graphic portrait as to why the perpetrators of these crimes should never be paroled from prison."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have a love/hate relationship with this novel: it remains the one work that has frightened and disturbed me more than any other novel, and it is the reason I stopped reading true crime accounts! I find that I can handle even the most bizarre horror novel over the true evils that human beings actually commit.I think we will always have a fascination with the Manson Family and their acts. The Tate/LaBianca murders remain some of the most bizarre and violent acts this country has ever seen. Bugliosi paints a realistic portrait of Manson's childhood, his gathering of his &quot;family&quot; and of the final murders themselves. It is chilling, it is disturbing. I will forever carry the image of Manson and his followers &quot;creepy crawling&quot; through people's houses (I slept quite restlessly for weeks after reading this). Bugliosi does not romanticize these people. Manson and his followers are presented as the disturbed, disillusioned people that they were/are. If you like true crime, if you are at all interested in Manson, and if you have nerves of steel, I recommend this one as one of the best true-crime accounts ever written."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book was a fast and intense page turner. It was scary and interesting since watching and reading the case in the news. The book was well written by the prosecutor. I recommend this as a read because it was one of the crimes of the century."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Having lived in the L.A. area when this happened, I remember it well. This is by far the best book on the subject."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"As they say this is the best book on the subject. The writing and layout flow smooth and easy.In the first group of photos there is a mugshot of Manson 6-29-66, Terminal Island. He looks, I kid you not, dead on Charlie Sheen! They should get Sheen instead of baby face Ryan Kwanten to play Manson in this new movie. Ryan Kwanten doesn't look anything at all like Charles Manson.QuestionsWhy isn't the unborn child of Sharon Tate listed as a victim? She was 8 months pregnant!Why is it that when the death penalty was abolished in '72 it was made retroactive (everyone on death row got off with life instead of death), yet when re-enacted in '77 it wasn't retroactive?Seems to me that if you were convicted/sentenced while the death penalty was the law you should be kept to the contract of the law at that time. Especially in the cases of the Manson family. Letting that baby die in Sharon Tate's womb .....If Manson and his \\"family\\" were so PRO-children as Bugliosi says they were, how could they have left that child to die? You think they would have taken it to raise as their own. Taken it as a souvenir.Where were all the righteous vigilantes and our tough-on-crime justice system when you needed them? \\"Family\\" members continued to kill and commit violent crimes many years afterwards and were alway given light ,IF ANY, sentences. Why?One Los Angeles district attorney a William Melcher and his wife were so sympathetic that he cleared \\"Squeeky\\" of an armed robbery charge saying that doing so was \\"my greatest satisfaction in three years as a prosecutor.\\" Unbelievable! Shocking!I'm surprised Polansky did nothing except put up a $25000 reward.Charles said:\\"I've had girls come to visit me with their babies in their arms and say, 'Charlie, I'd do anything in the world for you. I'm raising my baby in your image.' Those letters and visits used to delight me, but that's just my individual sickness. What sickness is it that keeps sending me kids and followers? It's your world out there that does it. I don't solicit my mail or ask anyone to come and visit me. Yet the mail continues to arrive and your pretty little flowers of innocence keep showing up at the gate.''WOW! One of his lucid moments."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I can't really add anything more to some of the other five star reviews here on Amazon for Mr. Bugliosi's incredible work. Don't buy these right wing racist revisionists who want to paint Charles Manson as a \\"wrongly accused eco-terrorist\\". Manson and and his family did nothing discernible for the planet (apart from make it an uglier and more morally decrepit place) when he was on the outside his priorities where militia style white nationalism and serious crime. Most of Helter Skelter is trial testimony and actual confessions and recorded conversations with witnesses, victim's families and Manson family members so any question of \\"veracity\\" is easily squelched. This was a nasty, very racist and very hateful group of people who finally found a purpose together which was to parlay the hippie counter culture into an excuse to kill randomly. It did not mater that apart from Abagail Folger, a committed civil rights and anti-poverty worker who had an inheritance, most of those at the Tate house were not very wealthy or even rich, its just that they were there to be slaughtered. They became Manson's reflection of his unparalleled hatred for society. The most intense part of the book is definitely the last few chapters which tell of the many unsolved murders which are clearly the work of The Manson family, left to kill after the first group of butchers were incarcerated and where all the killers and family members are today. Its frightening to think of how easily these people killed-like barbarians. The last remnants now preach Manson's ATWA (Air Trees Animals Air) philosophy of saving the planet and he has countless fans and friends globally who support and indulge, his lively crazed personality as he continues his incarceration. Many of whom are just interested in the case and think he should get a retrial as they feel he had zero to do with the murders.Many simply admire him. Bugliosi explains why he is still a charismatic showman to so many and why many bigwigs in the media to this day seek him out-perhaps the most frightening part of the book is that fact in and of itself. I even begrudgingly admit that Manson is entertaining. This book is not to be read late at night!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is an excellent read regardless of your background, or knowledge of the Manson case. Whether you enjoy true crime or not, you will enjoy this book. Very well written, very informative, and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"A close friend of mine was reading Helter Skelter about a year and a half ago, and up until then I honestly had never even HEARD of Charles Manson. One night, my friend read to me a couple pages of while Manson and Bugliosi were in court, and he read to me some things that manson had said. It was all really intriguing so a few months back I happened to see Helter Skelter in chapters, and on a whim I picked it up. I could NOT put it down. I have never read a true crime book, or anything even close to a book like that...and it was amazing. Amazing in a very scary, messed up way. I recommend this to anyone who is a little intrigued as to who Charles Manson was and what views he had. It was a really good book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Excellent Book! I literally had to tear myself away from this book at the end of each day.A terrifying, frightening look into the &quot;Manson Family&quot; and the murders that they committed. Truly a wonderful work of art.Too often true crime books focus soley on the killer and spend little or no time talking about the victims. I believe that Bugliosi and Gentry didn't forget the victims in this story, and portrayed them as they really were. The good and the bad.Definitely worth it to pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is a fascinating account of the Manson case from the eyes of prosecution attorney Vincent Bugliosi. Well paced, haunting, somewhat grissly, but suprisingly quite funny in places- (the defense attorney made over two hunderd objections on the first three days of the trial!). A real pager turner probably best read in the daytime so it won't give you nightmares. One quible though I feel the author has grossly misinterpreted the philiosophy of Friedrich Nietzche by affilating his philiosophy with the spread of Nazism. Yes Hitler (who shared with Manson many characteristic's; they were both loved animals more than humans, each a vegetarian, and had spent time as an \\"outsider\\" living on the fringes of society) had read his work. Yet those documents he read were greatly adulterated under the cursed hand of the authors sister, who, after the philosophers death re wrote his manuscripts to fit Nazi ideals in the hope of courting parties leader..."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"As a fan of the true crime genre, I would rate this in the top 5 easily. Bugliosi is not just a good lawyer, he's an excellent writer. To this day, if I see an article he's written on current topics, for example O.J., George W. Bush's election, I go out of my way to read it. They always rock. Even if you don't agree with him, he makes his points clearly, and with depth. Helter Skelter is the last word on Manson. Bugliosi is a very on the ball observer. He has a good feel for the underworld Manson lived in, and the California of the time. This book hasn't dated a bit."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"THIS AN AMAZING BOOK, I WAS VERY SPELLBOUND WHEN I READ THIS. ICANT BELIVE HOW ONE PERSON COULD BE SO SICK IN THE HEAD AND ALL THEKIDS HE HAS HAD IT IS GROSS. I HAVE DONE SO MUCH RESURCH ON MANSON FOR A CLASS PROJECT THAT I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN HE DOES.

The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book.

This one has it all,from the Beatles,to the the most beutifull women of all time,Sharon Tate. Vincent Bugliosi gives you a inside look into the murder of Sharon,her unborn baby,and all of the unlucky house guest that terrible August night.This could have been the murder of Candace Bergman and her boyfriend,Doris Days son,Terry ,but they moved out months before. We also get to read about the Beatles music from the &quot;White Album.&quot; Charles Manson thought they were telling him to get ready for the African American's taking over The country. The songs,&quot;Helter Skelter,Sadie,BlackBird,&quot; and alot of the other Beatles records are mention.The Beatles were even questioned about there music. Even Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys has his house taken over by the Manson Gang. The person I fill sorry for the most was the young man who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time,Steven.Nothing has ever been written about him,or his family. One of the greatest women,Sharon Tates Mom,Delores Tate,has fought for years untill her death to make sure none of these murders ever get out of prison. Sharon Tates Sister has taken over her quest.This is a long book,but even if you hate to read,you can't put this one down."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is known world around.That info should be inaf for you to buy it.Manson family would not be fameus as it is if it was not for this book.It tells you everything that hapend from the kilings to the trail.It's 700 pages long and you kind of wish it was longer.Thats how good this book is"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' is an examination of Charles Manson and his cult and the bizzare trial that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about. There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson. It is surprising that he was able to hold the power over those people like he did."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is a Beatles song. The Beatles are very powerful lyrically and musically, therefore starting these horrific crimes. The Beatles are powerful"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"A very detailed and well-written book. One can't help getting edgy and scared after reading it. How could such things take place in free,democratic U.S.A. ? I am inclied to see that the U.S. had very serious social problems in the 1960's especially with young people. Of course the birth control pill, the Negro revolution and the war in Vietnam all played significant roles. It is time to see if such social problems still exist. If so, more shocking and grisly things are still to come."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is a book about Charles Manson and the Manson murders. It was written by the DA who prosecuted Manson. There is a lot of interesting information in this book regarding the crimes and the weird court events that followed.But as a book review, I'll have to say that the book was so-so. Some people's reviews are a little over the edge (i.e., are too caught up in how they \\"feel\\" about the whole ordeal).Bottom line: Interesting piece of history done moderately well."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi makes no apology for wanting the Manson women to remain in prison for the rest of their lives. But I have seen that these women who were young once, made the mistake of following a madman.While they will probably remain in prison in California, they have done everything to reform their lives and have cut themselves from Charlie Manson's ways. The man, Charlie Manson, is an animal and there is no doubt about that. He doesn't know anything other than to live in a prison.It's sad but I feel that his women suffered along with the murdered victims and I know that people are going to criticize me for it and even hate me for siding with the Manson women. Luckily, they are still alive rather than executed like originally.Manson stole their minds and ruined their lives. I know 36 years is a long time in prison but I see that they have changed behind prison walls and have become role models for younger prisoners. There is no excuse for their crimes, they admit it, confess to it, and apologize for their crime.But you wonder why other criminals get less for the same crimes. I am sure that forgiveness, compassion and understanding is possible but I worry about if they are released and the vigilante justice."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Covers the story of Charles Manson, including the trial, in a magnificent way. Bugliosi held my interest and the actions of humans on humans is unbelievable."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Read the book many years ago, but wanted to read a crime story that wasn't bogged down with DNA evidence - just a reminder of how things 'used' to be. The book is very detailed on the people involved, the evidence, the trials and the aftermath. If you aren't familiar with the people in this case, you won't find the pictures that were in the hardback/softback version of the book. (Have found this missing in another crime novel as well.)I like putting faces to names, and, even though this was a rather famous case, memories fade and people get older - in this case - a lot older.The former librarian in our city had a brother who was a guard at one of the prisons Charles Manson was in. He told her that all criminals have their good side and bad side - like everyone else. Every criminal, that is, but Charles Manson. He said that evil oozed from his very pores.If you're looking for something light and airy, or something with a wonderfully happy ending, this is not the book you want to read. However, if you want an indepth true story crime story, this is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This account is not quite as engrossing as some of Bugliosi's other books, such as \\"And the Sea Will Tell.\\" It still rates five stars, but it takes a little more effort to get through, in part because there are so many names a reader has to keep straight. There were so many victims, perpetrators, witnesses, and investigators. Bugliosi does provide a Name Key at the front of the book, giving thumbnail sketches of the \\"cast of characters.\\" It's helpful to refer to this Key often.The other reason this book isn't quite as informative as Bugliosi's other true crime accounts is that he doesn't provide as many legal insights as he did in his other works. There is a lot of insider information about the legal maneuvering involved in bringing Manson and three female co-defendents to trial. But Bugliosi doesn't delve sufficiently into such points as why Manson was deemed to be the most guilty of all the perpetrators, even though Manson himself didn't personally commit any of the Tate/LaBianca murders.It's not that Manson shouldn't have been held ultimately responsible. But I'd like to have read more about the legal theory backing such an assignment of guilt. Bugliosi does devote a few paragraphs to the topic, mentioning the care he took as prosecutor to emphasize the rules of conspiracy to the jurors. He didn't want any juror holding out to exonerate Manson just because Manson didn't physically stab or shoot any of the victims. However, I'd like to have read an in-depth discussion of this point because it touches on so much of the high crimes that have characterized the last 100 hundred years - from the crimes adjudicated at the Nuremberg Trials to several of the more sensational matricides and patricides committed by teens recently. In several of the latter cases, the juvenile partner who did the actual killing was deemed to be much more responsible than the instigating youngster who merely provided access to the house and who stood by while the slaughter occurred. In view of the conspiracy rules applied in the Manson case, why would this be so?This book nonetheless provides a valuable demonstration of the often tragic consequences of carelessness. The blurb on the back cover cites the \\"meticulous detective work\\" involved. This would lead you to believe that members of the various police departments really exerted themselves gathering evidence. However, that's not true. The detective work referred to is probably that done by Bugliosi himself and his staff. Bugliosi stepped outside his role as prosecutor to become chief homicide investigator as well - a real Perry Mason generalist. He showed exemplary determination in his efforts to leave no stone unturned - literally - in order to locate evidence and testimony.Meanwhile, many members of the different police and sheriffs' offices were notable for their failure to follow through with leads, and for their failure to communicate with each other. Inter-departmental competition and just plain indifference was often to blame. It becomes apparent that if various individuals, from Manson's parole officers, to a whole hierarchy of officers and investigators had earnestly and intelligently done their jobs, at least some of the murders could have been averted.So this book provides a lesson in how things in law enforcement could be improved, but probably haven't been since this book was first published in 1974.Bugliosi goes beyond exploring \\"just the facts, ma'am.\\" He devotes pages to an explanation of Manson's motivating philosophy, a roiling stew of such disparate ingredients as songs from The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" and quotes from the Book of Revelation. Bugliosi further spends the better part of a chapter examining how Manson could have gained such a devoted following. He covers some of the elements that make any successful cult leader, but then is left with some X-factor that he believed Manson must have possessed in order to have had such influence. Sometimes the reader might feel that Bugliosi goes too far in admiration of Manson, characterizing him as having such qualities as \\"Intelligence...searing insights... mental deftness.\\"There are also several extensive sections of photographs (albeit rather grainy ones) reproduced here. Some have key elements whitened out to avoid personalizing the gore too much.Finally, there's an \\"Afterward\\" in this edition that updates (as of 1994) readers on the lives of both the guilty and the innocent involved in this shocking saga."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I've read this book twice, once in the late 1970's, and again recently after having gotten interested in this disturbing incident once again. Without question it is the best insight into the mind of Charles Manson, his followers and their ideology, as would be expected from the man (Vincent Bugliosi) who is largely responsible for putting them behind bars.Scanning some of the 1-star reviews, I'm reminded why 1-star reviews cannot always be relied on for accurate review, with some making ludicrous assertions about the case including the accusation that Bugliosi \\"made up\\" the Helter Skelter motive and making his interviews with Manson Family members reflect the results he was looking for.One read through this book puts that nonsense to rest. Bugliosi is not only a talented writer but his brilliance as a prosecutor may be unrivaled by any of his contemporaries. Throughout the trial he demonstrated over and again his ability to adapt to the efforts of this murderous cult to lie and deceit their way out of being held accountable, anticipating arguments of the defense attorneys and devoting no small part of his life to seeing these cut throat killers were put away for good.Through the writing you get a complete impression of the madness that is Charles Manson, and understand more fully how he was able to manipulate and control the disgruntled youth he reprogrammed to do his bidding. Manson was the product of an era in American history that was unique; a tipping point between a relatively polite and orderly society to one more dominated by political chaos that evolved as a result of youthful rebellion, drugs, and competing political interests that were unique to the era of the late 60's.If you have ever held a passing interest in the morbidity of the Manson murders and have not read this book yet, be forewarned...it is not only chilling and disturbing in its comprehensive outline of this killer cult, but you will find it extremely difficult to put down until you have read through to the end."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter may not have been the first True Crime book, but it defined the modern definition of what the genre should be. Anyone who likes True Crime owes a debt of gratitude to Vincent Bugliosi for establishing such a strong precedent. A detailed and enthralling account of the Tate-Labianca murders, the investigation and the trial. Bugliosi was there and makes the reader feel like they were. Don't let the amount of pages scare you, there is never a dull moment. A classic, cover to cover."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"one of the best true crime books i have ever read. wow. this is just spectacular. very detailed, very interesting yet also a bit scary. it is incredibly well written, makes you feel like you're a part of the investigation. couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I didn't buy this for myself but as a gift for my girlfriend that showed interest in it.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have a morbid curiosity with death, especially violent death, so I try to read as many books about murder and such very often. This book is the BEST I have ever read in the true crime genre!!! It's very organized, factual, and (above all) interesting. There is a large portion of this dedicated to the trial portion of this story, but since it was written by the prosecutor in this case, I should've expected that. Buy it. It's great!!!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is certainly not a Pulitzer prize winner, but it is definitely a must read for any true-crime fans. I found myself unable to put the book down for hours. Bugliosi carefully unwinds the horrific details that surround these infamous murders. This book is much more than a gruesome exploitive account. I found myself understanding the late sixties as the tumultuous period that could host this episode in history."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first read this book a number of years ago and have re-read it several times since. It is a superb account of the Manson Family and their crimes, written by Vincent Bugliosi in the brief period before all his books became &quot;I love me&quot; tales of his legal brilliance. There is no doubt that Mr. Bugliosi is indeed a superb legal mind as well as a brilliant author, and this book was written before he let the knowledge of this deter from his talent."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I couldn't put this one down! I thought I wasn't a true-crime reader, but Bugliosi's book was so enthralling. It's a real-life horror story and I was amazed at the amount of depth with which he recounted the history."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have always had a great interest in Charles Manson, his family, and the murders. i knew only a little bit about them after watching the movie but after I read the book, I completely understood everything. I could not put the book down for even a second and I not only wanted to congragulate you on such a GREAT book, I wanted to also say that you must be a great lawywer to have gotten a conviction of death on all of these people. Too bad the supreme court thought the death penalty was cruel and unjust punishment. I think what Charles Mansons' family did was VERY cruel punishment to people he did not even know. He wanted to ignite Helter Skelter when all he really did was scare the crap out of the WHOLE state of California. Job well done on a great book"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Thorough account of the trial of Charles Manson, convicted along with several members of his &quot;family&quot; of the murders of seven Los Angeles-area residents in 1969.The book, written by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, gives insight into the building of the case as well as the direction of the trial. Much of the information was revealed for the first time in the book, first published several years after the trial.The reader will find the book gripping and well-organized, but will have to sift through a bit of Bugliosi's ego, which comes through to some degree."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Of all that has been written and quoted in the \\"cottage industry\\" that revolves around Charles Manson, this book is still the foremost authority on the Manson Murders ever written. Everything else is mere window dressing.It has been over 40 years since Manson's minions creepy crawled over Los Angeles and obeyed Manson's blood lust. Still today, people are fascinated and intrigued by the whole scenario of the Tate LaBianca murders, when even more gruesome murders have been committed in the past both before and after Helter Skelter.Bugliosi, in his updated afterwords, gives us clues why this case still fascinates. One reason is that unlike Hitler, who deliberately chose which peoples he wanted dead, Manson and his followers were looking for anyone convenient enough to kill. It could have been you. It could have been me. In comparison, Manson was and is much like the \\"Jason\\" character in the horror movies- a soulless force of undead hatred slashing at all who crossed his path, the ultimate boogieman. And today, while most of his minions recognize the horror and have repented and strive to give recompense for their previous action, Manson is still the wrinkled jailbird hateball he has always been, and still that boogieman everybody loves to fear.Long ago my old grandfather purchased this book. It upset him so that he was shaking and he told us that he could read no more of it. At the time I thought that I HAD to read it! I did and was engrossed with it and I could not put it down. It is still my favorite reading on the Manson case. It is still the top selling True Crime classic in the world. it is still unparalleled in it's ability to scare the hell out of you! Get it immediately to read or re read!\\"Once, we had a secret love,He changed his name from \\"Milles\\" to Willis!All too soon, our secret loveBecame impatient... to kill us!\\"'Tis this book that changed a psycho nobody jailbird into America's favorite Anti-Hero!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is written perfectly. It is educational and entertaining all at once. It tells of true-life accounts and the details are written so graphically you can feel the terror."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is the definitive account of the longest trial in American legal history wherein four persons: Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for the murders of Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Voytek Frykowski, Stephen Parent, Leno La Bianca and Rosemary La Bianca. The crimes, collectively known as the Tate/La Bianca murders took place in Los Angeles in August 1969. Vincent Bugliosi's work is both focussed and orderly and he scores highly in bringing a convoluted and at times incompetent enquiry to the reader in a totally believable account. Stretching to 664 pages, some might consider the work too long winded but the story certainly licks along at a good pace. The lion's share of the time is given over to a day by day, blow by blow account detailing the court proceedings. These accounts are so good that in places you can believe yourself to be in the public gallery and can feel the tension and horror as this macabre tale unfolds.The crimes, which rocked America in the late 60's and early 70's, are truly horrific. Bugliosi does not shy away from revealing the cold, callous and detached nature of each defendant; none of whom show the slightest remorse for their barbaric actions. Neither too are we sheltered from the abundant stabbings, shootings, hangings, and mutilations. There are ample official statements, legal examinations, cross-examinations and personal conversations to satisfy even the most curious. The reader's inclusion \`in the court' so to speak, might for some readers prove too much, but by a combination of thoroughness, attention to detail and style the author takes us into the bizarre world of Charles Manson.He is a \`wannabe' but unsuccessful musician, drug user and, for more than half of his life, a frequenter of numerous penitentiaries. He is the self-styled guru of \`The Family' where most of the members are young, impressionable runaways. Lost, lonely and anti-establishment they, by numerous avenues end up at Manson's door. Most are female, most claim to be in love with Manson, most claim he possesses special power or is the embodiment of Christ or Satan (terms Manson uses of himself). The late 60's mix of sex, free love and drugs are used to full effect and, more often than not, the girls are used to attract new recruits. In turn, through a dangerous cocktail of charisma, fear and violence, added to delusionary interpretations brought on by \`hidden' meaning in a number of the Beatles songs, Manson creates a dependency upon himself and his words. In short - he controls their thoughts, actions and lives. He, Manson, plays the pipe, they dance in time until they kill to order, but as Bugliosi shows they too are willing participants in this \`game'.Crucial to the prosecution's case is the motive for the murders - Helter Skelter. Bugliosi shows that through his interpretation of the Beatles lyrics, his predisposition to violence, his anti-establishment and racism, Manson attempts to kick-start a race war in America. BR>If the book has a down side it would be that the real comparisons between Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler are pretty tenuous; Bugliosi's frequent portrayal of himself in the, \`I'm always right' camp when comparing himself to his opponents in defence counsel, gets a bit irritating and the use of aliases with some of the main players in the \`Family' can get confusing at times. That said, for any true crime buffs out there who like their reading material to be a real mix of the gruesome and the legal, this book is a must.This review covers the 1974 paperback edition."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior. What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I am 21, so I was not alive when Sharon and her friends lost their lives to these terrifying crimes. But I have become a fan of her and admire her very much. Bugliosi has written a truly scary and cold stone real book. This book gets in your head and stays there. I would close my eyes and see Sharon begging for the life of her and her child. And her innocent friends, who had not done a thing wrong. Nothing could have prevented this, and nothing can erase it. Sharon, Jay, Abigail, Steve, and Voytek will always have a special place in our hearts and their memory will live on. Thank you Mr. Bugliosi for writing a nail biting thriller that I did not want to put down, but when I did, it was on my mind."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read thousands of books in my life and this one is among the top in terms of gripping and holding my attention. After I started reading it, no spare second was used for any purpose other than reading it. I read it sitting on the toilet, in the bathtub, while riding to work, surreptitiously while at work and for a couple nights fell asleep with it in my hands. It is the story of the Charles Manson \\"family\\", who they killed, why they killed and how they lived. Written by the district attorney who compiled the case against Charles Manson and his bizarre group of followers, it describes in complete detail how Manson was such a controlling figure.After I completed the book, I couldn't help but think that in another place, another time and with another set of circumstances, Charles Manson could have founded a powerful religious cult. His hold on his followers was incredible; they truly believed that he had godlike powers. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, his methods were too brutal and violent to survive long as his philosophy carried within it the seeds of its own destruction."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This was a very informative (and at times, scary) book on the Manson murders. It is written by the prosecutor of the case, Vincent Bugliosi. I had only very limited knowledge of the case so reading this book really gave me some futher insight. I am not sure how much \\"new\\" information this book may provide someone who is well versed in this case.The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is simply because it did drag at certain times but as a whole, this is a very well written book!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I knew the story of this mentally ill man.

The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This was an incredible book. I didn't know much about the Manson murders and have always been interested in true crime books. This book was so percise and descriptive at times I thought I was at the ranch or in the court room. I was never bored and could not put it down. I was amazed at the control Manson possessed over these people. It was so odd that all these broken people looking for someone to save them seemed to find Charles Manson at a time when he was looking for followers.Very scary....."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Before I read this book I didn't really have that much knowledge about the manson murders, being that I wasn't even born when they occured. This book did an excellent job of presenting everything that happened in a completely logical and coherent order to someone who hasn't had any other information, or to someone who is looking for a COMPLETELY thorough and accurate account. Mr. Bugliosi (the prosecutor) is excellent in the fact that he is confident enough to attach his own opinions to the evidence, and he builds up such a powerful credibility that we feel privileged to hear what he has to say. This book brought me to a state of utter shock, it really illustrates the wicked animal-like quality of these people, and the hardest thing to contentd with is that they can be considered human beings. It is IMPOSSIBLE to leave this book without forming a passionate opinion about the case, and it is also the type of book that you absolutely cannot put down once you start reading it. If you're the type of person who thinks that it is better &quot;not to Know&quot; than please do not read this book, because it will definetely illustrate things that most people cannot even conceive of existing in their wildest dreams, let alone cold blooded reality. What plagues me most when I think of this horrifying account is that if there was ever a crime that deserved the death sentence this would be it, and instead these vicious murderers got to live the comfortable lives they should have never had a chance to discover, and being that their sentences were converted they even have the chance to receive parole. To live amongst the citizens they once promised to kill indiscriminantly. Charles Manson AND his &quot;Family&quot; have committed the most horrible crimes since Jack the Ripper, and this book is a gripping and fascinating account of as much of it as can be told."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book was a fascinating recount of the Tate-LaBianca murder trial. This book gave an amazing insite to Manson's hippy cult, and a bit of understanding to his morbid fantasies and orders. After reading this, I saw the movie based on the book, but it didn't capture the novel's true essence. It was a can't-put-down read that fascinated me till the end."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Chief Prosecutor Vince Bugliosi and Curt Gentry have done a remarkable job on this, the most famous true crime novel of all time. The first page states &quot;The story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you....&quot; And so it does in page after page of a very hard to put down book. I've read this four or five times since it was first published in 1974. Every time I've learned more.Whether or not you agree that the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; philosophy was the only motive for the dreadful Sharon Tate Murders'you can see where Manson preached it to his young followers to make some kind of sense of what he asked them to do.*CBS television is now at work on a new re-made miniseries of this 29 year old famous crime novel. It has promised that this version will concentrate more on how Charlie became the person he is and how he was able to brain wash these problemed young adults with his madness!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I liked Helter Skelter, a very interesting book written byVincent Bugliosi. The book is about Charles Manson and the otherkillers and victims of the Tate-LaBianca murders. The bookHelter Skelter also talks a lot about what happened throughoutCharles Manson's life. As I read, I wondered if the killingswere going to stop and if he was going to get caught. This bookcomes with a 64 page photographic record of the victims, thekillers, and the evidence.This book is for anyone who wants to learn why or how CharlesManson became what he was. I would recommend this book to anyonewho likes reading mystery books and anyone who likes to learnabout the lives and minds of killers."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry read. I was very pleasantly surprised at, not only how well-written, but how witty this book truly is! I even laughed out loud at some of Bugliosi's comments, which is astonishing considering the murderous content of the book.It really speaks for itself that after three decades, this book is still a literary staple!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read this book twice. I actually have the 1978 1st edition of the book, so I need to get the new updated one. But all is the same anyway, same contents, just with a new afterward by Vincent from what I see in the discription here...P>Vincent Bugliosi's book tells the REAL TALE of what happened on August 9th 1969. There are alot of wish washy books out there on this case, but the authors tend to add a little spice to the real story. Not Vincent. His book is 100% accurate.I did enjoy the book. It did literally scare the hell out of me. Could not sleep well after reading about the murders. The photo archives in the book is exellent! You really felt like you were there with Vincent trying to break the case.I don't think this book will ever go out of print. It is literally the best true crime book of all time and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Excellent Book! I literally had to tear myself away, and put the book down every once in a while. I've read the book at least 1/2 dozen times, and each time I see things in a new and different light.A terrifying, frightening look into the \\"Manson Family\\" and the murders they committed. Too often true crime books focus solely on the killer and spend little or no time talking about the victims lives. I believe that Bugliosi and Gentry didn't forget the victims in this story, and portrayed them as they really were. The good and the bad.This classic is definitely worth it! Pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book drew me in to the point that I found myself watching my open window across the room, fully expecting an intruder as I read!

As the chief prosecuting attorney in the case of California vs. Charles Manson (and \\"family\\"), Mr. Bugliosi in this book gives us every excruciating detail of this fascinating murder case. You're able to really get inside his head and see up close how he successfully prosecuted this famous Hollywood case.Hollywood is a fitting surrounding for this trial too. Sounds like something directly from a screenwriter's notebook. I guess that's what makes the Manson case so compelling -- it sounds too bizarre to be real. I mean, lyrics from a \\"Beatles\\" album becoming a major focus?! The tremendous overkill tactics employed by the killers, as they obey their \\"master\\" with zombie-like precision! Just simply unbelievable!I'm just glad Vince was successful in his efforts, and got Manson and a few of his murderous \\"family\\" members off the streets. You'll want to keep turning these pages till the end.\\"Helter Skelter\\" is a book recommendation of the highest order."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book 25 years ago and, upon reading it again, I still am of the opinion that Manson and his band of miscreants escaped justice.They should have been executed.We sure could have used Vince Bugliosi at the Simpson trial.

It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali.

This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This read was exactly what I was looking for in finding out what Charles Manson and his followers were all about.

But wow this is such a great book. Very well written & Detailed. I thought I knew all that there was to know about what happened. But I was wrong. This book is a must read!! :D"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"There are more than 200 reviews of this book already, so I won't rehash what's already been written. What I do want to say is this: I finally tackled knocking this off my to-read list this past month, and I couldn't put it down. It's an all-time best seller for a reason. The details are engrossing (not to mention just plain gross) and the description enthralling. It's very well handled material. The shift from third person to first is a bit jolting -- and I'm surprised I had never heard about it prior to reading -- but the author handles it well and makes the shift as painlessly as possible. My only complaint is that the court scene gets a bit verbose toward the end. I'd argue that some 50 pages could have been trimmed, but still, I could not stop reading. Definitely worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I started reading this book and was hooked after the first page. I have seen tons of documentaries on Manson, but of course they cannot compete with this great book. It was so gripping. I sometimes had to re read some pages because it was so incredible. I have read a lot of books, but none come close to this. This book will make you obsessed with the murders. A lot of people wonder why after almost 41 years later why these murders remain so interesting and intriguing, I was born in 1981 and have become fascinated with it. There just has not been and probably never will be any murder (other than the JFK assassination) that stands the test of time. Read this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Here, in this book--Helter Skelter,--we have a panoramic view of the Manson Family's final carnage. This is an authoritative description of Manson and his family, the method and madness of the man they called god, Jesus, soul.This is a ghastly description of the murders only as a member of law enforcement or seasoned prosecutor would narrate.Bugliosi meticulously takes the reader through the crime scene; beat for beat, down to the cents in the victims' wallets. He highlights the mistakes made by the investigating agency, the cover-ups and beyond. After reading his account, you might as well have been in the court room and alongside the detectives.The extent of hate portrayed in the overkill clearly leaves doubt that anyone could be brainwashed to commit such acts of violence without prior aberrant inclination, or psychotic / sociopathic predisposition. Manson was simply and clearly the switch that allowed the flow of bottled up rage that was already in his family members. He was the magnet that brought together a group of deviants."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book in hardback many many years ago. I bought it to give a friend who wanted to read it. It is an excellent accounting of the Manson murders. Some might be disturbed by the content but it is very well written."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read a couple of newspaper articles recently regarding this case and realized I didn't know much about it and decided to pick up this book which was noted as being the \\"definitive\\" telling of the Manson murders. It was so well-written and fascinating I couldn't put it down. It's a long (and heavy!) book but it was a page turner. I'm now reading another of Bugliosi's books and I'm loving that one too."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"\\"Helter Skelter\\" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"\\"It was so quiet one of the killers would later say, you could almost hear the sound of ice rattling in cocktail shakers in the houses way down the canyon.\\"This was not an easy case for the Los Angeles detectives to solve. It was one of the biggest murder cases in American history, and definitely not for the faint-hearted. Written by Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry, there are no holds barred, as all the facts surrounding these horrific murders are laid out in the open, naked for all to see of the Tate-LaBianca murders. The lovely movie star Sharon Tate, hairdresser to the stars Jay Sebring, the well heeled Abigail Folger the Coffee heiress, Voytek Frylowski, Folger's boyfriend, and Steven Parent who was at the address at the wrong time, Leno and his wife Rosemary LaBianca.The warped and drugged out mind of Charles Manson killers shall be with you forever, as they kill for the fun of it for no particular reason. This well written novel will keep you engaged and it will be very hard to tear yourself away from it once you have begun.This novel comes highly recommended.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (Sugar-Cane 11/04/09)"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have seen a lot of horror movies and read several horror books but none were ever as creepy and utterly scary as &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. Mr. Bugliosi did a fantastic job describing Manson's extremely disturbed mind and philosophy as well as that of Manson's co-defendants. Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Steve Parent, Abigail Folger, Voytek Frykowski and Rosemary and Leno LaBianca unnecessarily and tragically suffered such brutal deaths, deaths not one of them even remotely deserved. I was glad to read that Mr.Bugliosi managed to win convictions for all defendants but very disappointed that California abolished the death penalty in 1972, thereby reducing their sentences to life in prison. They should have suffered the same fate as the Tate-LaBianca victims. This book was graphic in detail but not so much so that it prevented me from reading the whole book. I could not put it down. This book beats anything written by Steven King by a mile."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Vincent Bugliosi does a wonderful job of describing in detail, the essence behind Manson's theory of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and the murders that this theory spawned. Once I started, I could not put this book down, even though the material sent a chill down my spine. I learned a lot about Manson and his followers, as well as the trial itself. A great book. Scary, but great."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The first time I read this book was the summer before I started middle school, it scared me to death! I recently read it again and it still has the same creepy vibe it did way back then. I remember it taught me a lot about police procedures, investigation and the legal process as a kid. It is a must read even though years later the motive Bugolosi based his case on has been denied by many of the killers, the reader can make up their own mind. Read this with the doors locked and all the lights on!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I have read numerous fictional crime stories that are interesting and readable, but Helter Skelter has them beat by a long shot! It is just plain engrossing in every way, and written wonderfully. It also puts the American Criminal Justice System under the microscope to a certain extent, and the portrait is not flattering! To call the U.S. Justice System a joke would be generous, considering the incessant abuse allowed by one of the defense attorneys and Manson himself, all in the name of constitutional rights and freedoms!! The portrait of Manson, the person (if you can call him that), is downright disturbing. ... In conclusion, I can't recommend this book highly enough, as long as you've got the stomach for it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Full of Detail in how the murders took place. Lots of information but never dull.The Epilogue was the most interesting. It tells about what happened to some of the people after the case was over.Much more then the movie or DVD they have out now."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song)."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 (what were my parents thinking?) and have read it generally once or twice a year for the past 11 years. I think the reason this book is so fascinating, not just to me, but to so many others, is because it combines so many elements: 1) A gruesome multiple murder, 2) The victims were (mostly) famous, 3) The murderers were young, and mostly women, 4) They took place in the &quot;make love, not war&quot; hippie era, and 5) The murderers were part of a &quot;cult&quot; which fascinated people--how could someone be ordered to kill, and actually do it willingly, joyfully? The last part of the book, which details the origins of Manson's philosophy (Bugliosi speculates at least in part from a group known as The Process), is a little boring, and I've since read other books that suggest the motive is less fanciful than &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and more ordinary, like perhaps robbery, but hey, the book would be a lot less incredible if it were something so everyday. Very absorbing and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Well written & informatiuve.word word word word word word word wod woprd qword word word word word word word word"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Mr. Bugliosi has been able to make us feel we were there throuhtout this nightmare.

Complete story. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in history...good movie"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Although there were a few problems that were not explored, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; One problem in particular baffles me to no end: I would like to know why Mr. Bugliosi included the following comment by Mrs. LaBianca and then did not follow up on it: At the very end of one of the second chapter (I think, I do not have the book in front of me) Mrs. LaBianca is listening to a car radio report about the Tate murders with her husband and daughter on the very night that she and her husband are to be murdered by the same killers, saying that she had had the feeling many times that somebody had been walking through her house and moving things around because objects were placed differently than she had left them many times. This is way before Mr. Bugliosi tells the reader that the Manson family &quot;creepy-crawled&quot; houses, that is to say, they would go through houses, move things around, and then leave, as a way of practicing, so Bugliosi says, for the murders that they would commit later on. The problem is, Bugliosi never really explores this idea of Creepy Crawling, and as I was reading the book, I kept waiting for him to bring it up in relation to the LaBianca murders because, as he tells us later on, Manson and several members of his family had frequented parties held by the LaBiancas' next door neighbor. Granted, this was before the LaBiancas had moved in, but nevertheless, Manson and several members of his family had at least been in their neighborhood before. So I was wondering if Mr. Bugliosi failed to leave out some information concerning creepy-crawling and the LaBiancas. Is it possible that Manson and his family had been inside the LaBianca residence before the murders? It seems likely considering Mrs. LaBianca's statement before her death and considering that the family liked to creepy-crawl. If I am missing something, and you decide to read Helter Skelter, pay attention to this and see if you can figure out why Bugliosi put this statement in there--it just seems strange because Mrs. LaBianca's comment makes no sense in the text unless Mr. Bugliosi means something by it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"That is what the first page tells you and it wasn't wrong. I read this book years ago, it was the book that started me reading true crime. Unless you were living on Mars, you have heard about the Tate/LaBianca murders by the Manson family on the orders of Charles Manson. The story is chilling and one that will stay with you for a long time. Sharon Tate was young, beautiful and about to become a mother for the first time. She was with three friends when Manson's band of psycho's descended on her home. What happens to Tate and her friends is beyond belief, truly frightening and disturbing. I have read many murder books since Helter Skelter and they all leave me wondering how can anyone be evil enough to inflict such horror on a fellow human being? Helter Skelter will always be for me, the scariest book I have ever read. Manson was never at the homes of Tate or LaBianca, his crew did his evil biding and that's what makes it even scarier. How did one man have so much control over so many people that he could get them to commit such heinous acts? Through the years there have been people that have tried to glorify Manson through songs or wearing T-shirts bearing his face. I wonder if they truly know what this man represents? If you want to read a real life horror story, one that will have you double checking your doors and windows, and unable to put your book down - than Helter Skelter is for you."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Best account of the Tate murders written. Exellent reflection of the culture and counter-culture of California in the late 1960's. Gives you all the information without dwelling on the perversion."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Even though this is a work of non-fiction and could be classified as a true crime novel, I would tell anybody that \\"Helter Skelter\\" is a horror novel. Heed the warning on the very first page of this 700-page tome- this book will scare the hell out of you.As far as I've had access to the History Channel, I've known about the Manson murders. I feel like everyone pretty much knows. They've haunted me since childhood. At nine years old, I begged my mom to let me stay up and watch the \\"Helter Skelter\\" made-for-TV movie, but she gave me a resounding NO. My aunt then professed that she could barely stand being along when she was a child during the actual trial. Six years later, I picked up this book, \\"Helter Skelter\\", at a garage sale and asked my dad about it. He gave me a strange look and said, \\"I've read it, Jess. I'm not sure you'll like it.\\" But I was curious. I'd seen the specials on TV, Manson's crazy Sirius Black mugshot eyes, the pretty hippie girls taking the stand, a beautiful pregnant blonde woman splayed out on the carpet, the bloody stains on her body pixelated away so little girls like me wouldn't have nightmares. I had nightmares anyway. But I was still curious. I bought the book and it sat on my shelf for three years until I finally got up the courage this summer to read it.The verdict (pun unintended)? I'm glad I read the book. But I surely don't feel very good about it.The novels literally starts at the Tate crime scene, and unfolds a picture so chilling, so nauseating, and so surreal that I keep wishing this was fiction. Sharon Tate, actress and wife of director Roman Polanski, three of her close friends, and a young man who was at the wrong place at the wrong time, all lay on the premises, brutally murdered. The crime scene encompasses the whole house- the living room, the yard, the driveway. Written on the wall, in Tate's own blood: \\"PIG.\\" This is where the story starts. This is what we have to go by. This is the introduction to a story that rattled my bones.I just need to say that the reason I prickled with goosebumps while reading this alone, outside on the porch, in the dark heat of summer, was because that scene was real but it read like fiction. Those little things- the way Jay Sebring tried to protect Sharon Tate, how Abigail Folger smiled at her murderer while she walked through the house, the little details. The way nobody lived to really tell the story. The way people had to find this scene and piece together what happened. That is the scary part.After another brutal and sickening crime scene was found and speculation ran rampant, a young woman named Susan Atkins tells her cellmate in jail that she killed Sharon Tate. Then the novel really begins, and we discover that young women and men killed seven people in cold blood, under the influence of a man named Charles Manson.Charles Manson is a figure in our culture who, to me, is unforgettable and frightening to the core. He had so much dominating influence over these kids that they treated him like a god. They cared for him, had his children, followed his orders, and eventually killed for him. I felt his influence, just as every other reader has. The part that cemented how dangerous he really is when the prosecuter and author of the book, Vincent Bugliosi, looks to see that his watch has stopped, and then looks up to see Manson smiling at him. This is real, it isn't fiction. Coincidence? Most likely. But still scary.This book takes us through the crime scenes then through the investigation, all while giving us comprehensive background information on the victims and the killers alike. Bugliosi is not only a dedicated lawyer (what a crazy time-consuming job, sheesh!), he is also an efficient writer. I don't think there is anything in this book that could've been edited out. It is a long book, sure, but its a long and complicated event. I appreciate courtroom settings, but if you get bored with the legal jargon, maybe skip this one.I get nervous writing these kind of reviews, because books like \\"Helter Skelter\\" blur the lines of reality and fiction. Would it be respectful to say that I enjoyed this book, even though it is about such horrible events? Can I say that I am fascinated by the Family without sounding like I am giving them unneeded attention? This book raises a lot of questions about morality and good vs. evil, and it might even make you question your own feelings about these people. I learned a lot from this book, but a part of me wishes I would've listened to my parents. They were alive when this happened, young but very much present. This wasn't just a book for them- it happened. And a part of me wishes I didn't have to face that reality."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Length:: 1:13 MinsWritten words can not do Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry, and Scott Brick the narrator the true justice that is due. This is a must have book for anyone! It clears up many questions left unanswered by the first book. It tells what happened to the major players 25 years later."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Read book thirty years ago. After twenty some years as a federal investigator I have a much deeper appreciation of evidence and litigation surprises. Great read!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Back when this book was written and presented, the horrendous crime was still alarming ... how could people be swayed by this nut and commit such terrible crimes against mankind. After all of these years and all of the parole hearings, I thank the powers at be who keep this man locked up. Vincent Bugliosi tells a good factual story in a way that is easy and at time the data frightening to read. It is obvious that Manson is crazy like a fox and needs to stay where he is and it is a blessing that this data is presented so that we know what kind of maniac can and does share this planet with us. This book is a very good read if you are fascinated by the mind and the workings of it and how people can be so mindless, murderous and have no regard for life. Vincent Bugliosi does a very good job with the writing of his books and to document such a crime can hopefully be of sound historical value in trying to determin why these kinds of things happen. It will of course never bring back the innocent people who were slain for no good reason and the maniacs still exist and the crimes still occur, a sad historical commentary. A good read, presented very well with hopefully historical significance to understand crimes and creatures hence the 5 stars."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The stars is not for the book itself which is a 5 at least but the Kindle version which doesn't have the pictures Boo hiss"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an \\"A\\"). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his \\"family\\". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I ordered this book to read on a road trip because I have always been interested in true crime stories.This book, of all the true crime books that I have read, was by far the most gripping and interesting.

I have since read several books about the Manson family and Tate- La Bianca tragedies and this book is the best out of them all.I strongly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Despite its length (600 + pages) and punctilious court room detail in the second half, Vincent Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter\\" is a fascinating account of the two nights of savagery which shocked the nation in 1969: starlet Sharon Tate and her three house guests (plus an unfortunate young man who, like Ronald Goldman, was in the wrong place at the wrong time) on August 9th, then the LaBiancas, a middle-aged upper-class couple on August 10th. With his co-author Curt Gentry, Mr Bugliosi opens the narrative with the discovery of the carnage at the Tate residence, goes through the invesigation (the LAPD does NOT look good here), and closes with the nine-month trial where Charles Manson and his \\"Family\\" members were brought to justice. The story is haunted by Hollywood history. Sharon Tate was the beautiful wife of acclaimed director Roman Polanski (they met while filming his \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\"); but her chances of ever becoming a major star, had she lived, is today debatable. Before she moved into the residence where she was murdered, the house had been occupied by Terry Melcher, the son of Doris Day and producer Martin Melcher. (He had been living there with Candice Bergen, herself the child of a popular entertainer.) Manson was introduced to Terry Melcher by Gregg Jacobson, a talent scout who was married to Lou Costello's daughter. One of the TV crewmen who discovered the bloody clothes discarded by the murderers was named King Baggott. It's an unusual name, and I assume he was the son or grandson of the silent film star. On a darker level, one of Manson's \\"indoctrinated\\", Bobby Beausoleil, appeared (according to Mr Bugliosi) in a Kenneth Anger film; and one of Manson's victims, a ranch hand named Donald \\"Shorty\\" Shea, had aspirations to be a movie actor. Hollywood Babylon,indeed.The \\"star\\"of the story, even with Mr Bugliosi's first-person narrative in the major part of the book, is Charles Manson. Extremely enigmatic, with a rhapsodic influence over individuals as well as groups, he is simple and extraordinarily complicated. One thinks of Rasputin, but Mr Bugliosi successfully compares him to Hitler: both were frustrated artists, both had nagging doubts regarding legitimacy and ethnicity in their family backgrounds, and both were vegetarians who loved animals (according to one of Manson's followers, he once petted a rattlesnake). Manson's mystique is undeniable. Mr Bugliosi relates how in court one day with Manson time literally stood still -- i.e., Mr Bugliosi's watch stopped. Manson was giving him a strange little smile. But in the final analysis one realizes that Manson, for all his mystical blend of the Bible and the Beatles, was simply a person who liked to kill people.As other reviewers have stated, while reading \\"Helter Skelter\\" you may aswell resign yourself to nightmares, as well as checking and re-checking your windows and doors. (Sometimes the most casual detail will turn your blood to ice: after butchering the LaBiancas, the killers raided their refrigerator and had a snack.) But stop reading? No, not once you've started. A gripping revelation of Hollywood's \\"creepy-crawley\\" underside, \\"Helter Skelter\\" gives the Bad and the Beautiful a horrible new meaning."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I had this book since I was sixteen and have read and re-read and watched the movie.

I've studied the Manson case extensively and come away with different opinion of them each time (all of them not good).Essentially, all the Manson Family was, was a bunch of kids aged 15-28, all runaways that joined up with and let themselves be brainwashed by 5'2\\" Charles Manson. I think Susan Atkins once said he had the voice of an angel.Between 1967-1969 Charles was preaching to his followers how he wanted to start a race war ... his version of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and that the Beatles were urging him to do it through the White Album. (How demented is this man?)In 1969, Manson got tired of waiting and told his followers that the population needed a little help in starting Helter Skelter. So he sent out Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle and Linda Kasabian (the only one with a valid driver's license and snitch) to a house he knew about in the Hills (10050 Cielo Drive).There in the early morning hours, Sharon Tate's \\"Love House\\" (rented from Doris Day's son Terry Melcher and owned by director Rudi Altobelli) went from \\"Love House\\" to Slaughterhouse as Sharon and each of her 3 friends and a bystander (Folger, her boyfriend Frykowski, Sebring and Parent) were brutally and horrifically killed. Sharon was 8-1/2 months pregnant with her first child from her husband, director Roman Polanski.The next night, Charles said it was too messy and he went along and brought along Leslie Van Houten. There a couple who owned a grocery store chain were killed in the same horrific way. In both residences the \\"Family\\" printed words on the walls and doors, including misspellings, with towels with the victims blood.\\"Helter Skelter\\" is the story written by the Prosecuting Attorney, Vincent Bugliosi. He and his assistant investigated, and tried the four murderers in a California Federal Court and got the death penalty for each one for the Tate-LaBianca killings.Today, the main people in the Manson Family (including the 1st in command Squeaky Fromme for trying to kill President Ford). In 1972 the death penalty in California was abolished and the Manson Family's sentences got commuted to Life. The Death Penalty was reinstated in 1973 or '74. Every now and then you'll hear about a Manson Family member come up for Parole and being denied. Most recently as (5/23/2002) Leslie Van Houten (participated in LaBianca murder) has come up for Parole and been denied, and now she thinks she has been unjustly denied Parole after all these years. The woman stabbed a person 13 times! And she wants a parole! Current California Governor Gray Davis won't allow it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I think that the previous reviews are correct in the fact that this book is very vivid with details and frightening, to say the least. My 14 year old son mentioned wanting to read this book and I instantly recalled my horror while reading this about 20 years ago. I have been told that the cover is the only big change in the editions since it was first printed. I can see why many readers had a hard time sleeping after putting down this book. I read constantly and love to read non-fiction but I have never had a book consume me as this one did. You are truly transported back in time and to the depths of evil while reading this engrossing, true account. After reading so many books over the years, I usually have to have some prompting to remember exactly which book someone is referring to. That will never be the case with this book. It will stay with you forever. I no longer have my older version and am still considering whether my son is mature enough to read this but I recommend this book to anyone who wants an in depth look at these events."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This is a terrific book by Bugliosi and Gentry of one of the most memorable and important crimes and trials of the 20th century. But the Kindle edition does not contain any of the, supposedly, 50 photographs and illustrations. The reasons might be legal, but the Kindle edition should clearly note this in their description."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This book is about the closest you can come - or would ever want to come - to understanding Charles Manson's warped ideology - an ideology that ultimately led to some of the most devastating crimes in American history. I found \\"Helter Skelter\\" to be an intriguing and emotionally draining read; once you become embroiled in the story behind the Manson murders, there's no escaping. As others have said in their reviews, this is a book that truly stays with you long after you've closed it, raising some important questions about justice and the very fine line that separates genius from madness. This is one of those rare true crime stories that seldom falls victim to sensationalism, but rather presents the case as exactly what it was: a complicated, mind-blowing, and senseless tragedy whose tremors are still felt today."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I initially read this book as a 14 year old and due to the recent publicity regarding Susan Atkins, decided to read it again.The book chronicles the true story of the murders of the LaBianca's as well as the murders commonly referred to the \\"Tate\\" murders. It also touches on the murders of Gary Hinman and Shorty Shea, who are often forgotten victims of the Manson Family.Essentially, the murders begin with Charles Manson, a career criminal with a poor childhood who was practically raised in youth homes and detention facilities, etc. Despite his poor upbringing and limited education, Charlie was a bright man who had the ability to spot and exploit weaknesses in other people.Upon his latest release from prison, Manson begins to attract a group of followers, mainly comprised of young girls, and a few young men, whom all seem to have dropped out of society and are experimenting heavily and frequently with drugs. Manson sees their dissatisfaction with society and using that, as well as sex and drugs further breaks down their morals and values until ultimately they look at him as Jesus Christ and look to him to make their every decision for them.Manson, disillusioned with his failure as a musician, begins to envision a new future for himself and his Family, in part guided by the Beatles musics, which he believes is full of secret messages. Manson believes that there will ultimately be a race war with the black man being victorious. In the meantime Manson and his family will retreat to the desert where they will find a hole leading to the bottomless pit where they will live until the black man realizes that he is incapable of ruling/running society as a whole. At that time, Manson will emerge and become leader of the country, if the world. Charlie calls this chain of events \\"Helter Skelter\\".When Helter Skelter fails to come to fruition in a timely manner, he decides to incite it himself, by murdering rich or upper class white people. His theory is that white society will believe the murders were committed by the black man, and will turn on the black man, thereby getting the race war rolling.The book further goes on the describe the investigation (or lack thereof on the part of some officers) and ultimate arrest and conviction, as well as an epilogue and afterward in the book with updates.I have read some of the reviews, and have to agree that in some instances, Vincent Bugliosi was perhaps too wordy and a lot of stuff could have been cut out.I also noticed that many of the reviews accuse Bugliosi of manufacturing the Helter Skelter motive for his own purposes. While I have not read the other Manson books, I am not inclined to believe this. First of all, he got the idea from many of the family members, many of whom got on the witness stand and testified to Manson's belief system as well as his many statements that \\"the time for Helter Skelter is now\\", etc. I also noted that many of those reviewers expressed support for Manson with the oft repeated phrase \\"he wasn't there\\", \\"he didn't kill them\\", blah blah blah. For the record, he was an active participant in the Hinman murders, slicing his ear off. He was present and aware of what was occurring and ultimately was the one who ordered the kill. He was also present at the Shorty Shea murder, for at least a portion of it. Again, it was at his behest that Shorty was murdered. Further, he is the one who sent the murderers to the Tate residence that night, he is the one who told them to get their knives, he is the one who told Tex to murder everyone and make it gruesome. As if that weren't enough, the next evening, it was he who entered the LaBianca home first and tied them up and left them there with full knowledge of what would happen to them. For anyone who is aware of the law, if someone is killed at your request, if you participate in a felony (i.e., cutting someone's ear off, or say breaking into their home and tying them up), and ultimately those people die in conjunction with those some events in which you particiated, you are responsible as if you killed them yourself.If anyone is in doubt as to Manson's control over the female defendant's in this case, one only need to read the vast material available regarding the trial and how he conrolled them in court, and how he attempted to control the trial. If they were unable, while their freedom and very lives were on the line, to exercise their own free will and make their own decisions, it's not a stretch to imagine that he was able to control their day to day actions, as well as order them to kill with the expectation that it be carried out.Additionally, the former Manson Family members who were involved, many of whom are still incarcerated, to this day state that was the motive/theory behind the killings. If it was not Manson's true motive, then he failed to share that with other family members.Further, in an interview with Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson, a reporter asked him if he had read Helter Skelter, to which Watson replied that he had and it was pretty accurate.Either way, it is a very informative book, and while on the wordy side, provides a detailed and inside look at the trial and what was going on behind the scenes. Whether the reader chooses to believe in the Helter Skelter theory or not is up to them."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I first read &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; the same summer I read &quot;In Cold Blood.&quot; Both books left indelible images in my psyche and ensured I would never look at the world of crime and investigation the same again.I've never read a book quite like HS since. Bugliosi and Gentry have written a taught and gripping blow-by-blow account of the two seemingly unconnected streams of events, the Tate/La Bianca murders and Manson's cult, how they horribly intersected and the breathtaking resolution.Bugliosi's reminiscences provide both the personal anguish that the investigation caused him and his family and the urgent immediacy that gripped him and the community to see that justice was finally done.Unforgettable and unflinching, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; forces us to look into the eyes of evil and learn more about ourselves.See also my reviews of the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; TV movie and the audio book version."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"\\"Helter Skelter\\" is the bible on the 1969 Tate-La Bianca murders. Bugliosi goes into great detail about the mechanics of the case - the murders, the autopsies, how the LAPD almost blew the case because the detectives working on the Tate and La Bianca cases, at that time two separate investigations, would not communicate with each other, etc.Bugliosi shows how he was able to link the two murders together, gather evidence that had almost been destroyed, and how he tracked down the gun that was used in the killings (which was filed away at the only precinct NOT to have gotten a county wide memo about the gun!).There are updated versions of the book, marking landmark anniversaries of that black night in American history and I wouldn't doubt that Bugliosi will have another update for the 35th anniversary next year.Helter Skelter is the book to have about the case. Greg King's \\"Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders\\" is the book to have about the victims (more specifically, of course, Sharon Tate)."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I read this book back in '84 in college and never again wanted to pick up another fiction book again. This book is a MUST READ. Not only is the story incredible but so is the fact that it is all real. This story of mind control of young, runaway kids back in the 60s by &quot;guru&quot; Charles Manson shows how vulnerable kids are when parents aren't around.Each player in the case from the victims to the criminals to the prosecutors and everyone inbetween was put together excellently in the book. Never once did it get confusing as to who was who. This case still resounds to this day in the psyche of America and after you read this excellent book you will see why."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"When they say that this book will scare the hell out of you they are making an under statement.

I am 13 now and the lights are still on.AND THEY ARNE'T GOING OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The book Helter Skelter by Vince Bugliosi is perhaps one of the best tru-crime books I've ever read. From the story itself, to the incompetency of the LAPD; from the chilling descriptions of the murders to the way the book is set out, you just can't put it down. It's amazing how clsoe to Manson and his three co-defendants Bugliosi gets. If you're interested in true-crime stories, and even if you're not, this is a book to read, if simply to find out how horrifyingly brutal and cold humans can be.4 Stars, and don't forget to check out the photos."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I loved this book. I could not put this book down. I'm only 16 years old, but I still understood everything. It made me wonder how it was back in the '60's, in Manson's family."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"A really good true crime book. Bugliosi does an excellent job in detailing events from the murders through the trial. I read this book many years ago and on a whim decided to read it again. It's a compelling, fascinating read. The tension continues to build as the case is built against Manson and his followers.The only minor criticism that I have is with Mr. Bugliosi's ego. He represents everyone involved in the case (except for himself, of course) as incompetent buffoons. Police, judge, forensic experts, coroners, attorneys, witnesses: no one is spared Mr. Bugliosi's wrath. After reading his account, you wonder how anyone in the whole history of jurisprudence has ever been able to attain a conviction without Bugliosi's assistance."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"this book is very good if you are interested in the Manson murders. You can also get lots of real footage from utube."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"The late 60s were full of destruction, rebellion and the end of the optimism and the idealism that America was almost attached to. Then the Manson family kills 8 people, which symbolizes the darker side to the hippie/LSD/youth culture lifestyle.Vincent Bugliosi was Manson's attorney during his infamous trial. Here he documents every shred of evidence and every detail which went into the ghastly homicide, and the trial itself, which resulted in Manson and 3 members of his family (Sadie, Lulu, and Patricia) being convicted of murder and sentenced to death, which was later turned into life in prison, due to California's abolishment of the death penalty in early 1970.This also gives an unbiast view of Charlie's life (by the time he was 32, he spent 17 years in jail), his aspirations to become a rockstar, the members of his \\"Family,\\" why he and his family committed the murders, and, probably the most interesting yet odd part of the book, Manson's rather religious, dogmatic and supposedly prophetic interpretation of the Beatles' double-LP \\"The White Album.\\" It is complete with rather bizarre lyrical references from the people he was after (the \\"Piggies\\") the revolt that blacks were going to plan against whites (The lyrics to \\"Blackbird\\" describe \\"Helter Skelter,\\" which meant that blacks were going to destroy whites, led by \\"Rocky Racoon, who, strangely would be a 'coon,' not to be racist\\"), the Beatles as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (The avant-garde sound effects of \\"Revolution 9\\", and how the 5th 'horseman' was actually Stuart Sutcliffe, who was in the group but died of a brain hemmorhage in 1962), and how the Beatles were planning to sail across the Atlantic to make Charlie a rockstar (The lyrics to \\"Honey Pie,\\" 'I'm in love but I'm lazy,' meaning that the Beatles were supposedly interested in Charlie but were too lazy to sail across the Atlantic to California to meet him). It's rather strange and laughable at the same time.It also gives the viewpoint of Manson himself, with interviews, quotes, press releases and biographical information. His comments about Richard Nixon condemning him as a guilty man, while Nixon sends young men to Vietnam to get killed, was particularly interesting.It's a very long, detailed account about the murders that would mark the end of an era, and one of the most notorious crimes in history. A book highly recommended for anyone interested in law, or anyone remotely interested in the Manson cult and/or ideology."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"WOW! This book is awesome! I love Vincent B. It's not an easy read because there's a lot of technical stuff in there, but it's definitely worth it. I had to leave the book at work a couple of times because I was so creeped out!"},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"this book is awesome! very very in depth about what happened. i cannot believe someone would ever let a person control them like that."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I really enjoyed reading the majority of the book. The author really gives \\"hands on\\" insight to this whole ordeal. I knew most of the facts having been raised in that generation - however it was the mental control that was very interesting. I always thought that Manson had a kind of magic when he spoke - even to this day - there is always just enough truth in what he says to make you think. I always found him intelligent but absolutely think he was behind it all - and he is probably best left to die in prison. He's actually happy there and it's all he knows....kind of a sad situation for his life - really.....The book went on too long. Once you reach the end of the trial - and all of the characters have been dealt with -it seemed the book never ended and got old. I found myself skipping toward the end and there was so much redundancy. Up to that point - it was very interesting. There were kind of 'minor' characters that he went into detail about how they ended up - and actually there were so many people involved, the reader kind of got lost."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"To begin this review, I must explain that I do not normally read books in the True Crime genre. In fact, this is the first and only True Crime book I have read. My reading interests are traditionally geared towards philosophical, religious and historical texts. I became interested in Charles Manson after watching some of his interviews about spirituality on YouTube. I picked up Helter Skelter because it appeared to be the most critically acclaimed text on the subject of Charles Manson. If you are someone who is simply looking for a gripping, page-turning story about murder and mayhem, BUY THIS BOOK. It is a well-written and accurate factual chronicle of the Manson murders that is every bit as good as all the other reviews on Amazon say. (Be aware, however, that this book is dated. A lot of information about the murders have come out since this book was published, and even the updated new versions don't cover the new material in any great depth.) If I were reviewing this book strictly on the quality of the story told, I would award it 5-stars.Having said that, this book could have been much more engaging. It is simply that, a well-written factual chronicle of the Manson murders. For some reason, the book opens on the day after the Sharon Tate murder. The author (the attorney who prosecuted Manson) presents the facts chronologically, with many many exceptions, in the same order that detectives working the case learned of them. This means that the book is less the story Charles Manson and his family, and more the story of prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi. This manner of story-telling brings to the forefront the limitations of the author. Again, Bugliosi is an attorney with a mind only for the concrete facts. If you are hoping for a critical examination of Manson, the control he had over his followers, his beliefs, his childhood, etc., choose a different book. On the few occasions the author attempts to stray from a factual account of the murders in order to address the more abstract ideas and implications surrounding the murders, he gets it wrong. (Browsing Amazon, I see that Bugliosi has recently published a book on religion. Read the reviews of that book and you will see that, even forty years after writing Helter Skelter, Bugliosi is apparently still unqualified to write about more abstract topics.)My advice is to read this book if you want a purely factual account of the Manson slayings, or are just looking for some good entertainment. However, if you are also interested in the psychology behind Manson and his family, you will need to supplement Helter Skelter with other reading. Finally, be aware that, at 700+ pages, this book will likely take at least a few weeks to finish."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I had always wanted to read this book. I grew up in the 60's & 70's. It is very well written and full of things I'd never heard about.

I would not recommend it to anyone. I pray something like this never happens again. Now let's forget about it."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is so full of chit. Any modern day investigator would through this case out. The story is so full of holes, you could drive your car through it.

You can sure tell that Vincent Bugliosi is a science fiction writer not a lawyer.the Charlie Manson (CDC B-33920 Corcoran) April 11, 2012 Board of Parole HearingCharlie Manson never actually killed anyone himself.

Mr. Bugliosi has a vivid imagination, and the characters he paints are very realistic. I would put this right up there with Dean Koontz and Stephen King, except it is a little more real. The story he tells is something we can truly imagine actually happening in today's society. A very unique storyteller."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"This will ALWAYS be the first book people pick up on the subject of the so-called &quot;Manson&quot; Murders. Author Bugliosi is now a paid Talking Head on Court TV and anyother cable Network that will cut him a check and he is STILL fundamentally misinformed as to the reasons these horrible killings took place. He bases his theories on interviews he conducted with Manson Family members, most of whom were tripped out of their minds during his sessions. He largely invented the entire Helter Skelter connection after encouraging one Manson follower to interpret the Book of Revelations. How's that for dependable detective work?? In my humble opinion, John Lennon's Estate should sue Bugliosi for all the damage he did to the Beatles as a result. I realize you will probably buy this book but you should buy a few others, most notably CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here on Amazon.com. It was published late in '98 and is currently the most accurate represenation of what went on. Buy them both, read them both and don't be surprised if you start wondering what story exists BETWEEN these two books. If you are a True Crime Buff, you should be ashamed of yourself if this is the only book you read on the subject."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"Helter Skelter is the most famous (or infamous) work attributed to the Manson case. Bugliosi, in his work as a prosecutor for the case, compiled his thoughts and evidence in this somewhat dubious award winner.Unfortunately, the book itself falls somewhat short of a literary masterpiece, and seems to have won most of its acclaim as a result of people's terror shortly following the case itself, and their willingness to ingest whatever was written, as soon as it was written, mirroring the media circus fiasco which the case itself spanwed.Dwelling on the somewhat unbelievable and conspiracy-driven helter skelter theory, the book, and Bugliosi himself, posits an undeniably fantastic scenario, in which a Satanic hippie with unlimited supplies of drugs, managed to convince his various young apostles to proceed with plans to begin a race war through killing. Bugliosi of course points out that Manson was trying to kill a former Beach Boy named Terry Melcher who promised him a record deal, in an attempt to get back at a system which rejected his self proclaimed musical talent.The gaping logical holes in the case force logical individuals to place Helter Skelter in the fantasy section at their library. As pointed out by the somewhat more enjoyable and well written work \\"The Manson File, Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman\\" by Nikolas Schreck, Manson was aware Melcher was no longer at the murdered residence at the time, but had moved some distance away (he would have known this since several of his friends visited him often to use drugs together.) The idea of controlling people using LSD is ludicrous when one studies the actual effects of the substance, a fact the government itself understood after failed MK-ULTRA experiments attempting to use LSD as a mind control drug and truth serum.The sad fact is that this entire work is nothing more than pulp fiction spawned by the anti-drug and anti-hippie bent establishment in the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. With an obsessive, almost religious fervor, Bugliosi repeatedly returns to his race war theories, without even visiting other possibilities in the case.In fact, the entire work seems to have been written with the sole purpose of absorbing as much money as possible following the case, with a mind to sensationalize it as much as possible, so that the scope of interest would increase. It will likely appeal to people who have limited understanding of the case, and are just looking for a spooky late night insomniac's friend to help them sleep unsoundly with a heavy dose of psychopath-hippie nightmares."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"First off, l strongly suggest reading 'Manson - in his own words', and even if you decide to read Helter Skelter, you should read the other book first so you will have much more detailed information than you will ever get out of the distortion and assumptions of Helter Skelter. It is written by the prosecutor and is so one sided. Bugliosi's main focus is the \\"helter skelter\\" race war theory as a motive which is just ridiculous. Sure the family discussed far out ideas when they were all tripping, but he blows it out of proportion. If you want a clear picture of the manson murders, you cant form an opinion based only on hearing a perspective from one side, let alone from an outsider."},{"Title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I bet Vincent never thought people would one day have home computers and be able to read the police reports and see the blood evidence because once you do that, you quickly find the book is complete B.S.

Manson is doing life in prison from a story that is a complete lie.

Author Gerald Luc gushes about this 100 page short as \\"having a soundtrack\\" because he often mentions particular songs in conjunction with particular scenes. He also had the audacity to add (supposedly truthful) \\"descriptions\\" of counter-culture cliques such as hippies, punks, and beatniks; an insult to those of us who actually were alive during these cultural revolutions and took place in them.The drugs? No one shoots up, a couple of pills are popped, and a little MJ smoking is achieved. There are no trips and one very lame withdrawal described more like a tequila hangover. If it's true that you should \\"write what you know\\", this kid strayed far from that advice. It's true the prose shows some promising future skill at writing, but the author needs to work on the emotional aspect of his flat and careless characterizations.So what is the book about? A young man wants to write a book, has a great deal of carnal relationships with several girls, spends a weekend in New York where another teenage carnal fantasy is filled by having a hooker show up at his hotel room. There isn't much to the book except bland rutting and pipe dreams of youth. Boring. Thank goodness it was only 100 pages, unfortunately filled with wet-dream fantasy, no drugs other than the action of 'placing a white pill in her mouth', and cheesy advertisements for the author's \\"listening list\\". Avoid this book."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Mizoguchi, a friendless loner handicapped by a pronounced stammer due to a childhood incident, lives in his own obsessive isolative world.

This makes for very powerful reading as one tries to piece together the man that is Yukio Mishima."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"A great book and very unique in its depth and detail. I was once told to write on subjects that are not broad but quite narrow and bring it deep down to its core which is exactly how Yukio Mishima writes. I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Mishima is one of the most talented writers who arose from the disaster of World War II. *Kinkakuji* is a journey through inner chaos. While the temple symbolizes everything that is beautiful for the book's tragic protaganist, it also reminds him of his own insignificance. The book is written from a Buddhist perspective and gives a glimpse into the paradoxical world that is Japanese."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Given the other reviews, this seems a dissenting opinion, but Mishima's \\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\" was a pretty laborious read. I read the entire book out loud to an audience and found myself wishing it would come to an end.All apologies to those who liked this book. I respect that, but the problem for me came in the amount of endless introspection that overflows the pages of \\"The Golden Pavilion.\\" I don't mind some philosophical pandering in my literature and thoroughly enjoy it when it's done with the uniqueness of Don DeLillo or Milan Kundera. But here, Mishima takes whatever plot is involved in this tale of a temple student gone awry in the face of foreign influence, loss of values, poverty, and psychosis and sucks the life blood right out the marrow of it. This leaves the book with no skeletal structure, no bones, just a big lethargic mushy mass of meandering thoughts and not even well-worded or unique ones at that.Here's what I mean, we get no less than 5 pages of a bee landing on a Chrysanthemum...somebody help me please. We get laboriously repetitive words (not sure if that's the translators fault or Mishima's) with a mention of the character's Kashiwagi's clubfoot about every other sentence. We get 7 counts of the use of the word, \\"adumbration\\" in one paragraph...7 mind you. Who uses the word \\"adumbration\\", much less 7 times in a paragraph, 3 in one sentence? Don't get me started.Not a detail goes by without Mishima turning it over in the character's mind endlessly until we are no longer remotely interested. It's your typical boy loves temple, temple is too beautiful, boy must destroy temple sort of story. And where the plot starts moving along towards the end, Mishima interjects some inane meandering ethereal philosophy that seems to lead nowhere, just to kill the momentum.On page 255 there's the line, \\"I was overcome by intense weariness.\\" So true, so true. That's how this book grabbed me through and through."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Yukio Mishima's The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is not a particularly interesting or enjoyable read, but its themes unveil the brutality and cruelties of reality that we all must learn in life, as well as one man's quest to discover his place in the world and what he can do change that world in which he tries to survive. With 90% of the novel being the protagonist's self-evaluation and reflections on life, the novel proves slow-starting and cumbersome to readers that may seek an immediate good read instead of a Japanese history and geography lecture. As the story unfolds, so do deep themes of the obsession of power, beauty and its corruptibility, and the search for the self. Introverted and calculating, the protagonist is easily controlled by his emotions for and the influence of his two close friends who, in reality, are as different as light and dark. The novel also offers a closer look into Mishima's psychologically disturbing world, where he is able to twist and manipulate the words of religious texts into his own painfully logical, cynically dark, almost satanic interpretations of Zen Buddhist proverbs and stories. Coming from a traditional, samurai family, Mishima lived during a tumultuous time in a modernizing, Westernizing, post-World War II Japan, and the novel, in some ways, parallels Mishima's resent and resistance of Western influence, as well as his struggle to perceive any value in foreign ideas and coexist daily with all that he hates. Verbose and often circular in thought, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is not for the faint-hearted reader, but is rewarding to the patient ones willing to suffer Mishima's insane ranting, analyze the text, and understand the method behind this Japanese author's madness."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This is not a superfical book, but if you take it that way it will be. I read it in my Ap Lit. and Comp. class, I think about 5 people in the class got anything from it, including the teacher. I was included in that too, but this is not an easy book, and I would not recomend it to just anyone. Its the kind of book you have to really want to understand, unlike my class, or else you'll read right past everything."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading"},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"The Temple of the Golden Pavillion is an excellent psychological novel. In this book, we can see how a mind can be driven along to evil through obsession.The main character of this book is Mizoguchi. He is the son of a poor rural priest. He is taken by his dying father to become an acolyte at the Temple of the Golden Pavillion. All throughout his childhood, his father had told him about the spledid beauty of this temple. Mizoguchi builds up an image of ideal beauty in his mind based on this Golden Pavillion. However, this ideal image causes him to feel disappointed in any supposed form of beauty, including women and even the actual physical Golden Pavillion. Nothing can live up to this image of supreme beauty.As he enters university, he comes under the influence of Kashiwagi, a fellow student with a very bitter view of life. Under this influence, Mizoguchi's dark feelings bubble up inside him. One of my favorite parts is Mizoguchi and Kashiwagi's discussion of knowledge and action. Kashiwagi asserts that an unbearable life can be made bearable by just having the knowledge that it is unchangable. However, Mizoguchi argues that knowledge is a dead thing, and that only action to change to change an unbearable life can make it bearable. This attitude leads him to his final desperate attack.I think that this book is particularly important in this age of terrorism. Often people ask why do terrorist do what they do, and they ask this because they don't understand the obsession (whether in ideal beauty as in this book, or with fundamentalist religion as in the case with terrorists), the hopelessness, and the desperation that they feel. I think if you read this book, you can understand how a mind is turned to evil acts through these means. Please read this book, if only to understand this point.A previous reviewer complained that ther isn't much action in this book, and that is true, but that's no reason to give it a low rating. It's a psychological novel about the process of a mind on the road to evil, so naturally the main part of the story takes place in the mind. If you want a novel with exploding cars, you should try a Tom Clancy novel instead."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This novel is a good example of a theme that frequently arises in Mishima's work: the resentment of the object of desire. Mizoguchi, the protagonist, is overwhelmed by the beauty of the golden temple and learns to resent it through the guru-like counsel of a friend. Over and over, Mizoguchi feels overwhelmed and made insignificant by the beautiful things in his new life as a monk: the beautiful temple, sexual possibility, and ultimately, his autonomy, perhaps even his life. This book, arguably Mishima's best, may well have been another one of the author's suicide rehearsals, and the unforgettable psychological impact of the book is that of a legendary storyteller demonstrating his Hamlet-like &quot;north-by-northwest&quot; madness. Technically, this is an amazing book, dripping with evocative, beautiful imagery and reminds me of a movie in its directorial-like descriptive method, its forceful 'mis en scene'. Artistically, I suspect Mishima was trying to compete with his great literary forefather Kawabata by playing with western ideas of the apolonean, further fueling his hopelessness and his rage with his art and with himself, but that is a bit academic and beyond my ability to determine. Ultimately, I cherish this book for its tortured explanation of the harshness love and beauty cruelly impose, a feral scream quietly hidden in the drug-like beauty of a book."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"If ever criticized, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima is chided most frequently for some of its seemingly mundane, superfluous and repetitive details and paragraphs. Many give up, or decide not to read it at all, since the text appears heavy and unmanageable from the very first page. However, after analyzing the book and enduring challenges, one should come to realize the book's deeper meanings.Mishima's writing is filled with archetypes and symbols that reoccur throughout the novel which may seem repetitive, but are utterly paramount and necessary to encourage deeper thought within the reader. After studying a chapter or two, one can make connections using these archetypes as a guide to interpret the book. For example, the seasons and the weather reflect the state of mind of the protagonist, Mizoguchi. Descriptive words such as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"bright\\" are premonitions of future events. Other distinctly repeated archetypes include colors, water and fire (they are repeated for the sake of emphasis), which help the reader to stay intact with the extraordinary world that Mishima creates.The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is famous for mind-boggling its readers. A way one can come to terms with the frequent juxtapositions in the book is by researching a little about the author's background. Then, one will realize that Mishima incorporated his own philosophies and experiences in the character of Mizoguchi (which resulted in an active voice in its narrations: almost as if Mishima was talking to you personally). This may explain why the book seems abstract yet realistic, absurd yet understandable. Some characteristics of Mizoguchi we can relate with--others are puzzling and enigmatic.It is striking to think that the main happenings of the novel actually happened--a stuttering young monk did in fact set fire to the golden temple after becoming obsessed with its beauty, as cited in the introduction of the book. The plot is simple, and its synopsis can be predicted through reading the introduction and the blurb. Mishima focuses acutely on the insight of the distressed monk's mind, even forcing the reader to unexpectedly sympathize with the mentally \\"different\\" protagonist. This may be the reason why some readers find Mishima's book hard to understand, or not fruitful. A reader cannot expect to obtain anything productive out of this book simply from the plot alone. Its true value can be attained through reading the book proactively, with care.The Temple of the Golden Pavilion has become internationally accepted, possibly because of its universal philosophical messages, unique writing style, and also precisely for its absurdness. It is an esoteric piece of writing. It is loved by individuals (intellectuals) who are able to enjoy and appreciate quality writing while carefully deciphering its many conundrums; but it is dismissed by those... seeking a lighter read.For more in-depth information and analysis, please visit:http://goldenpavi.exblog.jp"},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, by Yukio Mishima, is a tragic story about Mizoguchi, the story's protagonist, and his struggle to come to terms with his existence. This novel does not attempt to teach us how or in what way we should live our lives; rather, it offers an insight into the mind of a deeply troubled young man whose existence he justifies by hating the outside world.Told from the first-person perspective, I had trouble getting into the novel at first - I enjoy an intrusive narrator. After a few chapters, however, I was drawn into Mizoguchi's world of contrasts between evil and beauty. We learn that Mizoguchi stutters a lot and because of this he has been cast out of society at school. His stuttering, his feeling that he is unattractive, and some of the things he has done (such as stepping on a prostitute's stomach) cause him to believe that he is a terribly ugly and evil person. However, Mizoguchi would have himself be seen no other way. Since he has been cast out of the world, he comes to believe that the world is a beautiful and good place in which he does not belong. Yet Mizoguchi soon finds out that this perception of the word - one in which the world is a kind and beautiful place - is not entirely accurate. It is here that I believe Mishima's writing ability stands out among other writers. This is because he is able to show how people like Mizoguchi and Kashiwagi, who is met later in the novel, can see the destruction or defilement of something beautiful as a validation of their own existence.For example, when Mizoguchi wished \\"that the Golden Temple was going to be bombed,\\" (62) it was in order for him to remain ugly and evil in his own eyes. While the Golden Temple exists, he is able to find flaws in it - the phoenix looks more like a crow, it is made up of several different architectural styles and its shadow looks more beautiful than the actual building itself. This is not to say that the Golden Temple is not actually beautiful, but that it becomes more beautiful only when it is gone. Since he could then say that the Golden Pavilion was beautiful and that beauty did exist in the world, Mizoguchi could use that as a way to underscore his own ugliness.With The Temple of the Golden Pavilion Mishima holds his own among the great writes of fiction. Just like any other book, it takes a while to start enjoying, but picks up once you do. It does not try to give us guidelines to live our lives by nor does it have a \\"The moral of the story is...\\" This is part of the reason why I enjoyed reading it so much - I did not feel as though there was some sort of a hidden meaning behind every detail of which I needed to be aware. Rather, it provides a detailed insight into the thought processes of a person who can only see himself from a negative perspective."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is a book that stayed with me since I first read it, and in particular certain lines by Mizoguchi and Kashiwagi, two of the principal characters, are often so perfect in describing the events of life that I am again filled with admiration for Mishima's incredible philospohical and literary skills. The thing about Mishima, though, is that his protagonist will almost invariably be a young, introspective male - of course, this is a mirror image of Mishima himelf. I am reading &quot;Confessions of a Mask&quot;, his &quot;coming-out&quot; autobiography right now, and it brought me back to thinking about the &quot;Temple&quot;; &quot;Confessions&quot; was one of his earliest books and it certainly set the stage for a work like &quot;Temple&quot; to come. It's clear from the autobiography that the themes of beauty (in particular masculine beauty), death, and war are Mishima's obsessions. Of the four Mishima novels i've read (Sound of Waves, Thirst for Love, Spring Snow, and the TOFTGP), some of these themes are always present. In every novel, too, he is using a different approach to them; in the Golden Temple, there is a heightened awareness of sprirituality and beauty of divine origin, i.e. the Golden Temple itself, the object of the acolyte Mizoguchi's obsession, which progressively takes over his life. (&quot;Did I possess the Golden Temple, or was I possessed by it?&quot;)It is hard to imagine Mishima's characters - like the stuttering teenage acolyte Mizoguchi of The Temple, with his keen aestheticism or his crippled friend Kashiwagi with his brilliant philospophical insights - in real life, whether it be Japan or any other country. Mishima's works, even his autobiography, are all surreal in nature. The &quot;Temple&quot; very effectively built up such an aura around the actual Golden Templein Kyoto that when I later saw a picture of it (it has been rebuilt since its destruction described in the book) I was very disappointed by its real image. It is certainly a beautiful building, but to me is not mysterious or hypnotic like it is to Mizoguchi. It is not alive, and certainly doesn't look like it can manipulate the hearts and minds of people, as it did with Mizoguchi. In general, Mishima's works, as was he - seem otherworldly. If this appeals to you, then his books, and this one in particular, will be unforgettable. Mishima's gift for beautiful, descriptive prose and powerful analogies shines through Ivan Morris's excellent translation. If you have never read a Mishima book, and are looking forward to a hypnotic/intellectual journey, &quot;The Temple&quot; is a great book to start with.Also, the Everyman's Libraby edition is very good, with historical notes, an introduction by Donald Keene, thick paper and a built-in bookmark. Get it over the others."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Although Mishima is one of my favorite authors I am having difficulty getting through this work, largely because of the terminology the translator has used. An otherwise excellent translation is marred by an appalling lack of understanding of Buddhism. Throughout the text on finds terms such as \\"scripture\\", \\"priest\\", \\"parishioner\\", and \\"mass\\" -- as if the subject were Roman Catholicism. This kind of metaphor reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the practice of Buddhism, which is annoying to this reader and would be misleading to others."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"During WWII, Truman's military made the conscious act of not bombing Kyoto. During restoration, one of Japan's most revered temples was set ablaze by a young Japanese man, a stutterer in training to become a Zen priest. The novel is an exploration of this shocking event, a symbolic mourning of Japan's young people turning away from its own cultural roots(??). (Although many other subjects are touched on).Mishima, heralded as one of the great writers of Japan, committed public suicide during demonstration against American occupation. He was the &quot;John Updike&quot; of his generation I understand. His sharp criticism of Japan succumbing to Western values is evident in this book (the hospital-like order of the warfs where the U.S. Navy ships were docked).Mishima provides a satisfying complexity on some difficult subjects (e.g., what is beauty), the pyschology of a young person bent on destruction (shades of the Oaklahoma city bombing). Despite the dark subject matter, the novel is full of enjoyable, lively characters who seem to enter at just the right moments to breath fresh life into the sometimes heavy narrative. (Note the opening speach of the Kashiwagi, the club-footed friend with a refreshingly clear, unique pungent logic.)On the whole, Temple is deeply philosphical with startling twists and turns in observations, which kept me underlining passages. It is full of some of the best similies and analogies I've ever read. The &quot;off-kilter&quot; narration with deep self-questioning of motives reminded me a bit of Doesteovski's protragonist in Crime and Punishment.The ending seemed a bit abrupt, almost an easy out, but perhaps Mishima, who seems to have a gift for concise observation, didn't wish to over-explain. Every paragraph seemed to count, and I don't think I can look at a Zen temple the same way again."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"It is hard to tell whether Yukio Mishima's The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is meant to be a harsh criticism of Japan's superficial and self-interested modern society or rather one man's confession of a life long obsession with masochistic beauty. A sickly youth, a passive War-time experience and a longing for a beauty that can only be found in self destruction blurs the Narrator's voice and that of the author into one form. This novel can only be read and understood through allegory due to Mishima's everything-but-subtle writing style. In doing so, Mishima's poetic prose capture the full on collision between traditional and modern Japan during and after World War II. Over the course of the text, the reader follows the Narrator in horrific delight as traditional Japan dies a slow death as symbolized by the Golden Temple.As with many of his novels, Mishima insists on mourning beauty that has survived too long in the real world. When first confronted with the Golden Temple, the Narrator is shocked to find that the actual Temple pales in comparison to his personal vision of the perfection embodied by the Temple in his mind, \\"Then the Golden Temple, about which I had dreamed so much, displayed its entire form to me most disappointingly... The shadow was more beautiful than the building itself, \\" (24). For the Narrator, the Golden Temple symbolized all that is beautiful, precious and sacred in the world. Over time, the Temple in his mind became synonymous with the glory and beauty of Japan and its past. After his initial shock and disillusionment, Narrator comes to believe that the image of the Golden Temple which he held in his mind of was more beautiful than the actual Temple could ever be. It is only when faced with what seems like inevitable destruction that the Narrator is able to see beauty not only in the Golden Temple but also within himself.The Narrator's stuttering and his insistence on his own ugliness is brought out in his description of the reality of the dilapidated Temple. Before coming to the Golden Temple, the Narrator saw his ugliness, stuttering and suffering as a sign that there must exist somewhere in this world a thing such as perfection and beauty. This masochistic way to cope with a depraved world backfires when the Golden Temple falls short of the Narrator's mental image. With nothing beautiful nor perfect in this world, all is suffering and there is no hope for the Narrator's redemption nor a glimpse of beauty. In response, the Narrator's disillusion takes on yet another form when his life takes on a new purpose.Once he enters the priesthood, the Narrator soon comes to realize that maybe it is not the Temple that is ugly but rather that he has overestimated the world in which he lives, \\"It was quite natural that wars and unrest, piles of corpses and copious blood, should enrich the beauty of the Golden Temple. For this temple had been constructed by unrest... \\" (36). After realizing this, the Narrator starts to feel almost at one with the Golden Temple. Both are products of times of unrest and baseness. With the backdrop of World War II it no surprise that the Narrator's fascination with the Temple takes another masochistic form of beauty.In the face of utter and inevitable destruction, the Narrator feels that by burning to ash with the Golden Temple both can together attain true, eternal beauty. The only way them to become beautiful is to escape from the tangible world into the world of formlessness, \\"Indeed, if things continued as they were, the Golden Temple was sure to turn into ashes. Since this idea took root within me, the Golden Temple once again increased in tragic beauty... This beautiful building was before long going to be turned into ashes, I thought. As a result, my image of the Golden Temple gradually came to be superimposed on the real temple... [as] a symbol of the real world's evanescence, \\" (42,45). This dream of beauty is again dashed to pieces when indeed the Temple is not burned down during the war. Having both lived beyond their only chance for poetic destruction, both the Narrator and the Golden Temple seem cursed to die the slow death of all real and ugly things.If the Temple is seen as a symbol of traditional Japan, what idea is Mishima driving towards with this novel? What is meant when the Narrator chooses to burn the Temple down himself? In the end, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is a picture of Japan in the post-war era. A traditional culture, which only can be seen as beautiful in the midst of war and the baseness of human nature, lives on in a country that obsesses over its own uniqueness, ignorant of the suffering out of which their proud history was born. This is Mishima's Nihonjinron. Just as the Narrator masochistically attaches his good intentions to the Golden Temple only to be let down, so too is the nature of those who follow the illusion of Nihonjinron. Mishima leaves the reader with the intention to tear down all the symbols of the past which have outlived their stay in this world. Only then can the tragedy of the loss of culture and the end of history in the face of modernity truly be mourned for all of it's beauty."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Having only read Mishima's Sound of Waves prior to this, I was pleased to find the same beautiful writing with an edgier subject matter...I found this book particularly notable. The first person narrative (by Mizoguchi, in the novel) provides contrast, in that most people will note the logical fallacies in the narrators thinking and conclusions - and yet we are given those fallacies as fact, as Mizoguchi takes them to be fact. This results in a startling perspective, given without moral censure, which in itself is very interesting. There is never a time when Mishima implies that anything Mizoguchi does is \\"wrong\\", something which is done in most books by western authors. All conclusions on right and wrong are left to the reader, which is refreshing in a time and a country where right and wrong are increasingly dictated by outside authorities. This freedom is handled very deftly, although some people may find it disturbing. The last point I like about this book is that, while it is based around a Buddhist temple and many of the characters are from within that world, the religion is never preached - instead, it is more of a background, something taken for fact because of where the novel is set and who it is about. All in all, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion is a remarkable book, and I recommend it strongly to anyone who considers reading it."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"From all of mishima\`s work The Temple... is one of his most extraordinary works, his linguistic use to describe psicological extreme situations and the sense of beauty surrounding them and innate to their being, aquires here an epic touch. Here mishima focuses also on certain specific issues such as the relations between art, destruction, and death wich are treated in The sea of fertility too. if you wanna have a complete view of mishimas work, in my opinion its fundamental to read The Temple of the golden pavilion."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"THE TEMPLE OF THE GOLDEN PAVILION was a novel that had caught my eye when I first read its preview page. Even though it seemed to be just another book about a boy, who needs to follow in his father's footsteps, which was being a priest in this case, it turned out that this boy was not an ordinary adolescent. This boy,named Mizoguchi, is a stutterer and he decided to enter the famous temple in Kyoto, which was the Golden temple.When he was little, he would hear lovely stories, from his father, about what made this temple so unique from many other ones. Once he saw the temple himself, he developed a strong obsession to its beauty. Because of this, he couldn't live in peace there, and his dream was to destroy the temple by burning it down to ashes. Mizoguchi is a powerful character that I will never forget because of his behavior, which ignites hatred and disgust. I have sympathy for him though, since his personal experiences made me realize why he came to be who he was. So I encourage you to read this amazing novel by Yukio Mishima."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This novel greatly affected my life and the way I see things. Mishima's main character takes you into the depths of his mind and considers what it means to be himself, where he defines himself from, and how to break free from social norms. Every discription is a different way of looking at a situtation, and his language is colorful and complex, even in traslation. This novel is a must read for anyone interested in Japanese culture, and, for anyone who has ever asked themselves, &quot;Who am I?&quot;."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Disturbing, because The Temple delves deeply into the mind and motivations of a sick individual, making understandable if not nearly inevitable, his horrible destructive deed. The fact that the plot parallels the true story of the Temple of The Golden Pavilion's destruction (in 1950)makes the story all the more chilling and suspenseful. Ultimately,this novel will usher the thoughtful reader into areas of self reflection concerning the nature of beauty, unattainable perfection, and the harshness of life.Lovely, because Mashima is adroit at immersing the reader into a serene and beautiful world, even if it is one seen trough the eyes of a problematic individual. Several reviewers mentioned 'repetitive\\" or \\"heavy\\" - I think that most readers of Japanese writing will not find this so, rather The Temple Of The Golden Pavilion paints a picture of a whole life seen through the eyes of one person, so the perceptions are necessarily narrow. The story unfold through the eyes of an isolated, lonely and flawed young man, who despite his speech impediment has many privileges, and several opportunities to overcome his self doubt. This is not an uplifting book. Some of Mashima's other works are more of a joy to read; I definitely would not recommend this book as your first Japanese nor your first Mashima novel. Some suggestions: the sweet, hopeless love story with a hidden edge, Spring Snow, or the lyrical and poetic Sound Of The Waves."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"After reading and adoring a previous Mishima book (The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea) I eagerly bought and devoured this novel.This is based upon true events where a disgruntled and emotionally disturbed Zen acolyte burned down the temple he was studying at. This book explores his mindset and possible reasons for doing so.This is written in the first person so feel very immediate and direct and you are quickly drawn into the thoughts and feelings of the main character. Mishimas beautiful writing style is evident here, although I found this a harder read than the previously mentioned book as this fluctuates between the actual story and the inner dialogue of the acolyte. The inner dialogue, whilst giving a deeper insight into the character and his behaviour, felt very confused and convoluted at times, which may have been the intention as inner thoughts aren't often ordered or easy to understand.The story itself is shocking enough (especially as it's true) and the last twenty pages are where the real drama occurs, but it has a greater impact due to the build up to this point.This is a beautifully crafted book and whilst I enjoyed \`The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea' more, this is still one that will stay in my thoughts for some time to come and is one I will revisit at some point down the line. All in all this is well worth a look if you enjoyed his other works, but due to it's dark style it's not as easy to read as some of his other writing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This isn't my usual type of novel, and I probably will move on to other authors. An earlier reviewer commented on the similarities to Dostojevski, and in retrospect, I agree, especially when recalling a scene involving a non-Dostojevski book entitled nevertheless, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" near the end of the novel. The novel shares some similarities with that of FD. The book is serious and well written, and will have appeal to some readers. I recently toured Tokyo and the nearby temples at Kamakura. That trip enhanced this novel very much for me. I've much to learn about Japanese culture and Buddhism; reading this novel was an enjoyable step in that direction. That said, relative to my favorite tasty Western novels, for me, this represented a kind of bland oatmeal: it was sturdy and good, but somehow lacking. Another reviewer noted the Catholic projection of the translator onto elements of Buddhism; I too found this distracting in the translation."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"In 1950, a psychologically deranged acolyte burned down one of Japan's national treasures. Mishima enteres the mind of the perpetrator, crafting a fictional account of \\"How could anyone do something like this?\\" The story follows the antagonist, a physically ugly stuttering child, as he wages a mental war against beauty in general, and the Temple of the Golden Pavilion in specific.The greatness of the work is in how it shows, rather than tells. The narrator mispercieves people's reactions, misinterprets Zen parables, and sees the world in a very different light. As the reader, we are left to fill in the spaces ourselves. Despite cultural barriers, the translation is strong enough to allow us to fill in the blanks.In a sense, this could be called the predecessor to Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. Through deep research and interviewing, Yukio Mishima creates a psychological explanation of a major public crime. Mishima preceded Capote by several years, and could be credited with inventing the non-fiction novel.In all, this is a fantastic work. As acts of random violence and terrorism still remain unexplained, the novel finds itself remarkably timeless."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Yukio Mishima was to receive the Nobel Prize for literature the year he committed suicide. I feel he was one of the best writers of the 20th century and with over 40 stories, novels and plays its a wonder he isn't more known in the western world. \\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\" follows Mizoguchi, a poor, working monk stationed in Kyoto. Through his life he has come to see beauty in very few things, though he becomes enthralled at the site of the Golden temple. Being a boy, his father told him of it and so he built it in his mind as something amazing, something divine.I won't tell much of the story (you'll read the novel if you really want to know), but this novel is similar to many of Mishima's -- it deals with a character trapped between his culture and a forbidden taboo (this time it's arson and suicide, sometimes it's only a woman). Mishima's philosophy and introspection comes in to play in Mizoguchi's mind, and at times one feels like he or she is reading a philosophical text.And it is indeed hard to see what Mishima thought through all of this. Is Japan a violent, narcissistic country, caught up in it's own masochistic culture and suffocating its youth? Or is he saying that real human beings are not born, but bred?This is a novel, but is based on the actual burning of the temple in 1950 by a monk (though his name was not Mizoguchi). The historical connections have a part to play in post-war Japan, of course, but what's really worth experiences is Mishima's passion and his incredible gift to create extremely visual and visceral scenes that seem to vibrate poetically in the readers mind. This is one of the ten best novels I have ever read and should stand as a testament to anyone who doubts Mishima's brilliance."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Yukio Mishima was perhaps one of the more colourful individuals in Japanese literature, and one whose works have had enduring popularity. For this reason alone, his \\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\" is worth reading, even if it is not your normal taste in books.Using events in 1950, when the Golden Temple was deliberately torched, as a very basic foundation to his book, Mishima writes of Mizoguchi, a stuttering young man who becomes obsessed with the Golden Temple and beauty as a general concept. Seeing himself in world that he feels separated from, Mizoguchi is influenced by many characters through the story.The book is intensely reflective and told in the first person, which gives this reflective and speculative element a deeper punch. The internal journey of Mizoguchi is the mainstay of the book, and this also focuses on Mishima's own concerns.This novel is very deep, and can get pretty heavy at times, though this is sometimes counter-balanced by moments of true humour and tension, though rarely.\\"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\" is not everyone's cup of tea, so I would suggest giving it some thought before reading it. However, for something different and quite deep, it is a good book to provoke thought, and also introduce one to the thought of Yukio Mishima, himself a troubled and unusual man."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"The story of a misfit's revenge on the world he finds too cruel. The famous temple was burned to the ground by a young Japanese boy. Mishima creates a &quot;based on a true story&quot; novel of the event offering one plausible explanation to the question anyone would ask the boy: Why on earth did you do it? Mishima's skill in the creation of the central character is clearly demonstrated, allowing the reader to sympathize with his misery. A powerful story. Fans interested in a softer read will enjoy his teenage romance, The Sound of Waves."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This book affected me so much that I kept my mouth shut for a week (the amount of time it took me to complete the book). I couldn't eat, and I couldn't speak. Yukio Mishima's beautiful narrative paralyzed me the way the Golden Temple paralyzed Mizoguchi, the protagonist. A talented writer-philosopher, Mishima skillfully toyed with various aspects of beauty, fear, and faith, ultimately meltings them into one great encompassing theme that destroys the mystery behind what many of us lack: confidence. I strongly recommend this book to the artistically minded--especially those who has not found the courage to express themselves."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"I reckon The Temple of the Golden Pavilion to be one of the best novels of Mishima. This book is therefore quite something since Mishima in my opinion is one of the best writers of the 20th century. The protagonist is Mizoguchi a shy boy with a speaking problem(or has he problem speaking?). Mizoguchi is mentally and phisically overwhelmed by the building of the Golden Pavilion to such an extent, that it leads to disastrous consequences. If you want to read a great book by one of Japanese finest writers try this one."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"The Temple Of The Golden Pavilion is possibly Mishima's most famous novel. Strangely, it's also one of his least distinctive. It is very heavily influenced by Dostoevsky, much more than any other book Mishima wrote. Mishima even seems to imitate Dostoevsky's style at times. Even the names of the characters, even though they're Japanese, somehow seem to echo with the names of Verhovensky, Karamazov and Raskolnikov. Maybe it's just the number of syllables. Dostoevsky is also present in the book's way of ascribing great psychological significance to minor details, stating its main themes through philosophical disputes between characters, and constructing those characters to symbolize the different sides in those disputes. The destruction of the Golden Temple in Kyoto, like the murder of the elder Karamazov, is a philosophical problem more than a crime.The book's protagonist Mizoguchi is a stutterer, and he is also tempted by evil thoughts. Such things cannot be independent in a book of this sort. The protagonist is evil because he is a stutterer. His stutter alienates him from society, and turns him to evil thoughts. His outer ugliness causes his inner ugliness, which in turn seems to increase his outer ugliness all the more. Mishima dwells on the speech impediment beyond all measure, until it becomes a symbol.In a book of this sort, every action taken by the protagonist must be symbolic of something. He is given to internal monologue. Even his ostensibly irrational acts are laboriously pored over. Thus, when an American soldier orders him to abuse a prostitute, his compliance is not merely an act of violence or cowardice. It is also a symbol, a highly stylized way of expressing his alienation and demonstrating his love of evil. And his refusal to confess to his actions is nothing less than \\"experimenting with the single problem: 'Is evil possible?'\\" (88)The book's antagonist Kashiwagi works along the same lines. He is also ugly and deformed, and this also must necessarily be a symbol of his inner evil. When he takes any action, it's not to achieve the ostensible end of the action, but to make a philosophical point. For instance, he does not go the geisha district because he desires physical pleasure. His hedonism is intellectualized by the author into a deliberate philosophical statement. He does certain things because he is nihilistic and cruel, but his nihilism and his cruelty are the products of a conscious intellectual decision on his part. After he commits his evil acts, he is always happy to sit down and explain his motives in great detail, like Dostoevsky's Smerdyakov.And the good guy, Tsurukawa, is likewise not just a good guy and an optimist, but a symbol. His purpose is to \\"take [Mizoguchi's] feelings in his hand, turn them round and transmit them to the outside world\\" (57). Like every other action taken by anyone in the book, this has a philosophical consequence, namely that \\"there was no discrepancy between the very finest feeling in the world and the very worst; that their effect was the same; that no visible difference existed between murderous intent and feelings of deep compassion\\" (57).Do real people ever think or act like this? I don't know. Maybe. But there's something unsatisfying about it. This way of writing can create dramatic intensity, as in the case of Dostoevsky. This novel, too, creates a feeling of impending doom which hangs over the setting from beginning to end. But it also feels glib. Actions which are supposed to be irrational suddenly become pre-meditated, carefully explained, constructed, and justified. A poorly educated, stuttering country boy has the eloquence of a learned philosopher in his inner monologues. And his stutter, his lowly origins, and his ugly appearance are also of great intellectual significance. They strengthen his philosophical arguments even as they are not entirely consistent with the very fact that he is articulating them. Is he a character in a novel, or an abstraction? Mishima's evil is very stylized.To find a refutation to this way of writing, we might look at Mishima's own later works. In The Decay Of The Angel, Mishima's last novel, there is a narcissistic character much like Mizoguchi who feels compelled to intellectualize his every action. Like Mizoguchi, he is drawn to evil, and he records his evil thoughts in painstaking detail. But in that novel, he meets a very ignominious end. His self-awareness is revealed to be a shallow kind of self-delusion. His idea of evil is unfavourably compared to the genuinely irrational actions of Kiyoaki Matsugae, the protagonist of Mishima's greatest novel Spring Snow.We might also look at Mishima's own life, which ended with a spectacularly irrational act known as the Mishima Incident. Strangely enough, Mishima did absolutely nothing to explain or justify this act. His last novel, which he completed on the day of the Incident, reveals nothing about it. Mishima, unlike Kashiwagi, was not inclined to exhibitionistically describe his own motives. Doesn't that mean that the character of Kashiwagi is somehow inadequate for his intended purpose? Is it his extremely stylized, self-aware philosophizing that makes him inadequate?But if that's the case, then this book begins to look weak. It is so stylized that, if one removes the intellectual arguments, there really isn't much left. In fact, it really is kind of weak. Its saving grace is in the few truly irrational moments. The best of these occurs at the end of the second chapter, when Mizoguchi and Tsurukawa observe a parting ceremony between a military officer and a woman. Mishima was very good at coming up with such striking, sensuous images. The scene is extremely short, presented without any justification whatsoever. Mizoguchi is so transfixed by the sight that he forgoes his usual commentary about rejecting the world and so forth. The description is beautifully concise. Would that the whole book were like that."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"For those curious about Mishima's works, but who may have found other samples too daunting, this (along with Confessions of a Mask) is an excellent and comprehensible introduction to an extremely complex writer. In this sense, it may be compared to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, or Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, in that these works provide an entry to those authors' more dense pieces"},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This novel is based on a spectacular true crime. In 1950, a Zen priest, Hayashi, burned down Kinkaku, a beautiful sixteen century temple in Kyoto. The motives of the arsonist priest, like the motives of the student killers at Virginia Tech and Columbine, remain murky. Mishima turned Hayahsi into the fictional priest Mizoguchi in order to dive deeper into the thinking that would prompt such an act. His success is mixed.Mizoguchi sees himself as ugly and transient and sees the temple as beautiful and eternal. Just as thermodynamics is about lessening the physical gradients between objects, nihilism is an attempt to degrade the psychological distance between the nihilist's inner reality and the outer world that torments him. At first Mizoguchi defines his problem as finding the proper response to beauty, as personified by the Golden Temple; later, he's tormented by his growing distance from all that beauty promises in this world.Mizoguchi tells the story in the first person, and this challenges the author because Mizoguchi is graceless, inarticulate and resentful toward a world he can't fit into. His transactions with the Superior at the temple, his interactions with his friends Tsurukawa and Kashigawi and his intermittent, mostly impotent brushes with women are all refracted though Mizoguchi's distorted perspective. In fact, Mishima has to cheat and give this unsophisticated country boy the ability to bat around zen dialectics to explain himself and his actions. Mizoguchi's philosophical musings are the least convincing aspect of the novel.For the novel to work, whether or not we understand Mizoguchi, we at least have to feel sorry for him. For three quarters of the story he's neither interesting enough nor likable enough nor recognizably human enough to pity. In the last two chapters, though, as Mizoguchi makes his final preparations to destroy the temple, the book rises to another level, and we can feel compassion for him, mainly because we feel his painful, irrevocable turning away from any hope of a normal human existence.Some critics think this is Mishima's finest novel. I don't, partly because Mizoguchi's inner life is only partly believable, partly because the prose reflecting that inner life is often as clotted and plodding as Mizoguchi himself, partly because the inner lives of people who fold their arms and say no to life often aren't compelling. Although it's not an easy book to read, it's worth sticking with for the cumulative effect of the ending, and the complicated reactions Mizoguchi's final actions at the temple stir up in the reader.Even if the results are mixed in this book, Mishima was a great novelist. For a western reader, his Sea of Fertility tetralogy is perhaps a more interesting and compelling take on Japanese society."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This book reads like a diary. You get to find all about the main characters hopes, dreams, depressions, explicit thoughts and details. The translator did a damn good job! I was able to see myself in the character's body and world. Saw what he saw. Did what he did. And even though he eventually goes wrong within this downward spiral (read the book if you want to find out how), you understand him. Even if it seems so crazy, you understand because you feel like you're walking in his shoes. I liked it so much, I want to get the story in the original Japanese."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Mishima's beautiful introspective language and unique imagery kept me engaged in an unfolding tragedy. I find I disagree with almost all the other reviewers as to the meaning of this work. The young Mizoguchi finds he can not have sexual intercourse without the image of the Golden Pavilion dominating his consciousness. Mishima repeats the Zen koan \\"If you meet the Buddha in the road, kill him.\\" three times. He also provides long dreamy discourse on the beauty of the temple. Surely there is a connection between attachment to beauty and diversion from enlightenment. To some extent the acolyte mets the Buddha in the road and kills him when Mizoguchi burns the national treasure, the temple of the Golden Pavilion. My edition has an introduction by Nancy Wilson Ross where she interprets MIzoguchi's alienation as the result of nationlessness, an experience for post-war Japanese. Whereas extreme nationalism may have been a concern for Mishima, I did not detect this influence as a major contirbutor to Mizoguchi's alienation. In fact, his bare reality confrontive dismissive mother would be enough to shake any psyche. Other critics have pointed out that the theme is resentment of the object of desire. This rings more true but doesn't provide a strong enough theory to pull the entire narrative together. There are several amazing images in the book. The Japanese naval officer who formally meets with his mistress in a tea ceremony prior to his leaving for war is haunting and beautiful. The mistress pulls her breasts from her kimona and squeezes her milk into the tea, which is drunk by her lover as his farewell. What an amazing image of love's nourishment and the observation that intimacy between human beings is mediated by our body fluids. I also found the relationship between the Superior of the Temple and Mizoguchi to be interesting. The Superior's aloof attitude could also be interpreted as a mature recognition that we can not really mentor anyone without making our mark upon them. The Superior takes a hands off attitude toward Mizoguchi, allowing him to struggle toward some self realization. Yet, when the Superior realizes that a deep wound exists in Mizoguchi's soul, he responds by assuming a prostrate submissive humble posture during his garden meditations where he is sure Mizoguchi will see him. It is as if to say, \\"I bring no weapons against your evil, pass away from us.\\" Mizoguchi does pass, but not until he burns the temple."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"This novel is a good example of a theme that frequently arises in Mishima's work: the resentment of the object of desire. Mizoguchi, the protagonist, is overwhelmed by the beauty of the golden temple and learns to resent it through the guru-like counsel of a friend. Over and over, Mizoguchi feels overwhelmed and made insignificant by the beautiful things in his new life as a monk: the beautiful temple, sexual possibility, and ultimately, his autonomy, perhaps even his life. This book, arguably Mishima's best, may well have been another one of the author's suicide rehearsals, and the unforgettable psychological impact of the book is that of a legendary storyteller demonstrating his Hamlet-like &quot;north-by-northwest&quot; madness. Technically, this is an amazing book, dripping with evocative, beautiful imagery and reminds me of a movie in its directorial-like descriptive method, its forceful 'mis en scene'. Artistically, I suspect Mishima was trying to compete with his great literary forefather Kawabata by playing with western ideas of the apolonean, further fueling his hopelessness and his rage with his art and with himself, but that is a bit academic and beyond my ability to determine. Ultimately, I cherish this book for its tortured explanation of the harshness love and beauty cruelly impose, a feral scream quietly hidden in the drug-like beauty of a book."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Although I read this book several times before and wrote an analytical paper about it, I'll just say that it's an excellent book. Even if you end up hating it, you'll be glad you read it.If you can, read it in Japanese, or in the French translation which is much better than the English one. It is a pity that Keene didn't translate this work, probably Mishima's best.For those of you who have already read it: the Kinkakuji really does look as if it hovers in the air above the pond. Don't miss it if you happen to go to Kyoto. Another place (and very different sect) where you should go is Koyasan in winter."},{"Title":"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion","review":"Excellent book. I read it back in college, but I do not think that I fully appreciated it. This time around I could not put it down. The book combined a good plot with serious existential thought. If anything, it must be a commentary on the inner struggles of Mishima. Regardless, his desires and frustrations can be readily applied to everyday life. The long passages on the meaning of beauty the evanescense of human life were spectacular. However, I can only speculate how a school board might view this book in light of the events at Columbine. As grisly as it may be, it might give us insight into the thinking of the partcipants."},{"Title":"Murder and Underwear: working with the homeless in Chicago","review":"I'd heard about Murder and Underwear as part of a streaming radio broadcast from a famous Dutch news agency while taking my morning jog one fine day. I was so intrigued about the premise of Anika's book -- not to mention her title -- that I was immediately inspired to get my hands on a copy from her publisher.Reading it is was whole 'nother experience! I was shocked by the deftness with which Anika wielded the sardonic witty pen in the English language -- admittedly not her lingua franca -- and I found myself positively floored by the acrobatic savviness of her metaphors and the giggle-inducting descriptions she'd often used with such a smooth touch to get across the perfidy of what is the scourge of rampant homelessness in America. I was alarming to read Anika's accounts of loss and tragedy on the rough and tumble streets of Chicago in a democratic and so-called 'developed nation' which prides itself on being the bastion of plenty and the cradle of abundance. Murder and Underwear will make one want to run for the European EU Hills...or somewhere where there's at least a baseline of critical care for the citizenry. I can't imagine going into a hospital in the US and bleeding to death from an injury right there on the emergency room floor because I don't have my paperwork and insurance in order -- so much for the Hippocratic Oath!Anyways, Anika's tome isn't a bash-me-up against the ravages of the health system in the United States more than it's a poignant and heartfelt rendering of her several months' experience dealing with the uncanny, memorable, and captivating characters of Chicago's homeless 'community.'Murder and Underwear is a compact read, but worth its sticker price. While it doesn't neatly fall into any discernible genre, it's got my vote for mega-success written all over it strictly for the humanity of its expressiveness, and the immediacy of its urgent message.Murder and Underwear will read like a urgent plea for health-care reform -- certainly a hotbutton and pressing topic -- rather than some vitriolic diatribe or a pointless rant. For that reason, it's a wonderfully delightful pagetrurner that you'll want to share with both friends and loved ones. You'll thank your lucky stars you've got the disposable income to purchase this book when done.Look out for more of Anika's stuff...why this girl doesn't publish more, I don't know!...she's got talent spelled with a captial T."},{"Title":"Assessment in the Block: The Link to Instruction (Teaching in the Block)","review":"This book is excellent for those teachers who are tired of just giving test and quizzes.

Over 200 million copies of his novels were published. He mostly wrote about how the poor lived back between the 1860 to the start of the 1900s. He perfected the classic rag to riches story. Typically there was a young man down on his luck, who through luck and pluck was able to meet many challenges and end up triumphant in the end.\\"A Rolling Stone\\" is about a young man, Wren Winter, who came down from Maine to make his fortune in New York City, and to see the world. By having Wren move around Horatio Alger is able to show us many different parts of America. We see many parts of New York City, then Wren travels on a boat up a cannel in New York, he goes out to the Midwest, and to California. All along the way he has adventures.It is amazing how stories Horatio Alger wrote for children back in the late 1800s are now stored in the adult section of the library. The language is very rich; the vocabulary is much greater than the typical teenage novel these days.The only real problem with this Horatio Alger book is how racist it is. There are a number of derogatory comments about blacks, Chinese, and Indians.If you never read any Horatio Alger stories, it might be better to start with some of his other stories.

Similar to Royal Seduction (which I have mixed feelings about), Ms. Blake builds her heroine as an intelligent and compassionate yet skeptical person who is thrown into a wild dangerous adventure which ends up with the heroine demonstrating her ability to remain cool under pressure without giving up her dignity. Thankfully, this time around, I really fell for the hero (and applaud her for making him of mixed heritage). Ms. Blake balances out the cultural underpinnings without making it into such a intellectual discourse that my mind checks out. Ms. Blake adds details when necessary - from both protagonists' constant wardrobe change and constraints to how the fort was built and it being weak and adds qualities to her characters to build them like making the hero have a twin. It's all of these small things that add up to a great book. I hope to one day be such a great writer.

The French were some of the worst when it came to slavery and I find it offensive that she could ignore that huge fact. I mean, hello! Louisiana! Don't tell me that they didn't fight on the side of the Confederacy? But I guess any woman who reads for pleasure is only interested in being entertained, not in historical accuracy, right? That's why you pack &#34;history&#34; in with cookie-cutter romance and hope the average public-school-educated woman doesn't notice your fluffy-bunny version of what could have been a really great book. And, judging by the other comments, Jennifer Blake succeeded.As an American, I weep for the evident failing of our most basic education; as a person of mixed heritage, I lament a lost opportunity for the author to address another topic in what is, admittedly, a better writing style than I've had to endure from most romance novels (especially those I've found published solely on e-format). I debated between 2 stars and 1, but the writing really is sound & the story isn't so bad, but I find that just can't ignore the blind eye the writer turned toward the issue of slavery, or the description of the hero as going about shirtless (but wearing a swan's down cape) on a night cold enough to have a fire going (during the dinner party, when we first meet him)... I find it difficult to believe that the &#34;savages&#34; would have been stupid enough to go around without properly clothing themselves for the weather; that's something we see now (ie: short skirts and Uggs in the middle of winter)."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"Elise Laffont is only 25 years old, yet she is already a widow - and perfectly happy to be one! All of the bachelors around Fort Rosalie, and there are many as it is a military post, are positive that she cannot make her small holding in Louisiana Territory profitable without a man by her side. Yet Elise has nothing but disgust for men, her brutal husband having done nothing but hurt her, mock her and cause her trouble. Elise was proud of her small farm and had made a modest success, but she lost it all one morning when the Natchez attached Fort Rosalie and the outlying areas, killing or enslaving all of the French. Elise managed to escape into the forest and find a small group of survivors, but they knew they could not make it out of Natchez territory without being caught. When Reynaud Chavalier, a half-French, half-Natchez warrior, finds them, he offers to take them to Fort Natchitoches - if Elise will warm his bed at night. Nothing could be worse for Elise, yet the other French insist that they will not survive without him and Elise is forced to comply.Elise is determined to think Reynaud no better than her brute of a husband, yet when Reynaud sees the fear and panic in her eyes when he reaches for her that night, he is determined to make her want him as a woman. He insists that Elise touch him and pleasure herself. Elise uses these opportunities to tease Reynaud, but she slowly comes to trust him and to believe that all men are not like her dead husband. When they come to Reynaud's plantation, she is content to stay there, making love to Reynaud and living in a kind of paradise, untouched by the outside. However, this time of peace cannot last, for the French are coming to kill the Natchez for their uprising.When members of the Natchez tribe come to ask Reynaud, known as Hawk of the Night to them, to become the new war chief, Reynaud feels that he has a duty to his people to go, even though he fears that they will lose. At first Reynaud was going to let Elise continue on to the fort, but he finds that he cannot let her go. Elise does not go willingly, but has no chance to make a successful escape with all of the warriors watching her every move. She determines to make the best of it in the Natchez camp and befriends some of the Natchez women and offers what comfort she can to the French captives there. As Elise spends more time among the Natchez, she comes to see them for the people that they are - just like the French, full of strengths and weaknesses, cultural customs and taboos. She knows that she is in love with Reynaud, but what kind of future do they have with the French attacking the tribe from all sides?This was a very enjoyable romance that also had quite a bit of historical background to it (some of it fictionalized, of course). I liked Elise as a character, she was afraid, yet determined to be courageous and not afraid to change or to adapt to new situations. Reynaud was a gorgeous hero, tormented by not belonging to either people whose blood pulsed through his veins and not sure whose side he was really on. The supporting characters were also quite well developed and fun to get to know: Little Quail, the Natchez woman who befriended Elise and taught her the Natchez way of life, Pierre Broussard, Reynaud's trader friend who fell in love with Little Quail when he was a little boy, the Great Sun, Reynaud's twin brother who ruled the Natchez like a god, Tattooed Arm, Reynaud's mother who fell in love with a French man and bore him two sons, and many, many more. This is a tale full of love and tragedy and the relationships between the characters were very strong. Jennifer Blake really made the time period come alive and the pages just flew by. My only complaint is that Elise's feelings seemed to switch rather abruptly and Elise and Reynaud seemed to have the same doubts and arguments throughout the book without ever really finding any solutions or reconciling. Still, I think that most readers who are fans of historical romance will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"This book was one of the best I've read by Jennifer Blake. You really feel the plight of the Natchez indians without it feeling like a history lesson. You also come to understand the conflict the main male character, Reynaud, feels being half-French, half-Natchez in the midst of a war between the two. The heroine, Elise, is strong-willed but without excessive stubbornness. The beginning of this book starts of strong and the love story between the characters develops well. I thought the last part of the book could have been drawn out a bit more. Overall though, this book is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the \\"gentleness and thoughtfulness\\" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"Young & independent widow escapes the Natchez raid in her town along with 3 others. Half-Natchez French count Hero guides them to a safer location with the condition that heroine will be his mistress. Man-mistrusting heroine doesn't yield easily to him but Hero bides his time in letting her feel more comfortable in his presence. Their eventual affair hits a snag when heroine & her other cohorts realize that Hero was delaying them from their desired location. How will heroine trust Hero again?The romance was weaved in this 400-plus book but it was too long on historical detail. It was like a saga of the Natchez & French American squirmishes except it happened in a year's time. This book would've been better for me if it was cut in half because all that historical action rendition & other character relationships just got tedious. The main characters themselves were interesting when the book focused on them. Both Hero & heroine shared a lack of belonging & sense of isolation from their communities. Both were independent & made strong from their individual pasts. Hero resorted to deception & manipulation to soften stalwart heroine towards him. It did work until she found out what he was doing. Instead of groveling, he acted arrogant & even more controlling. As attracted as she was to him, heroine found the strength to leave him. She was independent & strong overall but there were moments when she acted clueless. She seemed oblivious to Hero's obvious affection towards her. Her rescue of Hero at the end was not believable. Someone of her unknown identity and a woman could not have swayed the high-official's decree to punish Hero who was well-known for his powerful influence over the Natchez tribe.Moderately recommended for the romance."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"I have to admit that I've really enjoyed reading Sourcebooks Casablanca Classics. I'm not usually one for romance books but 'My Love, My Enemy' and now 'Fierce Eden' have been great reads for me this month. Just goes to show you that covers can sometimes be misleading in regards to content. I thought this story was a great blend of romance, adventure, sexual tension, and historical information. I will own up to having fantasies (when I was younger and more naive) of wanting to be swept away by an Indian Chief who crackled with virility and smoldering hotness. Every time I watched 'Last of the Mohicans,' I would often catch myself sighing and dreaming of Unca (Daniel Day Lewis's Indian brother) coming to my rescue and saving me from the brutal British. But I digress....so anyway.....I found myself at many, many times with a huge grin on my face as I read the passionate love scenes between Elise and her half-breed Reynaurd. But the story isn't just about their romance, it's also about the history of Louisiana, the French, and the Indian tribes that lived there during the early 1700's. Jennifer Blake took a few historic occurrences and then wrote a story that firmly plants the reader into the past.Recommend? Yes..I would recommend this one especially for those readers that enjoy some great historical fiction with a tastefully written love story intertwined within the pages. There honestly isn't one cheesy thing going on here, it's not a Harlequin romance, or a book with just sex. Actually, the sex is fairly minimal and like I wrote above it's very well done. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon...not at all."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"I thought the characters in this story had no real depth and the story was a little slow and boring. It seemed like no matter what happened all they wanted was to have sex. That got old really fast. I was looking for a good story line and strong characters."},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"FIERCE EDEN by Jennifer Blake is a sweeping, vibrant historical tale of love, honor, betrayal and adventure.In 1729 Louisiana, long-simmering tension erupts into violence as the beleaguered Natchez Indians attack the French Fort Rosalie, destroying the fort and the surrounding farms and slaughtering the settlers.Widowed French landowner Elise, after suffering marriage with an abusive husband, has no wish to submit to any man. But in the chaos after the massacre, she must accept the attentions of the half-French Natchez prince, Reynaud, as the price for his protection of her and her little band of survivors.And so begins a far-ranging tale of culture clash and divided loyalties. Rich in in-depth historical detail and fast-paced action, Ms. Blake's superb novel sweeps you away into a vastly different time and place. Never dull, she draws you into the story of Elise's and Reynaud's increasing love for each other against the background of a world in violent transition.Fierce Eden immerses you in cultures far different from our own, but where human nature remains the same. Elise, while a woman of her time, is no passive victim. She fights against her fate, and fails and succeeds in turn. Reynaud, as both French and Natchez, is torn between two worlds and must make the wrenching decision of where to place his loyalties.I love Jennifer Blake. Her novels are exactly the kind of meaty read I adore. Ms. Blake wrote FIERCE EDEN in 1985 and the good news is--she's still writing. Even better, she still writes the same wonderful type of story. May she write for a long time to come, so we fans can enjoy her new novels along with her treasures of the past.Linda BancheARC provided by Sourcebooks"},{"Title":"Fierce Eden","review":"Elise Laffont and Reynaud Chavalier's trek through the forest to escape mayhem brings to mind the beginning of the Longfellow poem \\"Evangeline\\":\\"This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight...\\"Fierce Eden is a vicarious trip back in history with strong, resourceful, and, of course, flawed characters that are memorable. Their will to live, their determination to hold on to the culture they know, and their resilience is mindboggling--awesome reading.The Natchez Indian Uprising, after so many years of ill treatment by the French, sets in motion events that start gigantic changes in the social structure of Louisiana Territory in the early eighteenth century. Fierce Eden is spellbinding.Elise Laffont is a widow who has managed her property well since the death of her abusive husband, but her independent ways go against the grain of the many men who want her and her property. She's been able to meet and beat their challenges until the Natchez Indians attack, killing and burning. Hiding in the forest, with nothing but the clothes on her back, she makes necessary decisions to stay alive. Her back-story gives the reader revealing insight into her survival instincts, her intelligence, and her skill with people.The French-educated Reynaud Chavalier, half Natchez and half French, drives a hard bargain before he agrees to take Elise and other \\"on-the-run\\" French to a safe post. His own agenda puts him in danger, but he knows what he wants and is willing to take the risk. He seems to embody the best of both cultures in which he was reared. He is unquestionably a hero-though a somewhat flawed one. Even flawed, he is a lover that makes the heart race. To Elise who has suffered at the hands of every man she's ever known, Reynaud is unbelievable. The freedom of choice he gives her becomes an aphrodisiac to Elise--the love scenes sizzle.Elise and Reynaud's love story reaches far past the physical. It shows a love that is loyal, faithful, giving, and felt to the core. However, Fierce Eden is much more than just a love story. It plumbs the depth of the human condition, reveals every one of the Cardinal Sins, yet, shows the compassion and caring that some of the characters never lose even when all hope seems gone. It also showcases how history is made and cultures changed.Jennifer Blake, a master story teller, transports the reader to another time and place as she weaves together incredible descriptions of the environment, historical information, cultural differences, and a fantastic love story to create a tale that will be remembered long after the last page is read.

There are treasures to be found in their letters, their musings in the margins of books they read, articles they clipped. Even if their world was not our world, and would never resemble our world in any stretch of the imagination, the people who came before have left a rich legacy that many of us in the modern world should consider creating for those who'll follow us.It is in that spirit of human appreciation that one should approach the 23rd volume in the Women's Diaries and Letters of the South series. In it, Anne LeClercq mines years of family writings to show the world the extraordinary life of an ancestor whose diaries and letters show how one woman truly drank the essence of an amazing time in history.The book is a collection of diary entries spanning two decades of adventure and thousands of miles in travel. The editor is not only a family member but a university librarian skilled at combing materials for nuggets a larger audience would enjoy.Elizabeth Sinkler Coxe's life bridged the old and the new - the South before the Civil War and the world after, when northerners and southerners began to commingle, and when the Gilded Age and requisite Grand Tour allowed those of means to visit far off lands. Through the deft editing of LeClercq, we envision Constantinople at sunrise, ride deep into the Sudan, take tea in the shadow of the Sphinx and behold the Acropolis at Athens and Smyrna's harbor.On the surface, such diaries might be dismissed as dinosaurs from an age that has lost its relevance. However, as offerings of history, they let the characters - real ones, mind you - of the time speak for themselves.Coxe's diary isn't necessarily a book meant for a rainy-day read. It is easy to slip in and out of her travels. Indeed, it's often easy to get sidetracked in the copious footnotes that LeClercq uses to keep readers up to date on the family members.Summed up, this book is meant for historians, amateur or professional; unless the reader has a keen interest in the Gilded Age or Grand Tour life in general, it' probably a little obscure for a general audience.However, as part of a collection, this \\"modern\\" addition to the series that started as a 19th century look at women's lives is fun to have around. Coxe's language is vivid, and even if it takes a few days to absorb all of her stories, it's worth the trip for a historian looking to see how the other half lived."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife","review":"An autobiographical account of life keeping lights on the Maine coast, the author born in 1901 grew up in Lubec, Maine, married a man who went into the Lighthouse service, together they served at several light stations for decades: At Channel Light in Lubec Channel, at Avery Rock in Machias Bay, at Sequin Island at the mouth of the Kennebec River, at Dochet Island in the St. Croix River, and at the light in New Castle, N.H.

David Halberstam was one of the first outstanding journalists stationed in Saigon, who came down and covered operations in the Delta in the first years of the war. His writing is intense, and always unfailingly accurate. This story here was one of the early books written about the war, and was a \\"bible\\" for those of us who were there in the mid-sixties. I flew helicopters out of Vinh Long, just up the river from My Tho, and worked with the 7th ARVN Division quite a bit. I write up my exploits in the book OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, which is also listed on these Amazon.com pages. I was stationed with the 13th Aviation Battalion during the years of 1966-67; nothing had changed much from the accounts Halberstam writes of in ONE VERY HOT DAY. A collector's fine; I still need a copy!"},{"Title":"One very hot day","review":"I first read this novel in 1972, on recommendation from another veteran of the American military advisory effort in Vietnam. David Halberstam captured the essence of the military advisor's duty, and the ambivalent nature of the US Army's approach to it, perfectly. From my perspective, as one who performed the duty in less luxurious circumstances than those described in the novel, there were some substantive inaccuracies. However, the inaccuracies are irrelevant when compared to the story in its entirety. I can say that I knew men similar to each of the characters in the novel--both American and Vietnamese--and Halbertstam depicted them very, very well. For one who served in such circumstances, even 45 years ago, the novel can evoke emotional responses. For a reader who has experienced military advisory duty anywhere, there should be at least some instances of reminiscence. For other readers, especially for those who would like to grasp something of the Vietnam conflict diffrent from the current conventional wisdom, this is a worthwhile read...take it from someone who has been there."},{"Title":"Voorloper","review":"Voorloper (1980) is a standalone SF novel in the Forerunner universe. It is set on Voor, an agricultural world with a history of mysterious deaths. After fifty years of settlement, a hamlet in the north was wiped out by something since called Shadows. A couple of years later, another town was attacked. Then people in other villages disappeared until all northern hamlets were abandoned and everyone moved south.Only a very few survived the malicious incursions. In one town, only a five year old boy remained alive, but without any memories of his past. In another town, a four year old girl, two infants and a brain damaged women survived the mysterious attack. No other survivors were ever found.The Tangle covers a large area of Voor's northern plain. It consists of intertwined vegetation with large thorns and deadly properties. It acts as a natural distort, blanking radio and even vision. Aircraft that fly too low above it are brought down into the greenery and seldom recovered. Even blasters are useless against the vegetation.In this novel, Bart s'Lorn was the only survivor of Mungo Town. His father -- Mac Turley s'Ban -- was away from the hamlet at the time of the attack, but his mother was among the victims. Bart has been traveling as a voorloper every since his father came and recovered him. His earliest memory is of riding a gar with his father striding beside him.Illo is a survivor of the Shadow attack on Voor's Grove. She is even younger than Bart, but is a trained healer. She asks Bart's father for passage to the north and is given permission to accompany them.Mac s'Ban has been scouting the stricken towns in the north for many years. In the first two or three excursions, he wore a Survey exosuit to protect himself from any noxious substances or lifeforms. Later, he rummaged through the ruins in his normal clothes. Yet he never let Bart go with him into the deserted towns.In this story, a great storm strikes while they are far into the grassy plains. They free the gars and barricade themselves within the wagon. But the storm pushes the wagon across the plains and finally down into a gully.Mac is badly hurt in the final crash. Bart and Illo try to lay him out on the floor, but the wagon in tilted forward with loose cargo all over the place. Illo manages to straighten him out on a board and treats his wounds as best she can.Bart climbs out the front of the wagon over the raging stream that now fills the gully and clambers over the wagon to the rear entrance. He then works the large, heavy cargo crate back from the inside door and the two of them carry the board holding Mac up the bank to solid ground. While Illo continues to treat Mac, Bart climbs back down and takes everything whole and movable out of the wagon.Later that night, Mac tells Bart to take his body back to Mungo Town and then dies. Bart encases Mac in the Survey suit and seals it with glue from the cargo. Then he makes a sledge to carry the body on its way to Mungo Town.Eventually, three gar return and Bart hitches the sledge to the head bull. Then they start traveling toward the Tangle. They follow the Tangle north toward their destination.This tale takes Bart and Illo to Mungo town, where Bart leaves his father's body and discovers the bones of the inhabitants. There he becomes determined to solve the mystery of the Shadows. He goes with Illo as she ventures to Voor's Glade to find her own answers.The story is not among the author's major works. It reworks some scenes and episodes from other novels (seeThe Beast Master) and it forces the characters through their actions in a stilted manner. Still, the author has a way of enticing the reader into going back for more.

Small Terran settlements lay scattered to the south. People who tried to settle the northern part of the continent died horrible deaths from an unknown menace called the Shadow. Whole villages were slaughtered, with the exception of very young children.Young Bart s'Lorn is one of the children who survived a Shadow attack. His father rescued him from an otherwise dead town, and together they roam the plains, trading between settlements as Bart grows up. Unlike the other voorlopers, Bart's father occasionally ventures into the deserted Northern villages to see if he can uncover the secret of the doom that overtook the settlers.When a psychic healer hitches a ride north with Bart and his father, a great storm overtakes the travellers, and the young voorloper and his female companion must venture into the heart of the alien Shadow in order to fulfill a pledge given to Bart's dying father.\\"Voorloper\\" features Norton's usual cast of likeable, self-reliant young adults, who have to fight for their lives, and the lives of all of Voor's human settlers. Bart and the healer, Illo stumble upon the core of the ancient evil that taints their planet. An underground city built by the Forerunners, the mysterious beings who preceded humans into space, is the setting for an exciting climax. Norton often used the backdrop of a buried Forerunner installation in her science fiction novels, e.g. \\"Dark Piper\\" (1968) and \\"Sargasso of Space\\" (1955). However, Voor's Forerunners and their \`Little Shop of Horrors' is quite different from this author's usual run of ancient sentient beings.The only disappointment readers may experience is the lack of romance between the two main characters.

Unfortunately perhaps I long ago read parts of the Thompson biography of Frost the central theme of which was his inveterate cruelty to all those around him.All this has left me, you will excuse this, a bit 'cool toward Frost' and I personally prefer the more musical metrics of Wallace Stevens to the canny, often pithily wise lines of Frost."},{"Title":"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","review":"I was sadly very disappointted by this book.

Some of his works are undeniably for the ages. This volume is filled with the treasures Frost left to us.Works like &quot;The Tuft of Flowers,&quot; &quot;The Death of the Hired Man,&quot; &quot;Blueberries,&quot; &quot;The Road Not Taken,&quot; &quot;Fire and Ice,&quot; and &quot;Mending Wall&quot; (a poem that literally changed my life) are genuine contributions to world literature.A ton of Frost's poetry is to be found in this edition. I am struck by how consistent and sure he is in his poetry. This man was a great poet. I am not a big fan of reading plays. I'd rather see them interpreted by actors on a stage. I'm not going to lie and say Frost was a great playwright--he was not. But all the same, I am glad to have read the works contained in this volume.I must say that The Library of America's volume are all handsomely done and attractively presented.

Gluck author of \\"Life's Pages\\""},{"Title":"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","review":"Robert Frost is a unique American voice that many people love. A few reject him, but the majority of those whom he was writing for still love and admire his poetry. His fans always have favorites and can quote lines and whole poems from memory. When a poet gets into people's memories and hearts it is not a sure sign of greatness, but it is a good indicator of something special.In some ways his works have aged because they are about an America that has passed. One poem that I think catches a lot of the issues surround Frost is \\"The Literate Farmer and the Planet Venus\\". This piece is about the electrification of rural America and the strangeness of it all. It talks about the speeding up of life and wonders if the future will simply do away with beds because there won't be time to sleep. The poem is set in 1926, but was published in 1942 as part of \\"A Witness Tree\\". I don't know when it was written, but if it was written around the Second World War its nostalgia seems a bit more cynical to me (which I suspect to be the case). However, if it was written back in the late 1920s then it has more whimsy and an earnest wonder.This poet does have a capacity for irony and bite as well as humor and whimsy. His words are more conversational than lyric and that is fine. They have less music, but a great deal of color and subtle observation. It really doesn't matter what any critic says about Frost. He will outlast all of them. What matters is what he says to you. He is certainly a more worthwhile read than most of what gets published nowadays, just expect to have to deal with some words and references to an America from a century ago.This volume from the Library of America is terrific. The table of contents in the front refers to the whole volume. The Collected Poems is the reprint that takes up most of the book and has its own table of contents as well. There is also a chronology of Frost's life, notes on sources, and many very helpful notes that can help you understand certain references. There is an index of titles and first lines, and an index of prose titles.I always feel grateful to the Library of America whenever I get a chance to read their volumes. Heck, they are simply great to hold and flip through!"},{"Title":"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","review":"I took a class last semester on Robert Frost, and it was quite an experience. Frost was truly a wonderful poet who deserves every bit of praise he gets (and who is unfairly ignored in academia it seems). His words are so often true and lifechanging and beautiful and honest. Nobody is fully educated until they have read Frost's classics: \\"The Death of the Hired Man,\\" \\"Mending Wall,\\" \\"Birches,\\" \\"After Apple-Picking,\\" \\"Storm Fear,\\" \\"Meeting and Passing,\\" etc. There are so many good ones.The Library of America edition is a great way to be exposed to Frost's poetry. It's true that there are a lot of pretty bad poems since everything, good and bad, is included in the volume; the uncollected poems here were meant to stay uncollected. Nevertheless, that everything is here is really a great strength to the book. It's great being able to place a single poem in Frost's entire oevre. I also liked seeing how his command of the language and the forms of poetry. Seeing everything also helped to see how his conception of his role changed. Most importantly, I loved that Frost's prose and his plays were included here. There are a number of gems to be found there. I particularly enjoyed the \\"'Sermon' at the Rock Avenue Temple\\" and Frost's children's stories. The ability to read Frost's prose alongside his poetry really enhances the reading of both.Overall, Frost was a magnificant poet who cannot be given less than five stars, and by reading everything in this edition, one can certainly gain a greater appreciation of the poet at his finest."},{"Title":"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","review":"very pleased with this product that is nearly new and was shipped promptly and was was well packed so thanks"},{"Title":"Robert Frost: Collected Poems, Prose, and Plays (Library of America)","review":"Jay Parini's ROBERT FROST: A LIFE, 1999, may rehabilitate somewhat the view of Frost as terrible person, presented in Lawrence Thompson's earlier biography. See Parini, pp.452 ff. Some reviews may tend to discourage reading Frost, because of Thompson's jaundiced portrait.This wonderful, copious collection of Frost contains many of his best poems, which do not show up in popular anthologies. And his prose is filled with wit and wisdom you might not suspect. A great contribution to our Art and our humanity."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"This book will prove difficult or boring for many people, partly due to the vocabulary and partly due to the scope of background knowledge necessary to really enjoy it. The book parodies not only the prose of eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (as with the page-long sentence on the evils of verbosity) but also the political and philosophical movements of the time. Throw-away references to experimental physics, ecclesiastical history, etc. will probably lose everyone at some point. I'm sure I missed some (or a lot) of the jokes. As well, the authors are overly faithful to the voice of their narrators. If you don't have the background to catch the (often subtle) barbs, many passages will read as unleavened pedantry.In spite of that, I recommend this book for those with patience. Not as comedy, exactly - though it has hilarious moments, they're not that frequent. Instead, I'd place it more in the hazy area of the Princess Bride - a story superficially impossible to take seriously, but ultimately very serious indeed. Beneath the antics, there's a real message about human nature. The characters may be literally larger than life, but they are complex and compelling.Having a large vocabulary or a willingness to expand it rapidly will help. So will knowing something about nationalism and imperialism."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Eric Flint has become an established SF Author. However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in &quot;Joe's World&quot; is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading. Once read I was hooked into asking &quot;where is the rest of this story&quot;, this is quite normal for this style of writing and I await eagerly the next volume."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Forward the Mage (2002) is the second fantasy novel in the Joe's World series, followingThe Philosophical Strangler. This tale overlays the first volume, relating some events occurring between the departure of Greyboar and Ignace from Sundjhab and their meeting with Benvenuti in Sfinctr.In the previous volume, Ignace arranged an engagement for Greyboar to choke the King of the Sundjhab. The King taught the strangler much about philosophy, but Greyboar reluctantly strangled the man anyway. Greyboar and Ignace left town for a while to allow the queen time to cool down.Greyboar met Cat while he was away and invited her for a drink or three after returning to Sfinctr. Greyboar also met Benvenuti in the Sign of the Trough. Ignace hated him on sight. Benvenuti has an idea and would like Greyboar's assistance.Later, Greyboar learned that Benvenuti had been Gwendolyn's lover. He still pined for her and took out his sorrow by painting portraits of her in various states of dress. After an initial bit of confusion, they joined in adoration of Gwendolyn.In this novel, Benvenuti Sfondrati-Piccolomini is an artist, He is also very handsome and graceful; women fall in love with him at first sight. His uncles have trained him in art and survival.Zulkeh is a master sorcerer and a windbag. He also mistreat his dwarf apprentice.Shelyid is a very hairy and ugly dwarf with a pleasant voice. He is paid a shilling a month for taking care of Zulkeh and the household.Greyboar is a professional strangler. He is very tall and built like an ox. He is a member of the Guild of Stranglers and strictly follows their code of professional ethics. His weapons of choice are his hands. Greyboar likes to say that it is all in the thumbs.Gwendolyn is Greyboar's sister. She is built like her brother, but shorter and voluptuous. They grew up together, but parted when Greyboar left the slaughter house to become a strangler. Gwendolyn is an agitator for dwarf's rights and objects to Greyboar becoming a well paid thug.Ignace is an old friend of the siblings. He is short, red-headed and freckled and looks like a dwarf compared to Greyboar. He was rescued by Gwendolyn as a child and then grew up with Greyboar. He worked with Greyboar in the slaughter house and then left with him. Now he is Greyboar's agent and financial manager.Hildegard Laebmauntsforscynneweelds is the abbess of the Sisters of Tranquillity. She has a large storeroom at the abbey filled with notes to and from God.Wolfgang Laebmauntsforscynneweelds is a nephew of Hildegard. He is a madman by self-admission. He also owns the madhouse.Magrit is a witch. She had attended the same school as Zulkeh, but was expelled for seducing him.In this story, Benvenuti arrived in Goimr on the CSS Lucre, which the artist thinks should be renamed the Shipwreck-in-the-Making. The harbor does not impress him and neither does the port building. The only activity is occurring around the Great Grotum Northern. Eastern, Southern, Western, Central and Environs Express and Travel Company (a subsidiary of THE CONSORTIUM), hereafter called the GGNESWC&etc.;Benvenuti leaves his luggage in a locker and goes out the main archway. He steps aside to let a man hurry by. He is wearing the robes of a Goimr sorcerer and is followed by a large sack. Benvenuti looks closer and notice small legs under the sack.Benvenuti tries to warn the person carrying the sack of an obstacle, but is too late. The fallen sack reveal a dwarf, whom the sorcerer promptly berates. Benvenuti points out that the dwarf had said that he couldn't see, so the sorcerer should have warned him of the obstacle.The sorcerer turns red and then leaves the building with the dwarf and sack close behind. Then a black coach pulls up and multiple men get off and out of the vehicle. The coach has red painted letters stating GOIMR SECRET POLICE and in smaller print, Classified Information. Tell no one on pain of death.Benvenuti is the only person left standing in the plaza. So the police promptly seize him. He starts protesting his innocence and they gag him. Benvenuti is going to get a well deserved tongue-lashing from his Uncle Ludovigo.The secret police try to torture a confession out of Benvenuti. Thinks to the training of his uncles, he has iron-hard calluses an inch thick on his feet, so the lashes don't bother him But he screams and carries on and freely confesses everything that comes to mind. The secret police finally give up and report to the Chief Counselor that he seems to be innocent of the charges.Then they take Benvenuti to see the Chief Counselor. He gives the man a letter from the king inviting Benvenuti to Goimr and a letter of recommendation from the Director of Companies praising his artistic abilities. The Counselor is impressed, but admits that the king is not sane at the moment and is not seeing visitors.Benvenuti pries some money from the Chief Counselor and goes to look for a place to stay. He finds a temporary room is a rundown boarding house, but is up half the night fighting off the rats. First thing in the morning, he reclaims his luggage and goes out looking for someplace with fewer rodents.Rounding a corner, he sees a woman defending herself from a mob of cutthroats. She is picking them up and wringing their necks. After fighting down his artistic impulses, Benvenuti joins the battle. When the thugs are down to three opponents, he is stabbed with a poisoned knife.Benvenuti is out of the fight, but a giant of a man swats the last few thugs with a massive club and then takes Gwendolyn and Benvenuti into the catacombs. When Benvenuti awakes, Wolfgang is asking Gwendolyn about a message sent by Abbess Hildegard. Gwendolyn had been looking for Zulkeh to pass on the message, but hadn't been able to find him.Benvenuti remembers the sorcerer at the transportation terminal and mentions to Gwendolyn that Zulkeh had gone to Prygg. Wolfgang decides to go to Prygg to find Zulkeh and Gwendolyn is going to Mutt with news about the Rap Sheet. Benvenuti volunteers to accompany Gwendolyn, hoping for a portrait or two.Meanwhile, Zulkeh and Shelyid are traveling to Prygg on a GGNESWC&etc; coach. Zulkeh is pontifical and Shelyid is fascinated. They learn about highway men and THE CONSORTIUM rules. Zulkeh and Shelyid finally reach Prygg and meet Greyboar, Ignace and Magrit.This tale eventually brings these people and others together with a grudge against THE CONSORTIUM. The Grotum rebellion is drawing closer. Even the Ozar Senate is noticing the movement.This novel was published ten years ago. Flint has been busy during the past decade, but the Joe's World series needs a sequel. It is a unique mix of revolution, labor negotiations, lust, and low humor that demands the next installment.Highly recommended for Flint & Roach fans and anyone else who enjoys tales of armed conflict, master sorcerers, and artistic compulsions. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"This piece is a companion to THE PHILOSPHICAL STRANGLER. It is a sequel in that it was written after the original but the story line takes place before that of the original book. It is also a collaboration and differences can be seen.The biggest difference to me was the higher level of buffoonery. The characters seem less intelligent than in the original as they wander their way through this magical universe.The wandering in this story is on the part of two principal characters. One is the mage who was called in to interpret the dream of a king. The king goes mad right after hearing what the mage has to say and said mage embarks on a quest to find out who is trying to thwart him.The second wanderer is the artist, Benvenuti, from the original book. Since he was supposed to be hired by the mad king, he now has nothing better to do than wander around looking for the wizard who drove his patron mad. Eventually the two link up and set off on a greater quest.This story is not as interesting as the original nor are the characters as likeable. Still, it is an enjoyable read and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"I actually read this before I read \\"The Philosophical Strangler,\\" and I liked it more. This was probably the book that got me to realize I should start collecting Flint books.This was also the book that had me laughing out loud in the library. And again. And again. Perhaps it's because I have the background to appreciate it, as another reviewer mentioned, but the points of view are remarkably well done throughout the whole book and the various historical, social, etc references hilarious in context.I firmly believe that if you are a big fan of dry humor, meta-humor, and absurdist humor, this will be one of your favorite books."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"The authors (Eric Flint and Richard Roach) definitely had fun chronicling this book. The frequent changes of viewpoint are confusing at first, due to the very different biases each 'narrator' has, but once I figured that out, it became even more amusing. There is a lot of satire directed towards the modern-day American way of life - licensing agreements and privacy rights just being a couple of the gorings dealt out. A uniquely flavored novel and definitely not for everyone, but I found it well worth the hardback price."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Combining prequel and aspects of similarity withThe Philosophical Strangler, \\"Forward the Mage\\" is full of Rabelaisian nonsense that is certain to confuse and befuddle the average reader, who will likely then put down the book and exclaim \\"what nonsense! This is a terrible book! what is it even ABOUT!?!\\" and that is where their problem arises! The book really isn't ABOUT anything, outside of a loosely held overall plot about the Rap Sheet, that winds its way through the book like a single glinting thread of gold through a cliff of limestone being washed by the ocean. Why do books always have to be \\"about\\" something? Why not just sit back and enjoy the lunacy?The focus bounces back and forth between Zulkeh, sorcerer and pedant, and his apprentice, the dwarf Sheylid; and Benvenuti Sfondrati-Piccolomini, an artist, as he meets, travels with and falls in love with Gwendolyn Greyboard - THE Greyboar's sister, of whom we hear in \\"The Philosophical Strangler\\" and even meet there toward the end of that book. And, to make matters yet more entertaining, the book is purportedly written by a louse - yes, a humble louse! Living upon none other than Sheylid himself.As is obvious from the above, I rather liked the book. I think it will appeal to anyone with a good sense of nonsensical humour (those who enjoy Monty Python, Terry Pratchett, etc.) and who are willing to suspend reality to a fine breaking point and just have fun. Don't miss it, if I have just described you!"},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Like one reviewer mentioned below, this book is not for the squeamish. My friend and I got a kick out of it and we are both die-hard fantasy lovers (and not very old, either.) However, those to whom Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Princess Bride do not appeal completely may wish to avoid this book.That being said, this book contains what every good book does: truth. A whole lot of it. Without spoiling anything, the lunatic's advice to Benvenuti in the last line? \\"Things change.\\" How often does our modern society wish that things didn't change and get washed over by it?Along the same lines, verbosity is the bane of many readers, and yet the writers go at length to use it (so effectively, I think) to parody the notion itself.In store for dedicated readers are an uproarious Civil War (in the Dog House,a super-\\"socialist\\" city), the completely crazy wizard, and the very human and sane lunatic. (Don't ask me how they did it: the lunatic, Wolfgang, has better insight into the world than most so-called philosophical books do.)Great, great fun. My friend and I still stage Civil Wars every now and again. (We actually invented a form of government where every other state in the nation controls every state's affairs but its own, inspired by Forward the Mage)"},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Eric Flint and Richard Roach's Forward The Mage is fantasy writing at its best: an artist-swordsman faces an evil sorcerer, arrest, and politics when his artistic ambitions are rerouted in a struggle for survival. Both feature fast-paced action and complex, believable settings."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of \\"Dark and Stormy Night.\\" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized!

One of the other reviewers used the word \\"Execrable,\\" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti &amp; the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"When a powerful wizzard learns, to his surprise, that he has enemies, he accidentally destroys a kingdom and sets off in search of the one woman who can tell him who his enemies are. His voyage becomes a quest tied up in Ozar plans for world conquest, the world's greatest strangler, and God's eternal battle to rid himself of the Joe heresy forever. In a parallel adventure, an artist joins a revolutionary in a journey to love and the perfect anarchist state. Yet, even this perfect state is threatened by the power of the Ozar rap-sheet, and the wizard seems intent on protecting the power of the powerful rather than on their overthrow.Set in the same universe as Flint's THE PHILSOSOPHICAL STRANGLER, FORWARD THE MAGE combines adventure with humor. The wizard Zulkeh is as unlikely a hero as can be imagined with a combination of pedantic pseudo-scholarly language and abusive behavior. In contrast, the likely hero, artist and mercenary Benvenuti, never really gets into the story, providing a bit of romantic diversion. Still, authors Eric Flint and Richard Roach make it work. MAGE occasionally tries too hard, but often delivers a Terry Pratchet-like belly laugh.Flint and Roach slide a bit of the revolution into their novel, and offer some insights into basic liberties that will create a few grimaces from conservative readers, but they do so with good spirit. Clearly FORWARD THE MAGE has some political messages to deliver, but Flint and Roach manage to deliver them in the context of an amusing adventure."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"I usually like Flint and have read everything he published. This is the biggest single book and by far the worst. The book is supposed to be a comedic fantasy. Maybe it is. If you are looking for a book where everything is supposed to be funny and nothing is to be taken seriously, maybe this is your book, but I pitched it after 66 pages."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"Well I'm not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work."},{"Title":"Forward the Mage","review":"I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy.

The manual details the history and armaments of each aircraft as well as any weaknesses. The only problem I have with the book is that the diagrams of each aircraft are far too similar. If the planes were really made by competing manufacturers and countries, the designs would reflect that. Other than that, the book is fantastic for casual enjoyment or hardcore gameplay."},{"Title":"Crimson Skies: Aircraft Manual","review":"It should be noted that this book does not contain any information on the planes found in the video games (Crimson Skies (Jewel Case)andCrimson Skies). I bought it hoping to find schematics/profile views of those planes so that I could build an RC model. Unfortunately, this book is really only useful to fans of the miniatures game or those who are fans of the Crimson Skies universe in general. Still an interesting read, but I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Crimson Skies: Aircraft Manual","review":"This book nicely rounds out the 'Crimson Skies' series, but an actual fighter pilot should have been consulted -- in my case, my brother in the Marines. None of the aircraft depicted had good situational visibility, like the real-world P-51 Mustang. Worse yet, the large number of models is inconsistent with the series' premise of an America split into several countries, because of the enormous engineering manpower and production capital required for even a single plane. America's vast warplane production of WWII came nowhere near having this many different planes. A multi-countried America certainly could not."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"You are drawn in by the people and there various lives aboard a giant star ark The main characters are slowly drawn together to save whats left of mankind"},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.)

We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various \\"outsider\\" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain \\"outsider\\" males are physically abused by the \\"alpha males\\" of the group.

Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias.

Years later, when the distance finally becomes manageable, what is discovered is nothing short of pure utopia; a society unencumbered with politics, greed, and pride, living far more advanced in so many ways.Hogan has a firm grasp on science and provides interesting characterizations with equally compelling story lines.

It might be pulp fiction, but it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"This is a little-known but smart book that I would reccomend to any science fiction fan.In James P. Hogan's entertaining novel, humankind has settled a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri's primary star. The planet is called Chiron, after one of the few \\"good\\" centaurs in Greek mythology, and is settled by robots who use stored genetic information to create the first generation of human Chironians. Decades later, after a devastating world war, a newly fascist America sends a starship to claim its colony. Predictably, the Terrans and Chironians come into conflict.This book probably offers the best exploration of an anarchist society in science fiction since Ursula LeGuin's The Dispossessed. Although some reviewers have criticized Hogan's depiction of a noncapitalist society, they are clearly stuck in the old-fashioned mindset of communism versus capitalism and incapable of appreciating anything outside that paradigm. The description of the interaction between Terrans and Chironians is evocative of the early European explorers' accounts of Native America and Hogan's descriptions of the American's rationalizations for their encroachment on Chiron are reminiscient of some of the worst chapters of history as well eerily predictive of recent events. His account of the nonthinking aquiesence of some segments of the Terran population to the powermongering of the upper \\"echelons\\" is similarly spot-on.The book suffers from a large cast of characters, none of whom are really given a chance to develop although this is a criticism often applied to science fiction.Overall, an excellent book. It's influence can be seen in the popular computer game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"VOYAGE FROM YESTERYEAR depicts a libertarian utopia coming into contact with a sort of neo fascist, conservative American dream gone awry. Hogan sets up his premise with a fairly standard SF storyline, and uses this platform to explore this political drama. I was disappointed, however, because too little time was spent in this exploration. Instead, Hogan's story ends up as a fairly uninspired SF actioner with a wholly predictable ending. Still, entertaining if not engrossing. Somewhat reminiscent of L. Neil Smith's PALLAS."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it.

I loved it."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"September, 1999. Madison, WI. Voyage From Yesteryear is one of my favorite books. I've read at least 4 times and will read it again. Several things struck me after my last reading.The culture described is similar to the culture of open-source software programmers. This culture has been described by Eric Raymond (an open-source software guru) as a 'gift culture' as opposed to an 'exchange culture'. A gift culture is one where a person's worth is judged by how much he or she gives away. An exchange culture (the conventional Amerison/western economy) values a person by how much power and money he or she possesses. In a money economy it is easy to do bad things: just give them more money or power. Pimping, murder, politics, spying, down-sizing, advertising, etc. (All these professions would still exist, but much less.)After this last reading I recognized that Hogan is speculating on 2 cultural developments: 1. A society that didn't inherit all our hang-ups and conditioning. 2. A society with limitless energy and material resources.I share the doubt of another reader that the Chironian culture could function beyond some natural limit (200,000...2M ?) While goods may be be freely available to people, land will become a limited resource. What happens when all the Centauri planets are terraformed and filled up? They will need to invent a method to move huge numbers of people to other star systems.Each time I read Voyage from Yesteryear I speculate on how the Congreve and crew will manage when it returns to a shattered and hate-filled Earth. I try to 'think like a Chironian' and see the path. As yet, I'm still tripping over my American conditioning before I get very far. I shall keep on thinking, though."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"You are drawn in by the people and there various lives aboard a giant star ark The main characters are slowly drawn together to save whats left of mankind"},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"On the brink of nuclear war, Earth launches an Alpha Centauri probe that contains blueprints for DNA in digital form, hoping to start a human civilization that can escape the holocaust. Now, decades later, the New American Order (which sounds pretty fascist) sends the first mission from Earth to the new colony, only to find that its society is quite different from Earth's, and in some surprising ways. This is an excellent book, featuring some very imaginative hard SF concepts and far-reaching social commentary. In essence, it amounts to a libertarian manifesto, but in some ways Hogan goes farther than that. I have doubts about how workable his concept would be with a society numbering more than a few hundred thousand souls, but it certainly sounds attractive. Hogan's writing is expert, and his ear for the voice of the military grunts who are the focus of much of the book's action is unerring--kind of an interstellar MASH or Catch-22, if you take my meaning. This is one that I really didn't want to end."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"This is a novel well worth reading because it makes you think. As always, Hogan is trying to think outside the box, and he tries to make the reader to do the same. In that, he succeeds in this very worthwhile novel.The time is the late 21st century. There has been a third world war, and America and the world has more or less recovered from the aftermath. But America is transformed into a near-fascist state. There are hints that the Asians are practicing liberal democracy and that the Europeans are more or less junior rivals to America.The novel involves a race by the three powers (America, Europe, and Asia) to re-establish contact with a colony established on Alpha Centauri's main planet--the colony had been jointly established prior to the war. The Americans arrive first, and the clash between the Americans and the colonists is the central theme of the book.The main notion of the book is that people and nations carry their prejudices from generation to generation, and that it may take some form of \\"fresh start\\" to eliminate these prejudices. Hogan notes that America represented such a fresh start when it was founded, and Americans have shaken off much in the way of class structure and other undesireable components of European culture. Likewise, in his novel, the colonists have made a \\"fresh start,\\" and have abolished racial prejudice (or even racial awareness), as well as any concept of a market economy or of the anglo-saxon justice system.Hogan's basic premise makes sense--that a fresh start such as took place in America might help eradicate ancient prejudices. As he writes elsewhere, if we could somehow get one generation of the folks in Northern Ireland away from their parent's prejudices, this ancient quarrel would doubtless end for all time.Unfortunately, some of Hogan's speculation fails to hold water. His replacement for a justice system is having people shoot bad guys out of hand. Only trouble with this is that it is exactly what people used to do a couple of centuries ago. This caused feuding and an endless cycle of family reprisals. So we invented courts. Here, Hogan has us going backwards, candidly probably due to his lack of historical knowledge in this regards. Similarly, Hogan postulates that the Centaurian colonists would abandone money and a market system because everyone would work their fair share and take their fair share--the notion is that productivity is so high with modern technology that there is no need to ration resources. Nonsense, as the fall of socialism/communism has shown. Human greed is limitless and there will always be a need to somehow ration labor and resources. Here, Hogan makes a nice try that falls flat. These are not major quibbles, by the way.As a novel, Voyage From Yesteryear is so-so. The characters are not well developed, the storyline is murky, and the book rambles. In one sense you always know where it is going--a clash between the Americans and the colonists. But other than this broad theme, the book rambles erratically. You might think that these flaws render the book mediocre. That is not true. This novel's strengths are its ideas and speculations about both science and human societies. It is quite readable and does constitute a good read.This is an interesting book with interesting ideas and speculation. It is well worth reading whether or not you agree with all of Hogan's speculation. This one gets 4 stars. That ain't bad."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"I find this book a great story, easy to read, diffiuclt to put out.Of course, there are some flaws, technology moved since the book's been written, but the story does not suffer from that!I've read it several times and still come back to it from time to time.The author's beliefs in evolution and mentioned ani-God bias may tweak the noses of some (mine too a bit) but let us be honest - that's how many people see &quot;The Institutions&quot; ot the state and the church. And the ideal society of Chironians - ;-) ... it is good to see that some people still believe we humans can escape from our &quot;bad nature&quot;"},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"One of the foundations of SF is examining the consequences of science and technology on society. Here Hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies - those of Earth founded on limited resources and those of the newly colonized planet Chrion having unlimited resources. You won't find deep character development in this book, the focus is on the effects of technology on society - what we can become. Telling the story from the viewpoint of solders on the second colonization starship traveling and landing on the planet Chrion, Hogan explores his vision of what humanity can be. Chrionians value and trade respect, possessions are in abundence and free from automated factories. On the second colonization starship traveling from a militarized Earth, imagine the consequences to those powers to be when character matters! Unlimited resources you ask? Hogan postulates, the mind is a unlimited resource."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"This story is about what could be built in the future if only we put away our old ideas. Our ideas about money, physics, government, military force and the nature of mankind. A fan of James P. Hogan knows what I am talking about. This book would also be good for fans of Robert A. Heinlein, L. Neil Smith or even L. E. Modesitt, Jr. Great ending that I didn't see coming the first time I red it. Almost wish there was a sequel!"},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"I loved this book, and have read it many times. I especially love the quasi-utopian society it depicts. I really think that a society like that could work, at least in basic principal. The Chironians are all very decent, logical, interesting people. I do think their habit of always carrying guns, and being very free in their use of them, although only for self-defense, is a bit troubling. That would be something that would definitely require a major change in the characters of our society's individuals. But that, along with the idea of trading in respect, rather than money (as long as their are sufficient commodities to satisy everyone--and that too would take some modifications in character, which would require teaching people through media and education), I think could and would be a very good thing."},{"Title":"Voyage from yesteryear","review":"One of my favorite books. Have read it at least 4 times. Wish I had never sold my Sci-Fi book club edition; because now I will have to pay more to get a new copy. This book along with The Healer (F.

( Foxconn, the Apple manufacturing plant in China will be installing one million robots in 2013.)In that society, capitalism is long gone and is both unnecessary, unworkable and unwanted.Yes there is quite a bit of militaristic brutality and exhibitions of immorality and imperialism so as to villify the bad guys but it all goes together quite nicely and I thought the surprise at the end was just perfect.Not for Ayn Rand fans."},{"Title":"Multiple Choice & Free-Response Questions in Preparation for the AP Calculus (AB) Examination / Student's Solutions Manual: Eighth Edition","review":"The problems workbook itself is very useful.

These foldouts include a detailed cut-away view showing the interior layout of the vessel, additional descriptive views, sail plans (if applicable), actual photos (if the subject is still extant), and an excellent descriptive blurb. All details on the cut-away are numbered and indexed to a list of features. The historical range is from classical Rome to the modern age and includes primarily western warships. The ships described are as follows: Roman Trireme, Viking Longship, Royal Galley, Spanish Galleon, Vasa, Sovereign of the Seas, Victory, Santissima Trinidad, Constitution, Merrimac, Gloire, Warrior, Devastation, Andrea Doria, Maine, Holland VI, Guiseppi Garibaldi, Dreadnought, U9, Leonardo da Vinci, Queen Elizabeth, De Ruyter, Enterprise, Scharnhorst, Cossack, Tirpitz, Yamato, PT109, Iowa, Nautilus, Long Beach, Nimitz, Kirov, Ohio, Guiseppe Garbaldi, and Zeeleeuw. It is a good overall selection of vessels typical of their classes; ranging from surface ships of the line, lighter patrol vessels, carriers, and submarines.I only have two small complaints. First of all, why did they choose to include the Merrimac (Virginia) and not the revolutionary Monitor? Also, the contribution of Italy seems to be a bit too heavily represented, but this may be because the book itself appears to have been produced in Italy.This is a hard cover volume with an internal spiral binding."},{"Title":"The Gatefold Book of the World's Greatest Warships","review":"This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a \\"Nimitz\\"-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a \\"great\\" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book."},{"Title":"Wings Above the Diamantina","review":"This is but yet another Grand Slam for Arthur Upfield. His numerous Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte mysteries are each a joy to the mystery reader, especially for those who particularly savor the works of Christie, Tey, Sayers, Rinehart, and Ellery Queen.Here the half-caste inspector (he's half Aborigine, half Caucasian) is called in to investigate a small (and stolen) plane that has landed in the Australian Outback with one passenger, a young lady who was apparently comatose when it landed! But the plot thickens as this gal's condition continues to deteriorate and \\"Bony\\" (as all his friends call him) is working against time to save her life.A drunken physician, a suspicious foreman, two indigenous farm hands, and many other colorful characters serve to heighten the reader's delight in this suspenseful tale. And it's not a spoiler to all Upfield fans to know in advance that Bony always solves his cases.This entry is at least as good asMurder Down Under. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wings Above the Diamantina","review":"First published in 1936, Wings above the Diamantina is a feast of daring skullduggery, bizarre Outback weather and exotic Aboriginal folkways.Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (Bony) is sent out to the Coolibah homestead to investigate an astonishing occurrence. A little red monoplane, stolen from the flying circus, was found in a dry lake with a young woman strapped inside. She appears to be asleep but, in fact, a strange paralysis has gripped her. Only a subtle gleam in her eyes reveals that her mind is still functioning.It soon becomes clear that the aeroplane was meant to go up in flames, and the young lady with it. Her survival is a kind of aerodynamic miracle, and as long as she lives, she's in grave danger.Bony is the best detective in Australia, a half-caste with talents drawn from both the white race and the Aboriginal. But he'll also draw on the talents of others to overcome the obstacles in this case. The young woman's identity is a mystery, as is her condition. There are no tracks by the plane. And he'll have to subdue the racial prejudices of everyone around him to get the cooperation he needs.At every turn, freakish weather slows down the investigation, but floods, storms and sand clouds are thrillingly described. Upfield rewards the reader not just with a perplexing mystery, but also with amazing verbal snapshots of the weird weather and cruelly beautiful landscapes of the Outback.There's a fascinating cast of characters, including quirky lawmen, a drunken flying doctor, giant pet lizards, a resourceful villain, a loveable old Aborigine chief, and a dauntless pair of Aborigine trackers.Upfield's work is an endangered species, fast going out of print. Won't some enlightened publisher please, please reprint all the fabulous Bony mysteries? In absence of that, I'd advise vintage mystery lovers to grab up all the Upfield novels they can find. This is a great one."},{"Title":"Wings Above the Diamantina","review":"Before Tony Hillerman's justly popular Native American police officers, we had Arthur W. Upfield's (1888-1964) \\"Bony\\", the \\"half-caste\\" genius of the Australian police force. Never has he failed successfully to wrap up a case, almost always he has earned the respect of the \\"white\\" Australians, other than the criminals, who have been involved. These books are all well-written, with interesting backgrounds, and adequate plots within which Bony\\" can strut his stuff. It is a series dated in no respect, except, perhaps, in the attitudes displayed by some of his antagonists and, even, law-abiding citizens of the day. I can commend the whole series to any reader, of mysteries or other genres of light fiction, for its characters and ambiance.This is a 1936 entry in the series, requiring our master detective not only to find the thieves of an airplane but also the perpetrators of some type of assault upon an innocent young woman found paralyzed in the plane. It is possible that the average reader may unravel the puzzle of what ails the woman as her physicians cannot, but it makes no difference to one's involvement with the story and its characters. As usual, the nature of life in parts of Australia more than 70 years ago shares the spotlight with the featured and supporting players and the plot. i think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Wings Above the Diamantina","review":"If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one.

All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"This was my first foray into this world, a wonderful world of humble, faithful and consistent people of God. This is an appealing start for people such as me as each chapter has an illuminating bit of background about the original translators of the individual works. The wisdom and godliness of the individual men and women is an excellent example and challenge for us.However, the general introduction, as well as some of the chapters' introductory remarks, assume a knowledge of antiquarian works that won't be common, and is often pedantic.Overall, this book inspired me to learn more about the men and women shown, and I heartily commend this book to those interested in the true beginnings of Christian spirituality, and has much to give."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"Sayings of the early Christian monastics and stories of their lives of austerity and prayer in the Egyptian deserts have appeared as &quot;flavoring&quot; in books like Norris' Cloister Walk. This sturdy volume gathers up many of these tales and wisdom teachings in a clean, readable translation that also sports an encellent introduction which frames and contextualizes this ancient part of our Christian heritage. Waddell calls her book &quot;a case book of spiritual direction, ironic and wise&quot; (p 24), and indeed it can encourage and inspire the reader today. The abbess Matrona could be speaking to our modern urges and contradictions when she says, &quot;It is better to have many about thee, and to live the solitary life in thy will, than to be alone, and the desire of thy mind be with the crowd&quot; (page 72). If other stories strike the modern ear more harshly (&quot;The abbot Arsenius said, &quot;It sufficeth a monk if he sleep for one hour: that is, if he be a fighter&quot; [p. 74]), they still provide the modern reader with the traditions and cultures that developed shortly after the Christian gospels were written. These stories also formed the backdrop for the moderation and carefulness of St. Benedict's Rule--still being followed by monastic orders like the Benedictines and Trappists today."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"Intrigued by the listing title with its statement that it comprises &quot;Translations from the Latin&quot; I ordered this book only to find that save for the first selection from St. Jerome (originally written in Latin) all of the selections are indeed translations from the Latin but the Latin translations from which Waddell translates are translations of other authors from the original Greek. The Desert Fathers are much more appropriately presented by Faber &amp; Faber in their series of volumes entitled Philokalia which comes in a three or four volume paperback edition and a one volume abridgement and is translated to English directly from the original Greek. I believe."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"Richard Foster (author of The Spirit of Disciplines and other contemporary Christian works) recommends that for every contemporary Christian book you read it is important to read another one more than at least 400 hundred years old. One way to access such older Christian worlds is through the Vintage Spiritual Classics series that makes classical Christian works accessible to believers who often haven't read anything written prior to currently-living Evangelical writers.This is arguably a good introduction to the thoughts and beliefs of early Christian monastics, both male and female. This is a period all Christians should study since it reflects the origins of most early Christian theology and practice derived from men and women who were sometimes just a generation or two removed from the Apostles. It helps Christians get in touch with their spiritual roots and offset some of the spiritual nonsense that occupies much of the shelf space in most Christian bookstores.However, I found this relatively thin (221 page) book a disappointment. First, although it's a first edition for this publisher in 1998, it's actually a reproduction of work translated by a woman who died in 1965 at the age of 76, so who knows when it was actually prepared. Then, it's a translation of source documents for the stories and sayings, but they're sometimes less than easy to follow or \\"pithy\\" in this format. One really needs to dig for the most compelling and enlightening material. There are a number of more contemporary, extensive and more usefully translated books on the Desert Fathers, a number of which are listed in this book's two-page \\"Suggestions for Further Reading\\", virtually all of which post-date by 10-20 years this book itself.I suggest consulting Orthodox Christian WEB sites and publishers for good summaries, explanations and references for the philosophy, beliefs and practices of the Desert Fathers since the Orthodox denominations are arguably the Desert Fathers' direct descendents in today's world."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"These earliest of monks take Christ's admonition &quot;to sell everything and follow Him&quot; to heart. With deep austerity, and prayer they follow a path utterly dedicated to a spiritual life. Despite their austerity, there are at times a surprising expressions of personality, and even community among the solitaire cells and companionship of the monks. There are stories of hermits with lions as companions, of sustainment of a few herbs or palm leaves, of them helping thieves stealing from them, or selling Gospels to help the poor. However these monks are humble in their faith, and a lesson often repeated in these stories is humility and compassion for temptations that they themselves feel. The temptations of women, and even a monks' expression of Pelagia &quot;the harlots&quot; beauty was surprisingly sensuous. It may seem impossible for us to be isolated like this, but we can quest for solitude as abbot Antony said &quot;Who sits in solitude escapes from three wars: hearing, speaking, seeing&quot;"},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"Some thirty years ago I received the Benedictine habit in the Abbey of Saint Pierre in Solesmes, France. My Prior at that time was the Reverend Father Dom Lucien Regnault. Anyone interested in the Desert Fathers would do better to go to the Solesmes homesite and search their \\"librarie\\" (bookstore) for the works of Dom Regnault which are unsurpassed for scholarship and spiritual orthodoxy. Dom Regnault's several works in this field (or, rather, desert) are beyond compare, and tragically many are now out-of-print. I cherish mine very much.This present volume comes through the Vintage Spiritual Classics series. Catholic readers should know this as a section of Random House (who first brought us under Bennet Cerf the greatest novel of our time: Ulysses by James Joyce) and while it is a very excellent and popular printing house (along with its colophon) it is not a Catholic Press and bears no ecclesial authority. This is one reason why you find the poor to luke warm reviews presented here. This is not their field of expertise. We can come little closer than the fine work of Dom Regnault.Of course those in the know realize the Father Basil Pennington is a well respected author and member of the heroic Trappist Monastery in Spencer, Massachusetts. His spiritual works are well known and appreciated as rich soil for meditation. I have met him personally as well, of course as I have also Dom Regnault, although not as constantly as the very humble yet magnificent and valient Dom Regnault. Yet, even so, I find Dom Regnault's works an unlimited and eternal jewel, and have often meditated them through translation into English.Notice well that Father Pennington does the Preface alone to this book and not the heavy lifting. Also notice the cover represents a community of monks from after the 1400's (when did Trappists wear an old white habit? Or is this the Carthusians, even later? or \\"white\\" Benedictines, even? no indication given in the book aside from a general source of religious illustrations). The cover does not display the mighty anchorites out alone in the Egyptian desert who wrote these apophthegmes a thousand years earlier. Enough said. Believe me, I was mistaken when I automatically gave this five stars. Read your Regnault.I urge you to find his out-of-print works here in the mighty amazon, or anywhere you can. It is very easy to order what is still in print from Solesmes, and they are very good about shipping and payment. They are after all Benedictines of the highest order.Vintage Spiritual series meanwhile, is not a Catholic house and its work must be viewed as a popularization rather than a sacrament of the Living Word. The reviewer below who noted the probable age when Ms Waddell wrote this is correct. More recent work abounds. Especially, dare I say, Dom Regnault."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"The Desert Fathers is an interesting insight into how the Desert Fathers lived their lives and practiced their faith. The preface written by M. Basil Pennington makes an interesting observation that John the Baptist might have been influenced by the Essene/Qumranite community that was in that region of Palestine. John's behavior may seem bizarre to the modern-day reader, but the Essenes were already practicing similar behavior in their desert asceticism, and John was revered as a holy man (Waddell, xxv).Waddell's translation can be difficult to understand at times, but overall the book is interesting and insightful, and at points bizarre and unsettling. For example, St. Jerome's account of the hermit Antony's encounter with a hippocentaur and a faun/satyrs is extremely peculiar. Jerome even claims that a faun/satyrs was captured alive and brought to Alexandria during the reign of Constantius. The creature was either killed, or just died, and its remains were then preserved in salt (Waddell, 37-38). Furthermore, Jerome states that lions came and dug the grave for the hermit St. Paul (Waddell, 42). These reports are extremely difficult for the modern-day reader to accept as being historically accurate, and the reader is left wondering if this account is meant to be allegory, and not an actual historical account.However, it is interesting to read how the monks had some competitiveness among themselves, and of Jerome's love of classical works (Waddell, 45-46). There are several accounts of monks being well educated and possessing codices of Scripture. The monk Gelasius had a \\"codex in parchment worth eighteen solidi\\" (Waddell, 125-127). The monk Arsenius is described as a \\"great scholar\\" of Latin and Greek (Waddell, 122).Even though there was infighting among some of the monks, it appears that the majority of the Desert Fathers, in their solitary lives, showed great compassion and concern for one another:If by chance any one is missing in that gathering, straightway they understand that he has been detained by some unevenness of his body and they all go to visit him, not indeed all of them together but at different times, and each carrying with him whatever he may have by him at home that might seem grateful to the sick. (Waddell, 58)There kindness to each other and those in need is commendable.Racism seems to have always been with us. Pelagius wrote of the monk Moses \\"the \`long black man' who was converted from among the robbers, and was liable to gibes about his colour\\" (Waddell 65). This same desert abbott Moses was humble, but so revered that a provincial judge sought to meet with him (Waddell, 99).The desert monks' lives were lives of fasting, and it appears from the writings that since fasting was such a huge part of their lives they developed a fixation on food. Many of the stories relate to how they often only ate very small portions of food, and frequently that was mere bread and salt. One story relates how an old ailing monk, at the urging of the his fellow monk, ate some cake in hopes of aiding in his recovery, but the cake was accidently spread with linseed oil instead of honey--which likely killed the old monk. The underlying, and untold, moral is that such an indulgence deserved punishment (Waddell, 142).Woman, too, are a source of temptation for the monks. There are several stories about the monks' struggles with lust. One young monk who refused to be tempted by women went on a journey with his mother, and wrapped his hands in his cloak to prevent from touching his own mother's hands--for fear of lust, \\"Because the body of a woman is fire. And even from my touching thee, came the memory of other women into my soul\\" (Waddell 79). There are also some more fanciful accounts of desert monks being tempted by women. In another account, the temptress actually dies and the monk raises her from the dead to live a new chaste life (Waddell 86-87). This same theme is found at the end of the book in the story of The Life of St. Mary the Harlot (Waddell 199-209). However, there are also accounts of pious women who also lived the desert life (Waddell, 131, 138).The life of the dessert monk was one of denial and sacrifice, but also compassion and love for others. This interesting book gives the reader a glimpse into the lives of this devoted men and women."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"I agree with the review of C. Ryan: \\"One really needs to dig for the most compelling and enlightening material.\\"It's an okay read, but probably has more to offer the historian looking for tidbits of insight into the day-to-day lives of the desert fathers, than it does the spiritual seeker hoping to find a spiritual snack."},{"Title":"The desert fathers","review":"This book is an OK introduction, but otherwise disappointing. There are many other books out there much better. Helen Waddell did translate these writings from the Latin. The problem is that save for the first selection from St. Jerome (originally written in Latin) all of the selections are translations from the Latin but the Latin translations from which Waddell translates are translations of other authors from the original Greek.Still, if you have not been exposed at all to the thoughts and beliefs of our early Christian monks it may be a good brief introduction. You will get a look into how these early monastic thought and lived their lives. Of course in any translation of the Desert Fathers you will find words of wisdom that you will benefit from."},{"Title":"Ode to the Chinaberry Tree and Other Poems","review":"Jim Applewhite appears as a protagonist in V.

This is the middle book of the trilogy and is not as funny as the other two (My Family and Other Animals and In the Garden of the Gods). He relates various stories about his childhood which involved ranging far and wide on the island observing and collecting various animals, birds and insects. The stories are pleasant and interesting, just not laugh out loud funny like his other books.

The island of Corfu lies off of the Albanian and Greek coastlines. The family settled there to escape the deary English weather.Gerald's mother fought a losing battle with the Greek language. The family members became familiar with all of the peasants in the region. Gerald had a tutor named George who was an adept of fencing and an adult scientist friend named Theodore.Gerald visited the rock pools while his sister swam. Margo's sun bathing bothered a church functionary, a monk. Gerald sought permission to follow a fisherman, to accompany him in his boat when he fished at night. The fisherman used a trident to catch scorpios.There was a myrtle forest near the family's house. Gerald received a rich dark brown donkey for his birthday. The donkey was used by Gerald to transport things. Larry brought home friends, artists and writers, and brought home an artist who could play the accordian, Sven.Theordore had told a countess that Gerald, who was a fairly young boy at the time, was a naturalist and had a number of pets. The countess offered to give him a white owl who had an injured wing. Gerald went to fetch it and to meet her on his donkey.He wanted to add baby hedgehogs to his menagerie.

His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again.

They're not meant to be hurried through. When I do finish I'm a little sad, because I want him to just keep telling me more and more stories.I was afraid this one might not measure up to the first one, My Family and Other Animals. But this second one was every bit as enchanting and entertaining as the first. The two books give an account of the years the Durrell family spent living on the Greek island of Corfu in the 1930s.Gerry was the youngest in his family by a far margin, and was only about 10 years old when they moved from England to Greece. He spent these years as a budding naturalist, roaming the island collecting specimens and pets of every variety: insects, reptiles, birds, mammals, and sea creatures. To his family's dismay, he brought most of these critters home to live in his indoor menagerie. More often than not there were disastrous and/or hilarious results.Meanwhile, Gerry's mother, sister, and brothers entertained a colorful variety of visitors both local and foreign. Some of the zaniest parts of the book are these visitor escapades. I must say, many of these characters were fun to read about but I don't think I'd want them around for long. A little too much of the wrong kind of excitement for me.I envy Gerald Durell's idyllic youth in such a specatular setting. These are books I will read again."},{"Title":"BIRDS BEASTS AND RELATIVES.","review":"This is another wonderful books of Gerald Durrell's memories of his time on the island of Corfu prior to the Second World War. He takes us back to another time and place before the world changed for good.Each chapter is a separate story and rememberence of those days when as a young man he marvels at not only the natural world around him, but also the various people he encounters and learns to appreciate. It is easy to get lost in one of these stories and feel like you are there with him on a hot summer day with his faithful dogs tagging along beside him.I recommend this book to anyone who not only loves nature, but also can appreciate a time gone by when people were different and even strangers were looked as guests. This book is one that I intend to read again and again in the coming years and will appreciate the stories just much each time as the first time."},{"Title":"BIRDS BEASTS AND RELATIVES.","review":"Bought these books for my grand children.

I mean truly repellently, malignantly bad. &quot;Can it really be as bad as all that?&quot; you wonder. Yes!! It's that bad!! For starters, the book is poorly organized. Topics that logically belong together are often several chapters apart. There is no overall structure to the book. It seems like a collection of topics in AI that were hastily assembled without concern for thematic organization or flow. For example, the forward and backward chaining algorithms are presented in a chapter (Ch. 7) on rule-based systems, but are not even mentioned in the chapter (Ch. 13) on logic! Perceptron training is presented AFTER backpropagation! Contrast this with the much better book by Russell and Norvig, which uses the theme of intelligent agents as a continuing motivation throughout, and which groups related topics into logically arranged chapters.The examples in Winston are atrocious. The main example in the backpropagation chapter is some kind of classification network with a bizarre topography. This example is so trivial and weird that it totally fails to illustrate the strengths of backpropagation. The explanations of generalization and overfitting in backprop training are awful.The only chapter of this book that is not an unmitigated pedagogical disaster is the chapter on genetic algorithms, although better introductions exist (e.g. Melanie Mitchell).A further annoyance is the placement of all the exercises at the end of the book instead of the end of the chapters to which they correspond.Avoid this book.

He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer.

It was easy to read, and engaging from the very beginning."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"The fascinating thing about the Salem Witch Trials is that we will never know for sure what caused the extreme hysteria. The witchcraft phenomenon in general is now fairly well understood in terms of its psychodynamics. But what made the Salem tragedy so extreme? I suspect it was a number of factors. Phenomena are rarely simple. In Salem Possessed, the authors do an admirable job of analyzing the social background against which the outbreak occurred, a task that has not been done as thoroughly and minutely in any other source that I've encountered. The sections on the Putnams, the Porters, and Samuel Parris are particularly instructive, and the explanation of these families' relationships with some of the victims is eye-opening. Does this book explain the why's of this traumatic event in American history? Partially, yes. Therefore its value should not be understimated. Salem Possessed is a must-read for any student of Salem."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Boyer and Nissenbaum undertook their research to explore the interaction between everyday life in Salem, Massachusetts and the extraordinary events of the witchcraft trials. They researched the court records of the trials, personal accounts, census records, and church documents to understand the motivations behind the accusations. Boyer and Nissenbaum conclude the accusations sprang from different political, social, and economic views of the direction for Salem and the Massachusetts Bay colony.The village of Salem experienced civil discontent for years prior to the violence of the witchcraft trials. The townspeople were divided into factions centering around the Putnam and Porter families. The Putnams supported the old order, pursued a primarily agricultural way of live, resisted efforts to introduce mercantilism into Salem Village, and wanted independence from Salem Town. The Porters linked themselves to larger community, engaged in commerce, accepted incorporation with Salem Town, and resisted separatist efforts. These competing ideologies divided the community.The selection of ministers, including Samuel Parris, provided a focus rather than a cause for the animosity. The witchcraft trials tapped into this rancor and intensified the enmity between the sides. The struggles concerning witchcraft reflected a conflict over the economic future of the town.Boyer and Nissenbaum reevaluate the witchcraft trial in their study. The events in Salem Village happened because of the unique conditions of that community. Salem Village lacked autonomy and power, but had a taste of independence through their separate meeting house. These conditions fostered the spread of the accusations.The authors argued that the adults in Salem Village interpreted the behavior of the girls to suit their political and social goals. Northampton, Massachusetts experienced similar incidents in 1735. Their minister interpreted the occurrences as the hand of God, rather than the work of the devil. The Salem ministers saw the devil's work because of underlying social and political tensions.Boyer and Nissenbaum show the economic differences between the witches and victims by mapping their residences. The former advocated continued economic diversification and mercantilism, and aligned themselves with Salem Town. The latter group came from an entrenched agrarian contingent who experienced economic dislocation and loss of status because of the limited amount of arable land. They felt pressured to join the new order and resisted this development. This underlying tension strengthened the accusations.Boyer and Nissenbaum's book contains an innovative approach using social and economic factors to understand the phenomenon. Quantitative methods provide a useful tool to study this period. The book illustrates the underlying economic component of this issue."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Being a genealogy/historical records buff, I loved Salem Possessed. Rather than relying on court records or newspaper articles, the authors look at previously overlooked records to discover the origins of the Salem with trails.

While others relied on the tabloid type accounts of events left behind in court depositions, Nissenbaum and Boyer get into the nitty gritty to show you what really happened. Accessing Parris's sermons, wills, seemingly unrelated civil conflict court records, tax records, censuses, and more, this book starts from the beginning - the founding of Salem Village and takes you step by step through the most likely scenario of what really happened in this conflict in terms of personal power struggles, family legacies, societal conflicts between agrarian and commercial lifestyles and so on. This book also changed my perspective on the Puritan way of life and stirred my interest in the Great Awakening of 1751 which had similar outbreaks as the &quot;spectral evidence&quot; of Salem but was interpreted in a wholly different way."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"One of the great things about not being the first reviewer of a book, is that you can feel free to limit yourself to a discussion of what you felt was important about the book to your own point of view, since most of the other reviewers will have covered some of the more general issues about the book.Like the lead reviewer, I do not buy into the authors' sociological conclusions regarding the origins of the Salem Witch trials. But that does not mean this is not a very valuable book for those who study this subject. Since it does end with a socio-economic explanation of events, it marshalls and displays an impressive amount of evidence regarding the state of Salem Village at the time of the outbreak. You are unlikely to find this information elsewhere, and it is just as likely to support an alternative explanation as the one to which the authors lead you.For example, early in the book, the authors make the connection between the events in Salem and the events, 42 years later, a few dozen miles to the west, in Northampton, Massachusetts, during what was called the First or \\"Little\\" Great Awakening in the parish of Jonathan Edwards. This was the source for my alternate theory of the events in Salem. This means that one should read this book with an open heart, get what ideas are good, and criticize the ideas which may be too much of a stretch.If the authors attend too much to any one point, it seems to be the motives of certain individuals. My reading of the events is that it was an incident fuelled not by the evil or ignorance of one person, like Thomas de' Torquemada's role in the Spanish Inquisition, but in the sense of the times, fed by the way in which the incident was sparked by the Amerindian slave Tituba and her vision of many witches signing the Devil's book."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Why did the social fabric of Salem break down so thoroughly that by 1692 people were being accused of and executed for witchcraft? This book attempts to answer that question with a number of possibilities. For me the clearest answer had to do with the separation of Salem Village and Salem Town and how they perceived each other: Town was bigger and had the political clout to control the Village; Village wanted independence, which meant the right to elect its own leaders and, even more important, be independent in church matters. What was truly unusual about this arrangement for Salem was that the Village was caught in the middle between Town's dominence and the taste of independence it was allowed to savor - but never really have. This bred contempt and eventually the only means they felt available to force resolution, which went beyond the political and ecclesiastical realm in which they had no power anyway: witchcraft. The authors lean toward the psychology of guilt and accusation in proposing answers, which might be all well and good, but the answers are more basic and obvious than that, I think. A well written book, admirable for the extent to which original sources are utilized."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"When we think of the Salem with trials the first thing we we would think of are witches in the European style, flying on brooms, speaking in tongues etcetera. This because they were taken by the devil. To get rid of the witches and therefore the devil they had to be tried and afterwards liquidated. The most famous case was of course in Salem, MA 1692. Arthur Miller wrote the play \`The Crucible' as a parable of McCarthy Era America and the movie does the same thing. For a long time the events in Salem were soon as a strange case in history, Boyer and Nissenbaum decided to look at the records and writings of that era again and came up with a fascinating new history of the Salem witchtrials.The looked at the lives of the people in Salem from the beggar to the minister and also at three of the leading families in Salem. The minister Parrish plays the most important role in their story because they devide the town up into two camps; the pro and contra Parrish people. They find out that mixed in this is also the strife within one family with ties to another important Salem factory. For B&N; the witchtrials are more a battleground of different social groups than the fight against the devil.They unfortunately did not entirely look at the more psychological reasons for the events. Salem was not alone in it's social build and therefore something like this should have happened in more places, but it didn't.This book has often been heralded as an important book in the post-modern historical society for looking at more things and the people too, except the rulers. It also shows how easy it is to debunk myths if you just look at the sources.If yore are interested in the witch trials this book will certainly be liked."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"This has been a very popular book with many Salem Witch Trials researchers.

This book is proof that we must learn from history or stand condemned to repeat it.It is bizarre how the early settlers operated and how there was no true separation of church and State, blame abounded if someone had a seizure. Evidence shows that ergot poisioning led the the sympotmatic behavior of the poor class of females who mostly ate the rye bread, etc. and how society, with it's fearmonging idiocy was more readily willing to blame some psychotic make-believe of \\"being a witch\\" on those poor girls than of using their brains and finding a scientific explanation.It's hard to tell who was more nuts... the people with ergot poisoning or the clergy making the ridiculous judgements!I was blown out of the water when I read how a woman with a hemerroid was thought to have a \\"witches teat\\" that they believed she nursed secret witches and goblins at night from (talk about disgusting beliefs) and how these poor ladies were dunked, hanged, shot, be-headed because of a naturally occurring blood vessel protruding from [...]after child birth!Good God, I'm glad they didn't have truck drivers back then because they have the most hemerroids of any sector of the population!

In it, scholars Boyer and Nissenbaum take the then-standard Salem witchcraft narrative and subject it to reinterpretation on the basis of patterns and trends they see in the social history of Salem and Salem Village (now Danvers). Essentially, they argue that the witchcraft accusations and prosecutions were an unconscious (or perhaps conscious) means by which the poorer and more agrarian segment of the Salem Village population got back at the wealthier and more worldly types.As social history of Salem and Danvers in the 17th century, much of the book is fascinating and insightful. However, as an explanation of the witchcraft crisis, the book is, in my opinion, implausible. Too often, the authors seem to be reading into the data, finding evidence of discord where little or none exists. As one example, they interpret the bare negotiating positions of Salem Village and Samuel Parris regarding the hiring of Parris as minister to evidence aggressive overreaching on Parris's part, without any comparison to the agreements typically reached by other towns and ministers. More importantly, it's simply very hard to believe that, based on the types of disagreements the authors claim to have existed, people would hate their neighbors enough to throw about accusations of capital crimes on a vast scale.Salem Possessed stands today as another in a long line of unsatisfying attempts to make sense of the witchcraft crisis. Until the publication in 2002 of Mary Beth Norton's In the Devil's Snare (a work I found much more persuasive), Salem Possessed was perhaps the most influential scholarly interpretation of those events. (For example, its theories formed the basis of the PBS series Three Sovereigns for Sarah.) In my opinion, Salem Possessed has since been shown to be a wild goose chase."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"I was actually assigned this book for an anthropology class, but I couldn't put it down. Boyer and Nissenbaum look at every possible contributing factor to the witch craze that took hold of Salem in the late 17th century. They are careful to present all of the data upon which they based their hypotheses, allowing the reader to judge the validity of their claims. Salem Possessed provides an enlightening look at the pressures (social, economic, religious) that affected all of the villagers, and manages not to vilify any particular person.This book's strength is it's thoroughness, but it is also it's major drawback. It can be difficult to keep track of all the names, households and dates. However, it is well worth the effort, and I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"This is a wonderful book. Boyer and Neissenbaum take you to society and the time right before the witch trials took place. They give you all the information you need to feel what life was like there and to understand the underlying tensions and disputes, jealousies and arrogance. Things were changing. Some people wanted --and benefited from the changes-- others didn't want, and were antagonistic to, the changes. The ideal of the community was being tested by economic opportunity, which was fostering economic greed. An increasing stratified society was coming into being. Meanwhile, there was no mechanism available for petty disputes to be resolved via the courts or other public venues -- this is just a short list of the variety of problems that sat unresolved and which eventually broke loose in the hysteria of a witch hunting. This is an amazingly complex and fascinating story--the research and scholarship here is extraordinary. If you want to know what lead up to the witch trials this is the book you want to read."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed - The Social Origins of Witchcraft has long been recognized as one of several standard texts for university level classes on the subject. The authors view Salem as a specific and perhaps hyperbolic extension of the world-wide socio-economic tensions occasioned by the rise of Mercantile Capitalism (209). Specifically, they postulate that the growth of political-religious factionalism within Salem Village was due primarily to causes beyond local control; and that, when combined with the inopportune convergence of certain chance factors (such as long lasting intra-family feuds and the debate over the church) and personalities (such as Parris, Putnam and Porter), resulted in the collective abreaction of social tensions we now know as the Salem Witchcraft Episode (178, 191). Salem Possessed is a logical, extremely readable, and seemingly well researched book. However, a closer examination of both the focus and methodology may be in order.It will be readily admitted that a definition of the term \\"social history\\" remains ambiguous. There are, however, certain basic expectations a historian expects to have fulfilled by any worked labeled so, among them: explanations concerning the broad socio-political background leading to a specific event; how the effects of this background narrow in focus and relate to the local event; how the event itself impacts various effected segments of society; and how these segments themselves view and/or react to the event. The specific focus chosen by Boyer and Nissenbaum fail to fulfill the great majority of these expectation.It is a specific contention of the authors that the social environment of Salem accurately reflected the contemporary antagonism between larger social, political and economic forces (179-81, 209). However, the excessively narrow focus of the work would belie such an assertion. Little or no mention is made of the impact of the Restoration of the Stuarts and Britain's subsequent political-economic \\"Reach for Empire\\", or the resultant development of mercantile capitalism and the rise of the merchant group. Such omissions are all the more telling because it is the implicit ideological conflict between capitalist merchants and a declining Puritan oligarchy which provide the framework of local factionalism upon which Boyer and Nissenbaum center their research.In addition, although it is a commonly held belief that the Salem witch trials were - at least in part - an extension of the widespread European witch hunts of 1500-1700, no mention of these precedent setting events is made. In fact, little attention is paid to contemporary perceptions of witchcraft whether European or Colonial.A third and perhaps even more directly applicable topic passed over by the authors is the role of gender. Why, for example, are most of the postulated causes primarily, if not exclusively, male concerns, such as the payment of taxes, control of the village council, and service in the Salem Town Watch? This is especially confusing when one considers that a great majority of both afflicted and accused were female. From a broader perspective, the authors totally disregard the possible social (not to mention misognistic) complications arising from a patriarchal society which singles out and condemns a sizable percentage of their own womenfolk. These lapses alone serve to relegate the book to the less ambitious ranks of a local - rather than a truly \\"social\\" - history.A second and equally grievous criticism concerns the authors' selective but obviously calculated use of post ipso facto psychological methods to compensate when - and wherever purely historical methods appear insufficient. Rather than admitting that perhaps we just don't know exactly why people act and react they way they do, Boyer and Nissenbaum attempt convoluted psychoanalytical explanations which the objective observer must label conjecture, at best. The inappropriate nature of such techniques when applied at a chronological distance of over 280 years becomes especially obvious in Chapter 7 where the psychological portrait provided describes Pastor Samuel Parris as an insecure (169) paranoid (170) and self-hating (177) obsessive-compulsive (167) megalomaniac who compares himself to Christ (169), yet such a characterization directly contradicts the later portrait of Parris as the \\"representative [i.e., typical] man of his time\\".It also seems that Salem Possessed exhibits at least one consistently identifiable bias, that being the authors' rather obvious disparaging treatment of capitalism. Far from being the harbinger of modernity which supplanted an oppressive and antiquated Puritan world-view, capitalism is characterized as \\"the lure which menaced the village\\" (101), \\"a looming moral threat\\" (105), a \\"violation of much that is contained in the word 'Puritan'\\" (106), and as responsible for \\"many disputes and difficulties\\" (102). Even acquiescing the fact that total objectivity is impossible, one would assume Boyer and Nissenbaum could have at least done a better job of camouflaging their own 1960's liberal academic backgrounds.Finally, for a work in which a large portion of the text deals with such verifiable data as demographics and family relationships, Boyer and Nissenbaum seem to depend rather excessively upon secondary sources. For example, of the fifty-seven total references cited in the first ten pages of the book, only seventeen were original records. This imbalance becomes all the more glaring when one takes into account the authors' own statements concerning the comparatively large amount of primary documentation available on the subject (x - xi).In sum, it must be admitted that Salem Possessed does have its merits. It is well written with an easy to follow style. The extensive research and clarity of expression evidenced in sections dealing specifically with local factionalism are impressive. And Boyer and Nissenbaum's ability to translate complex relationships into readable prose is entertaining, if not always one hundred percent accurate. Unfortunately, the authors not only utilize inappropriate and unsubstantiated psychological interpretations to support their primary socio-historic focus, but they fail to place this focus within a larger world-historical framework. In fact, they seem to leave out almost as much as they cover, a trait that considerably lowers the overall quality and usefulness of the work."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Boyer and Nissesnbaum's work on Salem is a fascinating look into the social stresses which were at the root of the explosion of accusations in this small Massachusetts town. Each of the elements in this disaster, i.e. the questionable ministerial skills of Samuel Parris, property disputes between the Proctors and Putnams, the conflicts between Salem Village and Salem Town, are thoughtfully analyzed as part of a whole. I higly reccomend this book for anyone wishing to have a deeeper understanding of the true causes of the Salem trials."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"From an enormous body of surviving documents, the authors piece together a micro-historical account of life in 17th century Salem (Danvers), MA, comparable to Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's classic description of a medieval French heretic town, Montaillou: the promised land of error. Their conclusion: \\"the witchcraft outbreak was rooted in the prosaic, everyday lives of obscure and inarticulate men and women. ... The spark which finally set off the volatile mix [of geography, economics, politics, and the times] came with the unlikely convergence of a set of chance factors in the early 1690's.\\" Among these chance factors were the arrival of a new minister (Samuel Parris) and his voodoo-practicing slave (Tituba), heightened interest in fortune telling and the occult, a long-standing feud over land between the Putnams and Porters, the Montague-Capulet marriage of Joseph Putnam and Elizabeth Porter, and perhaps most of all, the peculiar political and economic status of Salem Village.One of the reasons life in Salem, even before 1692, is so well documented is because its inhabitants were a querulous, litigious bunch, frequently bringing lawsuits against each other: \\"What made Salem Village disputes so notorious, and ultimately so destructive, was the fact that structural defects in its organization rendered the Village almost helpless in coping with whatever disputes might arise.\\" About fours years before the witchcraft crisis, both the King of England (to whom colonists owed allegiance, and looked to for support), and the Governor of Massachusetts were removed from office. A new governor was not in office until 1692, after the crisis had already begun.What people in Salem most quarreled about land. Salem Village quite literally had its back up against a wall, the Ipswich River. There was no room for expansion, and average landholding size had decreased by half, from 250 acres in 1660 to 125 in 1690. (Carol F. Karlsen makes a good case in The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: witchcraft in colonial New England, that women, rather than their male counterparts, who inherited or controlled land were \\"at risk\\" of being accused witches.) When young girls resorted to fortune telling to know who their future husbands might be, they were seeking urgent, practical, economic help in a \\"down market.\\"The farming community of Salem Village was also encroached politically and economically from the more urban, coastal Salem Town to its south, and eastern Salem Village which naturally aligned itself with Salem Town. Salem Village had \\"no ecclesiastical apparatus.\\" It had no church and had to travel a long distance to Town Center for communion. Salem Village balked at paying taxes without what it considered necessary services, and in 1690 requested independent township status. In the decade or so before the witch crisis, Salem Village had gone through three unordained ministers before settling on the divisive, but ordained, Samuel Parris. Those aligned with Parris, mostly farmers located in western Salem Village, \\"treated those who threatened them not as a political opposition but as an aggregate of morally defective individuals ... it was a perfectly normal procedure for a town to rid itself of deviant and threatening individuals - by changing them if possible, by exile or execution if necessary.\\"As does Richard Godbeer in Escaping Salem: the other witch hunt of 1692, Boyer and Nissenbaum ask why events in Salem went so awry. There had been many witchcraft cases tried throughout the colonies and in Salem before 1692. For two centuries, Europe had been in the midst of a \\"witch craze\\" that claimed as many as 100,000 people. (By comparison, the Spanish Inquisition only executed about 5,000.) But in previous cases - in the colonies, and in Salem - executions were rare. It's surprising to read that elsewhere, before 1692, people were accused of witchcraft and brought to trial more than once over their lifetimes, without suffering execution or significant punishment. And therein might lie some explanation.There was an intellectual and class distinction about what constituted witchcraft. To the literate, learned community, the crime of witchcraft was making a covenant with the Devil; a kind of super-heresy that not only denied Church dogma, but actively aligned itself against the Church, and God. Among the \\"obscure and inarticulate men and women\\" of Salem Village and elsewhere, witchcraft was magic; spells, amulets, potions, and the like that gave witches advantage over someone. It was easy to show someone had advantage - their livestock did not die when others did, or their children were healthy, or they were rich, had more land, and so on - but it was more difficult to show someone made a pact with the Devil. Who could give witness but the Devil himself (who lies), and the accused, his servant? Magistrates were more likely to err on the side of the defendant, and acquit accused witches - sometimes, even reversing a jury's verdict - to the consternation, fear, and dissatisfaction of the accusers. An ideal condition for vigilantism.(In 1933, in my hometown, mobs broke into the jail, and beat two accused kidnapper/murderers senseless, then dragged their bodies across the street to the park where they were hanged, their bodies mutilated, and set afire. One reason \\"obscure and inarticulate men and women\\" in my town took such drastic action was s string of kidnappings, most notably that of Charles Lindbergh's son, that had gone unpunished.)What made Salem Village erupt was not just pent-up rivalries and conflicts, but what's now called lack of \\"adult supervision.\\" Why didn't someone simply tell the young accusers to go to their rooms and behave themselves? Why were they taken seriously? (English law at that time, did not admit evidence from anyone younger than fourteen years old.)It can't be overlooked that Tituba, and the original accusers were members of Reverend Parris' household. Already the target of attacks from forces aligned with Salem Town, Parris easily equated himself, as representative of the Church, with the Church and God himself under attack. \\"The prevailing motif of that commentary [in Parris' Sermon Book] - from 1689 to 1692 at any rate - is one ofn encircling menace: a menace which thrusts closer and closer to the heart of the Village as it becomes increasingly cosmic in origin. In this quite specific sense, Parris unconsciously helped set the scene for the climax of 1692.\\"Boyer and Nissenbaum make a good case that the antics of the accusers - mostly young girls, but including young women as well - had more in common with the behavior of people at revival meetings such as the \\"Little Awakening\\" in 1734 Northhampton, MA, or the \\"Great Awakening\\" and \\"Second Great Awakening\\" in 19th century Kentucky. The very use of the word \\"awakening\\" - a stage in mysticism - is significant. As medievalist Teofilo F. Ruiz points out in his UCLA course The Terror of History: Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition, mysticism has always been one of the few avenues open to women to achieve equality of power and influence. Boyer and Nissenbaum conclude, \\"the young people of both Northhampton and Salem Village at least momentarily broke out of their \`normal' subservient and deferential social role to become the de facto leaders of the town and (for many, at least) the unchallenged source of moral authority.\\"Reverend Parris, like Senator Joseph McCarthy, benefitted in his role as leader in this war against \\"the invisible world.\\" Again referring to the similarities between Salem and later revival movements, the authors conclude: \\"The crucial difference between the two episodes is the interpretation which the adult leadership of each community placed upon physical states which in themselves were strikingly similar.\\" The beleaguered Parris saw witches. Others would later see God. What was needed, and arguably, was eventually provided by Governor Phips, was someone to say \\"Reverend Parris. Have you no shame!\\""},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"Given to me as a gift by a friend who didn't think it would be interesting, this book was one of the most fascinating I've ever read.

By using such detailed and effective primary sources, the authors were able to create a vivid image of the situation Salem Village was in, and how the emergent mercantile capitalism was mistaken by those as a threat of witchcraft. Introducing us to the two \\"rival clans\\", the Porters and the Putnams, as well as the key role of the minister Samuel Parris, the authors of Salem Possessed used statistical and empirical data to show how the clashing of these distinct people, and their distinctive ways of life, led to a crescendo in 1692 that allowed for the hanging of innocent people. The authors sum up the book by portraying the events of 1692 as an \\"obsession with outsiders\\", showing that the difference in proximity to Salem Town, financial standing, land holding, and taxable property was more than many \\"pro-Parris\\" Villagers could stand to sit idly aside and watch fluctuate sporadically. Overall, Salem Possessed is effective in erasing the stereotypes involved with the Salem Witch Trials by using concrete evidence, primary accounts, and statistical data that hint at a very evident pattern in the growing chasm between the pro-Parris, religious Puritans, and the capitalistic, wealthy Villagers who had stronger ties to Salem Town than the Village itself."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"This book chronicles the interesting events that shaped Colonial history in the fall of 1692. Hundreds of people were accused of witchcraft in Massachusetts, and 19 of the accused (probably all innocent) were put to death. The mass hysteria that invoked this terrible event was brought on by a combination of communal hysteria, frustration with wealthy social classes, and the rigid interpretation of Puritannical laws. An excellent narrative for anyone interested in the development of early North America."},{"Title":"Salem Possessed, The Social Origins of Witchcraft","review":"\\"Salem Possessed\\" is a well researched but ultimately flawed account of the Witch trials of 1692. Boyer's and Nissenbaum's main contention is that the trials were a result of the animosity borne by the increasing bifurcation between Salem Village and Salem Town.Specifically, as the Porter family in Salem gained in wealth, land and political influence, the Putnams (the main accusers in 1692) were hemmed in. The main nexus of envy, the authors argue, lay in the second marriage of Thomas Putnam to one Mary Veren. It was ultimately Mary Veren in 1695 that willed a vast majority of her estate to the Porters. One would think then that the main accusations of witchcraft would be leveled against the Porters or those closest to them. Instead, the main accusations were made against people geographically close to the Porters in the eastern part of the village. The authors attempt to explain away this incongruity by reading into the documents and supplanting hard evidence with imagined psychological motivations. For instance, the authors argue that the Putnam's rage was directed towards outsiders rather then Mary Putnam (Veren). This begs the question: Why were the accusations not leveled against the Porters and/or Mary Veren herself? The authors argue that the Putnams would not dare touch the Porters because of their high status, but why not when the stakes were so high as the authors have argued time and time again? This cannot be explained by simply a matter of \`social deference.' That, in my opinion, is the ultimate failure of the book. If the witch trials were primarily an organized campaign against encroaching land-grabbing and commercialism, as the authors would have us believe, why accuse social outcasts? Although this book may suffice at the undergraduate level, at a higher level of academia it cannot stand up to very tough scrutiny. At the end of the day, it raises far to many questions then it does answers."},{"Title":"The act of touch in all its diversity;: An analysis and synthesis of pianoforte tone-production","review":"This is definetly a treasure to posess.

She posits that God the Father is the main subject of the gospel, and taht only in relation to the Father is Jesus properly understood as the one who is &quot;with God&quot; and &quot;is God&quot;. An interesting analysis of the Paraclete reveals that the Spirit is not some sort of replacement for the risen Christ, but one of the Father's &quot;two hands&quot;.This is really a needed work. She is right in stressing the fact that approaching God by means other than the Father can distort John's purpose. For he uses Jesus as the person who revales the face of the Father to us. There is a tendancy in exegesis to hold orthodox positions (i.e., that Jesus is actually God equal to the Father) for the wrong reasons, thus leaving orthodoxy open to criticisms that really are unfounded. Thompson's book is a needed corrective in this regard. Enjoy this great book!Thompson's other great books, The Promise of the Father and The Incarnate Word are really worth looking into. For another defense of Christ's full divinity, see Jesus As God by Harris (although he may need THompson's corrective in a few places, but those are places for you to find!)."},{"Title":"The God of the Gospel of John","review":"The delivery time was remarkably fast and the product quality was exactly what i was hoping for.

My second favorite Smith book is his newest: &quot;Monsoon&quot;, 3 &quot;Men of Men&quot;, 4 &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, 5 &quot;Golden Fox&quot;, 6 &quot;Burning Shore&quot;, 7 &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. You might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett after you have read all of Mr. Smith's books. It is very similar in style and quality to &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Eagle Large Print)","review":"THE DIAMOND HUNTERS revolves around the mining of beach and offshore deposits for diamonds, and the rivalry and jealousy of two \\"brothers\\" involved in this mining. The detailed and accurately depicted diamond mining methods described will be unfamiliar and informative to most readers. In my opinion, the plot is a bit more complex than it could be, and characters could be filled-in a little more, and more numerous and more detailed descriptive passages would have been appreciated. Even so, THE DIAMOND HUNTERS is a good read.WILBER SMITH NOVELSWilber Smith's novels are characterized by hard edged characters in harsh, unforgiving environments and situations, against implacable foes. When one of Smith's \\"heros\\" succeeds, his victory is usually pyrrhic-as is often the case in the real world. This gritty pioneer mentality is appropriate to South Africa.I imagine that many readers will conclude that many of the characters in Smith's novels lack dimension. But that's a failure of people, not of the author. There ARE nasty, vengeful people in the world who are NOT complex, and Smith describes such people accurately. Smith does not attempt to explain such people-which I appreciate (in contrast with most modern novels filled with dreary shallow pop-psychology). Smith's heros are men who manage to exceed the sum of their heredity and environment-as is often the case in the real world."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Eagle Large Print)","review":"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his &quot;unputdownable&quot; story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Eagle Large Print)","review":"I have seen Wilbur Smith novels on the bookshelves for years but for one reason or another none of them had ever really piqued my interest, but while browsing in an airport bookstore looking for something to read on a long flight I picked this one up and as I began to read I found that my flight was too short. I didn't want to be interrupted for something as trivial as changing flights. I intend to read more Wilbur Smith in the near future.The way Smith builds the story of Johnny Lance being an outcast and the way that he discovers the truth about his childhood and the animosity that builds between him and his foster brother Benedict Van der Byle makes for a spellbinding read. Smith's descriptions of the African landscape and exotic locations are well written without being over-done. When he describes Thunderbolt and Suicide you can smell the salt air and see the foamy spray shooting skyward and hear the crashing of the huge waves against the unyielding rock formations.Like all fiction stories this one is not for everyone, but if you enjoy action/adventure, emphasis on action you will find this a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Diamond Hunters (Eagle Large Print)","review":"The descriptions of diamond mining and sorting are as good as it gets.

This book shows the real and extremely difficult days of the stagecoach mail delivery and does it in a very factual, well-documented way. The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities. It was especially interesting to me since my father and brother have the same name--Ben Holladay. He may be a distant relative and we would be proud to claim him."},{"Title":"Ben Holladay: The Stagecoach King","review":"Prior to the coming of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the stagecoach was the primary means of transportation for goods as well as people across the vastness of the West. Ben Holladay established and owned many of the stagecoach lines that stretched from Kansas to California, and this valuable book, long in print (it was first published in 1940), tells the story of Holladay and the stagecoach business over which he dominated.Holladay was born in Kentucky in 1819 and went to Weston, MO, as a boy (one rumor says he ran away from home). He worked different jobs there for a number of years, married and had seven children, and then got a job freighting supplies for Kearny's Army of the West during the Mexican War. After the war he took a supply train to Salt Lake City which brought him a handsome profit. He worked with the Russell, Majors, and Waddell transportation company, learning the business and making deals for them, even aiding in the establishment of the Pony Express.In 1862 he bought out Russell, Majors, and Waddell and created the Overland Stage Line, which ran eventually from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Soon branch lines were added to Montana and Oregon, and he had as many as 15,000 men employed driving stages and tending stations and livestock. In 1865 he sold the business to Wells Fargo because of Indian deprivations and got into the steamship business in California. This he sold in 1868 and became chief owner of the Oregon Central Railroad, which he held until the Panic of 1873 wiped him out and he retired.As a businessman, Holladay had a lot to be desired. Machiavellian in his approach where the end always justified the means, he often cooked the books and lied to investors. He spent a great deal of time in Washington, DC, currying influence. Also in his personal life he was crude and overbearing. He died in Portland, Oregon, in 1887.Frederick's account of Holladay and the Overland Stage operations is scholarly and thorough. Reprinted from the original A.H. Clark edition, the book contains all the peculiar printing practices unique to that company (certain proper nouns - months and book titles, for example, are never capitalized). More important than that is that Frederick tells his story with authority and elan. Numerous appendices appear that further detail the business side of the Overland Stage Line; one I found especially useful: a complete listing, with intervening distances, of all the stage stations along the Line. This is a fascinating book about an important phase in the growth of the West."},{"Title":"Surrendered","review":"Ann Doupont is a divine writer. Her ability to write with simplicity and clarity resonates with my spirit and understanding. Her words speak to my spirit in a way that edifies and makes clear the teachings of scripture. The little short pieces she writes are supported by scripture and by her wealth of life experience from walking the way of Gospel truth. \\"Surrendered\\" is a collection or bundle of devotions, prayers, uplifting poems, encouragements, as well as excellent counsel for singles.To the believer, Ann opens your understanding of what it means to have a close fellowship with the Savior of mankind, The Mediator, Jesus Christ. If you are in Christ, you will be instructed and comforted by what Ann sets forth here. This devotional book will be a notable addition to a Christian's devotional resources.Ann Doupont's style is down to earth and straightforward. The topics she addresses are timely and serve to reinforce a believer's walk and to enlarge his spiritual depth and maturity. I love to pick it up and at random to allow God's Spirit to speak and guide me through today's confusion and secular jungle. Ann has written superbly about the prayer life of the believer. Ann's writing here goes a long way in helping us grasp the essence of trust and dependence upon the all-knowing and loving God of scripture.Ann's earlier experiences that she shares with singles constitute good counsel, especially when she mentions her \\"front sliding,\\" that ought to be highly valued by young singles. An example of excellent counsel may be had on page 24. Ann identifies with the rejected on page 44. But frankly, I wish that she had expanded or enlarged on this topic. I felt that she could offer the reader suggestions on how to deal with or cope with being left alone and feeling abandoned. I personally identify with her short testimony on page 67. Her style is appreciated, as she gets down-to-earth, no-nonsense, and matter-of-fact with sin and its consequences. Ann's discussion of meditation on God's Word versus the words of men on page 70 is well taken. On page 82, the point made of learning from the Holy Spirit rather than man is frank and true.If you have ever wondered about prayer, what to pray, how to say it, then this little book is a sound guide for many areas of life and living. It encourages doing your own praying and making it effective. Ann gives prayer or conversations with God a good shot. Especially the admonition to ask God's help to forget is a great prayer offered here. Her little piece on forgetting is of note too. Ann has written a valuable devotional book that helps in your prayer life and in your attitude and relation with the God of Holy Scripture. As one reads, one is reminded of the great French spiritual writer, Fenelon, as he helped us with understanding the mind and purposes of God. I put Ann right up there with Oswald Chambers too.The writing of \\"Surrendered\\" is accurately done and should bring comfort to many in their spiritual walk. I highly recommend Ann Doupont's book."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"Once you get past the premise and start reading, the writing reels you in.

Married to a local race-car legend, she knows the marriage is a mistake from the beginning. She only stays in it for the sake of the child she adores. She and her husband are careful to show their son only the good side of their marriage.

The nephew takes one look at Hush and falls pretty hard. And Hush?

Suffering through her family's poverty and losing both her parents by age sixteen, Hush decided she would turn the family apple orchards into a profitable business again.Though she was made fun of for selling apples from a road side stand, it only inspired her. Hush kept going. Surviving.She was given control of Sweet Hush Hollow and custody of her five-year-old brother, Logan. Her childhood friends, Davy and Smooch, vowed to help her.When Hush becomes pregnant with Davy's child, she reluctantly agrees to marry him, knowing he will not be faithful. Hush is still determined to make the orchards a success.She handles the obstacles one by one, choosing to keep her family life discreet. The years fly by and Hush has turned Sweet Hush Hollow into the profitable family business she knew it could be.Life is good, comfortable...until one day her now 23-year-old son calls her to let her know he is on his way home from college. He arrives with the President of the United State's daughter in tow. They are married and pregnant.Hush is thrown into the public eye. Her life of secrets is threatened as she discovers a real bee charmer and ultimately her true self.Deborah Smith did an excellent job bringing these two families through a crisis and to an understanding of each other. There were little stories within the overall story which kept the pages turning through the night."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"When I read the jacket for this book I thought, Oh no, how hokey. Here's another book about the President's family, and the books I've read lately with this type of story line have not rung true.Admittedly the presidental angle of this story is just a little hokey but Deborah Smith makes it work. The author pulls in the reader with great groundwork, inserts a strong heroine in a believable background, and then weaves a compelling story I couldn't get enough with an overall effect of a finely written concerto.Is it just another southern tale? Yes and no. Yes it's set in the south with many colorful southern folks but the author weaves these characters into a fine tapestry where they add a richness but never overtake the story.In addition, she adds a great hero who I came to empathize with until eventually I wanted and needed him to find his heart's desire. And he does, very satisfactorily.Put all the components together and voila--magic. The story made me laugh and cry and root for the characters; I couldn't put the book down. This is a gem in a long run of literary disappointments. Don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"The fifth of her line, Hush McGillen Thackery believes people are born to be whoever they want to be. It is all in how they tell their story. Hush spins a tale of true love, of the perfect Harvard son and of a successful apple farm. But love was rotten to the core with a man who did not live up to revered image, but whose presence made it acceptable for a business woman to succeed. Now secrets from the past threaten to bring down Hush's idealist image and destroy all she holds dear when her son Davis brings the world's scrutiny because he brings home his secret bride--the president's daughter.The president and his wife are convinced that Hush has ulterior motives and that the marriage between their daughter Hush's son was somehow coerced. They vastly underestimate this Appalachian queen who rules her home, farm and county. When they send the president's cousin Nicholas Jacobek to bring the situation under control, Hush meets the only man in her life who can match her skill at charming bees. But Jacob's dark past conceals a man of kindness and of mercilessness who will do anything to protect family, even kill.Author Deborah Smith succinctly captures the flavor of the south and of powerful matriarchs in SWEET HUSH. Readers will find it impossible to forget these rich characterizations and mesmerizing prose. Hush is blunt, fierce and determined, deserving of a hard man like Jacob. The president's wife Edwina would be easy to hate except Smith carefully reveals her vulnerabilities, devotion and motivation in a way that not only makes her understandable, but likeable despite her bitchy ways. Readers will delight in the image of Hush and Edwina throwing rotten apples at each other in the White House. Easily followed shifting points of view provide interior views of complex motives and tantalizing possibilities. In all, three love stories wind their way around the reader's heart, resulting in a must read tale reader's won't want to miss. SWEET HUSH earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"I have heard only but the good reviews on this book, now I know why.

This is my first Deborah Smith, I can't wait to read her other books.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"What a great read. Starts off a tiny bit slow, but sucks you in to an incredible plot with interesting characters. Our heroine is admirable; protects her family with all she has, reaches out to her extended family and community and is a role model of hard work and success.No erotic scenes, but aren't you a bit tired of them anyway!?Just a lovely romance of a young(er) widow and the man who has not known much love. Deborah Smith is a deep author with much to share. I've read some of her others and always found them fascinating."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"Fifth generation apple grower, Hush McGillen is proud of her Georgia mountain roots and being 100% American, but she never expected to be spending any time at the White House. She had not even contemplated visiting as a tourist. However, not only is she in DC and inside the Pennsylvania Avenue barriers, Hush is at war with the First Lady on the enemy's turf.The war of the women began when Hush's son Davis brings to the orchard his pregnant Harvard girlfriend, \\"Eddie\\" Jacobs. Now Eddie is no ordinary student as she is the First Daughter and she and Davis have slipped away from the Secret Service. Surprisingly, Hush turning deep purple when she begins to find the First Nephew quite attractive, but there still remains a war of the ladies to resolve as the vultures from the media begin turning over the red clay.The romance seems unlikely, but once the reader accepts that Eddie and Davis are an entry, the audience will appreciate the richness of the story line. The key to the tale is when Hush provides her first person observations of the past, present, and the future. When the nephew takes center stage, he behaves more like Edward G. Robinson in a flick than a relative of the first family. Still, fans of Deborah Smith will delight in her latest contemporary tale that sheds a deep light on rural Georgia.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"I acutally bought this for my kindle and fell so in love with this quirkly little story that I turned around and bought the hardback book for my mom.

It is a wonder story and a terrific read."},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"This book is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader.

However, despite her obstacles as an adolescent, she became one of those people who confronted adversity with an air of challenge. And she turned out to be a strong character in Deborah Smith's SWEET HUSH.Hush stuck me as one of those people who knows what they are destined for, as she rebuildt her family's empire as one of the heavyweight apple farmers in the state. The Sweet Hush apple, named after Hush's foremothers, was a sweet and rare fruit, and remained a central theme in her life.When Hush's son brought home the daughter of encumbent U.S. President Al Jacobs, Hush's quaint, quiet life in the Hollow of Sweet Hush Farms withstood some noteable changes. Hush had to look, once again, to the apple trees to guide her and console her through decisions she never thought she'd have to make.As this was my first time reading a work by Smith, I embarked on this reading journey with an open mind. I was looking for a good story with love, action, and lessons. I found these things in SWEET HUSH, a sensational novel.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Sweet Hush: A Novel","review":"Wonderful book filled with luscious language and deep characters that I would love to meet.

In thelatter category is the virial expansion for imperfect gases. Thisderivation makes an unnecessary effort to introduce a relativeactivity. The derivation in Jackson's book is more transparentand shorter without sacrificing rigor. The Mayer expansion forhard spheres is treated in useful detail.Chapter 18 includes a good description of the Debye-Hueckel theoryof electrolytes.

People who prefer long discussions rather than equations would absolutely hate this book. I would strongly reccommend everybody to take a chance with this book. I am a beginner only and do not have a good idea about the other books out there - but I find this book much more useful than those by Landau or Macquarrie (although I dunno about Chandler or Kardar or Pahtria).

Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I recently finished reading the whole of Perry's \\"Thomas & Charlotte\\" Pitt series, set in London of the 1880s and \`90s, so it seems reasonable now to work my way through this second, and in some ways subsidiary, series. Like Pitt, Inspector William Monk is a London cop -- but of a full generation before. This first novel is set in 1856, shortly after the Crimean War, when Pitt (as near as I can estimate) would have been a very small boy running around the estate where his father was the gamekeeper. Monk was apparently born around 1820 in a fishing village in Northumberland, and that difference of some three decades saw enormous changes in England, both socially and economically. (Similar to the changes in the world in which your grandparents lived in the 1930s, compared with 2008.) At the beginning of the story, Monk wakes up in hospital, having been involved in a terrible traffic accident in which he struck his head traumatically. Now he remembers nothing -- not even his name or what he looks like. By sheer luck and authorially mandated coincidence, he identifies his profession and finds his way to his rented rooms, but he's lost all his detective skills, all memory of his earlier cases. He has even apparently undergone a basic change in personality and doesn't care for what he discovers about his own character and reputation. Now, amnesia simply doesn't work like that, as Perry ought to know -- or as she ought to have found out while doing her research. Amnesiacs don't lose their own names any more than they forget how to walk or speak their native language. However, if one is willing to commit a willing suspension of disbelief, as they say, and accept what the author says has happened to Monk, then the portrait she paints of a strongwilled, intelligent, ambitious man struggling to find himself (and to defend himself) is quite fascinating. The actual plot involves the bloody beating-to-death of Major Joscelin Grey in his rooms by persons unknown and it doesn't take Monk long to eliminate all the possible suspects -- not a happy situation for a detective. As the investigation progresses (which Monk appears to manage more by instinct than by mounting an organized investigation), he meets a young married woman who obviously knew him before his accident -- but, of course, he doesn't remember her, though he certainly wishes he did. However, it's the woman's sister-in-law, Hester Latterly, who is obviously intended to become Monk's sidekick. She's a willful sort who went off to the Crimea to nurse the wounded and sick under Florence Nightingale and who has a very low tolerance for crap of any sort. (One has to wonder if she might have known Aunt Vespasia in her younger years. . . .) The plot and the action are pretty well worked out but it's the detailed characters who will hold your attention. And somehow, given Monk's rather dark psyche, I don't think he and Pitt would get along."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Face of a Stranger. Some sections were just a little slow moving, but on the whole I thought the pace was good - the setting is Victorian England, after all, where police work couldn't be expected to go at breakneck speed. The characterization was excellent, and I found myself becoming more and more involved in Monk's dilemma over his amnesia and his realizations about his own personality. If the amnesia is not accurately presented from a medical point of view I really don't mind, as I'm reading a novel not a textbook and I'm willing to suspend disbelief. Hester Latterly is a wonderful character, and I look forward to her appearances in the later books in the series. The conventions, attitudes, repressed emotions and hidebound respectability of the upper and middle classes of the time are accurate and very well described. A really good and involving read."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory.

The amnesia angle I didn't care that much for but Perry uses it to slowly develop her hero. To a degree this works and gives her plenty of room to take him wherever she feels. Hester is also a very good character who I see by other book jackets is a regular in the Monk mysteries. She's independent, clever and mature. It's pleasing to note that there's not a flicker of romance between the two, and I wait to see how the pair work together in the next book. The murder mystery is fairly standard but as always with Perry, the social constraints of the time are evoked well. You understand how men & women behaved the way they did."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"In Victorian-era London, a man awakens in a place he doesn't recognize. Gradually he realizes that he is in a hospital, and a nurse informs him that he has been waking each day unable to recall the day before. Now he can remember from day to day, but the past - his entire lifetime before the carriage accident that put him here - is a void. He knows he must be past 30 years old, but he cannot even recall his own name.He is William Monk, a police detective, according to the superior officer named Runcorn who grudgingly visits him. When he is released and goes to the address where he's told he lives, he discovers almost nothing about his past personal life. There are only paid bills in his desk, and letters from a sister in Northumberland. Since he knows of no other personal connection, and he is not yet well enough to work, he visits his sister - whom he has not seen in many years, so she finds it not a bit odd that they meet as strangers. After that he returns to London and reports to the police station, where Runcorn assigns him a case. Monk works desperately hard to keep everyone around him from guessing that he remembers nothing, and as he begins to learn about himself through the eyes of others he finds that he does not like the man he was at all. As for the case, he finds himself moving inexorably toward suspecting that the murderer may just be...none other than William Monk.I've read this series far out of order, catching up with its debut volume only after reading many subsequent installments. That did not harm my enjoyment one bit. I did find that the story flowed with less assurance, but that is only natural in the first book of a newly launched series. It was fun to learn how Monk met Hester Latterly, the former Crimean war nurse who later becomes such an important part of his new life; and the mystery worked well, although I did find it hard to believe that almost no one realized Monk's altered behavior was due to loss of memory.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I was delighted and captivated by this Anne Perry mystery. Her character, detective William Monk, wakes up in a Victorian hospital in 1857 or so, with no memory of who he is--but he does know enough to realize that the man visiting him at the hospital--his boss--is an unmitigated jerk who will ruin him, if he can. So Monk hides the depth of his amnesia and returns to work, to catch a killer and wrestle with the mystery of his own identity.He discovers two disquieting and alarming facts--that he is not a man imbued with sweetness and light, and that he might himself have been responsible for a murder.This is set against a canvas of exquisitely detailed mid-Victorian life and culture--bran pillows in the hospital!--and against Monk's own mysterious personality, which is in some ways, a character in its own right.I believe it is quite clear from the way Perry writes, what she thinks of her own actions. A very strong moral code tuns through all of her stories. I cannot praise this book or the author enough.

It is absorbing and well written. I was excited to see that recently (i.e., over the past few years) Ballentine Books is re-publishing the entire series in paperback. While the covers are absolutely beautiful, unfortunately, the paper that they use for the book is of mediocre quality. Further, given that the print is painfully small, with a poor choice of font and close typesetting, it becomes difficult to read this particular reprint of the book. The new paperbacks are definitely not worth the ~$15 price tag. I was a little surprised by this since the Random House Publishing Group has a reputation for quality work and Ballantine Books is one of their divisions."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"He wakes up in a London hospital in terrible pain. It's the nineteenth century, when hospitals kill as many people as they cure. He doesn't know how he got there or who he is. His very face in the mirror is the face of a stranger.Only when his boss appears at his bedside does he learn his name and profession: William Monk, police detective.Out of fear of seeming incompetent and/or losing his livelihood, Monk hides his memory loss from his landlady, his sister and his professional associates. Back at the station, he's given a difficult and sensitive case, the brutal murder of Major Joscelin Grey, and he struggles to solve it with no knowledge of his own skills.Oddly, his skills seem to be in place although his memory is not. This seems a bit far-fetched, but I'm assuming the author has researched amnesia.So William Monk is in the position of detecting a murderer, while detecting his own personality and history. He does observe, to his chagrin, that no one seemed to like the original William Monk, and he aspires to change this.The story, believable or not, is a good one, replete with family scandals, romantic elements and Victorian ambiance. I look forward to reading the next book in the series: A Dangerous Mourning. Will Monk ever recover his past entirely? Will he fall in love with - but I mustn't speculate!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"\\"Face of a Stranger,\\" a British mystery, is first in the series of historical novels about William Monk, a British Victorian-era policeman stationed in London, then, thanks to air pollution, the Big Smoke. It is written by Anne Perry, veteran prolific author of 14 further William Monk novels, also the popular Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels, as well as series on World War I and Christmas.Perry is surely one of the most unusual of mystery novelists, as she is, herself, a convicted murderer. She was born Juliet Hulme, in England, in 1938, daughter of Dr. Henry Hulme, a physicist. As she was diagnosed with tuberculosis, she was sent by her family to the Caribbean and South Africa, in search of healthier climes. She rejoined her family when her father took a position as rector of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. There she became extremely close friends with another teenager, Pauline Parker; the two girls brutally murdered Parker's mother in an extremely famous case, filmed in 1994 asHeavenly Creatures,( in which, I believe, the teenage Kate Winslet made her film debut, playing Hulme.) The girls were underage, and so were sentenced to incarceration at the discretion of the Minister of Justice, which proved to be for five years each. After she was released from prison, Hulme returned to England to become a flight attendant; she then settled in the United States, and finally Scotland, where she apparently still lives.The Cleveland Plain Dealer has said that \\"her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes,\\" and any reader must concur. She renders not only an extremely accurate account of the period, and its mores, but a passionate one, as regards the torment of the poor. For make no mistake, only a lucky few lived in the comfortable, easy \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" style we have come to take for granted; and, furthermore, only a lucky few were able to find positions as domestic servants to these people, and to benefit even a little from their comfort. The rest of the population lived short and miserable lives, in overcrowded, starved, diseased conditions; and William Monk, Perry's detective, is very aware of the dichotomy, and angered by it. Moreover, Perry sets the book during Britain's famed Crimean war: remember that classic poem, \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" by William Simpson? Well, British generalship at that war was extremely hidebound, and inadequate, and there never should have been a charge of the Light Brigade. In addition, conditions there for man and beast were so terrible as to bring the legendary Florence Nightingale, and her cadre of devoted nurses to the scene; to attempt to care for the wounded in a decent and sanitary way. And Perry has generously given us an interesting character, the proto feminist Hester Latterly, as a nurse who was there working with Nightingale, and witnessed it all. Well, it does occur to me, some of you may like this tough-minded history less than I do...The book is, of course, a mystery. William Monk comes to in a filthy London hospital after a head injury received in a serious accident; he has amnesia, and no idea who he is. Until his supervisor Runcorn shows up to tell him, and assigns him a recent case: the brutal murder of Major the Honorable Joscelin Grey, younger brother of the nobility, a popular man about town, and injured Crimean War veteran. \\"Face of a Stranger\\" is excellently done, well-written in plot, dialog, narrative, and nature description. I was initially annoyed by the over-used amnesia plot device, but have never seen it better handled, and am impressed by the writer's inventiveness - she is able to offer us several convincing scenarios as to what may have happened. Seems to me it's worth getting to know Victorian-era detective William Monk better."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Who knew that a character with no memory of who he is would be so compelling? Most authors who use the old \\"main character with amnesia\\" hook gradually return pieces of the past, eventually leading up to a final revelation that clears up all confusion. Perry is a brave author, she leaves her protagonist and the reader with fewer clues and more questions than they started with.The Face of a Stranger begins in a squalid hospital in Victorian England, where a patient has just woken from a coma. Having no memory of who he is or why he is there, he is shaken and fearful of what he might learn. Soon enough it comes to light that he is William Monk, a police officer who lost his memory in a violent carriage accident. Rather than admit he has no memory of his former life and risk losing his job, he returns to work and is immediately placed on the puzzling murder of a prominent English gentleman. As he investigates the case, he also searches for some recollection of his former life. Through the eyes of people he once knew, he learns that he was not a very nice man, in fact even he doesn't like his former self. One thing is undeniable though, he was an excellent crime solver and his skills are one thing that he has managed to retain. The only allies he has are his partner, John Evan, and a young nurse fresh home from the Crimean war, Hester Latterly. Evan seems to genuinely like Monk, while Hester can barely stand him. Together, they must piece together the solution to the case before all of London is calling for Monk's resignation.I can't explain what it is about this book that interests me. I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, but the interesting plot is a good point in Anne Perry's favor. William Monk is a very captivating lead, and Hester Latterly is a formidable foil for him. I'll definitely be picking up the next book."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"A man wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he is or what has happened to him.This is the first Anne Perry mystery I read and it had me hooked from the first page.Perry uses the artifice of amnesia to create a fascinating protagonist, a multifaceted character of exceptional depth. The reader joins Monk as he slowly discovers who he is--it is not always a pretty picture. One feels his desperation as he attempts to hide his memory loss and his frustration as he tries to solve a cold murder case and save his career.The story evokes all the splendor and squalor of Victorian era London. Perry has gift for creating atmosphere--you can almost feel the fog and smell the coal smoke.The murder mystery itself is interesting, it's resolution heartbreaking. But it is the enigma of William Monk that will stay in your mind long after you have closed the book.Happily, there are many more Monk novels to enjoy."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The first novel in a prospective mystery series must have certain qualities in order to be successful. First and foremost, the lead character must be appealing, even when flawed; the character must have redeeming qualities to endear him in some way to the reader. Then it helps if the mystery is well thought out, challenging and intriguing, and finally the supporting players must be well-rounded, characters that will continue to grow with the series. Perry succeeds in all these things with her introduction of William Monk. An amnesiac detective, in the middle of a case that will break him if handled incorrectly, fights to regain some semblance of what his life used to be all the while attempting to hide his impairment from all those involved. Monk's gradual discovery of his own past personality and his distaste for the man he was is an excellent idea to start the series and his original meeting with nurse Hester Latterly is a great example of the \\"tempestuous\\" meeting that often leads to romantic involvement in these types of books. Sure there's predictability to these types of books but with Monk, Perry has created a solid addition to the Victorian thriller genre."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"After waking in a hospital ward with no recollection of who or what he is, the man who comes to know himself as William Monk is forced to learn the rest, beyond his name and job title: Detective.

For what is there for the unemployed in Victorian London other than social shame and the poorhouse's cold charity?Forced to seek himself without letting anyone else in on the secret - he appeals to me on multiple levels. (So many &quot;want to find themselves&quot;, but don't want to admit they're looking.)A gritty, gruesome look at the reality behind the trashy romance novels of our day, Perry gives Dickens a run for his money in attemptying to portray a hand-to-mouth existance cohabitating with the posh luxury of 1850's London.Those familiar with 19th Century literature or who simply have a well-educated vocabulary will have little or no need of linguistic assistance.

He is a London detective and was working on a case at the time of his accident but now cannot remember anything about the details he learned through the course of his investigation.

He feels sure his direct supervisor Inspector Runcorn has no fond feelings for him at all.I like the character William Monk, I liked the premise that he has to conceal his memory loss so that he won't lose his livelihood, I liked the gritty period details and the character of Hester Latterly who has just returned from nursing in the Crimean War. The mystery was interesting and I was fearful about what Monk would discover about the murder as well as himself. I also liked Monk's coworker Sergeant John Evan. There was a good element of suspense that kept me reading and at the end of this novel as I said before I wanted to continue reading about Monk and Hester Latterly."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The first book in the Monk series was enjoyable and I am ready to read more. I love the setting."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The Face of a Stranger was enjoyable more for its time travel tour of London circa 1857 than for it mystery, which wasn't bad either. I had read other titles in the Monk series so I went into this book with preexisting knowledge of the main characters, but how fascinating it must be for those reading this mystery as an introduction to Anne Perry's 1850s series. Incidentally, I didn't figure out the solution to the mystery, but then again I am blessed with a capacity to sit back and be entertained instead of trying to figure things out. While not an earth shaking conclusion or even a pleasing one, there was and often is realism in how Ms. Perry wraps up her tales of sanguine crime.On to the next!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"William Monk doesn't remember his name. He doesn't remember his life, his past, who he is and what he's like. Those who know him tell him he's a detective with the police, but Monk can't remember having anything to do with the police. In fact, he doesn't even remember his family, or his childhood. When he looks in the mirror, he sees a stranger, not his own face. But he must hide his lack of memory if he's to discover who he is. Life as a detective may give him some insight as to who he is. But then he is put on the most difficult case - the case of Major Joscelin Grey, who has been beaten to death in his own appartment, and then further beaten after he was dead. As Monk tries to hide his loss of memory, he must solve the two cases thrust upon him - Major Grey's as well as his own - at the cost of much more than anyone can fathom.____________________________________________I'm utterly impressed. What a story - what characters - what a murder and a way to solve it. I've read one other Anne Perry novel (Buckingham Palace Gardens) and was completely engrossed. I expected to love this one....and boy, did I!I'll start with the characters. You know those characters that you love from the moment you meet them? Well, here's one that I loved from page one...literally. I loved him when he was waking in darkness, all alone, with no memory. I wanted to be his friend, to see him well, to watch him build success after such an accident - such a downfall. His name is William Monk. All of Anne Perry's characters are very humanized, to say the least. They all feel - love, hate. They cry and laugh. They all struggle with something deeper than the surface. And while it is fascinating to see this in her other characters, with William Monk, it was a treat, a desert to be savored. We watch him as he is seeing himself - as though for the first time, with no recollection of the past. We are a part, from the very beginning, of his self-discovery. We see what he sees, understand what he understands. We are kept in the dark and we are captivated by the newness of Monk's life as it is to him, however old or young he may be. The rest of Anne Perry's characters, while not seen from this angle and depth, are all so well drawn out that within a few sentences about them, you feel as though you know them, and yet you have a fascination to learn evern more.I really enjoyed Evan's character as well, and the part he plays in the story. He's a young, new detective who looks up to the brilliant William Monk with an innocence that makes him human. As you watch Monk and the story unfolding, you also see what it's like to be a newbie detective in Victorian England. Evan affected Monk's character in ways that I loved - but you'll have to read the book to see for yourself!The story line here is interesting and quite original. (There have been books about lost memories before, and there will be more, I'm sure, but this had something unique to it.) While it fluctuates from being a page-turner to just your average mystery novel, it never lost my interest...not once. And I never felt lost about what was going on. Even with twists in the story and new additions of suspects and characters, I felt on top of the case and ready to kick some murderer-butt.And then there is the writing.... It's smooth, like melted chocolate - and it tastes just as good. She writes simply, elegantly, and with a class and style that is a God-given gift. The quote that I posted last week is an example of her perfect and realistic descriptions. I read this and I immediately cared for the woman she was describing - and I didn't even know her name. (Her dialogue is also realistic and very intriguing. It's very right for the time period.)Oh, and the end... Don't even get me started on how shocked and excited and nervous I got.So would I recommend this book? Yes: to anyone (probably older teen to adult) who can read. It's captivating, realistic (that's another thing - Anne Perry doesn't hold back on her crimes, which is also the reason I recommend it to older teens), and intense. And there's Monk - need I say more? I think we've established this, by now, that he's my favorite character. And one word I would use to describe this book: exquisite. (Like melted chocolate.) This book is especially wonderful if you're looking for a mystery with the feel of Sherlock Holmes - except one that's longer and has more depth. You'll get that...and a story that relies deeply on the patterns of human nature to solve crimes, which makes for a very interesting case."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I have only recently discovered Anne Perry and her two series of Victorian mysteries. I am in love with William Monk. I have read both series, Charlotte and Thomas Pitt and William Monk, and Monk is my favorite by just a hair. I have just recently ordered ALL of the back list of Monk novels and am looking forward to lots and lots of reading pleasure. Get these books you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The only reason I didn't rate \\"I love it\\" is that statement is offensive to me except in something (or someone) I really love, as: I love God, I love The Lord with all my heart, I love my wife. I really did like the story and the suspense went to the very end. Very enjoyable. Anne Perry does well."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I loved this book! Amnesia stories are always interesting, and this one is especially so as the main character is right in the middle of solving a horrible murder when he has an accident and loses his memory. Very exciting - can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"After reading the last of the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Series I felt let down with nothing to follow. I finally, after some months and reading various other authors, started with the first of Perry's Monk series. Wow, I am happy again in the familiarity of this author's classy style. 'Face of A Stranger', the 1st in the Monk Series, is full of suspense, is really an interesting story, and was hard to put down once I had started to read. I am truly looking forward to reading the next in this series."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a fan of Anne Perry. The Thomas andCharlotte Pitt series is very good. Ms. Perry writes with suchdetail about this era and it is always very evocative. I like theWilliam Monk/Hester Latterly series very much. Monk is a man withouta memory in this first book and Nurse Latterly helps solve the murderwhile easing Monk's fears that he knows something quite terribleabout the murder but has forgotten it. I have read the next two booksin this series and I can honestly say that Monk & Latterly will bea team as the series moves on. Very enjoyable so far."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"In a nutshell: This is the first in Anne Perry's \\"William Monk\\" mysteries. William Monk, detective, lost his memory in a carriage accident. He tries to recover bits and pieces of his life while trying to solve the murder of Joscelin Grey, a member of the nobility. To help him in this is his partner, Evan, and Hester Latterly, formerly one of Florence Nightingale's nurses.My opinion: I like the characters in this, but I prefer Perry's other Victorian series, featuring Charlotte & Thomas Pitt. That aside, I thought the characters were rather well developed but this story focused primarily on Monk, due to his loss of memory. That was ok with me since I didn't really care all that much for Hester anyway. She was a little too harsh for me to like her, but I thought she was well-written.Meanwhile, I ruined this book for myself by inadvertently reading the second book first. Hence, I already knew who the killer was since he stands trial in the second book,A Dangerous Mourning. I do believe, if I hadn't already known, I would have been very surprised by the outcome, something to be desired in a mystery novel. On a historical note: I am not an \\"expert\\" on Victorian England, since I tend to focus a little more on the Regency, but what I read seemed quite accurate.I apologize if my thoughts here seem a little haphazard. Truthfully, I started this book over a year ago and had trouble getting into it. I completely blame my mistake for this (see above), not the author."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I'm not a fan of every Anne Perry series, and but these books featuring William Monk are chewy-chunky delicious. This is the first in the series. Set in mid-nineteenth century London and featuring a police detective who has lost his memory in an accident, they are studies of the inequities of the past and the horrors of Victorian England, wonderfully character-dense, and intricate mysteries. Almost all of them end with a dramatic trial with lots of intrigue and machinations. Therein lies a strength and something of a weakness, as the trials are enthralling, but sometimes (in some of the books) seem over-long to me.In this first book, fresh from the accident and memory loss, William Monk tries to cover up the fact that he doesn't know who he is or anything about his life. If he loses his job as police inspector, he could well end up in the poor house, a Victorian horror. So he tries to piece together who he is at the same time he tries to solve a murder. The more he finds out about the man he's been, the less he likes himself, and as he gets closer to the resolution of the mystery, he fears he himself may be the prime suspect."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"This book was very well written. Detective Monk awakes in a hospital after an accident with amnesia. He quickly realizes that in order to keep his job he must solve the case without letting his boss know that he has no memory of life before the accident. The author does a very good job of keeping your interest with a great cast of characters. I am very excited to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The idea of the book being William Monk awakens in hospitial without a memory. The book is as much a search for his identity as it is solving the crime. I enjoyed the overall idea for the book, even if it is a tad unrealistic. But I am willing to cut the author a little slack. William Monk is a likable hero even though he often seems a little weak. His sidekick was also interesting but not fully defined. This may have changed in later books. The only problems i really had with the book is her use of Victorian slang, she does not always let us know what the slang means. The book ends very abruptly without finding out what happened to the arrested party. The book is a much better read in Victorian England. I am not sure that it would have held my interest had it been modern. Although not on a level with Sherlock Holmes novels, this book was still interesting and enjoyable. If you like Victorian mystery then give this book a read."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Interesting twist to the normal murder mystery plot. Nice character development made all the richer by the setting in Victorian England. I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read more Ann Perry Novels and learn more about William Monk!!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"This is the second Anne Perry novel I've read, and unfortunately it's likely to be the last. Her plotting is strong, but she clearly wants to focus on character development. That would be fine if her writing skills were stronger. I found the first sixty pages of this book so repetitive that I nearly didn't bother to finish it. The premise -- that Monk has lost his memory and must relearn who he is -- is quite interesting, but Perry tries to develop Monk's character through the constant and highly repetitive (read: increasingly tedious) exposition of his thoughts in the form of questions. How many times does the reader need to know explicitly that Monk is asking himself what sort of man has few friends and no loves, or inspires trepidation in his coworkers? If Perry were a more skilled writer she could convey \\"character\\" less directly and more effectively. Was her editor asleep on the job?"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Overall, I liked this book, but didn't love it. I have only read one other Anne Perry, The Cater Street Hangman, which I didn't like at all. So, this was a vast improvement. That said, parts of it were very slow and repetitious which detracted from an otherwise good story. I really wanted to like these books as they came so highly recommended by friends with whom I share a lot of common interests and a love of historical fiction. This just isn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I enjoyed this, but man... it took me a long time. Two weeks! Part of that was the fault of my schedule, but it was also a slow-moving story. When you first meet Monk, he doesn't know who he is. I think this lends an extra bit of flair to this book -- you don't have any background about your main character. As he relearns about himself, you're learning about him too. And since he doesn't particularly like what he's learned about himself, you get to see him grow. He really doesn't have a choice but to become an entirely new person.The mystery here is interesting, but it's the main reason that the plot is slow-going. Things didn't become really interesting until Monk started putting the pieces together and remembering things, and that's more than 3/4 of the way through the book. My only other experience with Anne Perry is her Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels, and I didn't think this was quite as good. I'll read more in the series because I really like a good historical mystery, but I'm going to have to work my way into the next one."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I can't wait to read another of Anne Perry's Books. This book kept be busy for hours on end."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never \\"come clean\\" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I picked this book up on a lark, just browsing at the library through the stacks. I can't even say what caught my eye about it. After reading it, however, I heartily recommend the book.The story starts with an amnesiac detective in the mid-19th century in London. As he returns to duty, he needs to rediscover himself as much as he needs to solve the case that he is assigned. I particularly enjoyed the idea that Monk, the protagonist, didn't like his old self that much (even though I don't think amnesia would change a person's basic traits). In any case, the Crimean War background, along with fine writing, make this historical mystery stand out. I plan to read other Monk novels after giving myself a short break.I think this book will mainly appeal to two types of readers: first, hardcore mystery readers will enjoy the twists and turns of a traditional &quot;let's gather in the library so I can tell you who did it&quot; mystery; second, readers of historical fiction will enjoy, as I did, the gas-lit streets of London, the withdrawing rooms, and the spiritual depression of the British following the catastrophe that was the Crimean War.All in all, this is a quick read that combines an interesting plot with high quality writing."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"The mistake Perry made in her Pitt series was developing her characters too quickly--she has had to compensate by introducing a rather large cast of supporting characters. This, the first in her William Monk series, avoids that gaffe by inducing amnesia in her hero--he hardly knows who he is or what he's about. It may be preposterous, but it's also an enjoyable read and an outstanding mystery.The story has Monk attempting to learn the set of circumstances that resulted in his hospitalization and amnesia--he must face the horrifying possibility that he was involved in a vicious crime, and he knows too little of himself to trust that he was incapable of such a deed. He learns through the reactions of others that he was (is?) not a nice man, and the more he learns, the more he doubts himself. The fact that his past does not come flooding back to him after another bump on the head speaks well to Perry's prowess as a writer.Hester Latterly and Oliver Rathbone are the edgy counterparts to Monk's dark personality. Though never friends, these three circle each other with wary respect. Monk himself is an appealing character, the mystery is top-notch, and the Victorian setting is quintessential Perry--she has made it uniquely her own."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I have read 3 or 4 William Monk books, but didn't pay any attention to order. I have really enjoyed them, so I thought I would start at the first and read them all in order. Now I more clearly understand about Monk's amnesia. It was really fun learning about Monk's 1st meeting with Hester Latterly. Great ending, although I felt very sympathetic to the killer. I love Anne Perry's books. Next, I'll probably read the Thomas Pitt novels in order."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"In this book, William Monk wakes in a hospital in Victorian London with no memory of who he is or even what he looks like. This devastatingly frightening condition is no match for Monk though; his deep-seated instincts, which made him a formidable police detective (as he learns is his profession), lead him to slowly figure out, little by little, who he is and allow him solve a brutal murder.Anne Perry provides a good mystery with a twist. I really liked the way she provided insight into Monk's thought process, fear and confusion while trying to discover all he can about himself.I gave this book four stars instead of five only because I guessed ahead of time a significant plot point; however, this book is still a four star novel because I was surprised by the ending and was very impressed and fascinated by the way Perry introduces her characters, lets us get one impression of each, and then provides more in-depth information and personality development.This book will pull you right in!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Even though the first few chapters seemed a bit slow for my taste, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The personal problem of William Monk is different from most main characters in other books. The reader is getting to know him as he, too, is getting to know himself. I was surprised at the end of chapter 10 when he remembered something about himself, and for those who have read this book will know why. John Evan and Hester Latterly are other characters I liked, and I'm glad to hear they are in the other books. I didn't care too much for Hester's &quot;flashbacks&quot; from the war, but then at the end I was thankful there was a reason for them. I will definitely read the next book, A Dangerous Mourning, despite some of the bad reviews written about it."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Yes, it's that vital. I picture the Timothy Dalton circa BBC's \\"Jane Eyre\\" to be very similar to the wolfish, well-dressed, passionate William Monk. Once you get to know him (despite his memory loss) you'll care very much about his character in subsequent novels. He's definitely a unique character in mystery fiction. This novel features a decent mystery, but serves mostly to introduce us to a completely different set of characters, and indeed a different time period than the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels. You'll like Hester Latterly, who reminds me of Emma Thompson. She nursed the wounded in the horrific battlegrounds of the Crimea, and is full of righteous indignation about hospital reform. Oliver Rathbone is a surprisingly moral barrister who takes a shine to Hester immediately, unlike Monk who keeps trying to convince himself that she is NOT his type. (Methinks he doth protest too much...) Dive on in and get ready for a steady series of interesting mysteries and even better courtroom scenes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"I went through the Pitt series first and picked up the Monk series with some trepidation...after twenty-odd books the Pitts were all beginning to look alike. I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;The Face of a Stranger&quot; and the Monk series remains one of my favorites.Actually, it *is* possible to incur brain injury erasing memory but not touching your skills. We learned in class here at university about that, as they involve two separate areas of the brain. There are folks that can't remember yesterday but can still beautifully play the piano, perform surgery, etc.True, some of Monk's amnesia is a bit selective, but this is a work of fiction and thus does entail inclusion of some possibly not-perfectly-realistic elements.Monk's a great character, if not one easy to like. Flawed and all-too-human, it's also fun to watch his development through later books, so don't give up on him after &quot;Face&quot;. Thomas Pitt was a *little* too perfect for my taste, so I rather like the darker character Monk presents. It's also a relief that Monk does not spontaneously recover his memory in a common author's cop-out. Also, Hester Latterly's the perfect foil for him, and their clashes are always amusing to read in each book, right from that first meeting in the countryside.The mystery itself is interesting, and I noted that Ms. Perry once said that she intended for this to be a one-time book and not a series, intending to have Monk be the killer. I'm very glad she decided not to abandon him, even if he needs a good reality check at times. Not the absolute best of the Monk series, but a spirited and promising beginning to a great series."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Inspector Monk is one of the most riveting figures you will ever come across in Victorian mysteries. Initially, I was not sure that I would like this Anne Perry series because of the initial premise (Monk has had an accident and cannot remember his own identity or anything about his past life) nor was I sure I would like a series without Charlotte Ellison Pitt! I was drawn in immediately by Perry's amazing ability to explore the secrets that can reside within the most seemingly secure and blameless households.The Inspector Monk novels (of which this is the first) are darker and more gritty than the Pitt novels. There are few veils between the cruel and dangerous world of mid-century London and the reader, which gives the novels a faster pace and often more complicated plots. While some readers have taken issue with the amnesiatic Inspector Monk, I feel that his lack of awareness about his own past is a metaphor for the blindness his social betters are willing inflict upon themselves in order to keep up appearances. Monk's desire to KNOW, however, provides an interesting point of comparison with the people he must investigate who seem not to want to know anything at all that will make their lives unpleasant.I have spoken more about character than plot in this review, and that is largely because Anne Perry's mysteries seem to me to pivot on their protagonists's characters. The plot of this novel, and the mysteries at the center of it, do not disappoint any more than the characters. As Monk tries to untangle his own personal mysteries, he is expected to get to the bottom of a mystery that involves death, financial ruin, and the closely-guarded secrets of some very proper families."},{"Title":"Face of a Stranger (William Monk)","review":"Amnesia has probably occured in fiction more often than in fact. But rarely has it been handled better than is in this fascinating mystery, The Face of a Stranger. Imagine waking up not knowing who you are. Imagine having to pretend you haven't lost your memory because acknowledging it would mean the end of your job and probable poverty. Perry explores this fascinating territory in the character of William Monk, working class Victorian detective.The characters are probably the strongest part of this novel. Monk is most interesting as snatches of his past are revealed to him -- not all of which are pleasant. Hester Latterly is introduced as the veteran of Crimean War nursing (think Florence Nightengale). Even the circle of friends and acquaintences of the victim span a variety of circumstances. The Crimean War also plays a significant role as England struggles to come to terms with its lost sons and prestige.The unraveling of the mystery works quite well with an appropriate number of informative red herrings.All things considered, a dandy read. The book is a bit on the dark and bleak side, but nothing so depressing that you wouldn't want it for a vacation read. I look forward to learning more about Monk in the next book in the series, A Dangerous Mourning."},{"Title":"Science of the Gods","review":"'Science of the Gods' by David Ash and Peter Hewitt is a great place to begin if you're a novice in the mysterious and thought provoking universe of quantum physics. This rather slender paperback, only 192 pages in length, is simply crammed with infomative material. Such topics as resonance theory, super energy, time and space considerations, matter and the space vortex, parallel worlds and multi-layered, interconnected dimensions are intelligently discussed in an easy to understand manner. This is one of the real strengths of this book, its accessibility to the average reader.Add to that numerous and fascinating accounts of otherworldly encounters with beings from 'The Dimension of the Gods' makes this book not only informative, but highly entertaining. My personal favorite section is chapter 9 - The Return of Pan.Have Ash and Hewitt successfully reconciled science and the supernatural? Probably not, but it makes for a good read all the same. Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"What would a comprehensive graduate exam in political science or political behavior be without a review of Zaller's now classic text?

However, it is very dense, is chock-full of advanced statistics above the head of most political science graduate students, and therefore at the end of the day is somewhat unsatisfying.If you need a primer on public opinion research, this isn't it. But if you want to read cutting-edge work, and you have a good grasp of statistics, dive in."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"An interesting, and occasionally vexing, topic of study in political science is public opinion. In his book The American Democracy Thomas Patterson touches upon myriad issues that surround this topic: the difficulties in accurately measuring public opinion, the inconsistencies and fluidity of public opinion, and political socialization are just a few of the factors of interest to political scientists that Patterson examines. However, no introductory text can examine such a multifaceted topic in great depth, and as a result on page two-hundred eleven of his book Patterson recommends John R. Zaller's The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion as a good source for more in-depth information about public opinion formation and measurement. Indeed, Patterson characterizes Zaller's work as \\"[a] superb analysis of the nature of public opinion\\" (211). Zaller examines many, if not all, of the factors that influence public opinion, spending a great deal of time examining the affect of information on political opinions and election choices, and the impact of \\"elite domination of public opinion\\" (310). But Zaller's work is perhaps best known for its thoughtful examination of public opinion instability, an examination that challenges traditional thinking on the topic. And, while not perfect, it is easily one of the most important and influential works written on this subject.As Zaller highlights, variances in survey results has traditionally been attributed to \\"measurement error\\" which is built into a survey or the presence of \\"nonattitudes\\"(i.e. respondents answer questions about which they have no strong opinion) (31). In the broadest sense, The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion strives to refute these explanations; and instead posits that a combination of factors, including the degree of ambivalence an individual has related to a specific topic, the general level of interest a person has in a topic, and what information has been encountered and how recently, more accurately explain response instability. Zaller does an excellent job of building his case for this perspective; in particular the use of literature from disciplines other than political science is especially compelling. Supported by this literature, and compelling in its own right, are the axioms that comprise his \\"Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model\\" (58). The author painstakingly examines each of his axioms and examines each in relationship to real world data which serves to further strengthen his arguments. As a result it seems clear that his contentions that individuals who are more aware of the political process are also more likely to perceive political messages, while at the same time resisting messages that run counter to their own political biases, have great validity. Further, Zaller's argument that there is a high degree of ambivalence on many issues is well supported by the analysis of the findings from the 1987 pilot study that is cited (63). Finally, even though the author acknowledges the inherent challenges in proving the validity of axiom four, he makes a compelling case by utilizing literature from the field of psychology (62). The result is an intriguing model that, rather than assuming that \\"response error is simply so much noise . . . [or] signifies nothing of interest\\" instead argues that \\"response variation is rooted in an important substantive phenomena, namely the common existence of ambivalence in people's reactions to issues\\" (75). Of further importance and interest are the series of deductions that the author forms through the application of his model to real world circumstances.While it is impractical to examine each of Zaller's deductions there are two that are especially significant. The author's third deduction is representative of the very essence of his RAS model and its implications: If people form conflicting considerations on most issues, and if they base their surveyresponses on whichever of these considerations happen to be at the top of the head atthe moment of response, one should expect a fair amount of variability in people's responses to survey questions. (64).This \\"top of the head\\" argument is fundamental to the author's perspective, and Zaller offers numerous citations in support of this deduction. The result is a sea change in the way that response instability is perceived. A second deduction that is quite compelling examines the relationship between political attitudes and the political messages of the powerful and elite:[T]he population as a whole should be able to develop more stable attitudes for issues on which partisan elites divide sharply and clearly, thereby providing clearer message cues for everyone. Conversely, attitude stability should be weaker for issues on which partisan divisions are hazy or nonexistent, because in such cases the public gets few message cues. (67).The validity of this deduction has been proven out over the past thirty years. On a whole series of issues, including reproductive health and immigration, the messages espoused by the major political parties have become increasingly polarized and that polarization has increasingly been reflected in attitudes amongst the electorate. The RAS model, and the deductions that flow from it, represent a significant addition to the body of literature in political science. However, though Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion is an invaluable work, it is not without its faults.One small criticism that can be made is the relatively sparse discussion of the survey instrument from which much of the data used to test the RAS model. More to the point, it would be helpful to have the instrument included as an appendix to the book. Zaller does identify the pilot study used, and it is currently available online (after registering with the online host, and assuming that one has access to the statistical software necessary to open the documents), however, in order to test, and adequately assess, Zaller's conclusions the raw data must be readily accessible. A more significant criticism of the RAS model itself is an important assumption upon which it is built - that of the type of information individuals receive and process:The Receive-Accept-Sample Model is . . . a set of claims about how citizens acquire \\"information\\" and convert it into attitude statements . . . [O]ne cannot test the model without making definite assumptions about the information environment that sustains citizens' attitudes on a given issue. For purposes of this chapter, I make the following simple assumption about this environment: that it consists of moderately intense,temporally stable information flows favoring both the liberal andconservative side of each issue. By moderately intense I refer to information flows that involve neither dominating headline stories . . . nor obscure or esoteric stories. (58)The definition suffers from vagueness that is difficult to overstate, and ignores the fact that what a researcher might define as \\"esoteric\\" could be perceived as most significant to a member of the public. Given that the RAS model is what Zaller defines as an \\"information processing model\\" (58), the imprecise manner in which information environment and information flow are defied is a serious flaw.For many decades there has been an assumption amongst political scientists that variations in survey responses stemmed from flaws inherent to the survey instrument itself. In The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion, John Zaller exposes the flaws inherent in such thinking. Despite some non-fatal shortcomings the author builds a persuasive case that, where survey instruments are free of bias, response instability is the expression of the uncertainty that many people feel on a wide array of issues."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"Zaller turns our perception of polling data on its ear. People don't think about most issues until they are asked, so opinion surveying might actually do more to shape opinions than actually report on them."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"You want to know about public opinion? Read this book. You want to study political science past the undergraduate level? Read this book."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"Zaller offers an insight into how public opinion is created and shifted to individuals. His view is that opinion is created within the circles of the elite, where political issues are given the proper amount of thought and consideration. After all, many in the public will not have the same time to devote to deciding what should be done in a particular instances. Zaller argues that the fact the media discusses the opinions of the elite ensures that the public will gain some insight into what they should think. A great example would be Glenn Beck and his legion of listeners. These people listen to Beck and get an idea of what is important to think about, but not how to think. They become informed about the what, but not exactly the how, unless they like those who are telling them of the issue. What all this means for the public is that issues are created among the elite and then communicated to the public, which insures that issues that are relevant to the public might not get the coverage they deserve. Anyway, this is a good book, but not for the masses. Sorry, but still good."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"I had to read this book for a class at school and its very well written. This book is very informative and a recommend reading."},{"Title":"The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (Cambridge Studies in Public Opinion and Political Psychology)","review":"The effectiveness and accuracy of public opinion polls was always assumed, until this important and enlightening book. Zaller consolidates previous doubts about the very definitions of public opinion and how to measure it, and shows the shaky foundations of public opinion polls. In the fascinating early chapters of this book, we find that people's political opinions and poll responses are often distressingly inconsistent; with destabilizing effects from poll design, the ordering and language of questions, whether or not the person recently heard about the issues, and each person's level of ideology and receptiveness to ideas.But this does not prove that people are uninformed, but that standard polling is woefully inadequate in measuring all of the idiosyncrasies of the human mind, and one's opinions on complicated political matters. This book gets off to a great start by illuminating such fallacies. The first few chapters are strong enough to earn this book accolades as a poli-sci landmark. But after proving that public opinion is perhaps unmeasurable (at least accurately), Zaller then spends the rest of the book measuring it himself anyway, with self-designed statistical models. However, it becomes difficult to tell whether he is using the results of his measurements to gain insight into actual public opinion, or merely to prove the viability of his own statistics.By the middle of the book Zaller has embarked on a tedious and uninspiring academic exercise in statistical modeling that adds little to the points that were already made convincingly early on. Unnecessarily complex statistical equations are piled on mundanely, along with unenlightening charts and graphs. Like many other political science writers, Zaller has focused on pleasing his colleagues who are more likely to be impressed by repetitive evidence and windy statistics, while forgetting about the informed general reader who may just find the big-picture conclusions fascinating. That makes the majority of this book somewhat disappointing, rather like standing on a mountaintop on a cloudy day. You know the view (i.e. insights into the political knowledge of the masses) could be tremendous, if it wasn't obscured by clouds (i.e. academic tedium). True knowledge can be gained by disregarding the dusty science of this book and concentrating on the greater insights that lie beneath.

I am not sure that this series is at quite the same level--but it is a very good resource for younger kids any way you look at it.This volume focuses on \\"The World We Live In.\\" The Time-Life works are organized in a Q-A format: a question is posed and then the book provides an answer that is developmentally appropriate for the audience. There are also sidebar comments for parents, to assist in parents and children talking about the various subjects covered.First question (pages 4-5)? \\"Why are some countries hot while others are cold?\\" The text then answers by discussing different climate zones--from tropical to dry to highland. Following is an obvious succeeding question: \\"What are the world's hottest places?\\" Did you know that (as of date of publication anyhow) the hottest day on earth had been 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit in Al Azizyah, Libya.Or, \\"Why do the Lapps keep herds of reindeer?\\"(Pages 18-19) Or, \\"Why do the people of the Netherlands build so many dikes?\\" Or \\"Why do people around the world dress differently?\\" Or \\"What musical instruments do different people play?\\"As one might guess, an ancillary benefit of this book is introducing kids to diversity in its many forms, coming to learn that people behave very differently in different areas of the world.All in all, a solid entry in the series.

The story also covers the tale of a horse born into uncertain circumstances and travels through numerous adventures before winding up with an owner who truly appreciates her."},{"Title":"FATHERS & HERETICS","review":"I am shocked that this book has not been reissued, owing not only to the author's genius and wit but to the subject matter itself. Fathers and Heretics is in my mind one of the best introductions to the personalities and ideas at play in the early Church. What you come away with from this very well written and accessible text is a broadening of your appreciation and understanding of what it means to believe in Christ. We sometimes tend to understand our beliefs as immediately drawn from Scripture, without the intermediaries of Fathers and heretics who have greatly shaped what we mean by theology. Our faith does not live in a vacuum and it is historically conditioned. What Prestige shows is that, if you are in line with the Fathers, you are in line with the revelation of God in Christ, and you owe them a big \`thank you' for their defense of the faith once delivered to the saints. For in reality, we do not believe what we believe from a virgin reading of the Bible; we are conditioned. And if you are in line with the heretics (most of whom were honest men who sought what was true, but unwilling to be open to being wrong), you are in good modern company, but not in the Church, since the great heresies for the earlier periods have resurfaced under new names, with the fundamental philosophical or theological errors are the same. Either way, we are very much \`done unto'. Topics include the following:- Tradition, or the scriptural basis of theology- Callistus, or faith in a divine savior- Origen, of the claims of religious intelligence- Athanasius, or the unity of God- Apollinaris, or divine irruption- Nestorius, or redeemed humanity- Cyril, or one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism- Eros, or devotion to the sacred humanity- IndexAlso highly recommended is Prestige'sGod in Patristic Thought,Cruelty of Heresy : An Affirmation of Christian Orthodoxy,Heresies and How to Avoid Them: Why It Matters What Christians Believe,Beginning to Read the Fathers,The Fathers of the Church, Expanded Edition,The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, Vol. 1: The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition (100-600),Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes,Evangelicals and Tradition: The Formative Influence of the Early Church (Evangelical Ressourcement: Ancient Sources for the Church's Future)andChristianity and Classical Culture: The Metamorphosis of Natural Theology in the Christian Encounter with Hellenism (Gifford Lectures Series).

The Continental Divide hardly figures into things; in fact I think the South Park WY crossing (on the Oregon Trail) is the only pass across The Divide mentioned. And it's not that Ferguson uses The Divide as a sort of metaphor for a divided country, or some such thing. If anything the Rockies as a whole appear here as an attractor, or maybe a canvas upon which various aspects of the country's psyche play out in several ways. I'd put Ferguson generally in the McPhee camp of writing, as this is a mixture of historical reportage and philosophizing about the cultural milieu both past and present; but don't expect as much science/geology as you might get w/McPhee.A lot of the activity in the book takes place in other parts of the country, whether it's the Great Plains or in magazines popular along the eastern seaboard, rather than in the Rockies proper. Much of the book centers on the 19th century, when the Rockies were first being explored and settled -- if that's the word for it -- by Anglos; though men like Pike, Fremont, and Hayden are mentioned, most of the focus is on the trappers and \\"mountain men\\" rather than the official explorers and surveyors. Instead of very much about the mining days 100+ years ago we get much on the health mecca and dude ranch aspects. And while there are plently of colorful characters, it isn't *that* sort of a book. Only the last two (short) chapters cover the time after World War II.So to me it seemed like a somewhat random walk that I wouldn't have thought to take on my own. If there had been some great new theme(s) or revelation(s) which resulted from Ferguson's rambles I might have liked the book more. But I was left with wondering why he chose to focus on the somewhat unusual or off-beat subjects that he did. Oh well, at least it was something kinda different."},{"Title":"The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind","review":"This book nicely reviews how the place of the Rockies in the American imagination has changed over time. Americans originally saw the Rockies as a worthless \\"desert\\" but later became interested in classical conservation (like Teddy Roosevelt). Recent decades have seen the arrival of hippies, temporary residents, tourists, and dude ranches, among others. The book does not focus on the factual side of these changes - how many hippies were there and where did they go or how long did they stay - but rather on everyone's alleged views of the Rockies. In other words, it is more an \\"intellectual\\" history than a social, economic or political history, and a pop-intellectual history at that.As is normal for these kinds of books, the evidence is not systematic but anecdotal. Ferguson's synthesis of each period's view of the Rockies is highly personal and it would be easy to construct alternative accounts. His book also does not go into any great depth, though it compensates for this in breadth of coverage. It can't hold a candle to Nash's \\"Wilderness and the American Mind,\\" but it does cover a slightly different cast of characters and would be a fine companion volume.The main line of the narrative warrants some reflection. Ferguson sees a development over the last century from early tourists who wanted to spend extended time in the Rockies, whether camping or visiting dude ranches, to the modern tourist who wants to drive through the park, take a few pictures, and leave. If you're thinking of buying this book for a vacation in the Rockies, I hope you'll be one of the people who relax and stay a while.All in all, the book was interesting enough, well-written and a quick read. However, it didn't leave a lasting impression and I wouldn't go out of your way to read it. It would make a pleasant companion on a hotel balcony overlooking a mountain, or outside your tent in the backcountry. I gave it three stars as part of a struggle to stop grade inflation at Amazon, but most people would probably give it four."},{"Title":"The Great Divide: The Rocky Mountains in the American Mind","review":"This is an excellent book: full of history, information, stories, and insights about the Rocky Mountains.

Not only did it increase my excitement about going to and being in the mountains (at one point I read it while sitting next to a lake in Rocky Mountain National Park at 10,000 feet with an afternoon storm coming in), but it made me think about them in ways I had not previously considered.

The fantastic wording creates vivid pictures in the mind, and slips a moral in while you're not looking. I struggle to describe my appreciation for this wonderful compilation of tales.

Finger won the John Newbery Award in 1925. I didn't know anything about the book when I picked it up other than it's Newbery, but I must say, I was quite pleasantly surprised by what I found.I have always loved Fairy Tales. Like, a lot. If you remember, a few weeks ago I talked about my first experience reading Grimm's Fairy Tales, which helped cement my love for reading them as well. (If you are really interested, click here, and you can go back and read it.) So, imagine my delight when I realized this was a collection of 19 fairy tales recorded by Finger from South America. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about other countries and their rich cultural histories as I'd like to be, I'm always open to learning more. And I think you can learn a lot about a society from their fairy tales and children's stories.This was a real treat for me to read, and one I'm definitely looking forward to adding to my shelves and rereading, not only for myself but also to read to kids. I used to read some of the Grimm's fairy tales to my little brothers as a bedtime story, and I'd love to be able to add these tales to stories I can read/tell to young kids.Although some of these stories might be classified as more mythology than fairy tale, I felt the same way reading these as I did reading the classic fairy tales. There's that sense of magic and possibility, where you know anything can happen, and although things might get a little rough along the way, and there probably won't be super happy ending, the good guys do win in the end.I also noticed that the emphasis of each tale was placed on the struggles of each character rather than the resolution. The ending is always over so quickly. Normally, this is something that is a major no-no in writing, I mean, seriously. Who wants to read a 400 pg. build up to a 4 paragraph resolution?! But it seems to work in fairy tales. The stories aren't about what happens, it's about learning how to get there. We see their struggles, know their challenges and then we get to know they end up relatively alright in the end.This is definitely a book I would recommend. The writing is a little older, but to anyone who is a fan of fairy tales in their original setting (or people who want to write a fairy tale retelling but are wanting new material) this is a great book to read and one that I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"i enjoy folk/fairytales in general, and this collection is esp. interesting as a comparison to the more well-known european ones (the magic dog is eerily similar to the famous french fairy tale donkeyskin). there are some great images and situations, and although more than a few sort of meander and fizzle out there were enough uniques ones to keep you reading to the end. not the best, but not the worst either."},{"Title":"Tales from silver lands","review":"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America.

The stories are for all ages and written to intrigue the reader and whisk him or her to a far away land.

The second is read sparingly, and disregard a lot of the analysis - it's often tedious. Oh, and do be prepared for an affront or two. Naturally we all have our different tastes but might we not worry a little about the book's sensibility when Burt Bacharach's work is dismissed in little under a page, Paul Simon barely rates a mention, and the achievement of Lerner & Loewe is judged to be stylistically \\"dead-end\\"?Perhaps on the brighter side, this book has a sobering, generally right-headed approach to the subject. With a much greater range and a larger sweep than Wilder, the authors seem sure of themselves. But they don't write a twentieth as well, and it's something of a shame because style of expression is probably the greatest pleasure to be had from works like this. Wilder's uncommon elan and his tailored offhandedness make many pages in his great work sparkle. One could never say the same about this book, I'm afraid. The prose is wooden and the diction, especially the adjectival range, too restricted.

Reading it then partly inspired me with a love of literature that led to my becoming a professor of literature and a novelist. Yerby never fails to seize the reader's imagination. Even though his works have sometimes been referred to as pulp fiction, he does essentially what is required of the writer-- he seizes the reader and takes him on a pleasurable, thrilling journey through the imagination. As a black reader, I never even guessed from his writing that Yerby was black. His writing, as in The Foxes of Harrow, is color blind-- refreshing in a world increasingly obsessed with race. This is a &quot;must read&quot; for those in the next generation."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"This is the man: Stephen Fox - born out of wedlock, banished from his homeland. He came to the New World ragged and starving, with just one possession, a thing he could not sell, his pride! His body, his mind, his soul, burned with one overriding ambition, one day he would be a gentleman! And these are the women who knew his passions: Odalie - the pearl of the South, rich and beautiful, desired by man men but won by Stephen. She loved her husband with all her heart but could not love him with her body. Desiree - the lovely, tempestuous quadroon. She was a virgin when she came to him, just sixteen years old; she was his mistress from then on. Her vibrant body was everything a man could ever long for, but her love brought death and decay. Aurore - his wife's sister. She loved Stephen from a distance, always faithful to a love she couldn't know, waiting for a chance to share his life. This is the tremendous best seller about one of the greatest plantations of the Old South - the man who built it, the women he loved, the glory and decadence of a passionate age."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"Sex sells, and Frank Yerby gave it to his readers in droves. This steamy soap opera of a book, like other Yerby works, tells of a self made man who, in the end, is still a hostage to his hormones. The story begins with the adventures of the illegitimate Irish gambler, Stephen Fox. He's worked his way around Europe and America and has now settled near New Orleans. He schemes and gambles until he establishes himself as a wealthy planter, building the great hall of Harrow. But money doesn't buy happiness.He marries local beauty Odalie, but she turns out to be frigid in bed. After years of going without he finally takes on a quadroon mistress, Desiree, whose voice is like a soft, golden gong. Did I mention her voice is like a soft, golden gong? Mr. Yerby mentions it several times. Eventually Odalie learns about Desiree and this causes even more conflict in the marriage. Both women turn up the heat in the competition over this man until there's an eventual tragic end.The next part of the book takes up with Stephen's son, Etienne. With Etienne's cruelty to animals and his disregard for other people's feelings, he has the classic makings of a serial killer if given half a chance. He's a totally despicable person who may get what he deserves when he marries the half-wild Ceclie.Then at last the Civil War breaks out just when the book looked like it was losing steam. Yet we kind of breeze through the war, just touching upon high points, and before you know it it's over. (The war AND the book.)This is my second book by Yerby that I've read. I just can't come to care about any of his main characters because they're simply unlikable when they're not downright stupid. Yet it's the secondary characters who are more interesting. There's the venerable old slave woman Tante Caleen, and her grandson, Inch, who makes a daring bid for freedom. There's roly-poly neighbor Andre Le Blanc, who jumps into action to avenge his friend. Even the plight of golden gonged Desiree and her brother are as interesting, if not more interesting, than the sexscapades of the main characters.It's still readable stuff that moves at a steady pace and is littered with tidbits of historical facts. Oh, and it has sex."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a \\"senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"I swiped my stepmother's copy of Vixens from 1947 when I was just a kid in the 70's and remembered almost the entire manuscript, it stuck in my mind so.

Laird was the hero, Hugh,the villian, Sabrina's Laird's sterotyped nuttier than a fruitcake spoiled southern belle post war, & to me, Denise is the all time REAL WOMAN IN BOOKS. Foxes of Harrow was just as mesmerizing and complicated. I just noticed something too. There is an Etienne Fox, Stephen Harrow's son in Foxes name. He too was a sick, cowardly dirty white sheeted redneck. I wonder if Yerby had Vixens in mind when he did Foxes of Harrow? [...]My father, a loyal KKK sicko, blew a fuse and humilated me in elementary school for being assigned to do a report on Dr.Martin Luther King. I was all for it, and he refused to let me do it, because of Dr. King's race. BUT HE BOUGHT MY STEPMOTHER YERBY'S BOOKS, NEVER KNOWING THAT YERBY WAS BLACK, and around 20 years ago, my school book that I was to reference for Dr. King, somehow turned up in his home. Strange things happen in the name of justice. I think Oprah should discover Mr.Yerby's outstanding history and especially as most black writers had a very hard time getting contracts back then. Foxes of Harrow, however, sold for a grand price of $3 & Vixens the same in hardcover, for a whopping 75 cents in paperback, plus, he was a book club's pick on several occasions. I think that is magnificent history that should be wider known and told that he could acheive all that in a time, when that when it just didn't happen.Try some of his other books, like the Girl from Storyville, A Woman called Fancy, etc. You'll love them and see why he succeeded so well."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"I first read this book in 1962.

Great read - frustrating at times realizing the behaviors of the people back then."},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"I was lucky enough to find a copy of this beautiful book, The Foxes of Harrow, printed in 1947 and still in lovely condition. I first read this story when I was in school (nearly 60 years ago) at 14 years old and have never forgotten it. I read it in my forward thinking school's library - and have had to wait until now to find a copy of my own. Unfortunately Frank Yerby seems to have become a forgotten author and I urge anyone who has never read one of his books to do so - you will not regret it. Frank writes in a wonderful, almost forgotten, way of drawing the reader into the setting and time in which the story unfolds - I doubt that there is another author who would bring the character, Stephen Fox, to life the way Yerby does, the way he makes you want to shake Mr Fox yet want to be him at the same time.The story follows Stephen Fox from his life as a clever gambler in the early 19th century and it's trials, to becoming a planter of some renown and considerable wealth and his fixation with the beautiful woman he wanted as wife and mistress of his lovely plantation - acquired as a result of gambling and a duel.Read it and become addicted!!"},{"Title":"The Foxes of Harrow","review":"Having spent my life in south Louisiana, I am familiar with the culture of the \\"bayou country\\".

I'm taking a class of folklore in Miyazaki Municipal Collage, and the lecturer Ms. Fusako Izumi, who has been studying masks and puppets for 30 years, told me that it's really nice book with correct details.

However, with the exception of the one mask shown on the cover, they are all made from single sheets. Any 3-D effect is achieved almost exclusively through shading on the prints. Apart from that, simple triangular cuts are made in the corners of each mask so they dome slightly rather than lie flat. I found that disappointing. I'd recommend the book for young children, but it definately has nothing to offer to adults or origami enthusiasts. ..."},{"Title":"Cut and Make Japanese Masks (Cut-Out Masks)","review":"The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive.

Misty, Eric, and Dave take us into a world where the Library of Alexandria was not destroyed, where magic works, and where evil walks (or in this case, swims) the night. So far rather tame for a fantasy. Well there is a whole lot more!The caracters in this book are not perfect and, frankly I don't want them to be. They make mistakes, and fix them, get into trouble and get of it, fall in love, and out of it, and in general have a fine time doing it. How they do this is one of the things that makes the book so much fun. From a kinght, to a boat girl, an assssian on the run, a young heir needing help, a imperial heir hiding in plain sight, and a Emperor looking over everything, this book is packed with people.As to parts of the book being recycled from another series, Misty stated _in public_ on Baen's WebBoard, that some things were reused. And the parts that were reused were in the first couple chapters of the book. After that, it is all new material. The material was good and now has a new home. And I am glad she used it! As for the writing styles, the three authors in question made a [darn] good book, and while it may not be to all tastes, it is to mine. Thank you Misty, Eric, and Dave.

SOL's basic plot and characters, as well as incidents major and minor, are lifted straight out of the previous series. A few minor adjustments to adapt it to a setting in an &quot;alternate Italian Renaissance&quot; instead of the wonderful complex world of MN didn't improve the story at all.It's the same thing, a little more predictable and considerably dumbed down.If you enjoyed the first version, this one will just annoy you with pitiful attempts to change enough details to pretend it's not just hashing over the book you've already read.If you haven't read the original, this book will just spoil it for you.Bad idea-whether it was the author's or the publisher's, it was just a bad idea.Shame on you!"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"The Grand Duke of Lithuania, under the control of a demon, is thwarted in his expansion attempts by the Holy Roman Empire. But the Empire has many demands on its resources and the Duke realizes that the focal point is Venice. If the Empire can be persuaded to divert its efforts into the quagmire of Italy, evil has a good chance to run over the weakened borders. Renaisance Venice is a city of feuds, rich merchants, magic, and mystery. The Emperor sends his nephew and possible heir into the Italian stew, accompanied by a Norse/Vinlander bodyguard and a group of Teutonic-style knights. Two young brothers, Marco and Benito struggle for their place in the city, abandoned by their family but still hunted by vendetta enemies. And Maria and Kat work Venice's famous canals in their gondolas. But the forces of evil are strong and Venice's ancient protector sleeps deeply.Authors Mercedes, Eric Flint, and Dave Freer combine to create an intriguing alternate history. In this world, magic exists, Hypatia of Egypt converted to Christianity and became a Saint, the Greeks still control Constantinople, Germany is united in a useful empire that doesn't quite squander all of its resources in Italy, and Lithuania and Hungary rather than the Ottoman Empire threaten the west. The Christian Church is split between Petrian and Pauline branches with the more rigid Pauline being especially strong in Germany closer to the battle against the demons themselves.THE SHADOW OF THE LION is a massive work--and only the first in a multivolume series. Its focus is almost wholly on Venice--the richest city in the world and a major link between east and west. Somehow, Marco and Benito must not only keep themselves alive, but also grow to the point where they can save the city. Because when the day comes, all of the Empire's forces, even his nephew Manfred, will be able to do little unless Venice can shake off its lethargy.Alternate history buffs will enjoy the way SHADOW twists history--making it interesting to people who enjoy history but without beating the reader over the head with it.Be warned, though. SHADOW is a major commitment. It takes time and energy to get through. This isn't the kind of book you can sit down with and get lost in. You'll work at it--but it'll be worth it."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I have always enjoyed books set in the 15th and 16th centuries. This book is one of the better ones that I have read. It reminds me of a combination of Dorothy Dunnett's House of Niccolo series and Poul Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions. Both the characterization and the description are excellent. If you enjoy either fantasy or historical fiction, I believe that you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"OK, in paperback, this is almost 900 pages. Almost too large to hold. I leave it to others to discuss its relationship to Merovingen Nights, the co-ordinatation (or lack thereof) of the three authors.It's a slow read. For the first hundred pages, or more, one really has no idea where the story is going. It's a bit like entering the middle of a 20-part series. OF course, in one sense, this is not all bad. This is a book one can easily put down at almost any time and pick up later.And I truly dislike the sections that deal with the evil/monster. They are written in that oblique form that has become, apparently, so fashionable in the past 20 years - where words make up sentences which make up paragraphs which make up pages which leave you wondering who, what, when, where and why. (I admit to a certain bit of admiration for the ability of writers to string real words into an impenetrable fog of meaninglessness, but I don't like reading them.)But, finally, the problem is the \\"finally\\". Although what turns out to be the central problem of the novel is resolved, the lives of the characters and the history are not. (Consider a novel about D-Day that ends after the landing in Normandy. There's still a whole war to win.)It feels, unbelievably given the length, as if the writers planned a sequel - which, it turns out is the truth. This is the first of four books in what Lackey calls the Heirs of Alexandria Series. Unfortunately, in at least the edition I bought, there is no indication that this is so.Worth reading? Worth buying? I'm ambivalent. I don't resent the hours I spent reading it, but I'm not sure that I am interested enough in the characters or the alternate history to read the next 3 books in the series."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"SHADOW OF THE LION is an excellent, wide-ranging fantasy novel that makes best use out of three fine authors: Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint, and Dave Freer. It's a historical epic fantasy with many settings, many characters, and many interwoven plots, but it never, ever falters.SHADOW OF THE LION is mostly the story of Marco and Benito, two brothers who go from rags to riches amidst war, intrigue, magic, and more war in 16th century Venice. In this alternate history, because magic works, the alliances among countries and kings aren't always what you'd expect.At any rate, Marco and Benito are engaging characters, and I enjoyed reading about their adventures. I don't want to go into too much detail about these adventures, either; suffice it to say that who they meet, what they find out, and what they do along the way with that information is too much fun for me to spoil.Go read this impressive book for yourself already!Five stars plus, highly recommended.Barb Caffrey"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"At 823 pages and over 90 chapters long, this is easily Mercedes Lackey's (the lead author) longest single work. It is also more gritty than many of her recent works and collaborations, harkening back to her gutsy early works. Well done!The length of the volume allows for significant character development and plot twists galore (and medieval Italian politics has nothing but plot twists!). This also means the first 50-100 pages of the book kind of drags. That's okay, work your way through that, and you'll be entranced. I finished this sizable volume in less than 3 nights of reading... That good, really.The ending wraps up a little too neatly, quickly, and nicely, something of a Lackey trademark, but it's hard to complain about this meaty and interesting story."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This book has all the earmarks of Mercedes Lackey's usual work. The characters begin their story as the underdogs, abused and downtrodden and fearful; as the tale unfolds, they mature, stronger for the trials they pass through. The mood is dark but not oppressing, the magic obeys laws without losing its wonder. Venice and its allies and enemies are recognisable, the world the story represents only slightly out of sync with accepted history.Humor has its moments in the story, subtle in flavour but there; nowhere does this tale bog down in depression, despite the fact that some of the characters do their damnedest to achieve that state.The many viewpoints are well-represented, and not terribly disturbing, although the occasional scene is repeatedly told. I prefer finding out with the lead character; I like surprises, not foreknowledge. Despite this, I enjoyed reading this book and eagerly await further collaborations by this trio."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I tried a couple of times to read this book.

So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up!

Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I love the easy-reading fantasy books by Mercedes Lackey, but can recommend them only for fantasy lovers. This much more ambitious work, however, works on so many more levels that even my much less fantasy-oriented husband couldn't put it down, while I relished the depth and multiple layers of meaning. Yes, you have to work a little bit harder than with Lackey's less challenging works, but the payoff is enormous! The individual characters are *so* individual, so non-formula, so interesting. The book's whole world, with its alternate history from ours, is fascinating. This is a book to be savored, rather than gobbled mindlessly (though I very much enjoy doing the latter, too, on occasion)."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"The Shadow of the Lion (2002) is the first novel in the Heirs of Alexandria series. In 415 AD, the librarian Hypatia faced down a mob attempting to burn the Library of Alexandria. Her efforts saved many obscure works of the ancients, including a number of very powerful magical works. Although originally a neo-platonic philosopher, Hypatia was converted to Christianity and became the founder of an order dedicated to Christian magery, opposing the anti-magic biases of the Pauline Orders.In 1537 AD, within this alternate timeline, all of Europe is threatened by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland, whose Grand Duke Jagiellon is a puppet of the demon-lord Chernobog. Emperor Charles Frederik of the Holy Roman Empire is the principal European leader of the opposition to Chernobog. The Knights of the Holy Trinity are supposedly his main agents in the Baltic regions, but they have their own agenda and have developed ties with the militant and unpredictable priestly order of the Servants of the Holy Trinity.The Venetian Republic is the Queen of the Mediterranean, a bastion of independence and tolerance. Now forces are gathering in and around Venice. From Chernobog comes a shapechanged shaman to lurk in the lagoon and canals. From the Knights of the Holy Trinity comes a force of Knots and a few Sots; included among these knights are Manfred of Brittany, nephew of Charles Frederik, and his mentor Erik. And from the Grand Metropolitan of Rome come the Basque priest Eneko Lopez and his companions.In this novel, Marco and Benito Valdosta are grandsons of Enrico Dell'este, the Old Fox, Lord of Ferrara, Modena, Este, and Reggio nell'Emilia. Moreover, Benito is the illegitimate son of Carlo Sforza, the Wolf of the North, military leader of the Milanese forces. Although both brothers were thought dead after their mother was assassinated, they have been hiding within the Venetian environs, Marco among the marsh-dwellers and Benito among the street people. After an assassin attacks Marco in the harbor, the brothers seek the protection of Caesare Aldanto, an adventurer and former Montagnard assassin.When Caesare becomes sick, Marco and Benito help Maria Garavelli, his lover, take Caesare home and treat his fever. Maria is a canaler who was born and raised on her gondola; after her mother died of a fever, Maria assumed her mother's customers and route. Maria is related to many of the Arsenalotti, the families who traditionally work at the municipal shipyard.Benito has lately done work for Katherine Montescue, the last scion of an old Venetian family who has fallen on hard times. Kat has established a gray business smuggling magical artifacts and other magical goods with her gondola. Recently she has become friends with Franscesca De Chevreuse, a courtesan who becomes the mistress of Manfred.In this story, the Doge has reduced his opposition to religious persecution by the Sots and other Christian fanatics and the Sots have taken advantage of his recent slackness, stepping up their persecution of the Stegas and other non-Christian mages. In fact, they are very much opposed to even Christian mages such as the Siblings of St. Hypatia. The Sots have recently brought a powerful pagan artifact to the Imperial Embassy (unknowingly under the fearful eyes of Kat and Benito) and have performed questionable magical rites therein.The Montagnards are also becoming more active in Venice and have recently tried to terminate Caesare with extreme prejudice. The magical population of Venice have noticed that some of the Sots (as well as a few Knots) are tainted and thus the undines and other pagan entities have been staying away from the embassy. The Stegas have become more disorganized, but also more militant, and have been searching for one of their leaders, Dottore Luciano Marina, who disappeared several years past under dark circumstances; Eneko is also trying to discover the status of Dottore Marina. Meanwhile, Marco is being pressured from all sides to accept his mage talents.The story is a major alternative history of Venice. The rich details of the historical Venice are intermixed with a fantastic extrapolation of the existence of real magic in this timeline. For the most part, the magic is part of the background, but it also pervades every aspect of Venetian life. An amazing tour de force!The story is multi-threaded, with a fairly large set of characters (it does include a list of characters and other information in the appendices). This may cause some confusion about the minor characters during the frequent scene changes, but the main characters are memorable and fairly well fleshed out. However, there is plenty of room for character development in the sequel, This Rough Magic.Highly recommended for Lackey, Flint and Freer fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of high magic, political intrigue, and Renaissance society with a touch of romance.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"It took me twice to get through this book before I could decide if I liked it or not. I am very familiar with Mercedes Lackey so was looking forward to getting my hands on a book she wrote with two other authors. The plot was a bit complicated and with the large amount of subjects, and plats within plots within circles it was a bit confusing the first time through. But to be honest, I had a hard time stepping away from it. I just got through the second reading, which really set the characters in my mind and thoroughly enjoyed it the second time through. Not a book for a light reader, but if you're looking for a good complicated plot with a little real world flavor this is a good read. I will be actively searching out other books by Eric Flint and Dave Freer in the future with the hopes their other books are as well put together as this one."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Shadow of the Lion is a wonderful collaboration that brings the strengths of three great writers, Lackey, Flint, and Freer, together to create a rich and engrossing read. It's sad that Ms. Lackey's fans are so inflexible as to downgrade the work for not being 'all Lackey' or derivative, especially since the book works so well! Success can, apparently, have a serious downside.Admittedly, the first few chapters where all the characters are being introduced are a little tough to climb over. However, once you get into the meat of the story, it becomes an alternative history adventure in high style with a little magic fantasy thrown in for seasoning!What I particularly enjoy are the rich characters that don't require pages and pages of development. The writing, for the most part, is crisp and to the point without excessive infodumps or characters whinging about their inner demons or conundrums. Much better than the typical romance-novel-disguised-as-a-fantasy that seems to dominate the bookshelves nowadays.The two niggles that stick out to me (other than the climb through the first several chapters) is that the ending is a little predictable and the final battle in Venice lacks enough detail to be compelling, although the twist at the end between Benito and Maria is heartwrenching and unexpected.I very much enjoyed reading this novel, and I recommend it to my friends. Actual score would be 4.5 if I could."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This book does have a slow start, but I found it deeply engrossing after a brief period of becoming familiar with the characters. The cast is extensive but well put together and filled with plots and sub-plots. The Venetian setting was new to me, and I quite enjoyed getting lost in it as well as picking up some of the actual history and culture of the place. This book is certainly an alternate history more than a fantasy or science fiction, a point which may disappoint some of the author's fans. If you're looking for a light read, look elsewhere. However, I recommend this one for those in the mood for a deep, rich adventure with everything from political intrigue to magic."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Pretty good, but I think it could have been trimmed by a hundred pages or so. (Yes, I used exactly the same words about another novel in the same series. It is a very consistent series.)"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"In the realm of alternate histories, this one is really good. It reminds me a lot of Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy series in a way. Magic is real a few historical figures have made different choices how does that effect the world? This book follows conflict in 16th century Italy with all the conflicts and vendettas that such a setting implies. The book is character driven, with three dimensional interesting protagonists."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This is a good book for a long plane ride.The main story of the book deals with renaissance alternate Venice. The world is recognizable, though magic exists, Catholicism is split into factions, and Europe is dominated by Holy Roman Empire, cith state comprised Italy, the duchies of Lithuania and Poland, and several other large states.The book takes a while to get the setting down. having familiarity with Renaissance history will be a big help and helps the reader get up to speed faster.The main story deals with two young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, missing heirs to the Lord of Ferrara, Modena, Este, and Reggio nell'Emilia, who have been underground in Venice after an assisination attempt. In the background is a power struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and Lithuania, played out in the background of Venice.I won't go too much into the plot details -- after all that's what the book is for -- but it derives on more political intrigue, though with a mix of religious schism, magic, and adventure thrown in. The story was complex enough to be engaging but not so jarring as to be confusing.The ending wasn't the strongest, but then this i the first book in a series so it make some sense to have the ending it did. There's a helpful glossary of characters at the end. In a book of this length it does prove useful.I have not read C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights series but if you have read the other reviews for comments along those lines."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I love historical novels, especially the really well researched and lushly written kind, like the late, and very much lamented Dame Dorothy Dunnett wrote, and I love science fiction, fantasy and alternate history. Mercedes Lackey, Dave Freer and Eric Flint have managed to write an alternative historical fantasy about 16th century Venice. So I got three of my favorites in one shot.This novel is long. But it never flags. The pace is headlong, but the descriptions are clear, crisp and detailed. And the characters are wonderful, especially the little people, the spearcarriers, and the supporting cast.A case in point is the use of a certain Basque priest as a main supporting character. It plays great without knowing who that character is based on, but it adds piquancy indeed to know that the character is really St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits.The magic isn't intrusive where it shouldn't be, and is organic... that is, it doesn't just come from anywhere, and there are clear rules about how it works.The magic isn't nearly as important to the plot as the convoluted and terrifyingly complex politics in the story. Remember, this is the same part of Europe that was still reading Macchiavelli as a \\"How To\\" textbook.I read snippets before publication, and I can't wait for the next one. The collaboration of Lackey, Freer and Flint is greater than each of them alone. And since Lackey and Flint are known for being extremely good on their own, and Freer is too, just not as well known, that's saying a lot.Buy this book. You will be swept away.The Bananaslug. at Baen's Bar."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I really enjoyed this collaboration of Lackey, Flint and Freer. I had been rather disappointed with Lackey's latest offerings (except The Serpent's Shadow)and, while I love and adore Flint, his books with Freer are lightweight bordering on silly. This book really worked for me. I couldn't identify the various authors which is often a problem with collaborations and the plot moved seamlessly from one story line to another. Unlike other reviewers,I had no problem with following the plot, the characters or the intrigue and I don't believe other Lackey or Flint fans will have trouble either. Nor is the Shakespeare reference difficult for any high school student who has read Romeo and Juliet!The story, set in an alternate world Venice, is an adventure, a fantasy, a court intrigue, a romance, in other words, something for all tastes but in a unified package with great and sympathetic characters. Don't let the heft of the package put you off - The Shadow of the Lion is long but well written, using an easy to read vernacular. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I must admit, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this book. While I love certain of Mercedes Lackey's writing - especially her Elemental Masters and Free Bards series and her historical retellings of fairy tales - I've never warmed up to her Valdemar books, and I'd never read anything by (or even about) her two co-authors, Eric Flint and David Freer.I started the book, and was underwhelmed. While the concept seemed interesting - an alternate Renaissance Italy where magic works - the execution seemed clunky, introducing over a dozen major characters within the first chapter or so (a common mistake in historical novels). But within the first few chapters, I found myself caught up by the characters and the events that tied their lives together. By this point, the book had become so gripping that I couldn't stop until I finished it - and at 800-some pages, that takes a while! This is a wonderful book, and has persuaded me to check out some books by Flint and Freer while I'm at it. Certainly if you're at all interested in historical fantasy (especially dealing with alternate histories) you should give this book a chance."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"_Shadow of the Lion_ (hereafter referred to as SoL) is indeed related to Merovingen Nights, although SoL's acknowledgements may not mention it, but it's not a simple recycle.Once upon a time (1980s), the Merovingen Nights series, hereafter referred to as MN - 1 novel and 7 anthologies - was set in the city of Merovingen (a Venice-like city of canals) on Merovin, a world in Cherryh's Union/Alliance universe cut off from the rest of humanity and frozen at a pre-starflight level of technology. Cherryh introduced the framework of the city and some of the star characters in the novel _Angel with the Sword_. The series regrettably stopped at anthology #7 and passed out of print.Moving on to _Shadow of the Lion_ (SoL), we have an alternate universe wherein the breakpoint was the conversion of Hypatia (last Librarian of Alexandria in our timeline) to Christianity. (This information is provided gently early on, via a character ducking into a church during a rainstorm, looking at the frescoes of Saint Hypatia.) In SoL's universe, when the mob incited by bishop Cyril (in our universe, *he's* the saint) came to burn the Library down, Hypatia was saved by a miracle. That's the official version, anyway; it's been several centuries, Hypatia was an eloquent woman, and magic exists in SoL's universe, so SoL's history may have been prettified. Since Hypatia became a major Christian theologian-saint and the Library survived, Christianity and the political map of the world are different in SoL's 16th-century: the Church has different relationships with other religions, the Holy Roman Empire is a major power, and neither France and England exist as such. The magic system resembles that of Lackey's elemental magic novels with more religious overtones, a la Katherine Kurtz' Deryni.What has this to do with MN? The main action of SoL takes place in Venice (obviously correlating nicely with Venice-like Merovingen), and Lackey has used some of her contribution to MN's characters and short stories as raw material for SoL. Both characters and plots have been remolded, however, allowing for 1) the different histories of Venice (pretech) and Merovingen (posttech), 2) more realistic characterization, and 3) revision of areas where the original cast and plots interacted most with contributions from other authors. Consequently, any similarity between the storylines fades as events in SoL play out.Manfred - a prince serving his hitch in the Knights of the Holy Trinity - and his protector Erik have no counterparts in MN, and neither does Manfred's lover, the courtesan Francesca, consummate political operator that she is. I suspect Lackey of major contributions to her character, especially some of her conversations with Kat Montescue, daughter of a noble house fallen on hard times; Kat's far better developed than her underutilized MN alter ego. The priests seeking to form a new order within SoL's Church have no MN counterparts - instead, they correspond to those who in our universe founded the Society of Jesus: the Jesuits. The nebulous Strega correspond to the slot occupied by the Janists in MN, but only insofar as they interact with the Valdosta brothers.In place of MN's house Takahashi, SoL has the ducal house of Ferrara - the Valdosta family. As in MN, a wayward daughter of the house got involved with a very dangerous group of political fanatics - in SoL, the Montagnards - who murdered her as unreliable before the story opens, leaving her two young sons fugitives far from home. Marco's in the Rigel Takahashi role: a good, somewhat naive kid, having had no chance to learn social skills in the swamp. Benito corresponds to his younger half-brother Denny - a wild petty thief. Their introduction to SoL is a twisted reflection of \\"Deathangel\\" from _Festival Moon_: they ask one of their mother's old contacts (now *ex*-Montagnard, as it turns out) for help. Caesare is far more realistic than MN's Mondragon. Mondragon was a wish-fulfillment character - very beautiful, a great fighter who'd left his revolutionary cause through having a few too many ethics (his assassin aspects were played down), and genuinely devoted to the canaler-girl who once saved his life. Caesare presents a Mondragon-like facade, especially to his rescuer Maria, but it's a pose. He's mercenary to the core: he's only interested in Maria for her canaler connections and her body, and wants her loyalty as long as she's useful. When *he* takes in the Valdosta brothers, it's not charity; their grandfather hadn't abandoned them, and had paid Caesare (among others) to search for them. (What the reader knows up front, although the other characters don't, is that Caesare helped murder the kids' mother in the first place.)To summarize: the events of the Marco & Benito thread initially reflect those of the corresponding characters in MN; compare with the 5 stories Lackey contributed to MN anthologies 2-6. However, the SoL and MN threads diverge with good reason, with the realistic characterization of Caesare and Maria and their differences from Mondragon and Jones.SoL isn't MN, but if you liked certain aspects of MN you'll like this."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Set in Renaissance Venice in a somewhat alternate world (one where, for instance, magic works), this book chronicles two or three years of political upheaval, primarily from the point of view of two nobly-born brothers in hiding.The plot is complicated, but given that it's about Italian politics in a particularly volatile period, not excessively so. It's engaging and flows well; there aren't any particularly noticeable slow spots, and you don't want to put it down. Despite its size and weight (it's 800 pages in hardcover) I brought it with me on a cross-country plane trip because I'd started it and didn't want to leave it behind. And unlike many multi-author works, the various plot threads all integrate properly.The downside is that many elements of the plot -- and several of the characters too -- are rather heavily borrowed from C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights shared-world anthology, to which Lackey was a contributor. This should not be construed to mean that this book is a rehash/clone of Merovingen Nights; it's not, and even the borrowed elements are not necessarily assembled the same way.There are also certain points of resemblance to Diana Wynne Jones's book _The Magicians of Caprona_, but this probably just reflects common thematic material.To the extent that the setting is historical, it appears, to a non-historian, fairly well researched; to the extent that it's made up, it's done well, and it's not always easy to tell which is which (usually a good sign).The characterization is competently done, if not in general terribly deep; several of the characters are quite engaging. (Details would probably be spoilers.)Lackey's writing sometimes suffers regarding style; whether due to collaboration or more/better editing, there's none of that this time; the book is solidly and competently written, though not brilliant.Overall: **** (Ok, even pretty good, but not extraordinary.)"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"The first thing to say is that I like almost everything that Mercedes Lackey has written and so I am predisposed to like this. I have to say, however, that I suspect that Ms Lackey did not write the lions's share of this book (or perhaps she did write that part because the book gets much more 'Lackey-like' when touching on the supernatural). (The Lion of St Mark features in the book)The book is really an alternative history and will, I think be enjoyed by people who like relatively lightweight alternative history. It creates a world where the Library at Alexandria was not burned and the wisdom and knowledge contained there was saved by Hypatia, the courageous librarian who was unable to protect the library in our world . (Hypatia is obviously a favorite of Ms Lackey's .since she 'featured' in The Ship Who Searched'). The theory is that the Library contained much arcane knowledge and that as the result of saving it Hypatia was beatified and set up a tolerant and liberal Christian denomination with St John Chrystomenes (sp?) (who in real life was, I believe, dismissed as a crazy fanatic). In addition the knowledge of and practice of magic is very much a part of this world. Furthermore there is a substantial pagan presence. Some of these pagans are Mages. There is a group called the Strega (again , not well explained, they seem to be the equivalent of gypsies), whom the Church - or certain factions in it - are oppressing. Many of the Strega work magic in some form.In this sixteenth century Venice the Church has factions who follow St Peter (the Petrines) and those who follow St Paul (the Paulines) and some Hypatians. The exact beliefs of these factions are never explained - which probably doesn't really matter since the book is complicated enough without that - except that, by not going into that kind of detail the book may lose alternative history fans. The Church is a powerful and complex force in this world's politics as it was in the real world - but I missed just where each faction stood. Certainly the politics of Europe, woven through with magic and a powerful Lithuanian demon ARE pretty detailed - and complicated- as are the political factions within Venice herself. I found that reading the book took some effort because of the very rather labyrinth like plot but, having made the effort I finally got caught up in it ...only to find it had finished!The reason that I don't think Ms Lackey wrote much of the book is that one of her strengths is her ability to make the reader care about a character, or small group of characters. In this book the two principal characters are orphaned brothers Marco and Benito. They are pawns of shadowy puppet masters - who, again, the reader never knows much about. However, apart from the fact that Marco is fairly saint like and Benito is a street rat,and they are important in a 'great scheme', I never really felt I knew much about ' how they ticked'. We spend a lot of time with Ceasare, a shady character who is a spy, assassin and mercenary . . .but his character is deliberately unreadable.. . Only one character comes across clearly; an ambitious courtesan called Francesca. We understand her, she is highly intelligent, beautiful and a survivor. She also seems as if she is the only person who has control over her life! Perhaps the book should have been about her!I do not feel that regular Mercedes Lackey fans will necessarily enjoy this book. In fact, I would recommend this book only if you like dense, alternative universe stuff (though it isn't good enough for an alternative history purist) with less characterization that we have come to expect from Ms Lackey and (not enough) rather erudite magic."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"While I am extremely pleased as to how this book turned out compared to Lackey's usual material, I'm a little perturbed about the who this story line belongs to. About 15 years ago, I stumbled acrossed a series called Merovingian Nights. It is around 7 books long, and is pieced together by a plethora of authors. The series was not truly co-authored in the way we think of it now, but where each author wrote their own chapter in the novel. Sometimes it ended with some discontinuity.Shadow of the Lion is what I wanted Merovingian Nights to be. But does the story belong to CJ Cherryh or does it belong to Mercedes Lackey? It is not 100 percent the same, but a good 80% the same. Names, settings, plots.While I really enjoyed the book and its sequel, my enjoyment was dampened by the fact I couldn't get the idea of [...] out of my head."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I bought this book because I love fantasy and I love books by Mercedes Lackey. I got quite a surprise. This book was not what I expected but I enjoyed all of it. The typical fantasy book is heavy on the fantastical elements with one or two plot twists thrown in. This book has one basic fantasy premice and is heavy on the plot twists and turns. There are pages and pages that read like a good solid historical novel instead of a fantasy book.For me, this was all the better. I love a good fantasy, but I also appreciate getting a book I can sink my teeth into - and this one is a book that cannot be digested all in one bite. There is a 25 page prologue that takes you over 3 different locations and 8 characters - and these are just the men that pull the strings of power, not the heros and heroines of the book. Then in the next 25 pages you meet Benito, Katerina and Marco the most major characters in the book.Its a daunting 50 pages and can leave you feeling overwhelmed, but once you get past it the book begins to draw you in. As advertised on the front cover, it IS &quot;Rich plotting, vivid characterization..&quot; As a matter of fact, at the end I found myself wondering about the histories and futures of several of the more minor characters as well as what Benito would do in the future. This is not a light read, but it IS a good solid enjoyable one. Buy it and digest it, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I'm not one who normally likes alternative histories, but this is one of the best, most complex Lackey books I've read in ages.

Cherryh's Merovingen Nights Series may find many aspects of the plot strangely familiar..."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Absolutley rivetting.

Beautiful descritpions and the relationships bwteen characters is wodnerful, exciting and meets all expectations of their capabilities and interaction."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This book isn't much like Mercedes Lackey's normal writings, but isn't that the point of a collaborative work? I'm only giving it four stars because it is a bit hard to get into at first and the character list is extensive. It can sometimes be difficult to remember who is who, even with the glossary. I found myself having to write notes in the glossary just to record my thoughts on their characters and motivations. The plot is constantly twisting and there is enough humor without making the book silly. I've read almost every book by a female fantasy or sci fi writer (and quite a few of the men as well!) and found this one a delightful change."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I am an avid SF fan and this book was very hard to follow at first. To many different groups of charectors. After you finally figure out who was who the book was exciting in the end and was very good. Will there be another one? If people are patient they will learn to love this book."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I read the book and it was not up to par with Mercedes Lackey's previous books, even the ones co-authored. It seemed as though there were no set rules as to how each character was named. One person would go by the first name another by the last and it was confusing. Content wise it was fairly good. But as I said before it was not the best I have read by this author."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"In-depth historical research blends seamlessly into imaginative creation of entirely new material in this novel, which manages to make use of the classic tragic and comedic techniques common to Italy itself in the 16th century.I find this is far more engaging and thoughtful material than Flint's prior historical fiction, not nearly so repetitious as some of Mercedes' recent work (which, although enjoyable, tends to be in the same vein all the time), and more plausible than what I've seen from Freer in the past.I've appreciated Lackey's and Flint's work a great deal in the past, and I loved the collaborative work."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"At last, a new series which is substantial and worth reading. This is a &quot;big&quot; book, with a big universe feel. Yet it is easy to read and has some wonderful fast paced sections and some delightful characters. Benito is going to be everyone's favorite rouge. Maria and Kat with their bit of earthy realism were a welcome relief from the usual fantasy women. On the down side I could have skipped the sanctimonious and feminine Marco, and the Cernobog and the long talky bits of politics. But on the scale of serious fantasy since Jordan - outstanding. Congratulations, Ms. Lackey and co."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!"},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"The book had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. The characters were as flat as the paper they were writen on. The authors collaboration worked as well as a mixture of a heavy smoker in a fireworks factory. It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor. If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous. I enjoyed other works by the authors and am severly disapointed in this collaboration."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This novel borrows substantial character and plot material from the Merovingen Nights series (C.J. Cherryh, et al.), but with some new characters and situations. The setting has been moved to 16th century Venice, although in an alternate timeline where the Library at Alexandria was saved, and where magic exists along with demons. People are caught up in political struggles between rival empires, city states, and rival families, with vendettas and assassinations being common. All of that is complicated by demons from the underworld trying to take control and feed on people's souls.The setting is not entirely clear at the beginning, and it is necessary to read a few chapters to get a clear picture of the situation. After that, the story becomes more interesting. It was easy to set aside while reading the early chapters, but I stayed up late to finish the book when I reached the final chapers. Overall, an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"After a few pages I felt this novel had too many characters (dozens), and was confused and confusing.However, as I progressed I enjoyed it more and more, the confusion disapated, the major characters became distinguishable and interesting, and for the first time I enjoyed a book authored (in part at least) by Mercedes Lackey.One warning to fantasy lovers - this book is mainly a kind of coming of age story set in historical Venice - the fantasy element is relatively slight."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"This was a great book, thought I had the worst time figuring out what was going on in the beginning. Once I figured out what everything was (thank GOD for the glossary!) it was an easy read, and I shot through it. The plot was beautifully written, if complicated, and the description of the monsters so eerie I got goosebumps-- everything was magnificent until the end. I can't quite figure out how they managed to botch it, but I was left with a complete sense of dissatisfaction. It seemed far, far too easily resolved considering how long it took to read the book! It was good in that it was unpredictable, but bad in that NOTHING that you WANTED to happen, HAPPENED. You'd be led with the expectation that certain things were gonna go down, and if they did (and far too many didn't) they either went down in a big fat mess, or they went down far too easily. There is no way this book can stand alone. It will have to be part of a series, otherwise it was completely pointless. Don't buy it till it hits paperback."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Brilliant book!

But since I lack such knowledge, I found it extremely difficult to keep all the characters straight, let alone all of their alliances, intrigues and issues. If I knew something of the history of Venice and its relationship to the other city states of Italy, the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary in the 1500s, perhaps I would have the insight I needed to understand this book. While the authors develop their plots and realistically weave demons and magic into everyday life, the book jumps around amongst a plethora of characters, making it difficult to follow one person's story, let alone the couple of dozen main characters that make up the plot. There is a list of characters in the back (which I discovered after reading much of the 825-page book), but frankly, I'm not sure if it helps a great deal. You'd need a book in itself to explain some of the motivations and vendettas which swirl around the characters -- along with veiled references to the Romeo and Juliet story (I'm not a Shakespearean scholar, either).If you enjoy a richly written and extremely detailed story with a great deal of historical reference, let alone fantasy, I recommend this book. But I can't give it more than three stars, and I find it not nearly as good as the stories Misty writes herself -- even those which are outside her Valdemar series."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"Fantastic!

There were twists and turns that I couldn't anticipate, and the murky political world of 16th century Venice is the perfect backdrop for the story.If this is a stand alone book with no sequel then the only down side is wondering what happens with such well-developed characters as Benito, Maria, Lopez, Eric, the Prince, Francesca, Dell'Este, the Emperor, the Duke, and Chernobog."},{"Title":"The Shadow Of The Lion","review":"I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them.

Sharply blaming Democrats and the political left for &quot;undermining America's security&quot; and contributing to a climate that allowed the September 11 attacks, How To Beat The Democrats pulls neither punches nor opinions. The majority of this politically conservative book consists of harsh attacks upon the left for being &quot;unrepentant&quot; in its too-light treatment of accused and convicted criminals, too-lax defense policy, too-much spending, and worse. While How To Beat The Democrats presents numerous strongly worded arguments, with plenty of anecdotal illustration, it is emphatically not a &quot;how-to&quot; book that teaches the reader tips and techniques for winning elections against Democratic opponents. Rather, How To Beat The Democrats is a book of ideas, powerful and unrestrained. Though Horowitz's specific political assertions may be challenged and countered by opposing political views, his emotional honesty in speaking so unambiguously is beyond dispute and really quite refreshing."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"David Horowitz is the Noam Chomsky of Conservatism -- yet Horowitz actually knows what he's talking about. A former 60's radical, Horowitz knows firsthand the motivations and mentality of the Left and exposes the hypocrisy and underlying Socialist/Marxist philosophy that drives the Democratic Party and Liberals in power today.The book is mostly an expose of the failures of the Democratic Party that have caused more harm than good to the nation, but mostly to the very people Democrats claim to fight for: the poor and minorities. Horowitz goes a step further, though, and documents the ways that Republicans have and are trying to level the playing field between rich and poor and eliminate discrimination in matters of education, jobs, Social Security, etc.Horowitz's call to arms for Republicans is simply the acknowledgement that Republicans have a tendancy to use gentleman's tactics when it comes to political warfare; something Democrats have never restrained themselves to. Horowitz challenges Republicans to fight back with the issues, arguing that confronting accusations with solid facts is key.It's unfortunate that this book is titled \\"How to Beat the Democrats\\", because it will most likely turn a lot politically-moderate readers away before they even crack the cover. This is a book that every voter should read, whether Republican or Democrat, and draw one's own conclusions from the facts Horowitz provides to support his claims."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"I spent much of my life outside the USA - altogether over 20 years, and involving 4 continents. I've yet to see one place that favorably compares with the USA, in that our country is about the ideals, ideas and inspirations of free people. We're not without fault to be sure, but FREE people - do we really realize what that means? While I was serving in Vietnam, Jane Fonda (exactly my age) was encouraging and consorting with our enemy. For the longest, I was unable to totally understand how this could happen and why some of our citizens can actively support our enemies, and apparently hate our great country and every ideal it stands for.This book, together with Patrick Buchanan's \\"The Death of the West\\" has given me clear insight into the nonsensical and dangerous thinking of the progressive left. I learned that it is actually a movement which theorizes that \\"If I can control your thinking, I can reshape the world according to my philosophy and thereby make it a better place.\\" The left's message of hope to the downtrodden is generally a lie, since leadership of the movement is actually built on the hedonistic fragrance of self aggrandizement. This idea goes all the way back to Adam and Eve's becoming enthralled by the beast's temptation to \\"become as Gods\\", to the citizens of Babel's attempt to construct their own highway to heaven, and to Karl Marx' attempt to erect heaven on earth for the world's downtrodden. Never mind that Communism has murdered over 100 million human beings during it's existence, while simultaneously the left in our country suggests we busy ourselves with such trivialities as racial profiling! Although the modern day leadership of the left may nor be card carrying communists, their activist ideas are essential the same. The sad part is that socialism, in any form, can never be a success. I remember a young tour guide in Russia telling me just after communism had fallen that the citizens always knew it was a lie. To be sure, socialism must be built on a lie because it against human nature and attempts to force it's tenents on humanity must be accomplished forcefully, i.e. by resumption of the gulags, funny-farm camps and mass murders.The real danger rests in the fact that it is a shock how few people in our country have taken the time to inform themselves about the dangers of this movement. Thomas Jefferson said that an informed populus is the key to democracy. It is equally true that all of us in one way or another are our own worst enemy, and I often think this about blind followers of the activist left."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"Horowitz has hit it big with this book.

This is precisely how the GOP needs to campaign against the Democrats. On the issues, the GOP would win every election. After all, how many people truly don't want lower taxes, a stronger military, a better educational system, school choice, tougher crime laws lower energy prices etc. Not too many. But, the general public doesn't really pay much attention to the issues. What gets their attention are emotional appeals and symbolism. That's where the Democrats excel, and that's what the GOP needs to understand and work on. This book is all about how to do that. It's about framing GOP policy in an emotional and symbolic way so that voters get the message. The GOP is slowly learning these lessons and it's about time.

In HOW TO BEAT THE DEMOCRATS, David Horowitz draws upon his decades long dalliance with radical causes to suggest that the difference is one of a world view. Where the right focuses on the rights of the individual the left sees the individual as a mere cog in a collective wheel that allows those at the center to see themselves as the possessors of a moral vision that points toward a time when all races, genders, and creeds will be rendered equal by legislative fiat.The first half is a primer for Republicans to defeat Democrats head to head in elections at all levels. What has given Democrats the edge in all victorious contests over the last few decades is that they have recognized the difference between what appeals to the heart and what appeals to the head. The heart can be persuaded by false rhetoric, out and out lies, and suggestive television ads. The head by logic and cool reason. The left is the master of the heart, the right is the domain of the head. Horowitz demands that conservatives stop assuming that liberals are running a debate according to a linguistic Marquis of Queensbury and be willing to attack the left on areas and issues that they are most vulnerable. To do this successfully, Republicans must learn an entirely new set of rules: (1) politics is a war of emotions (2) politics is a war of position (3) politics is all about fear (4) politics is about hope. Those who can frame a contest by tagging themselves as the party of hope can label the opposition as one bereft of it. Those who can frame a contest by tagging the opposition as one that the voters should fear will win. Horowitz includes numerous examples of these formulae. The Democrats' stand on social security is illustrative. They claim that the Republicans will STEAL the savings of a lifetime by allowing claimants to invest their savings in the stock market. Horowitz urges the Right to claim the opposite: namely that it is the Democrats who will cheat claimants by refusing to allow the estates of deceased claimants to inherit social security benefits, a result that cannot occur under current social security rules but is a commonplace under standard stock market regulations. Horowitz also lambasts the Clintons as the most vile, most self-centered power seekers to ever hold high office.In the second half, Horowitz discusses the views of noted leftists like Noam Chomsky, Robert Sheer, and Hillary Clinton, all of whom would rather call Marx a capitalist than to say even one nice word about George Bush. But it is Horowitz's closing chapters on \\"The Unrepentent Left\\" that imbues his book with its damning denunciation of the left. He sees the inner circle of the left as those who possess a inner vision of themselves as the forerunners of a elitist, socialist world, one in which they will found and run. That such a world has never suceeded in the long and lamentable catalogue of failed ideologies does not deter them in the least. It is this collective failure to recognize the cold realities of their failed vision that marks the left as both dangerous and deluded. To combat them, Republicans must adopt the tactics of what has worked supremely well against them. This, then, is the message of this book."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"Horowitz hits the nail right on the head (no pun intended). This is precisely how the GOP needs to campaign against the Democrats. On the issues, the GOP would win every election. After all, how many people truly don't want lower taxes, a stronger military, a better educational system, school choice, tougher crime laws lower energy prices etc. Not too many. But, the general public doesn't really pay much attention to the issues. What gets their attention are emotional appeals and symbolism. That's where the Democrats excel, and that's what the GOP needs to understand and work on. This book is all about how to do that. It's about framing GOP policy in an emotional and symbolic way so that voters get the message. The GOP is slowly learning these lessons and it's about time. This would be a very important book for anyone running for office or studying political strategy."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"David Horowitz exposes the Dems' lowbrow and underhanded campaign tactics that they use with reckless abandon - playing the race card and instilling fear of the \\"evil\\" Republicans into their dim-witted constituents. Horowitz, a former far left anti-war activist of the 60's, knows the virtually isurmountable depths to which the Left will plunge in order to achieve their egomaniacal objectives - power and prestige.Horowitz explicates the Democrats' insular and inane platform: Big Government that should, when in doubt, tax and tax again mercilessly - and spend your hard-earned money on a wasteful bureaucratic agenda that serves the Democrats' own agenda. Horowitz explains the incessant pandering of the Dems to their indigent and indolent constituents consisting of illegal aliens, minorities, and anti-Americans. They somehow continue to maintain their voter base through a degrading, yet somehow effective, strategy that instills fear into their followers' hearts that the Republicans will eliminate Social Securtiy, abortion, and institute a racist regime the moment they are elected. This book should evoke fear into the hearts of sanctimonious fearmongering Dems everywhere."},{"Title":"How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas","review":"There is no room for RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) in our fight to win over the general population concerning the merits of conservative principles. Horowitz's book documents the fact that rightward ideas are winning ideas and will resonate with voters across the nation. This is a collection of essays, and, for the most part, they are brilliant. Two chapters, The War Room and How to Beat the Democrats, should be very influential upon politicians and the average reader. He preaches tactics and strategies that conservatives must hear and internalize. Important points are that politics are emotional and they should always be about hope. Republicans would be wise to learn from the words of this master. Ten more Horowitz's and the country would be in a much better place. He speaks his mind in beautiful prose and you'll turn these pages quickly.

It gives a great description of WHAT the liberal fascists/socialist/democ-rats are doing. But, that's not even close to being the important question. The important question is not what but WHY. Want to know the answer? Just study what John Kerry has done during his life and ask yourself what pattern you see. Another example is Jimmy Carter. The same for Jane Fonda and Michael Moore. These people are traitors. As in they purposefully and repeatedly, take the side of extremely evil people, over that of the United States....to the point of interfering with our foriegn policy with both the specific intent and effect of allowing these evil people to do evil things. It doesn't matter if they are communists, drug dealers/criminals, terrorists or genocidal maniacs. Neither does it matter how heinous their crimes are. They take their side over our side. Scary stuff. Mostly, this has been allowed to happen because of sheer ignorance of what these people are doing. That is changing....big time. This election shows that VERY clearly. The dems were marginalized this election. Based on what they have planned (Hillary Clinton....don't make me laugh), they are likely to be mariginalized for the next decade or more. That's a good thing. What you will see is the infiltration of these sick people, halted, particularly in the judiciary (short term) but also in the house and congress. In short, the american people are kicking the bums out of office. Finally, you will see the democrats expunge these [...] from their ranks (they really have no choice considering how big of a liability they have become).

Conan DoyleA Study in Scarlet. John H. Watson M.D. is looking for reasonable lodgings. So too Sherlock Holmes (described as cold-blooded in outlook). A letter requests help from Holmes. Drebber was found dead in an empty house, no wound on the body, but blood in the room. Holmes & Watson go there to inspect the scene. Holmes explained his deductions. An advertisement is placed in the \\"Found\\" column of a newspaper. Detective Gregson visited Holmes to explain how he solved the murder. Lestrade arrives to tell of another murder: Stangerson, the secretary of Drebber! Gregson's suspect could not have done it. Holmes shows his brilliance by his surprise introduction of the murderer! Part 2 tells about the events that preceded these murders. Chapter 7 explains Holmes' actions in reasoning backwards. This story introduced Sherlock Holmes to an audience that never tired of these stories. Note the dialogue followed by explanatory comments. More modern stories use mostly dialogue to carry the story along and bring out the facts. The solution occurs in the last chapters. The use of an exotic American locale was a way to add interest. Background descriptions are sparse. It tells why a man can have a \\"florid face\\", a medical fact.The Sign of Four. Miss Mary Morstan visits with her problem. Her father disappeared ten years earlier. For the last six years she received a large pearl in the mail. A letter told her she was wronged and asked for a meeting. Holmes and Watson will accompany her. Their carriage arrives at a new house. They meet Thaddeus Sholto, one of the sons of Major Sholto, the best friend of Mary Morstan's father. Thaddeus tells what he knows about the story. His brother Bartholomew discovered the hidden treasure. When they arrive they find Bartholomew murdered in a locked room and the treasure missing! The police arrest Thaddeus and the servants as accomplices. Holmes borrowed a dog, they followed the scent to the water's edge and find information. Holmes located the steam launch, the police boat chased it downstream. Holmes and Watson shoot at a small man, then a new man is captured with the treasure chest. He tells about the treasure from the India Mutiny and has the last laugh (Chapter 12). The Four chose to enrich themselves during the India mutiny. A double-dealing rajah straddled the conflict and split his assets for safety; this failed because others took advantage of their position. In turn their plan failed because of an unforeseen watcher. The Four who killed for riches were swindled out of their fortune by a clever liar who took advantage of his position.

When he sees Rachel on a Denver street, Jack can't resist following--and pushing himself into her life. The bond he felt went way beyond sex (although sex was certainly an important part of it), and Jack needs to see where it will take them.Rachel Westover pretended to be married to Jack to help get her job at a prestigious Denver architectural firm. But she never expected to have to deal with him again. When Jack shows up at her office just as the staff is heading for a retreat at a mountain resort, Jack manages to wangle his way into the group--and she can't exactly tell her boss that she lied about the husband. But it doesn't take long before Jack starts wangling his way back into her heart as well. And Rachel knows exactly how dangerous that could be. She needs to be the good girl--and knows how dangerous taking a chance can be. And Jack is nothing but dangerous--fun in a guilt-ridden package.Author Jane Sullivan (who also writes under the name Jane Graves) writes a sexy and emotionally satisfying novel with flashes of laugh-out-loud comic genius. Jack is all fun and games on the surface, but has a serious side that finds its mate in Rachel. Sullivan does a wonderful job showing a parallel growth in sexual and emotional closeness between these two damaged characters--leading up to the inevitable disaster where each must take stock of their lives and decide whether they dare take a chance with their greatest fears.This may be Sullivan's best yet--and that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"Risky Business (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"This is the first romance novel I've been able to read through from beginning to end in a long time.

HITLER and STALIN come quickly to mind. And while both employed intelligence operations to further their objectives, only the Soviet Union systematically integrated espionage, deception, and terror to advance its worldwide foreign policy and maintain domestic security. Many books have been written describing the operations, the personnel, and the organizations-KGB and GRU-involved. Jerrold and Leona SCHECTER have written one, Special Tasks, the story of KGB officer Pavel SUDOPLATOV. And Jerrold SCHECTER co-authored another with former KGB officer Peter DERIABIN, The Spy Who Saved The World, the story of GRU Colonel Oleg PENKOVSKY. But not until Sacred Secrets has the emphasis shifted to the impact of intelligence operations on the history of two societies-the United States and the Soviet Union.We learn that a KGB agent of influence in the American government shaped American the policy that led to Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. And, despite pledges to the contrary, the Soviet Union spied on its American ally throughout WWII using agents recruited from the American Communist Party. Robert OPENHEIMER was one such source as the letter to NKGB Chairman BERIA reproduced in the book, makes clear. Furthermore, as was their way, after the war the Soviets were largely successful in blaming America for not giving them the war time secrets desired outright, so spies wouldn't be necessary-it was America's fault. At first, many Americans either supported this view or denied that any serious espionage had even occurred. The FBI knew them to be wrong-disillusioned defectors had made that clear. But their evidence could not at first be made public. The most valuable revelations-contained in broken KGB codes-would not surface for 50 years. Liberal doubts and right-wing certainty-both wrong-became part of the daily news diet in the 1940s and 50s. But once aroused, using straight forward counter-espionage techniques and the results of government cryptanalysis, the FBI shut down the Soviet networks and ended the era of the ideological spy.Scared Secrets makes clear that despite these losses, Moscow did not end its espionage program after WWII. In fact, it quickly attempted to reestablish its illegal networks and in later years it took advantage of the greed-incentive made attractive by American walk-ins from WALKER to HANSSEN, with many in between. America had its own Cold War successes and the SCHECTERS describe several including a new twist on the acquisition of the KRUSHCHEV secret speech-interesting despite their use of the oxymoron defector-in-place. In the end, America's technological prowess overcame the Soviet espionage and military threat, bankrupting the Soviet Union in the process-America won the Cold War. Sacred Secrets documents well these often ironic contradictions.The SCHECTERS make a persuasive case that, contrary to the moral relativism advocates of the political-left, the United States did not start the Cold War or force the Soviet Union to do so. Would America's post WWII policies have been different had Soviet espionage and subversion in America not been so politically oriented and active? Read Sacred Secrets for the answer."},{"Title":"Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History","review":"In the interests of honesty and fairness, I will state at the outset that my evaluation of this book is based solely on the several pages of the book devoted to the Vietnam War, since that is my one and only area of expertise. The information the Schecters' provide in other sections of the book on Soviet operations and agents in the West may be outstanding and exactly on target for all I know, but in light of what is contained in the pages devoted to Vietnam, I fear that is not the case. The entire section on Vietnam consisted of what are clearly anecdotal stories and rumors from Soviet sources. The only sourcing provided in the endnotes for any of the information in these pages is &quot;confidential source,&quot; which is meaningless. The first anecdote in the section, about a Soviet missile officer who shot down three U.S. jets with one missile on 24 July 1965, captured and interrogated the pilots, and personally murdered one of them, is ludicrous. Both Soviet and Vietnamese records (publicly available) state clearly that Soviet missile personnel manned the launch sites that fired that day, which was the first day that surface-to-air missiles were used during the Vietnam War. However, if the Schecters had done even the most rudimentary research, they would have found that only ONE U.S. aircraft was shot down by surface-to-air missiles on 24 July 1965 day (the other two U.S. aircraft lost that day were hit over Laos, hundreds of miles from the surface-to-air missile sites), and that only two (not three) aircrewmen were lost that day. The fact that the Schecters did not even check the U.S. loss records, which are public and available on the internet and in books as well as in government archives, does not say much for their diligence, and it certainly calls into question just how reliable the rest of the information presented in this book really is."},{"Title":"Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History","review":"Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History by historians Jerrold and Leona Schecter is an informed and informative examination of the hidden agendas and secrets of the Cold War, and an impressive study of the pervasive influence that Soviet intelligence operations exacted upon American politics, economics, and more, ranging from Pearl Harbor through Star Wars. An intriguing, compelling, articulate analysis, Sacred Secrets is highly recommended reading for students of Soviet and U.S. Cold War political history, international studies, cryptography, and intelligence operations."},{"Title":"Sacred Secrets: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed American History","review":"Most of the author's findings and re-interpretations of the Venona data (by now well wrung-out), while provocative in the extreme, offers no controversy, as those data are backed up not only by what is presented here but are also solidly confirmed by other independent researchers and sources. Findings such as the Rosenberg's and Harry Dexter White's treachery, even Oppenheimer being at the very least a Soviet agent of influence, are now more or less established facts: convincing conclusions that flow cleanly from what has been uncovered and thus conclusions that any reasonable reader of this book and of the historical record might come to believe in.However, on the other hand, some of the author's findings such as their most provocative claim here, that Soviet Intelligence, working both sides of the fence behind the scenes, drove the U.S. and Japan to war, in my view are utterly unconvincing. And furthermore, seem a bit of a contrivance brought about by a clear \\"over-determination\\" of, and an \\"over-interpretation\\" of, if not indeed and over-reading\\" of the preponderance of their data and supporting information. It appears (at least to this reader) that these two masters of the spy game themselves, may have fallen victim to having their own tails caught in an explanatory trap of their own making.In this instance, I leaned over backwards to hear them out, to give their interpretation the full benefit of the doubt, yet I could find no daylight between their own rather tortuous version of the spy games (which they themselves participated in), and a simpler one that suggests that due to the mere exigencies of the events of the time, both sides would have made the same decisions without the \\"supposed\\" influence of Soviet intelligence.These authors seem to have forgotten that there are many alternative interpretations of the same data, all equally convincing to some unspecified audience. And while the difference alluded to above might at first seem like a mere nuance, is it indeed not incumbent upon the authors to first acknowledge this difference, and then to demonstrate that it is more than just a nuance?In my humble opinion, with the carefully orchestrated data presented here, these authors have not done this, but have instead done just the opposite: used the very large areas of overlap in the two possible interpretations (the mere weight of events versus the influence of Soviet intelligence) to further conflate the two and lend unwarranted credence to their own explanation? And while doing this does indeed make for a provocative and a good \\"after-the-fact spy story,\\" those of us not heavily invested in the spy game and in spy-laden interpretations, can clearly tell the difference between the two.The evidence pointing to the authors' interpretation that Soviet intelligence drove the U.S. and Japan to war, as the sole and only correct explanation, based on the data presented here simply does not hold up under serious scrutiny. A less accusatory way of putting this is to say that perhaps these two masters of the spy game have simply over-determined and then simply over-interpreted their data, data that for very obvious reasons may have been a bit too close to their hearts and their own respective careers.

Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook is much improved over the freebie notepad version they gave out a few years back, but it suffers from a lack of focus. The small size, spiral binding, and tabs suggest it is intended as a first responder or incident commander handbook, but occasional topical discourses suggest that it is meant as a textbook. As a result, it is hard to find the information that would be needed on the scene (an index helps, but only slightly), while the coverage of the various topics is too uneven for it to be a good text. In some places, it seems to be simply a compilation of information from various (US) field manuals.There are some good ideas, but they seem to be sabotaged by the execution. The checklist version of the &quot;Agent Indicator Matrix&quot; (based on the Defense Protective Service model) is a good idea, but it is spread over three pages (instead of being arranged to fit on two facing pages in a landscape presentation or provided as a foldout) so that it can neither be copied easily or used easily in the book. A section on the threat of stolen military munitions, after noting that stockpiles in other countries are not as well secured as those in the US, then proceeds to a description of US weapons without describing distinguishing characteristics of chemical munitions relative to conventional munitions or how the munitions described might relate to foreign munitions.There are also some surprising errors in the hodgepodge of facts. The volume I purchased indicates that it is from the sixth printing, so I have to presume that most typos have been corrected. One particularly egregious error is in the characterization of liquid phosgene as &quot;...not hazardous except as a source of vapor.&quot; This statement is highlighted in a little box with a finger pointing at it on page 106, and repeated on page 108. While certainly it is the vapor that kills, liquid phosgene splashed into the eyes is known to produce opacification. Subsequently, it is stated that &quot;Phosgene [vapor] does not damage the eyes or skin...&quot; Yet it is well known that concentrated phosgene vapor will irritate both the skin and eyes, and, while this would not be fatal, and is usually not permanent the downplaying of these risks is certainly inappropriate, to put it mildly.To try to close on a positive note, this book does have some good information salted in various odd spots. If you are responsible for a training program, it would be a good book for you to look at, provided it is not the only reference you use. The table of emergency decontamination materials found at a K-Mart, for instance, suggests an obvious bit of homework for your trainees.In summary, this handbook should not be your first or only purchase, but it probably has a place in a comprehensive library.

It could use more historical information about the topic addressed. For example, the early Pledge of Allegiance was the origin of the stiff-arm salute. The Pledge was written (1892) by Francis Bellamy, cousin to an infamous author of the time, Edward Bellamy, and they were both self-proclaimed socialists in the Nationalism movement and promoted military socialism. They wanted government to take over all schools and impose robotic chanting to flags. The Pledge was the origin of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers Party. American socialists (Edward Bellamy teamed with the Theosophical Society) also bear some blame for German socialism's notorious flag symbol, which evolved into overlapping S-letters for socialism under the National Socialist German Workers Party. The Pledge's early salute was not an ancient Roman salute, and the 'ancient Roman salute' myth came from the Pledge Of Allegiance. It is amazing that books don't examine the issue of whether the pledge should be dropped entirely, especially for young children in government schools. The socialist dogma led to the socialist Wholecost: 60 million dead under the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 50 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 20 million under the National Socialist German Workers Party.

Author Chion devotes a lot of space in this book to comparing each of Malick's three films to one another. Hard to tell if Chion is very insightful or just grabbing for straws sometimes.Of note, Chion wrote this text in French and only later was it translated into English. It is significant because the same translation issue comes into play watching the film with French subtitles. Some of the characters' inner-monologues in the film have words and expressions that just aren't directly translatable into other languages. Chion, being bilingual, has the interesting perspective of experiencing the film in both languages and can make comparisons between the two, noting subtle and not-so-subtle differences in interpretations.I believe that to get the most out of this book one should have seen the film multiple times. But if you are thinking of buying this book, chances are you have already seen the film mulitple times anyway.And for good reason.Recommended book, though a large percentage of seems to be more about Malick's body of work than this particular film."},{"Title":"The Thin Red Line (BFI Film Classics)","review":"Terrence Malick's, 'The Thin Red Line' is one of my favorite films so I was excited to read Mr. Michel Chion's discussion of the film. I was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. Chion discuss elements of 'Thin Red Line' in relation to Malick's previous two films, 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven' as there are themes present in all three films. I also thought the author did a good job in discussing the distance between characters (whether it be in relation to the dialogue, or the way Mr. Malick chose to frame his shots) as well as man's distance between ourselves and nature.My biggest problem with Mr. Chion's book has to do with the voice-overs (or monologues) that populate 'The Thin Red Line'. The monologues in the film are incredibly important, which Mr. Chion admits, indeed, he spends much of the book relating the monologues to what is, or is not, happening on-screen. He also attempts to penetrate the meaning of these statements as they relate to the 'bigger picture' (love, death, life etc.) However, Mr. Chion's problem is that he does not credit the monologue with the actual character who is speaking it.I'm not sure if the mix-up is due to Mr. Chion being French and that perhaps he saw a dubbed version of the film, or was just unable to tell the accents apart, but the North American DVD release of the film, does tell the viewer (if the subtitles are turned on) who is speaking the monologues. As well, if you listen carefully, you can hear the subtle differences in voice between the characters of Private Witt (Jim Caviezal) and the speaker of the majority of the monologues, Private Edward Train (John Dee Smith).Many of you may think, 'so what?' Does it matter who spoke the monologue/voice-over or does it matter what the monologue says? I agree, WHAT is said, is more important then WHO said it, generally. But Mr. Chion's discussion, indeed his thesis, is severely hampered by his mistake as to the monologues.For example, Mr. Chion spends a great deal of time breaking down the ending of the film, and the final voice-over found at the conclusion (the one that contains the phrase 'look out at the things you made, all things shining.') He states that a disembodied Pvt. Witt makes the statement (an honest mistake perhaps, as both Witt and Train have deep southern accents) when in fact it is Train that makes the speech. Chion believes that Witt is the central character in the film and that we are, perhaps, trying to understand the relation between war and nature, through him. Dead at the end of the film, Witt can reflect back on what has happened.The problem is that Train (the young soldier at the end who says something to the effect of, 'I've been through the think and thin of it...') makes the 'big' statement, changing the meaning of Witt (as Chion sees him) and introducing another character into the discussion (Pvt. Train). Again, because Chion spends so much time on Witt and the monologues, their importance is front and centre. But because he cannot tell the speakers apart, his view as to the meaning of the film is hampered (and dare I say, incorrect).I value the attempt of Mr. Chion in this book, and in general, the other books in the BFI Modern Classics series, but the fundamental failure of the author to attribute the monologues to their owners, cripples this book's power.J. Adams"},{"Title":"The Thin Red Line (BFI Film Classics)","review":"Precious few books have been written about reclusive filmmaker Terrence Malick and his films. So little factual information is known about the man, so when a new book is published, there is a certain amount of anticipation by fans of his work. Michel Chion has written a book under the BFI Modern Classics banner that attempts to decipher many of the mysteries and enigmas that surround Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line.Chion recognizes that the film has no beginning or ending and therefore an analysis of the movie can begin at any point, which is exactly what he does as he makes an excellent observation about the jaded character of First Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn): \\"But perhaps Welsh has rediscovered that spark of consciousness and anxiety that had been extinguished within him. Perhaps the death of an individual is what allows the flame to move from one to another.\\"He argues that Malick's film places animals, the environment and human beings on the same scale -- a very unique concept as most movies put an emphasis on one group over another. Chion illustrates the unusual approach that The Thin Red Line takes on its subject matter. Characters pontificate about life and death and love and hate in \\"erratic, fragmented interior monologues\\" that embody \\"mysterious relationships created by the way shots are cut together, in the contrast between small details and big events.\\"There are several themes that run throughout Malick's movies and Chion does a good job of identifying what they are and then analyzing them. For example, he writes about the isolation that the protagonists in his movies experience. Many characters in The Thin Red Line are either shown to be alone in a shot or through voiceover narration. Direct conflict between characters is also avoided. Even the big showdown between Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) is done over the phone. Both Private Witt (Cavaziel) and Welsh are solitary figures alone with their thoughts -- Witt with his notion of another world, a paradise waiting for him, and Welsh with his cynical view that the war is only about property and nothing else.Chion's book is an excellent primer for Malick's challenging movie. Newcomers to his cinema are given a thumbnail sketch of the filmmaker and his body of work and major themes. Chion does not just analyze The Thin Red Line; he also identifies its structure and breaks it down into five separate sections. At one point in the book, he even deciphers what the Japanese soldiers say. His writing style is clear and concise and acts as the perfect companion piece to this important movie."},{"Title":"Tabernacle shadows of the \\"better sacrifices\\": A helping hand for the royal priesthood","review":"It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of \\"Pastor\\" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above.

The twist here is that the story is a western, complete with adobe castle, people spouting slang like \\"hornswoggled!\\" and a character named Annie Okey-Dokey.Harris has succeeded masterfully in making the story new and approachable for even young readers for whom the classic tale might be a little bit too bloody. The illustrations are an absolute hoot--colorful, detailed, and abrim with delightful asides where tiny mice, rabbits, buffalo and other animals wink and grin at each other with quips appearing in cartoon-like balloons. It's all visually reminiscent of the very best of master illustrator Wallace Tripp.This really is a lot of fun for adults and kids alike, and rewards repeated reading with all the fun visual stuff you'll continue to notice."},{"Title":"Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans","review":"Author/illustrator, Jim Harris, has created an in-your-face western retelling of the classic fairytale, Jack and the Beanstalk that will have you and your children laughing out loud. Wild Bill Hiccup is the western version of the giant and a magic lasso that turns french fries into gold, a banjo that plays music on its own and a furry buffalo that leaves golden buffalo chips replaces the classic story's standards. Jim Harris' illustrations are hysterically one of a kind and keep you begging for more. Luckily for us, he is a prolific author/illustrator and he continues to recreate these delightful classics."},{"Title":"Jack and the Giant: A Story Full of Beans","review":"This atypical version of the well known fairy tale is a delight to both young and old alike. The creative storytelling carries the reader along like a tumbleweed in the wind, not knowing what twists and turns will happen next. Jack is the hero trying to save the day and the Bar None Ranch, along with his sidekick the yellow tabby cat. The clever adaptation of this old tale is refreshing and downright funny. I found myself laughing at the antics of the tabby throughout the story. My favorite character is the one who gives the giant the gold in a very original way (I won't give it away, you'll have to read it for yourself!) 'Jack and the Giant' captures the spirit of the west in its delightful illustrations. Each page holds a reader's attention while they try to take in all the action in the pictures. Jim Harris is a tremendously talented illustrator who seems to bring to life each of his characters with the ink of his pen. He truely has a gift to share with children of all ages!

Well, you might consider this recent book. The authors have gone to some length to explain events without appealing to more than simple calculus.Nothing flashy. But you can obtain a good understanding of fractal dimensions, self iterating systems (like a Sierpinski gasket) and noise."},{"Title":"Chaos: A Mathematical Introduction (Australian Mathematical Society Lecture Series)","review":"Firstly, this is one of those rare technical books which one can thoroughly enjoy. It can be read at a number of levels and rewards any effort put into understanding the concepts and the mathematics. One needs decent calculus, basic set theory and a bit of topology to wade through the maths. The text and diagrams are clear and unambiguous. The fonts and layout are well chosen for easy reading, always an important consideration for technical books. As this is a text book for a course in elementary chaos theory, the authors write out the proofs fully, in an almost bullet point fashion which makes it very easy to follow the argumentation. I like this style very much.What I don't like is the lack of solutions (preferably worked solutions) to the excellent exercises at the end of each topic. This is one of my major bugbears about textbooks. Without worked solutions one simply cannot get the feedback required for a full understanding of the subject. Not everyone who buys the book will be attending classes and they will never know if they are on track or not. To make me even crankier, the authors will provide worked solutions to \\"bona fide\\" teachers who contact them. How about letting teachers, bona fide or otherwise, write their own exercises instead of taking the easy way out, and letting students learn using the well accepted techniques of feedback and reinforcement.A star is lost! Hufff!"},{"Title":"Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle","review":"Amazing book!!! It has some of everything that I was looking for: the first part talks to the history, myths and spiritual aspects of drumming. It looks at all sorts of cultures too - Egyptian, Chinese, Native American, African, and others. It's a great overview that gave me ideas of areas where I might want to learn more. Wonderful poems and quotes are sprinkled throughout the book as well. Following this there's a practical section that helps you select a drum that's right for you and there's info on how to care for your drum. My drum had lost some of its tightness during the humid time of the year but there's a paragraph that addresses that specifically so I knew it was normal. The next section talks about drum circles and the different points in the circle. Really neat. It's my first introduction to drum circles. Lots of great lore and history throughout this book."},{"Title":"Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle","review":"Sacred Beat illustrates the reasons we are emotionally drawn to the drum.Opening with a bit of an ethnographic look at the cultures that have long held drumming in high regard.There's a strong lean to New Age and Pagan uses of the drum today, and the book is light on technique, so plan on wanting more as you finish this book. But all in all, that is not a bad thing.I would not have this as an only text on drumming for spirituality, but it deserves a space on the shelf."},{"Title":"Sacred Beat: From the Heart of the Drum Circle","review":"You ever wanted to know why drums are so important in a pagan circles?.

Passages like the following are prevalent throughout the book : \\"Moving from science to theology to philosophy and the intellectual history of the period, we can see how his photographic productions were explicitly motivated by the categorical imperative of religious faith.\\" After translating this into \\"His images were based largely on his strong religious beliefs,\\" you can, after some difficulty, get through the extremely burdensome text. The text also goes on multipe tangents trying to explain Victorian England, and the milieu that Frith lived in, but I found it overly burdensome and digressing.I found myself constantly trying to skip ahead of lengthy passages about Darwin's The Origin of Species and other digressing digressions.The best aspect of the book is the images themselves. They are superbly produced with about as much detail from Frith's gigantic glass plates as I could expect a book to have. Frith was a rich man by the time he took his trips to the Middle East, and, whatever his motivations were, these images are historically important as well as having that Middle Eastern mystery I find fascinating. I wished that Nickel would have placed BOTH pairs of Frith's stereo slides into the book, rather than just one side and I also wish he had more images."},{"Title":"Francis Frith in Egypt and Palestine: A Victorian Photographer Abroad","review":"Though nicely illustrated, this is no mere picture book. Its real strength lies in its well written text and critical apparatus. Nickel's scholarship is impressive: the book combines a sophisticated approach to writing biography (Frith's) with just enough historical detail and Victorian cultural context to bring the ideas to life. Best suited to audiences operating above a fifth-grade reading level."},{"Title":"Lexical Tools to the Syriac New Testament (JSOT Manuals)","review":"This 136 page spiral bound volume adds useful materials for the study of the Syriac New Testament. The text is well laid out, the Syriac is in a nice readable Syriac (Serto, very close to a Jacobite) font. Initially a computer generated list of word frequencies occupies the first 34 pages, followed by a frequency list of proper nouns, a list of words derived from Greek, consonantal homographs, and elegantly displayed verb paradigms. Added to this work is a fine &quot;skeletal&quot; Syriac grammar by the great S. Brock, which in itself is very handy. The text ends with an English and Syriac index to the work. Kiraz is a known expert with this language, and this work is a useful and accurate tool. It serves as a SUPPLEMENT to a grammar."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"This book (originally published in 1900) is split in two sections. In the first 100 pages, the life of Chopin is discussed by Huneker in a very colorful and poetic style, although unfortunately very few biographical facts are revealed. When I finished this section I felt I had hardly learned anything new about Chopin.The next 150 pages deal with Chopin's music, in which Huneker comments briefly on every one of Chopin's compositions (with the exception of several pieces unknown to Huneker), categorized by type (Ballades, Preludes, etc.). This section, like the first, is amusing but not very helpful. The author never really goes into great depth about any single piece. Instead he simply says a word or two on mood or style, often quoting authorities such as Kullak and Niecks, and compares several major editions of the work. I would recommend this to someone very interested in editorial details... anyone else could probably do without most of this section.People familiar with Chopin should find Huneker's writing somewhat enlightening, though far from substantial. Those looking for an introduction to Chopin may find the first section very helpful, if they can tolerate the author's verbosity."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"Huneker was an aspiring concert pianist (as well as a brilliant writer), and his analysis of Chopin's music and poetry are simply amazing. Like Chopin, Huneker expresses from the heart and hears the music at a whole new level. His interpretation is raw and as full in energy as the music itself (especially for etude op.25 no.11 and the ballade no.1)."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"Who can count themselves learned in Chopin who has not read Huneker's wonderful, purple-prosy, unabashedly romantic examination of the Polish Master's music? If the musicology is a tad dated, the enthusiasm, the sheer love of music present on every page, are more evident than ever. This is absolutely essential reading for the Chopin lover."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"The biography is very disappointing, the musical descriptions are poetic but don't get into much detail. If you want a general feel for Chopin's music but don't want intricate musical detail, the descriptions of the pieces may suit your need. That's the only reason I didn't give this book the lowest possible rating.For biographical info, \\"Chopin in Paris\\" by Tad Szulc is much more informative and accurate. Huneker's biography, besides being relatively short, takes off on gossipy tangents that often jump around in time making it hard to get a good feeling for Chopin's progression thru life.My problem with the musical descriptions (the book is divided into 76 pages of biography and 141 pages of music \\"analysis\\", divided into sections on preludes, mazurkas, etc.) is again the gossipy nature. For example, the chapter on the preludes is 13 pages long. The first four pages are strictly about who claimed when and where they were written.I recently played Prelude No. 4 in E Minor at Peabody in Baltimore. Prior to the recital, I was deluged with coaching at college master-class play-ins, etc. The discussions centered on things like why the downbeat beginning each measure is played weaker than usual, contributing to the feeling of hopelessness in the piece.Huneker's descriptions are: \\"The melody seems literally to wail..\\", \\"This tiny prelude contains wonderful music\\", \\"The whole is like some canvas by Rembrant..\\"In the relatively few times Huneker does go into musical detail there may be some insight, but just as frequently a few bars of music are shown accompanied by an explanation like, \\"Volcanic mutterings these!\\" -when the music shown is a pianissimo (played very softly) passage!For anyone looking for insights on actually playing the pieces, Walker's \\"The Chopin Companion..\\" which can be found \\"used\\" at Amazon, is a much better choice."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"Loved the documentary about Mozart.

Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called \\"Chopin: The Man And His Music\\". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"Strangely, no one seems to have writen a definitive biography of Frederic Chopin (1810-1849), despite the fact that he was one of the most important composers of the 19th century Romantic era. (Tad Szulc's book,Chopin In Paris: The Life And Times Of The Romantic Composer, is perhaps the best existing biography, in addition to Jim Samson'sChopin (Master Musicians Series)and Jeremy Siepmann'sChopin: The Reluctant Romantic; Chopin's friend Franz Liszt also wrote a \\"SORT OF\\" biography of himLife of Chopin (Forgotten Books).) Consequently, I would suggest that this book by American music newspaper writer and critic James Gibbon Huneker should not be expected to be more than it is.Huneker offers many interesting observations on Chopin's life and personality: \\"For the dissipations of the 'average sensual man,' he had an abiding contempt.\\" \\"Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries...\\" Chopin \\"did not care much for German music except Bach and Mozart. Beethoven ... was not sympathetic. Schubert he found rough, Weber, in his piano music, too operatic and Schumann he dismissed without a word.\\" With regard to Chopin's famous development of the rubato style of playing, Huneker writes, \\"The Chopin rubato is rhythm liberated from its scholastic bonds, but it does not mean anarchy, disorder.\\"Concerning Chopin's fateful meeting of author George Sand, \\"Sand was antipathetic to Chopin but her technique for overcoming masculine coyness was as remarkable in its particular fashion as Chopin's proficiency at the keyboard.\\" Her ardor for Chopin cooled as he became ill: \\"for an active mind and body like hers, it must have been irksome to submit to the caprices of a moody, ailing man.\\" In his final days, Chopin \\"begged his sister to burn all his inferior compositions. 'I owe it to the public and to myself to publish only good things.'\\" Huneker notes that \\"This wish has not been respected. The posthumous publications are for the most part feeble stuff.\\"Huneker concludes that \\"Chopin is the open door in music. Besides having been a poet and giving vibratory expression to the concrete, he was something else---he was a pioneer.\\"This isn't THE biography or study of Chopin to purchase; but for lovers of Chopin and his music, it should be read."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"Au contraire to the negative reviewers. This book is the tour de force on the music of Chopin, expressed in the most descriptive and vibrant language imaginable. It was written in the late 19th Century by a man who enthusiastically explored every nook and cranny of Chopin's genius.The book is meant primarily as an overview and examination of Chopin's music for pianists and lovers of Chopin, written by a man who was a respected music critic and pianist himself. It's full of information on how the great pianists of the time performed Chopin and invaluable as a fascinating read and historical document. The book was never intended as a dry encyclopedic biography of the composer, and much has been discovered about Chopin's life in the last 100 years that can be found in other biographical sources. Those who expect Huneker to be literally correct in every respect on Chopin's life are badly missing the point of this fascinating examination of Chopin's life and music. Huneker adored Chopin, and his writing brims with passion, enthusiasm and incredible insight into each piece Chopin produced, though his words were never intended for the piano pedagogues only.Anyone who deeply loves Chopin will find this a unique and wonderful read. I have marked many passages, referred to it countless times, and there is nothing like reading Huneker's descriptions of a Chopin work while you are actually listening to it performed at the same time. Huneker's language simply reflects the florid language of his age and is truly fantastic in its descriptive detail.Zero stars on the misguided negative reviews on the book; and 5 stars on behalf of Huneker's little Chopin classic that has been in print for over 100 years. This is a book to be savored, and there are no other writings on Chopin that can match the boundless enthusiasm that Huneker felt for his musical god. Each page brims with Huneker's exuberant spirit and his fervent love of music itself. A treasure from another age."},{"Title":"Chopin ;: The man and his music","review":"James Huneker made an praised essay around the different stages of Chopin's life as well an extensive, meticulous and detailed analysis about every one of his compositions.

Is it sexy, whoo boy, but made more so by the humanity of the people. From Enid, Oklahoma to the inevitable San Francisco he finds his people and gives them to us as the sexual, lusting beings that they are. But he never forgets that they, like us, are humans.

The real instructors for ambulance drivers were the stretcher bearers. The fifty year old men were endlessly patient about teaching raw Americans. They taught tenacity and mercy. On leave in September Weeks could play tennis with Suzanne Lenglen at the Monte Carlo Lawn Tennis Club. He made friends with a fellow volunteer, Harry Crosby. Christmas was celebrated at Vosges. At Christmas Weeks received knitted gifts from his five aunts. During his two years overseas he gained thirty pounds and grew six inches. He left the service with reminders of guilt and passion.Ted Weeks was admitted to Harvard as an unclassified student since his record at Cornell had not been good. Robert Hillyer, a poet, became Weeks's resident mentor. He knew John DosPassos and Malcolm Cowley, fellow students. Allen French, writing instructor and Concord historian, gave him a picture of the Alcotts, Hawthorne, Emerson, and Thoreau. With George Pierce Baker, John Livingston Lowes, Charles Townsend Copeland, and Bliss Perry on the English faculty, Weeks feared it would take him years to make up for lost time.The magazine at Harvard, the ADVOCATE, spoofed Ellery Sedgwick's ATLANTIC. Sedgwick's office was on Arlington Street. Weeks and the other editors of the ADVOCATE gave him a presentation copy. Walter D. Edmonds and Oliver LaFarge were published in the ADVOCATE. Virgil Thomson's critical intelligence was evident as was John Mason Brown's flair for talking. Philip Barry attended Baker's drama workshop. Professors were more accessible then than now. Weeks went to Cambridge University for graduate work. He crossed the ocean on a cattle boat and tended the cattle. Cattle hands were not part of the crew. There were 280 steers and 11 bulls. Nine days later, landing in scotland, Weeks was ravenous. Cambridge was in the fens, He read vigorously and, as was the case at Harvard, his memory of the year is studded with famous names.In 1923 Weeks moved moved to Greenwich Village. He worked as a book salesman at Boni & Liveright. He received a handwritten offer from Ellery Sedgwick to join the staff of the ATLANTIC. Ellery Sedgwick would give him more latitude than he had in his New York career and so Weeks took him up on his offer. He was to be 'first reader'. Weeks learned to trust the judgment of a co-worker, Florence Converse. The two read 160 manuscripts a day. After four years Weeks was given the opportunity to edit ATLANTIC books through an arrangement with Little Brown. He learned in that position that a publisher's relationship with an author is evolutionary. He was editor to some best selling authors including James Hall and Charles Nordhoff, and Hans Zinsser who wrote RATS, LICE and HISTORY. Zinsser lived across the street from him on Beacon Hill.The ATLANTIC lost ground during the Depression. The magazine was resized and brightened in 1939. Weeks liked to vacation in New Brunswick, he liked to fish. He enjoyed meeting people and loved discovering new writers. He helped writers turn their nonfiction magazine contributions into books. Mencken believed Americans would have a literature of surpassing freshness and vitality. To our shame we don't put value on the precise use of words. In June 1938 Weeks became the ninth editor of the ATLANTIC. He learned that editors read manuscripts and think weekends."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"This two volume set on the entire canon of Raymond Chandlers work is beautifully put together and very enjoyable to read.

My biggest complaint is that are presented here in their republished form, rather than with the original names of the protagonists.

Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!"},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"Chandler was a brilliant writer and an American genius, every bit as important asHemingway. But he wasn't very good as a mystery writer. He was honest about it, too, saying that he was more interested in atmosphere than logical deduction.It certainly shows in this collection. Chandler came to detective novels through the format of pulp fiction, which focused on violence and titillation rather than logic. Pulp writers wrote thrillers and action stories more than mysteries. Chandler did the same. To be honest, most of his early short stories are unreadable, and his one later story \\"The Pencil\\" doesn't even make it into the volume. Stuff like \\"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\\" adheres to tough-guy posturing and mannerisms on every page, but it's impossible to figure out who is blackmailing whom, and why, and also why these thugs are shooting those thugs. Of the whole lot, only \\"Pearls Are A Nuisance\\" turns out to be a sort of gem, mostly because it is a screwball comedy written in a ridiculously pedantic tone, very out of character. But you can't make a career writing stuff like that.We all know that this humble start eventually led to a huge success. However, revisiting The Big Sleep, it is surprising just how much it is indebted to the early work, and just how much it continues in the vein of the pulps. The rapidly accumulating murders are impenetrable; Chandler famously stated that he had no idea who killed the driver. (It seemed to me that it was an accident, but if so, it was a very improbable one.) Also reflecting Chandler's rough beginnings, this first Philip Marlowe novel is the only one where Marlowe kills a criminal.But at the same time, you can also see that something else is emerging. The ending of The Big Sleep is a stunning flash that instantaneously solves the main mystery, even if it does mean that all the sideplots fall by the wayside. It also introduces Marlowe as a unique character in American fiction. Tough guys who fight crime for great justice were nothing new in the 1930s, much less now. But Marlowe's concept of justice appears to be motivated by some instinctive sixth sense of honour, combined with a profound visceral disgust for criminals. Chandler understood that a little principle goes a long way -- Marlowe does not deliver long speeches or action-hero wisecracks, and often Chandler focuses so much on the routine details of the investigation (as well as Marlowe's whiskey-drinking) that it's impossible to tell exactly what the detective is thinking about everything. But in the ending, you see that he never forgot about principle, and that he understood the people he was dealing with long ago. His solution of the case is not based on any particular clue as much as on his instinctive perception of Carmen's character.That's not exactly detective fiction, but it is phenomenal drama. Chandler was a natural fit for Hollywood (where he wrote at leastoneclassic screenplay), and yet no director or actor ever got Marlowe.Hawkshas Bogart smirk too much and talk too fast, andAltmanis clueless about Marlowe's motivation. The best Marlowe wasMitchum.But back to the collection. Chandler's second novel was Farewell, My Lovely, which surpasses The Big Sleep as much as the latter surpassed the short stories. It introduces Chandler's lyricism. Marlowe's disgust for criminals is blended with self-criticism (in a mordantly funny inner monologue when he attempts to obtain information from a key witness by plying her with gin), loneliness, and a kind of detached sorrow. The book is still full of disconnected incidents (the entire trip to Amthor turns out to be a pointless digression -- actually the movie with Mitchum improved on this part), but there are also actual clues, such as a business card that the reader is unlikely to notice in time. In any case, the digressions don't matter as much, as the book is full of vivid supporting characters...or, rather, the most generic supporting characters become vivid through Chandler's ornate, stylized dialogue, full of evasions and double meanings. A routine investigation scene, taking place in the hotel across from the bar where the book begins, is full of rich, quotable dialogue. The token cop character, omnipresent in detective fiction, splits into the lazy, jaded Nulty, desensitized by routine and unrewarding investigations, and the scarily professional detective Randall, every bit as sharp as Marlowe (and maybe more), but constrained by the law as well as by extra-legal politics.Chandler's third novel The High Window is probably the best detective story in this book. It is an extremely enjoyable read, and the investigation is more streamlined, and makes more sense, than in the first two books. Pleasantly, the token cop character this time around turns out to be a very reasonable man who tries to work together with Marlowe, a welcome change from the stereotype. The book generally has all the same elements as the others, with an unexpected twist and a somewhat more uplifting ending than usual, even if it doesn't cut quite as deep, and the endlessly masochistic Merle is neither interesting nor sympathetic enough to make a good emotional lynchpin. Still, as far as entertainment value is concerned, it delivers fully.This collection offers a lot of lasting value, and it's not even Chandler's best. That camelater, with The Lady In The Lake, The Little Sister, and The Long Goodbye. He never quite became a mystery writer, but his contemplation of loss, isolation, and loyalty deepened, and his evocative, yet simple language and metaphors are just about unmatched in American literature."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"I really am enjoying reading many of Chandler's early stories.

But strictly speaking, I hadn't had any business in a month.\\"(21) For Phillip Marlowe, the irresistibly aloof private detective who stars in Chandler's impressive detective novel, Farewell, My Lovely, crime is not something he seems able or willing to avoid. Hitting the streets of Los Angeles in the midst of the American gambling craze of the 1930's, Marlowe finds himself an inextricable player in a search for knowledge of past and present crimes and criminals.Though he appears, on the surface, to be little more than a nosy, bumbling \\"private dick,\\" his successful unraveling of a closely interwoven crowd of crooks proves, as one suspect cop observes, that Marlowe \\"played...smart....You must got something we wasn't told about.\\" (228) Keeping his cards in his hand for most of the noel, Chandler shows that both he and Marlowe are \\"smart,\\" leading the reader on a circuitous trail that shakes out only in the novel's final pages.The story begins with a happenstance encounter between Marlowe and an ex-con called \\"Moose\\" Malloy. Marlowe cannot resist pursuing the suspicious-looking hulk of a man and soon finds himself both running after and from a variety of shady characters. In the course of his private investigations, Marlowe survives several near brushes with death, getting \\"sapped\\" by thugs near the novel's start, pumped full of opium in a suspicious hospital-like place, and stealthily boarding a closely guarded gambling boat to confront an infamous mobster in the middle of the night. In the end, Marlowe succeeds at untangling the web of murders and crimes that keep him running throughout the novel, but not before giving the reader the run-around as well. Chandler's smart, articulate prose lends itself well to the captivating story and intriguing characters that combine to make this a must-read for fans of detective fiction."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"Just my personal opinion, but I think Raymond Chandler is one of the most underrated American authors. Anyone who hasn't read &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; must be punishing themselves for sins in a past life. &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; and &quot;The High Window&quot; are also excellent novels--good mysteries.But what really makes Chandler's stories hold up so well is the language: &quot;The Dancers is the kind of club that will dissolution you about what a lot of extra golf money can do for the personality&quot; or &quot;What does it matter, if you're breathing wind and air or oil and water--when you're sleeping the big sleep.&quot;While the plots are wonderful period pieces of a young Los Angeles, the characters are richly drawn. Ever wonder where all those tv detectives came from? Right here.Chandler's short stories are also supurb. My vote for the single best detective short story of all time is Red Wind--there is so much that happens in such a short story. No one should ever die without reading it.....&quot;Trouble is my Business&quot; is also excellent....Is this a complete collection of his short stories? No--There are a few I would have added, even though several of them were &quot;canibalized&quot; (Chandler's phrase) into later novels. The plot of &quot;Bay City Blues&quot; was built into &quot;Lady in the Lake,&quot; but I think that story still holds up on its own. An earlier review also mentioned that &quot;The Pencil&quot; is missing. I can't understand why it was left out. &quot;Killer in the Rain&quot; also became &quot;The Big Sleep,&quot; but it still has charm. &quot;No Crime in the Mountains&quot; is not included, but that's not much of a loss.Not all of the stories in this book work--but that's going to be true with any collection. What is convenient with Library of America is the bindings are wonderful, the print font easy to read, the books lie flat, and will last forever. The list prices are a little steep--but not if you consider the amount of literature you're getting for the cost. I've bought this book three times, and have loaned it out--only for it to never return. But that's why I buy books.One final note--The previous review mentioned that in this edition Johnny Dahlmas was replaced by Phillip Marlowe in &quot;Red Wind.&quot; I was certain it was Johnny, and used Amazon's &quot;Look Inside&quot; to confirm--it is. Chandler had a few detectives, that eventually evolved into Marlowe, and each was a little different. I have a very soft spot in my heart for Dahlmas (I'm probably spelling his name wrong, so the soft spot may be in my head), so if the editor x-ed him out, I'd be furious....Buy this book."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"Earlier anthologies of Raymond Chandler's works mostly center upon what have come to be known as his 'big four' or earliest novels -- The Big Sleep, Farewell My Lovely, The High Window, The Lady In The Lake -- or upon his later, and admittedly (with the possible exception of The Little Sister) 'inferior' works. Chandler's earlier short stories ( many of which he &quot;cannibalized,&quot; to use his word, for the material in his subsequent novels) are normally treated as a separate genre altogether.This particular collection, rightly, combines Chandler's first three novels with the best of his earlier short stories, recognizing the thematic unity in those works. (Good as it is, &quot;The Lady In The Lake&quot; demands to be treated separately from Chandler's earlier efforts.)Chances are, if you're reading this, you've read most, if not all, of Chandler's Phillip Marlowe novels. You may as well have read many, if not all, of the short stories presented here. But have you read these novels, and these short stories, TOGETHER in this context? Likely not. But you deserve to.In the short stories, for example, there are protagonists named John Evans, Ted Carmody and Tony Resick (the last two of which, interestingly, inhabit locations which were most likely Los Angeles' Hotel Mayfair, with which Chandler had more than a nodding familiarity). And when, in Chandler's writings, did they meld themselves into what would be his penultimate creation, Phillip Marlowe?And at which point did Chandler begin to write, as fellow writer Ross McDonald termed it, &quot;like a slumming angel . . .&quot;? The answers to both questions may well lie here, in this collection.Pick up this collection! Read it! Discover the material anew!"},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"Raymond Chandler - from out of the past comes a master storyteller. His style is remarkable; smooth interaction and dialog,the plots intricate, well designed, reader friendly; but it was the three-dimensional detailing that I enjoyed the most when I finally discovered this out-of-the ordinary mystery writer. This particular grouping of his work by Library of America contains a selection of his short pulp fiction writings. These are splendid, each within a little world of it's own, and one marvels at his imagination. For genuine reading entertainment, Chandler is hard to put down once started.\\"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\\" - is a misnomer for sure. Everybody in this tale will shoot at anything that moves quickly given half a chance. Four men - three hoods and a \\"maybe\\" kind of good guy - are roughed up, betrayed by each other and killed within a short span of time over the foibles of a beautiful actress with more \\"whim encouraged by ego\\" than good sense.\\"Finger man\\" - testifying before a Grand Jury and helping put away a wise guy can be bad for the health. So can Casinos, mob money, political influence in underworld activities; putting a street-wise detective at risk for taking the rap after receiving skimmed money from a desperate woman working both sides of the fence. One of the most intriguing parts of the action involves using a cat as a most effective weapon of opportunity.\\"Nevada Gas\\" - the first casualty of the night belonged to a shady politico who promised to grease the wheels of justice and \\"get the half-brother of a gangster\\" out of the hot seat for a respectable fee; the service was bought and paid for, but wasn't delivered. That usually spells trouble in the world of exchanged favors and crooked politics, especially when playing for keeps with \\"tough guys\\". These particular people had their own way of \\"dealing with a double-dealer\\" - a back seat with no door handles and a sweet odor of almonds.\\"Pearls are a Nuisance\\" - in a vast departure from the others comes this bit of tomfoolery. In fact, you have to get into it awhile to figure out what he is doing; then it dawns on you with a big laugh. Picture Tom and Dick Smothers as private detectives, only Tom has a snootful. Or Leslie Neilsen with a sidekick. It starts off with the \\"detective\\" getting a call from his girlfriend who suspects a strand of phony pearls has been heisted from her employer and she thinks she knows who did it. As she outlines the theory to him, she casually mentions that the suspected perp \\"tried to kiss her.\\" Bristling with testosterone, our man makes his way immediately to the perps address to confront him - not about the pearls so much as about the \\"tried to kiss\\" thing. Brandy and Scotch bottles appear as if from nowhere; after a very unusual brawl the two tipsy adversaries become fast friends and determine they can solve the mystery over another bottle of Scotch. It is truly a hoot, and totally unexpected. Forsooth, after reading Chandler's bio, one might suspect he had been hitting another flask of his own as wrote this one.\\"Goldfish\\" - in another tale of precious pearls heisted, \\"goldfish\\" turned out to be a password of sorts - once that password was delivered, the answers to the next questions better be right and our detective is flying by the seat of his pants in that department; he knows just enough to get himself killed if he doesn't play it right. But the mastermind had outsmarted himself as most of them ultimately tend to do. The theft itself turned out to be the easiest part of the idea; because the merchandise became too hot to handle. A bloodhound-type pursuit ensues with a thrilling ending that was one of a kind.These short stories, mingling with the novels, make for long, lingering evenings of reading enjoyment if you're in the mood for mystery, well done."},{"Title":"Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)","review":"Chandler was a brilliant author and Marlowe is a timeless character.

It boldly states on it's dust jacket that it contains all the short stories that Chandler wrote with the exception of those he refused to have collected in his lifetime. It does not, missing are the Bronze Door and Professor Bingo's Snuff. One would think that the editors of this volume would want to make it a point to include all of these &quot;lost&quot; writings especially because &quot;Killer in the Rain, the book that contains those eight that Chandler didn't want published is currently out of print. As for the remaining two, &quot;The Bronze Door&quot; is in &quot;Fingerman&quot; that has long been out of print and in a few sci-fi pulps, the latest in 1953. &quot;Professor Bingo's Snuff&quot; is in a pulp called &quot;fantasic&quot; and nowhere else.

This ends in a tragedy for the powerful millionaire that hired Marlowe. (Why couldn't Marlowe notice the tail when he went to visit the Questioned Document Examiner?) Does this story echo some Shakespearean tragedy?\\"Finger Man\\" tells how a crooked politician tries to get even with Marlowe.

Walter represents the classic wealthy detective of English fiction, Henry the hard-boiled detective of American fiction. They try to recover a stolen pearl necklace, which is \\"Dutch\\" (slang for fake). But a high ransom tells Walter they are real. Walter recovers the pearls in a surprise ending.\\"I'll Be Waiting\\" is about one-night at a hotel. A woman checks in and tells the night clerk she is waiting for a visitor.

But after hearing Toby Stephens' brilliant portrayal of his iconic Philip Marlowe on British radio I became intrigued. This volume is part of a set of two with all of Chandler's stories except Poodle Springs, his last, finished by Robert B. Parker. I began with the famous novels Farewell My Lovely and The Big Sleep. The writing was like nothing I was familiar with. Rather than be turned off by the slang of the underclass of the Depression Era '30's, I was drawn into a world totally realized and fascinating. The character of Marlowe is a miracle of cynicism and chivalry. The mystery in each novel is almost beside the point. It's Marlowe with his world-weary charm and wise-cracking persona that kept me enthralled. I then enjoyed reading Chandler's earlier stories for the pulp fiction magazines watching the evolution of his talent and spying glimpses of the Marlowe-to-be.

I read this book before I read his &quot;Arrogant Capital&quot; and it strikes me that Phillips is maybe a little too naive in expecting things to improve in America. It is fortunate of course that we in this country have people like Phillips who inform us well so that we can then make informed decisions about what to do in the future. Take me for instance, I have decided to leave America for the next 15 years, or at least I am going to attempt a life abroad. If you read Phillips and Krugman and just about what any other respected journalist or educated government watcher writes, then there is but one inescapable conclusion - viz, America ails with a terminal illness. The microbes of this illness are the K-Street lobbyists and also the Christian Coalition. According to Phillips the demise of the middle class which incidentally is a symptom of the breakdown of governance, started a long time ago, when we did not have Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson running around with their silly diatribes. So, at this late stage in the atrophy, injecting religion into politics is akin to shooting crystal meth into your veins when you are in the last stages of liver cancer. The final nail in the coffin. By the way, I am a born again Christian evangelical."},{"Title":"Boiling Point: Democrats, Republicans, and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity","review":"Phillips does a good job of demonstrating why the American middle class was shrinking in the early 1990's.The situation today(2008) has only been exacerbated by 17 years of more of the same-more and more speculation in financial assets and stocks and less and less industrial and manufacturing production.A combination of securitization and banker financed speculation has resulted in an economy where the major growth sector is \\" financial services \\".More and more income is diverted into this speculative sinkhole while less and less is invested in long run physical capital formation that will create jobs and businesses where profits are based on production.The current banker dominated approach to income generation is the manipulation of the financial assets of corporate America-profit without production.It is obvious that the fortunes of the American middle class are tied to an economy primarily based on a strong industrial-manufacturing sector that produces real goods for sale .These fortunes are severely impacted negatively if the currently dominate speculative approach continues.The core of Philips analysis is contained on pp.185-190.Phillips does an excellent job in discussing this issue.The impact on the reader,however,could have been much greater if Phillips had explicitly tied his analysis to the analysis originally presented by Adam Smith in 1776 and restated in advanced form by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 in The General Theory of Employment,Interest, and Money .Unfortunately,Phillips appears to be unaware that Adam Smith had already warned against allowing speculators to take control of an economy by allowing them access to bank loans with which to leverage their debt positions.Smith's conclusion is that savings loaned out to speculators is savings that is \\" ... wasted and destroyed \\".There has never been a more clearcut warning about the dangers of speculation.

This area is beautiful but less-visited than the Sierra. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevation, navigation, time, and season. All tours have B&amp;W copies USGS topos (1 inch per mile scale) with the trail outlined. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you through the tour. The book also has a list of local lodging and official information sources. Lots of interesting and entertaining ski pictures are sprinkled in the book. The only thing I think is missing would be an index, but that wouldn't stop me from buying the book.Also recommended: Ski Tours in the Sierra Nevada, 50 Classic Backcountry Ski and Snowboard Summits in California, Ski Tours in Southern California"},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Great War: The Western Front 1914-1918","review":"Chronicles of the Great War is really a photographic history of World War One. There is also informative accompanying text, but the photographs take up the larger proportion of the pages. The photographs are all numbered and are easily referenced by the number to the notes describing each photograph. Interestingly, war photography during this period does not include many phtographs of actual combat, particularly close combat. Photography still being in its relative infancy and the perilous nature of raising ones head above a trench, probably account for this. The reader is presented with hundreds of photographs which serve to give a sense of what it was like for the soldiers during World War One. There are very few diagrams in this book. For a more detailed look at World War One in a similar format check out The &quot;Historical Atlas of World War I&quot; by Anthony Livesey, H. P. Willmott (Editor). &quot;Chronicles of the Great War&quot; is an interesting read but is not as comprehensive as the &quot;Historical Atlas of World War I&quot;. Like all books on 'The Great War' this one however conveys the horror of trench warfare and terrible suffering endured by the soldiers. On that theme you may wish to read &quot;Fields of Memory: A Testimony to the Great War by Anne Roze&quot;. Recommended, but more detailed books are available."},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Great War: The Western Front 1914-1918","review":"After I had read a couple of novels--The World As I Found It by Bruce Duffy about Wittgenstein's trench-bound years--and Sebastian Barry's A Long Long Way From Home about an Irish soldier fighting for the Crown on the opposite side from Wittgenstein, I wanted to see what these authors described. This book served that purpose: it showed me how the trenches were designed, and fantastic aerial reconnaisance photos look down upon the \\"dog's tooth\\" pattern dug in over miles and miles; a couple show before-and-after comparisons of areas bombed. After the fact the terrain looks like a brownie or a dry lake floor in the desert. Such pictures tell much.The text was less satisfying. I skimmed much of it after having made a brave start. But features within the more narrative, year-by-year, General this led this army this way types of prose did clarify not only trench warfare but aerial duels, nurses and medical care, and transport efficiently in a few pages. The author takes pains at the end of his account to stress not only the predictable tales we all have read about incompetent leaders and miserable conditions, but reminds us that this was the greatest victory achieved across the longest front in history by the British and later their Allies. Whether or not this was worth millions of lives lost and maimed and shattered remains, I suppose, for the memorialists more than the military strategists and dutifully detached chroniclers."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"When Brother Brutha of the Omnian Church starts talking to a tortoise, he merely assumes that he has gone mad. However, when the tortoise turns out to be the great god Om who is having a Bad Day, Brutha finds that his faith is about to be put to the test...Up to (and including) Witches Abroad, Terry Pratchett was an author who wrote books that broadly fell in two categories: books that spoofed or were a satire of modern society in some way, often through broad comedy, and other books that were a bit more serious and had a point to them, though still amusing. The two sides had come very close to coexisting in Pyramids, but arguably just managed to avoid fusing into one impressive whole.Small Gods is where Pratchett got it right. The entire book, from its first page to its last, is a lengthy, sustained and inordinately clever examination of religion, fundamentalism and blind faith and their conflict with reason, argument and science. And you barely notice, because the story itself is extremely taut, well-told and brilliantly characterised with Pratchett's occasional bursts of silliness kept to a minimum in favour of flashes of wry and at times angry humour. Small Gods is a book that Richard Dawkins would kill to have written, and done so in such a manner that even the most God-bothering evangelical would have still been riveted to it.Small Gods has the veneer of being just a traditional Pratchett book: there's some jokes about men in togas arguing pointlessly about philosophy (in a world where it is difficult to have a conversation about, \\"Are the gods real?\\" when a lightning bolt will come flying through the window five seconds later with a label attached saying, \\"YES,\\"), Death has a couple of cameo appearances and there is a running joke about tortoises being nice to eat. But you can tell the subject matter really got Pratchett riled up. His hatred of blind faith and the idea that killing people is okay because some book says so - and, let's face it, that book was written by a old guy who might have been bitten by a donkey that morning and was a really foul mood when he started on the bit about doing unto others with fire and brimstone and was probably not, when you get down to it, an actual deity - really comes through in this novel, but in measured tones.Character-wise, Small Gods may be Pratchett's strongest book. Most of the cast does not reoccur in the series (Death and a very brief trans-temporal appearance by a certain simian book-collector aside), but Pratchett still has time to paint them in impressive detail. Vorbis may be one of the scariest 'villains' (if that's even a right description) in the whole series. Brutha is certainly one of its most interesting protagonists. Om's pragmatic, tortoise-meets-deity outlook on life is amusing. Even minor characters like Didactylos and would-be rebel leader Simony are well-rounded and given good rationales for what they do.Almost as importantly, the ending does not suck. Pratchett has a patchy record with endings, with his books sometimes ending okay and others being a bit of a let-down after a strong start and middle section. Small Gods, however, has a fantastic ending, starting with possibly the biggest belly-laugh out of all thirty-odd books in the series (hint: it involves something being airborne which shouldn't be) and proceeding from there.Intelligent but never preachy, philosophical but never boring, Small Gods (*****) is Terry Pratchett's masterpiece (okay, his strongest masterpiece). It is the strongest Discworld novel and almost certainly the best thing he has ever written."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"\\"Small Gods\\" is the thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, and was first published in 1992.Omnia lies on the Klatchian coast, between the Klatchian desert and Howondaland's jungles. The country is run by religious fundamentalists, with the Cenobiarch officially in charge of both the church and the state. However, the real power lies with Vorbis, head of the Quisition - who most people expect to be anointed the Eighth Prophet. (It's been 200 years since the Declaration of the Prophet Abbys, which means that the time of the Eighth Prophet was at hand - Om tends to have very punctual prophets). Vorbis terrifies most people he meets, which is hardly surprising given his job title and his physical appearance probably helps - shaven all over and eyes of the deepest black.The Omnians have very firm beliefs - that Om is the only god and that the Discworld is round, for example. Anyone who says differently, however, is branded a heretic and booked in for an appointment with the Quisition. Unfortunately the Omnians are entirely wrong - there are plenty of gods on the Discworld, with many of the more important deities living at Dunmanifestin. Furthermore, the Discworld is flat and is supported on the backs of four great elephants - which, in turn, are carried by the great turtle A'Tuin. Vorbis, however, isn't too happy that many people in Omnia have started to believe these heretical lies - with Ephebe being blamed as the source of the wicked rumours in question. Their righteous anger has been compounded by an attack on Brother Murduck, who was visiting Ephebe, and the burning of the Omnian fleet. (Those who live in Ephebe, however, considered that an act of pre-emptive defence, following Om's invasion and occupation of Betrek and Ushistan).Things are going to get any better for Vorbis either - as it turns out, Om's eighth prophet is Brutha. On paper, he seems to be a strange choice : Brutha, after all, is only a novice who works in a vegetable garden. (However, given that Lu-Tze - the noted History Monk - is looking after him, it's no surprise Furthermore, he can't read, write or sing - although, thanks to his amazing memory, he knows the Septateuch by heart. Neither is Om's return as glorious as his flock would have expected. Instead of arriving as an eagle, a lion or a bull, as is traditional, he arrives as a tortoise. He can't manage anything better due to their lack of belief in him - people believe in the church, its rules and especially the Quisition...but as far as real, honest, genuine belief in Om goes, Brutha is just about the height of it. Unsurprisingly, it's only a matter of time before Brutha and Vorbis meet. In fact, Vorbis decides to bring Brutha along on a very important (and officially peaceful) mission to Ephebe. Brutha, in turns, secretly brings Om...As usual, a very enjoyable book from Pratchett - and being one of his \`standalone' novels, it's a good place to begin if you haven't read any other of the Discworld books. (For those who have read a couple of the Ankh-Morpork books, the appearance of a character called Cut-Me-Own-Hand-Off Dblah will probably raise a smile though). Om and Brutha prove to be very likeable characters, and they have a very good effect on each other. Om grasps the concept of fairness, rather than smiting just because he feels like it. Brutha, on the other hand, stops blindly accepting what has been written - largely because, when he quotes scripture, Om replies hasn't got a clue what he's talking about. (As it turns out, Om didn't dictate the holy books...Ossory managed to come up with one hundred and ninety three chapters when Om appeared as a pillar of fire and said \\"hey, see what I can do !\\"). Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"-- sooner or later.Pratchett has done the unthinkable - kept a series (and a humor series at that) alive and fresh well into its second dozen. This book started that second dozen.It's about Brutha, a minor novitiate even among novitiates who are all minor. He's doing what he does best, hoeing the beans, when his god arises before him in physical manifestation:A turtle. Slow. Partial to lettuce. Not fond of being turned over or dropped. Not much for conversation when it gets cold out. And, as near as Om can tell, the god of Brutha only. No one else seems to be paying much attention when the god calls down plagues, or at least some really nasty rashes.In Prathcett's hands, this small start yields a very worthy bit of amusement. No, there's really no point to what Pratchett writes (well, that's what he wants you to think). Brutha crosses his world, overturns empires as easily as he overturns weeds in the bean-patch, and dies happy. Everyone dies, and Brutha has seen lots of the other ways - this really is a happy ending.For all of its shallow jests, this book has rewards for the serious reader. Brutha wins in the end by be slow, thick, and mind-bogglingly even-handed. Om finally comes out of his shell and really makes his entry, even among the more exclusive clubs of the gods. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, no matter what you thought they deserved. By the way: observe Om, the lowly turtle, and the place of the turtle in Discworld cosmology.Pratchett fans: watch Vorbis. Yes, the character dies, but that doesn't mean much in Discworld. He may reincarnate as Vetinari, or maybe as Vetinari's evil identical twin. Death is there, all caps, but really quite a congenial chap - says &quot;Thank you&quot; when you pass him the bottle, sort of thing. The librarian is there, working hard in librarian heroics. Lu Tze is there, makin sure that history turns out the way it's supposed to, not that he has a lot to work with.Every series has its ups and downs. This is a serious up for Discworld. Enjoy!//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"\\"Small Gods\\" is another Discworld novel, and one of the best to date. Taking place far away from the more familiar setting of Ankh-Morpork, the story centers on the struggle for religious freedom, and the difference between truth and perception.Through absolutely no fault of his own, Brutha, a novice in the church of Omnia, has the misfortune of meeting his God as a voice inside his own head. Whereas the church is one of persecution, power grabbing and torture, Brutha is a peace-loving individual, slow in thought and imagination. He is ill prepared for meeting a deity. Om, his God, isn't having a very good day either.Practchett utilizes his unique sense of humor and the setting of Discworld, to satire modern culture and popular thought. In \\"Small Gods\\", the issues tackled are religion, fanaticism and the drive for power. Whereas all of the Discworld books are funny, \\"Small Gods\\" is both funny and extremely thought provoking, with perhaps the hint of a message.The book isn't quite as silly as, for instance, \\"Reaper Man\\", but there is plenty of the traditional silliness throughout. No need to lose one's sense of humor when making a point. Pratchett manages with style. (The guide to Discworld at the back is pretty fun, as well.)"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In &quot;Small Gods&quot;, Terry Pratchett tackles religion and philosophy. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Our character offerings this time are an evil inquisitor named Vorbis, a meek apprentice named Brutha, and their almighty God Om, here incarnated as a powerless tortoise. Religion is the subject of the first half of the book, as we get lots of jokes about the evils of oppressive theocracy of medieval mindsets. I don't mind humor on this topic; the problem lies more in Pratchett's lack of originality. The jokes are mostly old ones, with a distinctly dreary feel. Pratchett's humor works better in the conversations between Brutha and Om, where the 'logic' of religion clashes with the oddness of having a god who's a small tortoise to produce some bizarre results.Brutha: That's Blasphemy!Om: I can't blaspheme, I'm a God.orOm: Somebody up there likes me. It's me, of course.Luckily, the boring religious passages flow by fast enough that they don't really weigh the book down, and things pick up once we move to the city of Ephebe, where robed philosophers clash over metaphysics and Om tries to earn a living via geometric skill. The ending is everything we've come to expect from a Pratchett ending. So while &quot;Small Gods&quot; may not be Discworld's high watermark, it's still well worth checking out."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"When Temple Novice Brutha hears a small turtle talking to him, he is certain it is a demon--until the turtle persuades Brutha that he (the turtle) is, in fact, the Great God Om. Brutha's entire civilization is built around the worship of Om, but worship and belief are two very different things. In Discworld, a god's power comes from the prayers of his believers and Om, it turns out, has exactly one believer--Brutha. Brutha is not especially bright, but he has a perfect memory and he is tasked to come on a journey with the Exquisitioner of Om--a man who has made a career of routing evil out of the theocracy. On the journey, Brutha discovers philosophy, books, and strange ideas about coexistance.The idea of a world swarming with small gods, each desparately seeking for believers and each concerned primarily with their own self-interest (it is the amount rather than the content of the prayer tha matters) is funny and author Terry Pratchett milks it to the max. The once-great and now diminished Om is a charming character, full of himself and of practical advice that Brutha mostly ignores. Pratchett presents SMALL GODS in a fairy-tale style, tying the story together with other Discworld novels through the device of the time monks and the omni-present Death.Occasionally, Pratchett gets a little carried away with his message and certainly SMALL GODS doesn't deliver the kind of complex and evolving character that Pratchett develops in his wonderful Night Watch sub-series (NIGHT WATCH was BooksForABuck.com's #1 pick for 2002), but the novel is well written and interesting nevertheless."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is a masterpiece; it is well written, creative, original, hilarious and thought-provoking. From the first page I was mesmerized, and it has long since become my favorite book. I have written more than my fair share of essays about this amazing story. Terry Pratchett has perfected the art of making you laugh and making you think. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and a love of laughter."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchet is very rare today. He actually writes satire that is very funny. Small Gods is about the rise of a new religion through simple belief. He satires the idea of church, but not faith. If you do not have a sense of humor when it comes to religion, this book is not for you. His story unfolds that every religion starts out with good intentions, but ends up mired in dogma. You can't but help to love the turtle god and his half-wit follower. The scene with the god and an eagle is a true classic of modern writing. This book is part of the famous discworld series, but stands alone and apart. This is a good book for a new reader to Pratchett to start. If you liked Douglass Adams or satire, then you will love Terry Pratchett. You will spend most of the time laughing along with the story."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was my first Discworld book, and although I don't know what I don't know about the others, this story seemed like a good place to start. That is, it didn't seem to require any prior knowledge of the series to understand.This story is about an apparent simpleton, Brutha, whose simple faith is humorously juxtaposed against the absurdity of religion run amok.The plot itself was a simple construction to allow the author to wax humorous on the concepts of gods, worshippers, and philosophy in order to get across his message about the human condition - that purity of heart can not only triumph over evil, but maybe even redeem it in some cases, and that victory perhaps doesn't require us to impale our enemies on sharp sticks (or hot turtles)."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This book is simply hilarious. All of Terry's books at least make me crack a smile at one point, but only a few are truly comedy masterworks, and this is one of them. I don't want to give away much of the plot or any of the jokes, so this won't be a very long review. Suffice to say that this is one of the best religious parodies I've read. Some other reviewers have found this book offensive, but unless you're a very touchy religious conservative or a Catholic from several hundred years ago, I doubt you'll mind. None of the characters in this book occur in other books, which makes this an ideal start to the Discworld series."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Imagine, if you will, that you are a big time god, with millions of worshippers, big temples, and all the trappings. That you can incarnate as an impressive ram or a magnificent white swan and that you have all the standard godlike powers. Then, one day, you close your eyes for just a seconds and, suddenly, you found it's years later and you are a small turtle being carried 200 feet in the air by a hungry eagle. An eagle who fully intends to drop you in order to crack your shell. Fortunately the eagle miscalculates and instead of dead, you wind up face down in a compost heap. Such was the fate of The Great God Om.Or, imagine that you are a temple novice. Not a particularly bright novice, but well behaved. You have a fantastic memory, but are a little short on what it takes to understand how the squiggly markings on the scroll can be words and ideas. You're nice, even tempered, and have a bit of a weight problem. While you will probably be a novice forever, you like novicey tasks like turning the compost heap and tending the garden. Or you did until a crazy, one-eyed turtle walked out of the grass and said, \`Hey, you!' Such was the fate of Brutha.So begins Terry Pratchett's marvelously witty attack on organized religion, spiritual snobbery, philosophers, and bad people in general. For, with all those people worshipping Om, only one person really believed in him. You guessed it, Brutha the novice. You see, gods need people who believe in them, or they kind of dry up and disappear into the desert with all the other small gods. Om sees the handwriting on the wall. In order to stay in business he will heed to enlist Brutha, push him into action, and completely rework Omnianism. No simple task for a god whose current lightning bolt will barely singe an eyebrow.To make matters worse, our hapless duo must deal with Deacon Vorbis, head of the Omnian Quisition. All of the Omnian Church's inquisitors take their orders from Vorbis, who was more or less the opposite of Brutha. He is very smart, quite thin, and not very nice at all. The kind of person who turns turtles upside down in the sun to see how long it takes them to die. Vorbis is a strict follower of the Omnian church and intends to be its next prophet. He is not about to let a holy turtle and a chubby novice get in the way. Instead he intends to use Brutha's eidetic memory to aid in the invasion of the city Ephebe, which is full of philosophers, gods, and is not very cooperative at all.In Pratchett's hand the struggles of Om and Brutha are the basic material for a funny and insightful look at the difference between worship and belief. Pratchett has little toleration for dogma, unquestioning belief, or the abuse of religious power. But he is never unkind, simply honest, and it is clear that he writes from a strong ethical sense. He is to be admired for undertaking what is usually a difficult subject and bringing his points home with considerable consideration and love. If you're looking for a diatribe you won't find it here. If what you want is a bit of insight and a lot of snorts and chuckles, \\"Small Gods\\" is just the book for you."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Having just finished &quot;SMALL GODS&quot;, I am somewhat embarrassed.

Either you know it, or you don't!SMALL GODS is the sort of inside joke rich people share at cocktail parties, sniggering at those who don't get it. They are also the sort of people Vorbis could have made use of.Pratchett makes use of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, a dash of Catholicism, and a pinch of heresy in this incredibly brilliant novel.

Pratchett has revisited the whole bloody history of religion, philosophy, government, and science as they are put to use in the service of war, death, and destruction, and served them up as a feast of knowing smiles, wicked grins, meaningful chuckles, spontaneous laughter, and a couple of uncontrollable guffaws for desert. But be warned, if you don't find it palatable to mix a bit of thinking and contemplation with your laughter, you might want to pass on this one.Pratchett may be a philosopher disguised as a fantasy novelist and humorist. He gives us characters that brilliantly capture the gamut of human endeavor, from the pure malice of Vorbis, the true believer inquisitor, to the equally pure humanity of Brutha, the peasant prophet of brotherly love. He shows a keen understanding of the entire muddle in between, where most of us dwell, as well. He dissects the nature of belief and the relationship that humans have to their gods and vice-a-versa. And he shows exactly why the best human instincts so rarely win out in the end and what could happen when they do. Along the way, he scatters a plethora of erudite and silly jokes like land mines. Dissertations could be written on this book, but that would miss the point.Avoid this book if you are adverse to cleverness and hilarity. Otherwise, put your hands on a copy post haste and join the delighted initiates of Pratchett's marvelous and witty world.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was my twelfth Discworld novel (reading them in order) and it's my favorite so far. Very funny and very moving. Pratchett satirizes religion, the military, atheism, philosophy, and then ties everything up neatly at the end in a most satisfying way.The book is more complex and layered than the previous I've read. Beyond the numerous historical and literary allusions (Plato's cave allegory, Homer, Elijah, Aesop, etc.) Pratchett weaves his own allegory of faith, God, and the solution to the dilemnas of the human condition."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I doubt that Pratchett is capable of &quot;straight writing&quot; of any length -- his ironic wit and off-balance turn of phrase likely infuse his every waking thought! Nevertheless, this novel has a definite dark side and the reader's laughter is apt to taper off into an uneasy awareness of just how nasty certain kinds of people can be. Especially the coldly fanatical religious types, about whom this is very much a cautionary tale. Om is the very small god of the title, once a great supernatural being with hundreds of thousands of believers keeping him stoked, but now reduced to the form of a two-pound desert tortoise and with only the steadfast belief of Brutha, a mere novice, keeping him alive. (&quot;Alive&quot; in the sense that gods, it seems, can die, just like everyone else.) The Omnian Church is doing well, though, ruling the populace through fear and torture and engendering no belief in the deity whatever. (The Omnians believe that the world is spherical and orbits the sun -- which on the Discworld is utter superstitious nonsense.) And at the top of that unpleasant heap is the dreaded Deacon Vorbis. Om can't read human minds but he can see their shapes, and Vorbis's mind has the shape of a steel ball. Nothing gets in and nothing gets out. Vorbis needs a new secretary -- the previous one having been used up -- and he takes Brutha out of his haven in the garden because of the young man's extraordinary memory. But being in close proximity to the Deacon is going to have an effect on Brutha's belief, and so is their diplomatic mission across the deep desert to Ephebe, home of happily contending philosophers and inventors. Some of the story's best characters appear in Ephebe, especially the Platonic-Aristotelian Didactylos and his apprentice, the proto-Archimedian Urn. An excellent book, humane, thoughtful, and not to be taken lightly at all."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"The Great God Om wakes up in tortoise-form just as an eagle hurls him into a compost pile. If you're the type of person who worries about being struck by lightning while reading the wrong kind of book, stay away from &quot;Small Gods.&quot; Terry Pratchett blasphemes against (or maybe I should say 'explains') religion in this book, and most philosophies too. This is one of his more seriously comic Discworld books, although only Pratchett (and Monty Python) would even consider an attempt at a comedy about the Grand InquisitionIf Galileo had muttered, &quot;Eppur si muove!&quot; to the Inquisition on Discworld, he no doubt would have been referring to the gigantic turtle that carries the world on its back. He would have burned too, old as he was, if Vorbis the exquisitor had overheard him blaspheming against the perfect sphere of Discworld, which orbits around the Sun &quot;as Man orbits the central truth of Om.&quot;Meanwhile Om scrabbles out of the compost heap and discovers Brutha, a young novice who is hoeing melons in the temple garden. Brutha is the only person left on Discworld who truly believes in Om, and really bad things happen to gods who lose all of their believers.However, Brutha almost loses his god. Vorbis the exquisitor discovers the small tortoise hissing at him and doesn't recognize it as his God, Om. He flips it over, inserts a couple of pebbles into its shell so it can't right itself, then sticks Om on the garden wall to broil in the sun.Vorbis is a bad 'un.After this temporary setback (setback, get it?), &quot;Small Gods&quot; carries on with the tale of Om and Brutha and their adventures as Om tries to figure out why he ended up as a tortoise, and Brutha attempts to discover truth in religion.

He silently cursed a beetle, which is like pouring water onto a pond. It didn't seem to make any difference anyway. The beetle plodded away. He cursed a melon unto the eighth generation, but nothing happened. He tried a plague of boils. The melon just sat there, ripening slightly.&quot;Some classic Pratchett lines but a somewhat weak ending. Don't miss it, though. It's still worth a few hundred smiles."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods is, in my opinion, Terry Pratchett's most powerful Diskworld novel. While continuing his reputation as a masterful humorist, Small Gods thoughtfully tackles the serious world of humanity, ecclesiatic institutions, faith and God. Or gods. As with all Diskworld novels, it's both satire and parable of our own world -- and much more. I keep several copies on hand at all times for instant giving to favorite friends!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"If Pratchett isn't God, he's at least tuned into that realm much better than any of us. This book is amazing. Hands down i feel it is the best book i have ever read and ever will read (and i have gotten around some in my reading already), simply because it has everything, and teaches so much. Rolling-on-the-floor-laughing caliber humor, deeply memorable characters (Brutha is an icon), a wonderful and original plot, and a few lessons that, should you read this book with an open mind, may change your life. I know they did mine. You owe it to yourself to read this book. If you don't, may your sexual organs sprout wings and fly away!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett may have accomplished the miracle of goingfrom the ridiculous to the sublime, and back again. In fact,he may be the best philosopher writing today.Anyone familiar with Mr. Pratchett's other works knows he'sfunny. _Small Gods_ is certainly funny. In a nutshell, it'sthe story of a boy and his god. The problemis, the Great God Om has become a small tortoise due tothe lack of faith of his worshipers. Instead of making divinepronouncements and throwing fireballs, he's reduced to throwingsparks and speaking in the mind of his only true believer,a simple young man named Brutha. During their adventures, we getto meet some of the best and worst denizens of the discworld,and Pratchett airs some really thought-provoking theories ofthe origins of the divine, the nature of belief, and the powerpeople have to shape the conditions in the world around them.Of course, you don't have to buy into these crazy ideas. Afterall, it's only a &quot;light fantasy comedy&quot; book. Right? RIGHT?Seriously (or foolishly as the case may be) check this one out.It's a rare book that makes you think while you're laughingand laugh while you're thinking."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This book is excellent. It's thoroughly enjoyable, well written, witty, and very engaging. This is my third Discworld book. I was disappointed by Color of Magic. The Light Fantastic was better, but not quite perfect. Small Gods is perfect. The characters are well developed and the ideas about gods and belief are brilliant. I fully recommend this book.There's been discussion about which book to start with. This one is as good as any, better than the first few, actually. &quot;The Turtle Moves!&quot;"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. One of my friends suggested I not read this one yet, because she knew my habit of giving up on a book when bored with it. But being me, I read it anyway.It was excellent. The way Pratchett describes how gods and goddesses come into power and shrivel into a mere ghost of their previous forms by basis of belief is superb. This is one of those books that entertain you all the way through, but soon you find yourself really thinking about what the content means or what it COULD mean."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Mr. Pratchett is a very good writer, and while not every discworld novel is a knock out, none have been bad. Of all of his work this is my favorite. I reread it at least every couple of months. Bruthra and Om [pointy horns] spin a tale quite entertaining that keeps me coming back. I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Pratchett consistenly brings rare genius to the table with his colorfull discworld series and Small Gods is no exception. In one of his best written novels to date, Pratchett delves into religion, spirituality and dogma with uncomprimised insight. Featuring a page turning plot, intricate and memorable charachters, biting satire, and laugh out loud humor, Small Gods delves into fantasy yet arrives poigantly at the heart of human nature. This is a briliantly written work offering not only unique perspective but great entertainment."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was an excellent and extremely funny book; yet another of Pratchett's wonderful stories. It speculates on the origins of religion and pokes fun at everyone. Definintely a must-read for believers and atheists alike."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This book is amazing! It provides us with great humor while taking a serious look at religion as a whole. Personally I think the Great God Om is the best character on the whole Discworld (followed by a close second of Rincewind and then Death bringing up third place) and I hope to see him again sometime soon, maybe in another Discworld book(of course). This book also has the best villian in the whole series as far as I'm concerned...he was really truly an evil man. In short...I LOVED IT!!!!!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was the first book I read by Pratchett, and I was just blown away. If you've ever read anything by him, you'll love this book also; if you haven't his is a great place to start. Though humorous, this is probably one of the best looks at religion you'll ever get. :)"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"The first Pratchett book that I've ever read, I was immediatThe first Pratchett book that I've ever read, I was immediately drawn up. Coincidentally, I was considering the nature of gods at Camp Rising Sun when I read the book, so it only fueld the imagination. Definitely one of the best books that I've ever read, and challenging Douglas Adams' works for most humorous."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was the best book ever. That is all i need say. I am mainly writing this in the hope that someone with at least a spark of knowledge has noticed that near the top of the page in the synopsis et c. area, it says that i) 'brutha is a man...'. he is refered to by everyone as a boy and we know that he is 17 and a novice anyway.ii) that 'the disc is carried by FOUR TURTLES'! oh please. There are several philosophies on the disc, including that the world is an Orb, and that the universe is carried by an old man in a sack (see 'the last continent'), but no-where does it mention four turtles.the turtle moves.Lord BlaaP.S. No worries, eh?"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Having never read any of Terry Pratchett's work before, I have to admit that I was more than impressed with his novel, &quot;Small Gods&quot;. Not only was it extremely entertaining, but it was also very thought provoking and the kind of book you have to read many times to catch all of the nuances and details, and to absorb the pure, satiric pleasure of it all. One of my favorite characters is the blind prophet Didactylos, who carries a &quot;lantern that doesn't shine for a man that doesn't see&quot; because it &quot;works perfectly, and of course, is very philosophical&quot;. In my opinion, this not the &quot;usual&quot; fantasy novel in any way. It is an extremely smart, witty, entertaining, and intelligent read (for a book of ANY genre), and I will enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who asks! So do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I would say that this book makes a satirical strike against Organized Religion as an institution, but it pretty much goes after the disorganized ones as well, and takes a potshot or two at atheism and general philosophy along the way. The book is set in Pratchett's Discworld series, but you don't really need any background in Discworld other than to know the concept. There is no continuity to worry about and recognizing the cameos by recurring characters (Dibbler as Dblah, for example, or the orangutan librarian) is not necessary to enjoying the book. I'd only read a couple other Discworld books, and I got along fine. This is a different set of characters, a different part of the world, and a different kind of story from the typical Discworld fare.The mechanics of divinity presented here are not new. The story relies on the idea that a god's power derives from strength of belief - the more believers, the more powerful the god. Every so often, a god returns to the Discworld to appoint a new prophet and renew his faith among the masses, maybe make a few updates to his holy writings. Om is a god with millions of worshippers, so when he comes to the Discworld to choose a prophet, he is surprised to find himself incarnated into the form of a small one-eyed tortoise. That's because while he has millions of people dedicated to the worship of Om, he only has one true believer. That believer, a young man named Brutha, is a simple novice with a unique talent - perfect memory - so that while he can't read or write, he has all the books of the church of Om committed to memory.The division is drawn between the belief in a god and the following of a religion. While Om once had millions of believers, which made him strong among gods, and his people conquered nations in his name, they have since forgotten what their belief was for and instead came to believe in the symbols of the church, and the mundane trappings and figures of authority have supplanted the connection to the divine. This is the world that Brutha exists in. An oppressive theocracy dedicated to the worship of Om dominates the hearts and minds of the people. The ruthless Quisition exists to enforce the proper methods of worship, and to ferret out and remove any traces of heresy from the populace. The dreaded Deacon Vorbis leads the Quisition, and intends to set himself up as the next prophet of Om. Although Vorbis doesn't actually hear the voice of his god, he finds that declaring himself the prophet will make such a step irrelevant. And nobody but Brutha knows that the god Om has returned, albeit as a small reptile, and that Brutha hears his voice. And Brutha thinks the turtle might be lying.The story is told in a witty, ironic, wry narrative style that never fails to elicit a smile or a chuckle from the reader. There may be occasional laugh-out-loud funny moments, their presence and frequency depending on your own inclination to laugh out loud. But there are also a great many moments of deeper examination, where the author examines the nature of belief, worship, and truth itself. This is the boldest move for Pratchett in this book. Pratchett examines several aspects of religion, and it's clear that when he's talking about human nature and religion in his fantasy world, he's really talking about our world. And he doesn't shy away from holding unpleasant aspects of these topics under scrutiny. He manages to be critical without being judgmental, and such a critical eye might make some readers uncomfortable, but I can see just as well how it could help others reaffirm their own faith in what they believe.The parts of the book that focus on the minor characters of Simony and Urn are a little dull, and probably unnecessary. Pratchett almost gets sidetracked with this subplot consisting mostly of commentary on war and the arms race. Since this plot seems to spring out of nowhere fairly late in the story, it serves to distract from the characters that the reader has become attached to. I recommend the reader skim lightly over these parts and return to the main story as soon as possible. If Pratchett felt like making another commentary about war in addition to the one about religion, he probably ought to have made it in a separate book, rather than bundle it into this one.Fortunately, the book's flaws are relatively minor, and easily overlooked. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little wit and humor, and can see the funny side of religious fundamentalism."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett makes a funny and yet serious critic to the instituon of the church. But he goes further, he also makes a critic to the persons who are draged into it, sometimes unwillingly. And he continues by critiking the gods themselves, who at least aparently don't give a damn to us, his worshipers.P.S.:I worship the almighty god OM!!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This book is quite unique among Pratchett's works. It is not really part of any sub-series, although it might help the reader understand the mind of Constable Visit, Mightily Oats, and other future Omnians better in later books.This book obvious parodies organized religion, in particular religion that is so entrenched that its practitioners have forgotten the spirit of their laws. We saw this in Pratchett's 7th book &quot;Pyramids&quot; with the high priest Dios. But this book is much, much better. Vorbis is certainly a match for Dios, maybe even more so' he reminds me a little of a religios &quot;Patrician.&quot; Who would want to cross him? Brutha is a great character, not so much likeable as interesting: so upright and calm yet willing to tell the &quot;god&quot; Om the way he should behave toward people. And they way he and Vorbis meet at the end is great!This book is not perfect - it seems to drag a bit. I could almost feel the despair (of having to wait so long: just like crossing a real desert) as Brutha gets tossed from danger to danger. But that is only a minor problem. The satire of ancient Greece through the Ephebians was good, and the philosophers were as funny as the wizards in Ankh-Morporkh ever were. Even the way Om deals with Vorbis is a play on the real life of a famous Greek playwright.So if you like religion and philosophy twisted in a strange way, this is the book for you. One of the best Discworld books before &quot;Men at Arms.&quot;"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"If you haven't read Terry Pratchett before, prepare yourself for some great laughs, inventive plot, and sharp satire. Pratchett's facility with satire within such an overfed genre (fantasy) is always a breath of fresh air.Small Gods starts in Omnia, a country organized around a fundamentalist religion. Novice Brutha (our hero) is a simple, honest novice at the Temple who discovers that the voice that is speaking to him is coming from a tortoise claiming to be his god - Om. The tortoise explains that he's got some head-cracking to do, and he needs help. Why? Because he's a tortoise! Brutha gets set on a path walking between belief in his God and skepticism, while the evil Quisitor Vorbis tries to foment a holy war between Omnia and neighboring Ephebe. As the plot moves forward Brutha has to decide whether to do what he's been told or what he feels is right, even if the directions come from a tortoise.Initially, I thought that Small Gods was a too obvious with the \\"question religion\\" type message, but I got over that because of some great writing by Pratchett: you shouldn't have to die for the truth - it's dying for lies makes more sense. Most of all, your god doesn't want you to die for it if the God's existence is dependent on you - you should live a long and fruitful life for your god.If you're really put off by snarky references to religious tradition that may be too close for comfort, you may have probelms with Small Gods. But if you have a pretty good sense of humor and you're ready for some challenging satire that will make you think a little and entertain you, then go get some Terry Pratchett, for small Gods' sake."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"&quot;Small Gods&quot; is funny, thought-provoking and very rereadable. It's my favorite of the Terry Pratchett books I've read so far. Fundamentalists won't like it, but anyone who is at all open-minded will enjoy this intelligent, satirical fantasy."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Welcome to heaven (or the Hub as the case may be). In a world where the title for the most intelligent man alive is contested by a man who spends eons processing a single thought and one who can only describe a war as many people hitting Pacha Moj's uncle over the head with a big rock, the outlook is a promising one. When Brutha, the only person who truely believes in a God who happens to be currently a tortoise, is called upon to save this Om the Great One's existence, how could he refuse? He covers up his ears and sings mindlessly that's how. Welcome to the Discworld at its very best."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Althrough this book is as funny as a meat pie floater in your mouth, Small Gods is one of the best Pratchett book EVER! It's insight to life and the way Pratchett presented it made it better reading then even some academic books I've seen. It's a novel that you could actually learn something from and I urge even those who didn't like Pratchett to buy this book and raed it. You won't waste any dough on this one!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods was my first foray into Discworld. Terry Pratchet writes with the charm and humor of Douglas Adams and the wonder of Tolkien. He uses his world to take a look at our own never losing sight of the humor.

Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a &quot;British&quot; or an &quot;American&quot; feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is definately one of the greatest and one of my favorites of the Discworld series.

It is a work of multilayered artistry to be appreciated from the spiritual to the fantastic. It's also fun and unlike most of Pratchett's books you actually care about most of the characters. Reads well out loud as well. Like many readers here, I see it as the author's pinnacle, the book that he will be remembered for. Here's to immortality, Mr. Pratchett!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is the kind of book that makes you give up on tryingto be a writer. It's that good.A particularly stupid and clumsy boy starts hearinga voice inside his head, which claims to be that ofhis god. He explains that he has lost his powers becausenobody believes in him any more; they're too busy goingto the temples and organizing religious cerimonies toreally BELIEVE. So the best he can manage is turn up asa small, one-eyed tortoise that everybody keeps tryingto eat.After convincing the boy that what he says is true, thegod sets out to win his worshippers back. And also tofind some lettuce.This is definitely the best book I've ever read andprobably one of the best books ever written. If you canimagine a book that is at the same time deep, extremelywell constructed and tremendously funny... then youhave a better imagination than I do.

Pratchett's real strength as a writer, much like fellow Brit Douglas Adams, is his ability to compose tales that can be thoroughly enjoyed as humerous escapist fiction or be contemplated and plumbed for their underlying depth. This book excels on both levels.Pratchett assumes his audience is intelligent with a broad knowledge base and thus doesn't feel compelled to explain every joke and reference, which I greatly appreciate. So many authors seem to dumb down their works and rob them of subtlety and nuance, it is refreshing to encounter one who respects his readers.An example of what I'm talkingh about is the philosopher Didactylos. Pratchett never feels compelled to explain the joke in \\"Two fingers\\" name and leaves this wonderful pun buried for those who can see it.Pratchett and I have some very different ideas when it comes to theology. I find the \\"Tinkerbelle theory of gods' existence\\" (if you don't believe in them they disappear)nearly as offensive as monotheism, but that doesn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying this intelligent, wise and utterly hillarious novel."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I absolutley loved this book. The beginning was confusing but the book quickly gained momentum. Never having read any of the Discworld books did not hinder my enjoyment of this book in the least. In fact, it is not necessary to have read the other books in the series to enjoy this one. This book was entertaining, fun, and the ending was just .... Well, I don't want to give it away. Read it and decide for yourself. I loved this book so much I bought it for my two younger sisters. Now, that is a pretty good book!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In my humble opinion, Small Gods is one of the best in the discworld series, right up there with Hogfather and Interesting Times. The great thing about Pratchett's books is that they have so many dimensions. This one is no exception. It made me think and it made me laugh."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett is an awesome writer and &quot;Small Gods&quot; is a fantastic book. Pratchett has singlehandedly created his own genre and has garnered himself a huge following -- and it's easy to see why. &quot;Small Gods&quot; has to be one of the wittiest books ever written, with incredibly sharp one-liners, in-jokes and pratfalls. Great names and clever words hide subtle parodies and satire, which are a bonus as the plot is entertaining enough on its own.I tried to read this book in contracts class when it first came out and kept on getting busted for laughing out loud, no matter how much I tried to hide it. The only other author able to do this for me is PJ O'Rourke. If you read it on public transport, people will look at you and think you're kinda strange, unless they too know who Pratchett is, in which case they will envy you reading and try to catch furtive glimpses of the text over your shoulder.This is one of my favourite books of all time -- read it and love it too. If I could award it 6 stars, I would."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Every tome of the prodigious Discworlf series is filled end-to-end with Pratchett's sideslitting humour. Most of the books also feature satirical pokes and jabs at various aspects of our modern society, but what makes &quot;Small Gods&quot; his best work is the cohesive nature of its criticism. The satire of &quot;Small Gods&quot; very thoughtfully critizes the religious establishment, and in a holistic way that Pratchett has yet to recreate. Far and away the best discworld book, and one that stands on its own two feet, having no more than superficial reference to other books in the series."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods isn't War and Peace, but it is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. To call it a classic is an understatement. It is one of the few books that could be called an owner's manual to life."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"A really fun book, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. None of our old pals [Rincewind, Gaspode, Vimes, Susan] put in an appearence [other than the guy WHO TALKS LIKE THIS and an old monk with a broom, and they but briefly], but it does add some info to the overall Discworld mythology, and provides some laughs as well."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've read all the Discworld books. This is something I take great pride in. I have almost all of them on my bookshelf. The ones I don't have, I'll be getting soon.Much as I like, enjoy and frequently read the other books in the series, this is the one that remains with me the most.I am an atheist. I don't \\"grok\\" religion, as the kids today say (or possibly not). I think it's fine for other people, more or less, but like drugs, alcohol and voting Republican, it's not something I choose to have any involvement in.That said, I do recognize that religion, for whatever reason, plays a great role in the lives of others, so it is, therefore, something worth learning about and understanding.This book is what you get when Terry Pratchett explores religion directly. He touches upon it in other books (notablyThud!,The Fifth ElephantandFeet of Clay), but he tackles it head-on in this book.\\"Small Gods\\" is in many ways a very different Discworld novel. It doesn't take palce within the main time-period the other books occupy. It doesn't take place in Ankh-Morpork or Lancre. None of the previously established characters, aside from Death, appear in the book (though Dibbler sort-of does, and the book establishes the History Monks and Lu-Tze). Really this book, more than any of the others, stands on its own.The plot of the book is basic. Boy finds god. God turns out to be a tortise. Hilarity ensues. But the book also explores in great detail the inner-workings of faith and religion (two very different things), the consequences of what happens when zealots out for their own agrandizement rather than that of god take over a faith (Pat Robertson, I'm looking at you! Benedict 16, too! Where's the Biblical basis for a Pope, I ask?), and importantly explores what happens when the structres of religion and the church become more important than the god(s).This is an excellent book. Highly recommended for people who enjoy Discworld, those who have never read it (great starter book), and those who like philosophy. It's a perfect book for the faithless and the faithful, for atheist and Anglican (and Eastern Orthodox, Hindu, Zoroastrian and Mormon. I know there's more than Anglican, but, well, the \\"a-to-a\\" thing scanned well. Besides, I don't think this is a good book for Scientologists. I doubt L Ron Hubbard would've appreciated a better author horning in).Don't go any further along the road of life until you've read this book."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In which the hidden power of little old men with brooms is revealed, the true nature of gods is illuminated for the properly grounded, and the dangers of natural science illustrated.Small Gods is the opening of the truly great period of the Discworld. Brutha, a friendly, but not too bright novice is chosen to hear the word of the Great God Om. Om, however, is not on form, and Brutha is not the chosen one Om would have chosen. Eventually, this takes Brutha's country to the brink of war.A fellow smarter than me once observed that true evil always has two traits; the inability to ackowledge their mistakes, and a lack of a sense of humor. When someone will not acknowledge their own mistakes, and cannot laugh, especially at themselves, there is no hope for them. Terry Pratchett holds up a mirror to real world orthodox religions and religious leaders, and these traits come shining through in the reflection.In short, I loved the book. A nonstop stream of pithy observations on human nature and all aspects of religion, combined with brilliant subtle jokes and puns.Oh yes, and of course, appearances by Death."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"-- sooner or later.Pratchett has done the unthinkable - kept a series (and a humor series at that) alive and fresh well into its second dozen. This book started that second dozen.It's about Brutha, a minor novitiate even among novitiates who are all minor. He's doing what he does best, hoeing the beans, when his god arises before him in physical manifestation:A turtle. Slow. Partial to lettuce. Not fond of being turned over or dropped. Not much for conversation when it gets cold out. And, as near as Om can tell, the god of Brutha only. No one else seems to be paying much attention when the god calls down plagues, or at least some really nasty rashes.In Prathcett's hands, this small start yields a very worthy bit of amusement. No, there's really no point to what Pratchett writes (well, that's what he wants you to think). Brutha crosses his world, overturns empires as easily as he overturns weeds in the bean-patch, and dies happy. Everyone dies, and Brutha has seen lots of the other ways - this really is a happy ending.For all of its shallow jests, this book has rewards for the serious reader. Brutha wins in the end by be slow, thick, and mind-bogglingly even-handed. Om finally comes out of his shell and really makes his entry, even among the more exclusive clubs of the gods. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, no matter what you thought they deserved. By the way: observe Om, the lowly turtle, and the place of the turtle in Discworld cosmology.Pratchett fans: watch Vorbis. Yes, the character dies, but that doesn't mean much in Discworld. He may reincarnate as Vetinari, or maybe as Vetinari's evil identical twin. Death is there, all caps, but really quite a congenial chap - says \\"Thank you\\" when you pass him the bottle, sort of thing. The librarian is there, working hard in librarian heroics. Lu Tze is there, makin sure that history turns out the way it's supposed to, not that he has a lot to work with.Every series has its ups and downs. This is a serious up for Discworld. Enjoy!//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Disclosure: I'm a big Pratchett fan.That being said... 'Small Gods' is a wonderful book whether you're a Discworld regular or someone who hasn't read any other part of the series.Pratchett, as always, uses humor to make a bigger point - and in this book he really hits a home run. This book had me laughing out loud and thinking critically.Great fun, great read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods was perhaps the best book Terry Pratchett has ever written. It was a bit more serious than most of his other books, which was partly why I liked it. The book was refreshing to read, simply because I had never read anything with so much to say that managed to say is so clearly, while still maintaining a light-hearted attitude.One thing I enjoyed about Small Gods was that it kept my attention the whole way through. The plot was fantastic with many interesting little twists and turns that made me want to keep reading. It was basically about a god who gets reincarnated as a turtle. He figures out that his believers beleive in his church because they are afraid of it, but nothim. It was very well-written and told the story flawlessly. Quite aside from that, it had me falling out of my chair from laughing on several occasions. Needless to say, I enjoyed it.The book also had great characters. It was easy to relate to them because they acted like regular people, but without becoming stereotype nonentities who just lead their boring lives. There were all different types of personalities with all their different opinions and emotions, but the narration stayed neutral the whole time. One thing that's important in any story is a good villain and this one had it. His name is Vorbis and he's the head of what I assume is the Discworld parallel of the Inquisition. I hated him throughout the whole book. He was a cynic and a sadist, but Pratchett does us the enormous service of never dehumanizing him the whole time. He had motives for what he did, even though they were twisted, and at the end we pity him more than hate him.It wasn't just fluff. It's very easy to classify all books with humor in them as fluff, but you can't do that with this one. It had an idea behind it throughout the whole book and even somewhat of a moral. This was that people should never ever be treated as things. Pratchett applies this to every character and not just the villain. One thing that I appreciated was the fact that Pratchett maintained a clear head throughout the whole thing. He tried to be inoffensive, but not too hard. There is a fine line between inoffensive and politically correct, and Pratchett didn't cross it. Overall, I thought it was because it made me think.In conclusion, I give Small Gods two thumbs up and five stars because it deserved it. I felt better for reading it and highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Brutha is an unlikely choice when a Great God is choosing a prophet... but a battered tortoise is an unlikely form for a god to be stuck in. Brutha, a novice at the temple of the Great God Om, goes on a journey (both metaphorical and literal). He is chosen by Vorbis (who is not EXACTLY evil), for his most unusual talent, to travel to the 'evil' city of Ephebes inhabited by 'polytheistic heathens'. He meets, among other characters, strange men who devote their lives to not being sure about anything: philosphers. Brutha serves his god in various ways (finding tasty lettuce leaves in particular). He must learn to think like a god and rekindle the belief in Om before it is too late and Om winds up... where the Small Gods go.A hilarious book and excellent parody. Terry Pratchett has done it again. Where gods get their power from? And what happens to a god when he loses his power and can no longer smite anyone? Read this book to find out. Also read this book if you want insight into the nature of religious belief along with hours of laughs (provided you don't take it TOO seriously)."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"There are billions of gods in the world; they swarm as thick as flies.

Some people say that this is darker than most of Terry Pratchett's other books, but stop and consider why this is so... because it's about humans and their religions? Isn't that interesting?On the one hand, extremely and disturbingly profound. And on the other hand, also extremely, and hilariously funny. What more can one ask for? Oh, memorable characters (one almost hates to use the word, some of the people are so REAL), a lot of extremely good quotes and one-liners (Terry just has a great way phrasing things), and a story-line that you will want to read over and over again (so buy the book already! You'll be getting a bargain, considering the usage and mileage you will get out of this book).&quot;Time is a drug. Too much of it kills you.&quot;&quot;And it all meant this: that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kind family man who just comes to work every day and has a job to do.&quot;&quot;... what was worse was listening to his voice, which was certainly powerful and full of intent conviction, swinging backward and forward across the tune without ever quite hitting it.&quot;&quot;Cuius testiculos habes, habeas cardia et cerebellum.&quot;Enough said?

This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"As an adoring Pratchett fan, I'd like to say that this book is one of the best books in the Discworld series.

In his best work, pratchett's humour is second only to his wisdom, and this is so far the best of his work that i have read. i've probably read this book ten times now and i still find things that i'd missed before. this book is funny no doubt, but there is some real hard thought buried between the laughs, and the symbolism is just brilliant.probably my favorite part of the book is the 'sacrifice' scene, at the end-this book takes heroism to whole new heights. and you've got to admire a tale where God learns to be a better person. further, the opening parable of the eagle and the tortoise is, well just read the book already, it could very well help you find god."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"It must be one of his best and I believe this is due to the fact that it was not completley a farce. During the middle of the book his tone became more serious and touched on some real issues. But after all this hilarious book was Pratchett at his best. And like all of his books Small Gods was above the average set by the rest of his work. (no I'm not an idiot and that was a meager attempt at a joke.)"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Pratchett writes to a formula, and whatever else can be said about it, it's obviously a very successful one. He takes a basic unifying theme for a book, throws in a liberal mixture of other ideas and literary devices, stuffs them all into the sausage-machine, round goes the handle and out comes the usual product. He does it very skilfully. There is plenty of variety in the situations, he knows how to catch the reader's attention at the start, he can introduce new characters into the narrative at any point in a very natural way, and he is particularly adept at finding a clever and convincing ending. He writes largely for a public who know his previous work and who know what to expect, and he obviously knows how to keep them pleased and how not to upset them with surprises of an unfamiliar kind. There's nothing wrong with any of this. Much the same could be said about Agatha Christie, or about Chandler or about Wodehouse. What surprises me in some of the press comment that I've seen is what Pratchett's formula seems to amount to in the minds of some readers. The New York Times, for instance, credits him with \`a multifarious genius for strong parody', which I can go along with. On the other had it also finds that his \`wit is metaphysical'; and The Times of London itself manages to compare him to Swift and detect that he can \`hold up a distorting mirror to our own [world]'. This kind of thing seems to me to go miles over the top.When Swift attacked religious and secular orthodoxies he was playing for much higher stakes and taking far bigger risks. When Swift said (I quote from memory) \`There are those who would die for no-Popery and know not if it be Man or Horse' the wit is as caustic as sulphuric acid. Can anyone seriously put Pratchett in the same bracket? Pratchett can turn out some nice lines certainly, like the soldier's statement that \`For centuries we died for lies. Now we've got a truth to die for.' All the same, unquestioning religious belief is easy meat these days for the sceptics and satirists, to say nothing of the steady bombardment from the heavyweight philosophers. Pratchett's trick is to keep the tone light and to take so many incidental swipes at so many incidental targets that the reader never feels \`got at'. To have a philosopher called Aristocrates who wrote a volume of \`Platitudes' is nice lightweight satire, and very typical of the general style. To say \`People allowed to be by themselves overmuch might indulge in solitary cogitation. It was well known that this stunted your growth. For one thing it could lead to your feet being chopped off.' is good average nudge-nudge humour. \`Where there is punishment there is always a crime' is definitely a bon mot but not exceptional, and \`It was a beard you could camp out in' suggests imitation of Chandler to me. There are any number of whimsical digressions, and some very run-of-the-mill naughty little verbal innuendoes like \`I will write you more balls than you can imagine...'. It's all a matter of what we're prepared to laugh at, and as far as I'm concerned We Are Just About Amused but not much more.Pratchett's great strength seems to be that he can keep it all going in book after book after book. I have now read three of them, and I sense that as far as I'm concerned that's It. If three is sufficient of a selection, then I would guess that in the others he can keep his standard relatively high without cheapening himself, and that recurrent characters like Death who always talks in CAPITALS and who says \`SQUEAK' to rats will be welcomed by his faithful each time. In general faith is not my own strong point, and I haven't succumbed to the Pratchett faith either. Those who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like. They are clearly numerous, and they are not likely to be disappointed by Small Gods. I like it up to a point myself.What does this reaction prove? I suppose it only proves that the formula doesn't greatly work for everyone, and we would all have known that in the first place."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I love this book! It plays, quite successfully, with Douglas Adams's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? If you like this book you will also enjoy \\"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\\" by Douglas Adams and \\"American Gods\\" by Pratchett's friend Neil Gaimen (though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of America). \\"Good Omens\\" by Pratchett and Gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world.

There are several layers. &quot;Small Gods&quot; is like inviting over your friends to paint. There is one uneven coat of paint and they left masking tape on all of the edging in an unsuccessful attempt to miss it with their paintbrushes.

And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S.

And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (\\"Psst!\\") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've just gotten to the part with the Fin of God (I'm not certain why a theocratic nation that calls the sea sinful would have a navy, but...), and I was strangely touched by it.

I revisit Douglas Adams's writings on religion, generally of the potshot variety--funny enough, and true enough--but this book has the leisure to spend all 350 pages gently peeling back the layers and savoring the subject.And it was still funny, it just didn't seem to work as hard at being funny as it did at telling a story.

I'm not much of a fan of Pratchett's other books. But this one I adore. And not just becase I enjoy Turtles."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In Discworld, the power of the Gods is related to the number of people who believe in them and the strength of their belief. The Church of the Great God Om has tremendous power, controlling a Theocracy and building an empire by conquering neighboring states and crushing their native religions. So when Om returns to choose a new Prophet, his appearance as a tortoise doesn't match anyone's expectations. Further, it appears that only a single lowly novice, Brutha, is able to hear the voice of the God. Brutha must figure out how to fulfill his role as Prophet, while, at the same time, not run afoul of the powerful Quisition, which enforces orthodoxy within the Church.This is a powerful satire about the distinctions between religion and faith. Pratchett clearly shows how as a Church grows, it can easily lose its way. The foundational beliefs and faith, become obscured by ritual and rules. This should be a cautionary tale for anyone who focuses on doctrine instead of belief."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In Small Gods, the thirteenth novel of the Discworld, Terry Pratchett gets philosophical, religious, and existential on us, delivering a remarkably insightful look at man and his relationship (or lack thereof) with the gods. There are gods everywhere on the Discworld - you can't swing a simian librarian without hitting one - except, of course, only a few people can see them. Each small god lies in wait, desperately seeking to make someone believe in him; on the Discworld, gods need people more than people need gods, for belief is the food of the gods.The story takes us far away from the environs of Ankh-Morpork to Omnia, a land on the Klatchian coast ruled by the priesthood of the Church of Om. It's an arid, harsh world where the Quisition works tirelessly to beat the sin out of individuals deemed to be suspicious (and almost no one is safe, for the priests regard the very existence of suspicion as proof of guilt). You would think that the Great God Om would bask in the glory and power of all that faith being demanded of the people, but ritual has replaced substance in Omnia; the people may worship Om, but they don't really believe in him anymore. For the past three years, the Great God Om has been stuck in the body of a one-eyed tortoise and has only now been able to find one man with the true flame of faith burning inside him. Unfortunately for Om, that one believer is Brutha, a novitiate in the Church whom, all would agree, is just a little bit slow on the uptake and is just about the last person Om would have chosen to become his new Prophet. Brutha does have a perfect memory, but all that memory crammed into his mind leaves little room left over for actual thought. In a way he fits right in, though, as the Church does all it can to discourage individual thought, because that kind of thing just leads to trouble.Naturally, Brutha has a hard time accepting a tortoise as the Great God Om, and Om doesn't have the power to do anything but curl ineffectual oaths and curses at things that bother him. Om is actually a pretty surly little god, but spending three years as a tortoise, having to worry about falcons swooping down on you and then dropping you from a great height, tends to bring out the worst in gods. Brutha is increasingly disturbed to learn that Om never really gave his followers any instruction whatsoever; all of the holy books he knows by heart suddenly come into question, and that's hard on a true believer.As the novel progresses, Brutha finds himself accompanying Deacon Vorbis, head of the Quisition, to the land of Ephebe where philosophers cover the landscape like locusts, argue violently among themselves, and generally live in barrels. One such philosopher is Didactylos, whose philosophy can basically be boiled down to the words \\"It's a funny old world.\\" He now becomes the unifying part of an underground movement that insists, despite the tenets of the Church, that \\"the Turtle moves,\\" that turtle being, of course, the Great A'Tuin. As so often happens, religious dispute breeds war, and the future of Omnia - not to mention the future of the Great God Om - lies in the palms of Brutha. There is only one thing you can be sure of in such a precarious situation: somewhere nearby, Cut-Me-On-Hand-Off Dhblah will be there selling all sorts of wossnames - onna stick.Pratchett's razor-sharp wit cuts especially deep into religion, society, and the body politic in this novel. To some degree, organized religion is being satirized in these pages, but it's a healthy and honest sort of criticism; more than anything else, Small Gods is an ingeniously subtle philosophical examination of the meaning of life in an uncertain world. Pratchett offers one explanation as to how and why gods die, and there is more than enough weighty material in these pages to give us pause in between fits of laughter."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've read nearly all of the Disc World series and have thoroughly enjoyed most of the ones I've read. SMALL GODS holds a special place in my heart. The characters are engaging. Om as a little turtle won me over completely. Brutha, the naive is one I could relate to. What a villian Vorbis! Pratchett is at his best with his usual terrific humor, but in addion -- and upon rereading I keep discovering this -- there is much much more to this story. It invites us to think and to question. If you only want to read one Terry Pratchett story I recommend SMALL GODS."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Even though Small Gods doesn't fit particularly well into the chronology of the Discworld books, nor are any of its main characters used in any of the other books, I feel it is the finest in the series. I began reading this series in the early 80's, when Colour of Magic was available as a Science Fiction book club purchase. Since then, I have eagerly awaited each new book in the series, and have loved them all. Small Gods biggest strength is that it makes you look inside yourself. I understand that personal philosphy and religion are often difficult issues to talk about, and Small Gods is probably uncomfortable to some people as it makes them question their own philosphies and/or religion. I find that is what makes the book the most important in the series to read as &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;. Throughout the book there are many issues raised that make you consider your own feelings, and I think that is what makes this the most valuable of the series to read. Without this book all the other Discworld books are still excellent, but this is the only one that makes you question what life is really all about. And that makes it more valuable than the rest in the series, as they are mostly just entertainment (although an absolutely excellent entertainment value, including the 2 DVDs that were released of Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music)."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods was perhaps the best book Terry Pratchett has ever written. It was a bit more serious than most of his other books, which was partly why I liked it. The book was refreshing to read, simply because I had never read anything with so much to say that managed to say is so clearly, while still maintaining a light-hearted attitude.One thing I enjoyed about Small Gods was that it kept my attention the whole way through. The plot was fantastic with many interesting little twists and turns that made me want to keep reading. It was basically about a god who gets reincarnated as a turtle. He figures out that his believers beleive in his church because they are afraid of it, but nothim. It was very well-written and told the story flawlessly. Quite aside from that, it had me falling out of my chair from laughing on several occasions. Needless to say, I enjoyed it.The book also had great characters. It was easy to relate to them because they acted like regular people, but without becoming stereotype nonentities who just lead their boring lives. There were all different types of personalities with all their different opinions and emotions, but the narration stayed neutral the whole time. One thing that's important in any story is a good villain and this one had it. His name is Vorbis and he's the head of what I assume is the Discworld parallel of the Inquisition. I hated him throughout the whole book. He was a cynic and a sadist, but Pratchett does us the enormous service of never dehumanizing him the whole time. He had motives for what he did, even though they were twisted, and at the end we pity him more than hate him.It wasn't just fluff. It's very easy to classify all books with humor in them as fluff, but you can't do that with this one. It had an idea behind it throughout the whole book and even somewhat of a moral. This was that people should never ever be treated as things. Pratchett applies this to every character and not just the villain. One thing that I appreciated was the fact that Pratchett maintained a clear head throughout the whole thing. He tried to be inoffensive, but not too hard. There is a fine line between inoffensive and politically correct, and Pratchett didn't cross it. Overall, I thought it was because it made me think.In conclusion, I give Small Gods two thumbs up and five stars because it deserved it. I felt better for reading it and highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Small Gods is yet another great book by Terry Pratchett.Once again we are taken to meet a new set of character onDiskworld, a world that hurtles through space on the back ofa giant turtle. Small Gods pokes fun at the buracracy ofthe religion, and points out what this religious stuff is allabout. The characters are well done, and memorable. Thelaughs keep going. A great read all in all."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"People look at me funny when I compare Pratchett to Jonothan Swift or Kurt Vonnegut, but I hold my ground and I point to this book as his satirical masterwork. While Moving Pictures was his first attemt on dedicating a book to satirizing something about our society, Small Gods is his best and led to such stand out satires like Interesting Times, Jingo, Men at Arms, and Hogfather. This book more than the others, I feel, tries to say something serious about its subject matter, that being religion, faith and God. Reading this book influenced the way I look at religion today. Many of my peers (I'm 19) who wish to be rebellious like to make fun of people who believe in god, criticize the Bible because it contradicts itself, and point to violence caused because of religious differences as the reason why faith and belief in religion is a bad thing. What Pratchett says in this book is that faith is what you make of it, orthodox thinking is a stranglehold on belief, and that evil men use religion for evil purposes, not the other way around. It is a very lighthearted book with serious undertones, and I can hardly see how anyone could be offended by it, unless they have a stick up their rears about their particular religion and how it is the one true faith."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"\\"Small Gods\\" is a book set in the Discworld universe. It is a stand-alone book and not part of any other series (i.e. the City Watch, Death, Wyrd Sisters). It's also a very good book, though it's nowhere near my favourite. The back cover calls it a great comedy, but I didn't find it all that funny. It was good, makes very insightful comments on religion and how it is set up. There are some great moments in the book as well. Most of these consist of indirect comments on our world that just pop up and hit you in the face with their accuracy. But again, it's not that funny.It is set in the land of Omnia, a heavily religious land, or at least it seems to the outside. They are very intolerant of other religions, going so far as to torture heretics for their beliefs. In reality, though, there is no real belief there. It has become a power structure instead of a true religion. Om, the god that they worship, has come to visit. Unfortunately, while he intended to come down as something noble (like a swan), he appeared as a tortoise. To make things worse, he traveled the Disc for three years without realizing he was Om. This happened because nobody truly believes in him any more, and gods derive their power from belief.There is one person who does believe in him very deeply, though, and that's Brutha. Because of this, Om has to use him to try and get his followers back. Brutha is a very simple man; he can't read and write, and he enjoys puttering around in the temple garden. He's a very unlikely choice for a chosen one. Unfortunately, he's the only choice Om has. One thing Brutha does have is a fantastic memory. He can remember everything he sees, even if he doesn't know what it means. This ability very often comes in handy, whether it has to do with the library or getting out of a maze. Om finds that a simple man isn't always the most easily controlled, though.The story is a very interesting comment on religious practices. It covers everything from organized religion to the creationism/evolution debate. The people of Omnia don't believe that the world is flat, on the backs of four elephants that are standing on a Great Turtle. No religion is singled out for ridicule, though, as most of the comments are made about religious structure in general. The belief that a god's power is based on how many people believe in him is very interesting. Neil Gaiman uses the same idea in his American Gods book.The characters are all well done. Brutha is an unlikely prophet, but as events happen to him and he grows into the role (no matter how reluctantly), you believe the transition. Vorbis, the exquisitor (as opposed to the inquisitor), is suitably sadistic. He's the one main character that you could say is slightly two dimensional because you don't know why he is what he is. He's not as devout as he seems, and he does enjoy his work, but that's pretty much all we know.Om is a great character, though. He's suitably sarcastic. He uses Brutha for his own ends. He tries to keep Brutha in the dark about how the belief system works, and why he has appeared to Brutha. He's arrogant (shown especially when he visits the other gods). He also has many of the best lines.The main problem with this book, though, is that the comedy just doesn't seem to be there. Sure, after reading the annotations, some of the bits seem funnier. Maybe I just wasn't getting the jokes as much. Some of the exchanges between Brutha and Om are priceless. The philosophers of Ephebe make their return from Pyramids, and they are hilarious. I always enjoy them. But there's not enough of it. Perhaps this one just went over my head. One of the things that is really missing is the funny footnotes. In the previous books I've read, there are footnotes on almost every third or fourth page. They were great! However, this one only has a few of them. I would call this book more \\"amusing\\" then \\"funny.\\"Still, the book is well worth reading, and I would suggest you pick it up for the philosophical insights and the writing. There are some funny moments as well, just not as many. And if you already like Pratchett, this is certainly a good one to continue with."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"The Great God Om is in the midst of a crisis. Intending to appear as a grand and spectacular animal, he instead finds himself in the form of a tortoise. The only one he can find to listen to him is the simple novice monk Brutha. The man is considered a bit dim and useless by most, but he has a memory like a steel trap, as well as something even more spectacular--a true faithful belief in the Great God Om.At first Om is disdainful of his follower. Soon, though, he becomes terrified. He knows the fate of gods who lose all of their true believers, and it appears Brutha is the only man he can count on to help him. As Brutha explains all of the religious rules that have been declared in Om's name, the god becomes more and more distressed.When the man who sentences people to torture and death in Brutha's community appears to be gathering power and preparing to make a move, it becomes clear that something must be done.What is less clear is what a minor unrespected monk and a tortoise will be able to do.This book was very amusing. I liked the characterization of the gods, the way their power changed, and their lack of knowledge about the things happening in their names. Brutha was a charming character, a perfect hero for a story about a world a bit out of control."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Possibly the finest book of theology I have ever read.

They're really good and really funny-what more could one want? This one had some really good bits, including jabs at religion, philosophy, war-mongerers, etc. At the beginning, there's a lovely passage about history.As far as I'm aware the only recurring character to appear is Death. I'm not sure that Brutha or any of the other characters are in any other Discworld novels. In fact, I'm pretty positive that they aren't which could make this a good first choice to be introduced to Discworld; you don't have to know any backstories although you do have to be prepared for Pratchett's writing style.Overall: As I said, this could be a good introduction to the series as it's not a series that has to be read in order although that could be interesting too.Cover: The tortoise is very important to the story."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"The first twelve Discworld books were adolescent affairs, obsessed with corny jokes, screwball plots, and bumbling but lovable characters. Enjoyable treats all, but in retrospect less substantial than they could have been. &quot;Small Gods&quot;, to me, is Terry Pratchett's first 'adult' book. The corny jokes, screwball plots, and bumbling but lovable characters are still here, but only to service a narrative soaked in significant themes and obsessed with our place in the multiverse.For the most part it stands on its own as a complete story. Except for a few notable exceptions (i.e., an appearance by the cousin of Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, a quick cameo by my all-time favourite Disc denizen The Librarian, and a couple of pregnant references to Ankh Morpork), you don't have to be Discworld savvy to follow the story. It's set in the previously unheard of locale of Omnia, where the Quisition, led by Deacon Vorbis (as evil a character as anything Pratchett has put on paper), tortures into its heretical citizenry a belief in the Great God Om. But the central question in the book, the one that drives the plot forward, is this: what happens when belief dissipates, and is replaced by simple routine? Following the rituals of a religion is not really the same as believing in the power and glory of a God.And on the Discworld it's not like your wanting for Gods to choose from. There are billions of them, and they're all likely to strike you down where you stand if you insult them in any way. Great God Om used to be the greatest of all Gods, but he's fallen on tough times. The brand of belief favoured by Vorbis is not the kind of belief Om needs. He's losing true believers in the process, and has become quite ineffectual. So much so that he woke up one day to find himself in the body of a small turtle, dropped by an eagle attempting to break his shell (because, as we're constantly reminded, &quot;There's very good eating on one of these, you know&quot;). The only thing keeping Om from disappearing altogether is Brutha, an illiterate novice, who barely knows anything of the world outside the confines of his garden.Brutha and Om follow a Pratchett tradition of teaming a wide-eyed innocent with a cynical curmudgeon, and watching as the two personalities eventually meet in the middle (&quot;Om, bumping along in Brutha's pack, began to feel the acute depression that steals over every realist in the presence of an optimist&quot;). Brutha is a true believer in the face of pure evil, and it's this innocence/ignorance that allows him to survive. Om is a perpetually pissed-off little dude, angry at his new lot in life, and unsure how to get his powers back. All he knows is that Brutha is his only hope, for Brutha is the only one that can truly hear him. Their joint quest is a joy to follow.Along the way, we meet an eclectic cast of characters, all looking to revolt against the tyranny of Omnia, or to sit back and wait for the cards to fall where they may. The most fun is a brief excursion to Ephebe, the Disc's Greek doppelganger. Its philosophers are known to run through the streets dripping wet, dressed only in a towel and carrying a loofah sponge, after an Archimedes-esque &quot;Eureka&quot; moment, and it's tyrannical ruler (rightly called The Tyrant) is guarded by an impenetrable and lethal labyrinth. Terry has much fun poking holes in this world of ideas, just as he's had poking holes in the world of beliefs. Which is probably the greatest thing about this book. No matter what side of the line you fall on, be it atheist, zealot, intellectual, or priest, you'll find someone/something to laugh at, and many reasons to pause for thought.You'd think a book like this, thick with ideas, would be short on plot and humour. Well, this still is a Discworld book, so it has plenty of both. The plot moves along like a steam engine (or a steam-powered turtle), plunging Brutha and Om through danger and chaos until the fantastic denouement, which drops from the sky like some divine providence. It's a thrilling ride and a satisfying ending. As for the humour, Terry's remarkable wit remains intact even after thirteen entries in the series. My favourite moments here involve faux-Latin translations, that clean up the original version with PC precision (&quot;Cuius testiculos habes, habeas cardia et cerebellum&quot; doesn't necessarily translate to &quot;When you have their full attention in your grip, their hearts and minds will follow&quot;, but the joke comes when you realize what that second Latin word must really mean).&quot;Small Gods&quot; is most assuredly a parody of other sci-fi/fantasy books, just as the rest of the Discworld books have been. But it is so much more than that. It really does stand on its own as a perfect satire of religion, and what it means to be religious (or more simply put, to believe). I fancied myself a fan of Terry's previous books, but have to admit that this is leaps and bounds ahead of those previous works. And thank Om for that!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Rough translation: I announce to you with great joy, we have a turtle God. That should have been the announcement that greeted the arrival of the God of the City of Om upon his return to Om. Unfortunately he was greeted by stunned disbelief by his sole remaining true believer. Since the size and power of any God/god on Discworld is directly proportional to the level of belief in each God's by its adherents this god is but a turtle. Out of such co-dependent relationships are small gods and Terry Pratchett's Small Gods made.Co-dependent seems an apt term in this context. In Small Gods, Pratchett looks at organized religion through the prism of the co-dependant relationship. This theme is set against a backdrop which, if filmed, would have been produced by David Lean and looked remarkably like Lawrence of Arabia. (The Omnian attack on Ephebia and Brutha's trek with Vorbis across the desert between their cities both left me with images of Lawrence's attack on Aqaba and his disastrous trek across the desert with his youthful assistants.) Specifically, Pratchett examines the co-dependency of man and his God(s). Each is entirely co-dependent on the other. The plot, including the hilarious deus ex machina climax, has been well summarized in the product description and in other reviews so I'll confine myself to a few random observations.No matter how deeply philosophical the underlying theme, the potential reader should know that Pratchett is an excellent writer and capable of some of the funniest lines and paragraphs you are likely to encounter in fiction. Pratchett introduces the Ephebians' leading philosopher Dydactylos thusly: His philosophy was a mixture of three famous schools -- the Cynics, the Stoics and the Epicureans -- and summed up all three of them in his famous phrase, \\"You can't trust any bugger further than you can throw him, and there's nothing you can do about it, so let's have a drink.\\" It is no small compliment to state that the passage reminded me of Month Python's Philosopher's Song.Pratchett's sharp tongue and wonderful sense of humor does not detract from his ability to get a point across. For example, the villain of the piece, Vorbis is engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the leader of the Ephebians, known simply as \\"the Tyrant\\". \\"Slave is an Ephebian word. In Om we have no word for slave,\\" said Vorbis. \\"So I understand,\\" said the Tyrant. \\"I imagine that fish have no word for water.\\" In context, this exchange is simply brilliant. Small Gods is full of these little pearls.Pearls, actually, form the basis of my final thoughts on Small Gods. I think it clear that Pratchett does not look kindly upon the excesses and brutalities committed in the name of God(s). However, those who do maintain such a belief system should not construe that as an attack on faith itself. I think one can liken the philosophies expressed by Moses, Jesus, or Buddha for example as a grain of sand. The grain of sand can be perfectly beautiful but because it serves as something of a societal irritant when first expressed it becomes covered with layer upon layer of outer covering until it evolves into a pearl. Now that pearl can be beautiful but it can also completely obscure the pure beauty of that grain of sand. So too with the trappings and dogma of oragnized relgion. When doctrine and dogma take pride of place the beauty of the idea is lost and can turn horrid. Vorbis' role as leader of the Omnian inquisition is no accident. The comparison between Vorbis and Brutha is beautiful for its symetry. Vorbis is all form and structure but totally devoid of content, of soul. Brutha is close to being the opposite. As we look at the trappings of our own faith (those of us that choose to have one) it might not be a bad idea to examine whether or not the trappings of that doctrine obscure the initial meaning and purity of the ideas around which those trappings were created.That any author, particularly one so consistenly funny, can evoke such a thought process, is, perhaps, a minor miracle."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Quite simply, Terry Pratchett is the funniest man alive. However, his early books are somewhat coarse, and the later books may confused a newcomer.Small Gods is an excellent starting point for anyone. The book has new characters, a new plot, and nothing is expected of the reader. Its a wonderful book that will explain everything for someone who's never ventured into the Discworld before. Its also one of the funniest texts around.Small Gods is also a great books in its seriousness. The book takes a witty look at the perils of making religion too organized - in worshipping the Church rather than the God. It is a book you can read, then mull over for hours - if you didn't break up laughing every two minutes."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"So maybe I'm biased. I've read all Pratchett's book at least twice. I've got both of the map books, and I even met Pratchett for Gods sakes. But SMALL GODS is, and always will be, my favourite. It doesn't have as much of the in-your-face humour of some of the others in the series, or the sly digs to popular culture (Wyrd Sisters, Moving Pictures) but Small Gods is first and foremost, a satire. Personally, I believe this is where Pratchett hit his creative peak, when he had the perfect balance of characters, wit and imagination. Not to mention a real sense of danger - how many &quot;humorists&quot; can pull that off?Don't think about it. Small Gods has something to say about belief, friendship, zealotry - the whole nine yards... Kevin Smith's new film DOGMA is trying to cover similar ground, but I doubt it'll be anywhere as insightful or entertaining as this.Just get it... buy it now, on the cheap, and I'm Cutting Me Own Throat..."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"A few weeks ago I finished my first Discworld novel, 'Mort', which was a very light and funny book. Therefore, I assumed all Discworld novels would be like this.. I guess I was wrong. Small Gods is funny (at least in the beginning) - but far, far from being a light book, which is not necessarily a bad thing.Small Gods tells about Brutha, a not so smart lad who one day hears the voice of his great god Om calling him. But contrary to what he expected, the great god Om wasn't really such a great god - in fact, he was quite small.. like a turtle. And he didn't have any powers at all. And apparently, not many believers either. The book tells about the god Om and Brutha's adventures, trying to survive in Omnia (which is a very religious in a fanatic way...) - and maybe even restore the god to his full power.The book really started light, but turned into a very heavy and philosophical novel about the nature of religions and gods - and of people and belief. Really, I think it would've fit quite well into a philosophy class. Typically to Terry Pratchett, the book is very very witty - I don't think the man knows how to write in an 'Unwitty' way. I don't think I laughed at all during the second half of the book, but I still couldn't stop reading it - and definitely enjoyed the read. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Discworld, and enjoys reading books which make you think afterwards. However, don't get it if you want a book which will just make you laugh."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This was the first Pratchett book I read, and I'm glad of it. While it has the humor and satire that is inherent in all of the Discworld books, it also has something else - something to say. It was evident, even from the first time I read this book, that Pratchett had put some real heavy thinking into it.This book is, as the title suggests, about gods. Where do they come from? Where do they go? What keeps them moving? Ordinarily, gods don't like this sort of question. People who think are not what gods look for in followers. Gods want people who believe. That's where their power comes from. Gods with many believers are stong, great gods. Armies of priests and worshipers attend to their every needs, the sacrifices are plentiful and their dominion is vast. A great God wants for nothing.A god with no believers, however, is a small god, a mindless thought blistering through the firmament, searching with single-minded fervor for one thing: a believer.What happens, then, when a Great God finds out that, while he wasn't looking, he lost all of his believers? That's the thrust of this tale, the story of the Great God Om and how he became a tortoise for three years. It's about the difference between what is real and what is believed in, and how much difference that can make at times. It's about fundamental and trivial truths, and how to tell them apart. It's about eagles and tortoises and how much they need each other.Above all, it's something of, in my opinion, a statement of faith. Many people ask me if I am religious, and I tell them no. That's partly due to this book and the thinking that it made me do. Spiritual? Sure. Religious? No.This is, as I said, the story of the Great God Om, who discovered, about 300 feet above the ground, that he had been a tortoise for the last three years. Before this mid-air revelation he had been just chewing at melons and wondering where the next lettuce patch was. Suddenly, all the self-awareness of a Great God was put into his head, as well as the knowledge that he was probably about to die. Om had intended to manifest as a bull or a pillar of fire - something much more majestic and Godly - but for some reason, that hadn't worked. He had become a tortoise.Now, in the presence of Brutha, a novice in the Church of the Great God Om, the god remembers who he was, and discovers that he's in a lot of trouble.The Church of the Great God Om. There's something to talk about. Many people believe, upon reading it, that it's an allegory for the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. The Omnian Church permits no heresy. It permits no sin, no disbelief. Violating the precepts of Om and His Prophets can lead to death, in a lingering and painful manner. The Quisition cannot be wrong, for was it not Om Himself who put suspicion into their minds? It's a tactic that has been used by many religions over the years, often to justify acts that they know their god would not approve of.I don't believe that Pratchett was trying to take a stab at the Catholics in this book. It's just an unfortunate coincidence that the Omnians and the Catholics bear a few points of similarity. A rigid hierarchy, for example. A penchant at one point or another for extracting confessions by any means necessary is another. It's all very efficient and effective.There's a problem, though, as is pointed out by Brutha late in the book: if you beat a donkey with a stick long enough, the stick becomes all that the donkey believes in. At that point, neither gods nor believers benefit. The only people benefiting are those wielding the stick. Instead of becoming a tool for inspiration, the church becomes a tool for terror. People do not obey their god out of love - they obey their church out of fear.This is the kind of church that could produce the Deacon Vorbis, head of the Exquisitors. He is one of those men who would turn the world on its back, just to see what would happen. He is everything that is wrong with the Church and, unfortunately, it seems that he is in line to be the Eighth Prophet.In other words, Omnia is not a nice place to live. Its church is vast, its god is small, and neighboring nations want to take it down a few pegs. It's up to Brutha and his God to change the course of history.As I said, there was a lot of thought put into this novel, as well as Pratchett's usual hidden research. For example, Brutha is called a \\"Great dumb ox\\" by his classmates, due to his size and apparent lack of intellect. The same epithet was thrown at Thomas Aquinas by his classmates, and he was canonized less than a century after his death. Like Aquinas, Brutha is not dumb. He is simply slow and careful in how he thinks, and his measured pace leads him far more surely to the truth than the hot-headed and passionate men who march with him.Some people read this book as an attack on religion. Others see it as a defense of personal faith. I think Terry had a story to tell, and perhaps a point to make. The beauty of books such as these is that they can be whatever you want them to be. For me, it came as a kind of defense of gods. Humans, the book suggests, need gods. Now there is a growing atheist community out there who disagree with that idea, and I can definitely see where they're coming from. As I've said many times, I'm not entirely sold on the god idea yet. But the gods that are rampant in the Discworld aren't the kinds of gods that the atheists and the true believers fight over - the omnipotent creator of Everything. They are gods who are controlled by humans, who exist with humans in a kind of co-dependent relationship. Humans need gods, and gods need humans. In its way, this kind of theology makes gods more... realistic to me. I can't say for sure whether a god or gods exist, but if they did, I think I could live with this kind of arrangement.What this book definitely is, in any case, is good. Very good. If you haven't read it, do so. If you have read it, do yourself a favor and read it again."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In this era of triumphant religious fundamentalism, Small Gods is a pretty dangerous item to be seen carrying. Terry Pratchett, carrying a reputation of being a major force in writing fantasy and humour has shed both in this penetrating book. It's an incisive satire of the mores and methods of the three major religions of Western Civilization. Pratchett's astute axiom that the Discworld is a &quot;mirror of worlds&quot; applies with more force here than any other Discworld book. Pratchett casts away whatever subtle restraint he's given other philosophical issues to directly confront us with a harsh truth about faiths.The basic theme is a simple, but rarely recognized, truth. Gods are created by people. The fewer the believers, the smaller and weaker the god. When belief fades or believers eliminated, the gods cease to exist. Once mighty, the god Om has been relegated to the body of a tortoise. He retains but one true believer: Brutha, a novice in the Citadel of Om. Brutha makes frequent reference to segments of the &quot;holy book&quot; Om supposedly authored. Mystified by attribution to himself of these writings, Om wonders who really wrote them. And why they were written. What has been perpetrated in His Name?Brutha, who has a photographic memory, is conscripted into a religious crusade against neighbouring Ephebe. The Omnian Church wants to erase Ephebe's false belief that the world is a disc riding on the backs of four elephants standing on a turtle swimming through space. According to Vorbis, head of the Quisition, such false doctrine must be erased, erasing the Ephebians in the process, if necessary. Besides, Ephebe's on the best trade route to the Turnwise coast. Tucked away in Brutha's pocket, Om is taken along. But how does Vorbis expect to conquer mighty Ephebe, home of philosopher kings, with a token force of fifty soldiers?Pratchett is as direct as Vorbis is devious. There's an old saying that runs &quot;I'm not a bigot, I hate everybody&quot;. Vorbis doesn't hate anybody, just those following false doctrines. Nor does Pratchett hate anyone, but his scathing wit in this book leaves few untouched . There are some light passages, but this book is deadly serious. It's not small gods, but small minds that Pratchett targets and he hits the mark unerringly [He's nearly prescient about Christian reaction to J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter books]. Pratchett holds the mirror before us to consider our beliefs. What do we have faith in, and what sustains that faith?. If it proves false, how do we respond? What an experience it would be to visit Pratchett when one of the evangelicals arrives at the door! If he's as verbally devastating as he is with the printed word, there'd only be a smudge on the doormat."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Most of America has not yet caught on to the Discworld series, but those of us who have are fiercely devout followers, and this book is a prime example of why. On the surface, it is a hilarious and touching story of a once-mighty god and his last remaining believer, but Pratchett's astounding wisdom and understanding of human nature take it much deeper, through labyrinths literal, metaphorical, and moral. At the center are the questioning of a religion where belief centers on the church, rather than the god, and the way a sole believer can shift his god's way of thinking and take a religion with it.At the same time, Pratchett employs his usual side-splitting humor and vile puns to show us the silly side of serious philosophy, atheism in a world with thousands of gods, and exactly why tortoises hate eagles. And that even an orang-utan Librarian from across the sea can help if books are burning.If I was asked &quot;Which is the best Discworld novel?&quot; I'd say, with the possible exception of Hogfather, this one.Finally, a tortoise has learned how to fly."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"On Terry Pratchett's Discworld, belief is a force. But belief is not the same thing as worship. &quot;Small Gods&quot; is built around these two premises. And it is a pretty wonderful adventure.Brutha is an illiterate novice in the service of the great god Om. He is unlikely to be much more than a gardener, but he does truly believe in Om, and because he does, he can hear Om when the god speaks to him. In fact, Om is on hard times, with an entire nation that worships him but only one believer. And if a god has no believers, it becomes a small god. And Om has become so weak he can only manifest as a turtle.Through the course of their adventures, Brutha an Om wander through the wilderness, confront heretics and madmen, learn to recognize the perils of tyranny and theocracy, and generally tour the highlights of the Old Testament. Brutha visits classical Greece, in the form of Omnia's neighbor, Ephebe, and learns what true evil can be. It sounds like philosophy, and in some measure it is, but under Pratchett's masterful touch the story is so well done that it is only afterwards, when you are through with the tale, that the message hits you. At speed, right between the eyes.Pratchett recast his ideas about belief later, and in quite a different way, in &quot;Hogfather.&quot; But &quot;Small Gods&quot; makes important points, as well as being a glorious romp through the apocrypha.This book is not for anyone whose sense of righteousness gets in the way of their sense of humor. This is a satire of religious excesses and pokes fun at worship when it gets separated from belief. For some, it may cut to close to the bone. But for the rest of it, this is a terrific book."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"&quot;Small Gods&quot; came to land on my window sill after fluttering in the wind for what appeared to be ages; even though I knew it would eventually flutter somewhere nearby, it came as a pleasant, somewhat unexpected surprise.Being my first Terry Pratchett novel, I didn't really know what to expect other than a number of sardonic comments on religion and its place in society. Prior to reading it, I thought it would take on the tone of a polemic: unrelenting and pretentious at heart; so I didn't necessarily rush out greet it. The great thing that I discovered afterwards, however, is that Terry Pratchett novels are so lighthearted in tone that they will make even the biggest cynic crack a smile.The inherent message of the story is simple: as ridiculous as everything associated with a particular god may be, there is certainly no doubt in the fact that we cannot live without them. The book makes a conscious effort to let us feel how faith draws out the best, and sometimes the worst, in us, and through the story's protagonist, Brutha, professes that the best way to believe is by what you know lies deep inside you.If you're wary of being offended, don't fret. Pratchett treats the matter with the respect it deserves, as long as you're not too big on organized religion. Give it a try; it just might inspire you to think a little intrinsically as opposed to simply going along with the waves."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.

The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.

His comparative parody of philosophy was also amusing. Pratchett also offers up one of his more memorable villains.Sadly, something just didn't connect, and I suspect it was the loose ends. Admittedly, I am reading the series out of order (based on what's in at the library) so perhaps these unanswered questions I had -- such as how Om fell to his current state in the first place -- are answered in previous (or subsequent) books. Still, I felt a bit cheated by not knowing certain things by the time I reached the end. Om's \\"redemption,\\" if it can even be called that, also struck me as hollow and a tad forced.I wanted to like this book, but ultimately it struck me as a substandard offering. Pratchett certainly has done better. While there are chuckles galore, and even a few interesting insights, it was otherwise average. The supporting cast was unmemorable, and I also felt a bit of a loss at the lack of the accompanying cast of \\"usual suspects\\" that populate his Ankh-Morpork books.If you like Pratchett, give it a go, but keep your expectations reasonable.

Here is his take on organized religion, and on religion in general. Both as a humorist and as a novelist Pratchett's output is quite variable in quality, rarely reaching the peaks set by such superior works as INTERESTING TIMES or MEN AT ARMS. SMALL GODS is above the average, and for Pratchett, that's quite good indeed. Pratchett's hero, Brutha, is an apparently retarded and ambitionless monk who's slated to become a new Messiah, but the leader of the established church has his own ideas about who that Messiah should actually be. Furthermore, by an incredibly unlikely turn of events, the God worshipped by the established church actually exists, although He is handicapped a bit by being incarnated as a tiny turtle.

Although some people may find this book satanic or blasphemous this is not the case - pratchett treats the whole thing with a sense of sarcasm, and does not take himself seriously - although quite witty in places, I think this book is better suited to the avid prattchett fan!!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I have read it several times and each time find another pearl of truth. I have recommended it to friends and have even given a copy to my minister."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"My second Terry Pratchett. I have always studiously avoided Terry Pratchett, because it seemed clear from the covers and write ups of his books that they would not be my kind of thing. But I am frequently recommended his books, and a week or two ago a friend expressed surprise that I could love Douglas Adams and not Terry Pratchett.I explained I had read Nation, but apparently my Pratchett education was incomplete and he suggested I try Small Gods to see what I think.On completion of Small Gods, I decided that I know my tastes better than my friends.Small Gods is a clever and highly satirical book with plenty of wacky humour. I can see why it is so succesful, and I was left with the impression that Pratchett is well read and the book is well researched. Where some authors might repeat old cannards about, for instance, people only using 10% of their brain, Pratchett soundly debunks them. Moreover his satire appears to be informed at least somewhat by some actual history (although it was often to obvious and in your face for my tastes). For a book set in a nonsense world, it was surprisingly strong in such research.But despite appreciating the book, and understanding its popularity, Pratchett is not for me. It is all a bit too silly.So why do I like Douglas Adams then? I don't really have an answer to that. It may be because Douglass Adams was not so prolific. It may be because Pratchett writes fantasy, and somehow that changes things. It may be just that Adams' work was on a different wavelength better suited to me.I don't have a good answer to that but I won't be buying any more Pratchett."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"SOOOO profound about religion. I even wrote down several quotes.The book doesn't so much mock God, or even belief, but it certainly points out the problems and hypocrisies of organized religion. And of course, this is all couched in Pratchett's extremely clever and creative style.I liked the characters: Javer-like Vorbis; the slow, fat hero; the distinctly not god-like god trapped in the body of a turtle.In true Pratchett style, \\"Philosophic engines\\" referred to anything scientific, and \\"philosophers\\" were inventors, often at odds with the various religions.The end's a bit too warm and fuzzy, but I think that overall, this is my favorite Pratchett book."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"We have all read some allegorical, satirical commentary before whether about society or religious fervor. These stories offer hollowed characters and empty plots as we, the readers, are suppose to bring our own experiences to shore up the novels weak narration. In Small Gods, one could have not a philosophical or religious bone in their body and still be treated to a wonderful story of Brutha, the novice Monk propelled to greatness. The religious themes, satirical prods, and overall commentary on our society could be shucked and there would still be a wonderful work to be enjoyed.Those are the parts that catapult this novel into a great, 5-level star book. With such well written characters and story, these themes have plenty of things to hook on to and start taking jabs right from the get go. The glorious thing about this book is that no on is spared; atheists, agnostics, believers, Buddhists, apathetics, and theist all alike should be prepared to be challenged in subtle, but humorous, ways.This book, deeply rooted in satire, allows for introspection when it comes to the notions of society. Not to forget, as with Terry Pratchett books, this is laugh out loud stuff here. So, be prepared to be challenged in a fantasy setting with humor around every page."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett is the literary gateway drug for fantasy humor and this is the book that got me hooked. Smart, satirical fun-poking that questions the unquestionable. Chock full of Anglican tongues-in-cheek, laced with a crinkly layer of metaphysical philosophy, tickling soft underbellies along the way - so funny, odd and quirky, you may discover funny bones you didn't know you had. Thank you Terry Pratchett. You've made me an odder person for reading you, but also a happier one."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett is a phenomenal writer! I'll tell you that any of his books, especially the Disc World series are well worth picking up! In my youth I loved the Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien (and yes, I'm talking pre-movie adolescence, thank you). I read any fantasy/adventure novels I could get my hands on. Eventually I ran out of books worth reading.... In my late teens I even resorted to Harry Potter, which I thought was amusing (but with a very low reading level) until I stumbled upon Terry Pratchett. Oh what a day! It was as if I had been waiting for his writing since the first time I picked up a book! The worlds he has created within the Disc world series are so interesting and entertaining. On each page he has spelled out endless wit, comedy, and enchantment. The characters hook you from the start and in each book you learn more about them and how they intertwine with one another. The imagery Pratchett depicts with his stories is absolutely amazing! And one of the things that I think is the best about this series is you don't necessarily have to read them in a particular order. There are a few here or there within the series that do fit better together read in a certain order but besides those you can just go with the next one that strikes your fancy. Every time I finish one I CANNOT wait for the next! Soon I'll be done with the series and this is sad... But reading them all was well worth it! See for yourself!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This book was first published in 1992.Terry Pratchett's 13th Discworld novel (and 23rd overall) is a satire of organized religion. It poses a conundrum to many fans. Most of Pratchett's novels are parody, and Webster's On-line Dictionary defines parody as \\"a literary or musical work in which the style of an author or work is closely imitated for comic effect or in ridicule\\". Of course, Pratchett's works have always been a bit deeper and life-true than that pat definition suggests. On the other hand, the same dictionary defines satire as \\"a literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn; trenchant wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly\\". With most of Pratchett's fans expecting parody from a Discworld novel, satire can be a thorny pill to swallow.This rare \\"stand-alone\\" Discworld novel (like Pyramids and Moving Pictures, it is not part of any previously defined sub-series of novels) sticks organized religion on a spit and broils it mercilessly. It follows a young priest named Brutha, who is the last true believer of the great god Om, in spite of it being the state religion of the theocratic dictatorship of Omnia. On Discworld, gods can manifest to the proportion of their true believers, and because only Brutha is left, Om can only manifest as a one-eyed tortoise. Brutha discovers Om, literally, and carries Om in tortoise form with him through his journeys.His commander is Lord Vorbis, a blackly pious inquisioner who has no difficulties with torturing unbelievers. The Omnian priests openly pity those who have not accepted Om, though they unknowningly betray the fact that they themselves don't believe in Om so much as the Religion of Om. Therein lies the problem. As Brutha and Vorbis travel, they encounter many nations and religions, with Vorbis the matter-of-fact executioner restrained only by diplomacy. When disaster befalls them, and Vorbis spends most of the rest of the trip unconscious, it is Brutha who selflessly drags Vorbis along, hoping to find safety, because it is just the right thing to do. Ultimately, Vorbis sees Brutha conversing with Om, and predictably does not see it for what it is, and he persecutes Brutha for heresy, leading to a typical Discworld story ending.While Small Gods ranks as one of Pratchett's best -- I would place only the Discworld tomes Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music above it, as well as the non-Discworld books Good Omens (co-written with Neil Gaiman) and the newly published Nation) -- it is easily the meanest natured book in his ouvre. Pratchett simply does not bother to disguise his contempt and disgust for the hypocrisy and fake faith bred by most large, powerful religious organizations. While Pratchett has sharpened his poison pen from time to time in past and subsequent Discworld novels, it's usually not been at the expense of parody. Perhaps Pratchett sees the evil done by such organizations as not leaving room for fun. It's not that Small Gods isn't funny -- it's uproariously, scathingly funny just about all the time -- just that the fun is taking a back seat to the millions of people who have died because of religious zealotry.Small Gods is not a good first Discworld novel, or a good first Pratchett novel. It is best enjoyed by those thoroughly initiated into the splendors of the Discworld, and then only those who are not easily offended by its subject matter. Though a dozen years later he treats the topic with much more tenderness and humanity in Nation, Small Gods should not be missed as Pratchett's ultimate hit piece."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it. Makes you think about faith while it makes you laugh about everything. If I had not read better Pratchett's books, I would have rated this with a five"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett's Discworld series includes stories that are cynical, funny, satirical, occasionally deeply moving, and very entertaining. Like many of his fans, I believe \\"Small Gods\\" ranks at the top. It examines religion in society and manages simultaneously to condemn and endorse religion; deeply critical of religion as a tool of oppression yet supportive of religion as a path to goodness and self-enlightenment. The story takes place in Omnia, a country tyrannized by high priests in a theocracy patterned on the Spanish Inquisition. The society is so relentlessly oppressed by the dictators claiming to speak in the name of their god that the religion itself has been lost, buried in tyranny and bureaucracy. In fact, paradoxically in a country ruled by \\"The Church\\", there is almost no one left who really follows the religion. Enter Brutha, a simply country boy who is the last person in the entire country who actually believes in their god. The devout Brutha is the hero of the story, and the interaction between him, the Grand Inquisitor, and especially the abandoned god that only Brutha worships makes a very entertaining and thought-provoking novel with a terrific and moving ending.Many of the Discworld novels are interrelated with reoccurring characters, but this one happens to be a \\"stand-alone\\" story. Although I believe knowing a little about the reoccurring character Death will help a little; Death appears several times and also contributes to the story's closure. At any rate, knowing nothing about Discworld will not inhibit enjoyment of the story at all. Overall an outstanding novel that could easily have won any or all of the major prizes in the genre."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I enjoyed this quirky fantasy story. It was really humorous and managed to poke fun at religious bureaucracy.The Great God Om has been worshipped in Omnia, a region of the infamous Discworld, for centuries.

I can't give any solid reason for that, but it has never quite captivated me the way it does so many. Pratchett's writing is very good, and his world entertaining, but well . . . I don't know. Just doesn't do much for me. Maybe too much satire, not enough story.\\"Small Gods\\" is different. It has a pretty good story. And the end is very satisfying. This is one of the first Discworld books I read, and it's still my favorite. Admittedly, I haven't read many, so take that with a grain of salt.It does drag a bit, and once in a great while, Pratchett is more convinced of his cleverness than he should be.

This is a great satire and a wonderful place to start your journey into the Discworld, if you haven't already. The humor isn't quite as blatant as in some of the other books, but that makes it even better. Some of the best one-liners of the whole series come from this book. Check out the l-space web for the highlights."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I was picking through my mom's book collection, and found Small Gods to be a little different from the rest. I had no idea when I began to read it how different it was! From the first page onward I could not put it down. Terry Pratchett takes us into a private world, so similar to our own, and yet not. Religion is brought out into the open in a humorous, insightful way. We see a little bit of ourselves in the blind faith of Brutha, the novice with the amazing memory, who, out of thousands of hollow believers, truly has faith in the Great God Om, *holy horns* who through a failed attempt to become a massive white bull, compleate with fire and might, instead becomes a humble tortoise, whom most everyone will admit, &quot;there's good eating on one of those.&quot; Pratchett adds a little intriuge, betrail and a hint of human cruelity to this wonderful book, perfect for long, otherwise boring, summer days."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've been reading the Discworld books in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book.

The only thing is--he is the last true believer and the only person who can truly speak to Om. Going from there, this is Brutha's story of self- and religious- discovery. None of the people around him seem to know what to make of him, and his connection to Om, a very small god who is learning that if your last believer dies, it is not a pretty situation for a small god. But the world of Omnia is being upset by this new religious group obsessed by the fact that a Turtle actually swims across space with the world held up by four elephants upon its shell...it's a whole new world in this book!I can't wait to try another novel in the Discworld series! I highly recommend the same for anyone wanting some pure reading pleasure!"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Possibly, the best Pratchet work yet, and the work most associated with our own world.

Then, a quest to liberate not only the novice but the entire coutry from the clutches of those who only believed in themselves.This is a book I keep coming back to, years after I bought it."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"If you have the slightest inkling that you have what it takes to be a professional author, do not read Terry Pratchett. This is not because he's not worth reading, or because I don't think that aspiring writers can learn anything from his prose: that is patently false. Do not read Terry Pratchett because one chapter in, you will feel like a kid with a toy xylophone staring at Beethoven at the head of a symphony. Pratchett is one of the truly great writers today, with vivid imagery and beautiful wordplay that is unparalleled. In Small Gods, Pratchett follows the Discworld version of the Spanish inquisition, and creates a story that managed to make me laugh in the same chapter that it caused me to genuinely think about the nature of religion, belief and faith. I know I'm using hyperbole, and I know I'm raving to a ridiculous extent. But Small Gods earns the praise."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I expected a lesser Douglas Adams; after all, it was only a Terry Pratchett novel, one of those things with pages that you read quickly, laugh a couple of times and change for any other book on those second-hand stores.But \\"Small Gods\\" is a thing of beauty, of seemingly superficial thoughts that nevertheless takes you to the depths of the human condition. Pratchett mayve even did not intended to reach the heights of art, but here the attempt has succeded, and we could well be in the presence of a minor classic.Here you have a book that explains how Gods are made and destroyed, not in a fantasy world, but in our very real one, deux-ex-machina and all."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Religion isn't a concept that is touched on in any significant way in most fiction/fantasy books. Usually it's something along the lines of a Great Divine Goddess that some people pray to, while most people get on with their lives. Or perhaps the book has a generic set of Earth God, Sky God, and Food God. This is odd, because if you look at any history book most of the events of the Medieval and Renaissance periods were dominated by religion.So it's nice to see that religion is the main focus of Small Gods (as you could probably guess), even if it is in a satirical way. Small Gods focuses on the large, zealously religious, crusading nation Om. Their God is also called Om. The religion is Omnia, and the main character is named Brutha.Novice Brutha is the kind of person who really Believes. Not in the go-to-church-every-Sunday way, but the Om-is-watching-you-always way. So it comes as a surprise when Om appears to him in the form of a small, one-eyed turtle, asking for help. It comes as an even bigger surprise that nobody else can hear the God.Small Gods takes the idea of belief and turns it inside out. It doesn't make fun of religion, or try and poke holes in anyone's actual beliefs. But themes such as \\"Belief vs The Structure of the Church\\", \\"Atheism Being Almost As Good As Belief\\", and \\"What Happens When People Stop Believing\\" show up throughout the book.Sure, you could read it just for the laughs. Oh, the God is a vulgar turtle, ha ha. The book is certainly funny enough for that to satisfy people. But if you read the book for the larger themes, instead of reading it joke-by-joke, you'll see that Small Gods actually provides a pretty smart and thorough commentary on what religion is, and what it can make people do."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Although I had read around ten of the Discworld books (mainly the Watch books along with a couple of others), I had not read them in order. This time I am reading all of them from beginning to whatever is end at the moment. While I enjoyed this series from the very first book, at this point in the series the books just get funnier and funnier. WITCHES ABROAD was a complete stitch and SMALL GODS was, if anything, even funnier. The great god Om, who has very much against his will been incarnated in the body of a wee little tortoise (there's good eatin' on them), is one of the funniest characters that Terry Pratchett has ever created, which is saying quite a lot, while Vorbis is one of the most delightfully evil ones. There are countless delicious lines, wonderful ideas, enticing twists, and hysterical scenes, enough to make this one of the funniest of all the Discworld novels.I'm now at approximately the one-third mark in my reading of all the books (UNSEEN ACADEMICALS was #37 in the series, but given that I started reading the series in September 2009 and that Pratchett, despite his illness, is bravely pushing forward with new books, I figure that he'll have published #38 and #39 by the time I get to #37, praying to God that his health remains good) and I'm delighted that they just seem to be getting better and better. I'm about to start hitting most of the books that I've already read once, but I look forward to working through them again, especially now that I am familiar with so many more secondary characters. Since Pratchett is English and I'm American, I can't claim him as a national treasure, but surely I can claim him as an international one. I can't say for certain that he has made the world a better place, but he has certainly made it a more entertaining one, and surely that an improvement of sorts."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order.

The character development and interactions were (as always with Pratchett) deep and entertaining.

Unfortunately for Om, it's the village idiot. Now all Om needs to do is raise this kid up to become the next Prophet, and his problems should be solved, but the church has other plans.Sounds pretty promising, doesn't it? It's a situation ripe for kicking large holes into some of my favorite things that need large holes kicked into them. But at the 2/3 point, I'm still bored and I'm not really laughing much - not as much as people tell me I should be, anyway.This is the third time I've tried to get on board the Pratchett train and the third time I've been left standing at the station wondering what all the commotion was about. Clearly, he is well loved by a great many - enough so that it's earned him a Knighthood - so I'm certainly not going to criticize his writing or his imagination. I am quite willing to say, &#34;It isn't you, Terry. It's me.&#34;I mean, I see his wry commentary and the curmudgeonly asides. I get the various aspects of modern culture that he is lampooning. And I do enjoy the very occasional almost-chuckle. But it just feels too forced for me, like that kid I knew in high school who just kept telling jokes and throwing witty barbs at people, class after class, day after day, hoping one of them would stick and get a laugh. The sheer sense of desperation overwhelmed any actual funny he might have landed, and left me exhausted more than amused.Now, I'm not pleased with myself about this. Not in the least. I wanted to like Pratchett. I was hoping that maybe this time around, he would finally &#34;click&#34; for me, and I would be the proverbial kid in a candy store, eyes a'glaze, looking out over the vast plains of his delectable works, eager to gorge myself on his books of plenty. But it didn't happen, and that saddens me. I feel like I've let myself down somehow.If you've enjoyed other Pratchett books, then I'm sure this one will work just as well for you. And if you're a fan of curmudgeonly sacred cow tipping, then by all means, give this a shot. But if you like your humor to arise more directly from character, rather than from the sheer audacity of what he's lampooning, then you might understand my disappointment.Good-bye and God Speed, Sir Terry.

A fun story that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"After discovering the discworld series very late on in the piece, I'm reading my way through them in sequence. To be honest, they are a bit patchy from book to book - always worth reading - never bad, but some definitely better than others. No question which side of the equation this book falls - it's my favourite so far. The tone of the book is slightly more serious than previous novels - it's a more sophisticated satire on organised religion than a simple magic and swords and magic fluff fun story. Don't be put off by that though, the trademark quirky characters, razor wit and wordplay as well as absurd humour are still in there. And of course the odd laugh out loud moment or two."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I went into the bookstore looking, and hoping to find a new book by Douglas Adams. Nothing new, dissappointed and ready to leave a sales clerk stopped me and asked if I had read any Pratchett? I said, no. He said read this(Small Gods) and if you don't like me you can thwamp me with a tuna. YOu have got yourself a deal. I grabbed the book, and my towel and went to read. All I can really say about this book is WOW! Brutha is a new fantasy hero! He comes home from the Citadel's garden one day with a tortoise, whom talks to him. And a month later he is the next Prophet. Go figure! Give up snapper soup, it may be your god you eat next."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is by far one of the most intellectual books I have ever read - and about a turtle god too! Reading between the lines will give the reader a surprising look at the peculiarities of our world while remaining a very interesting and funny read. Anyone interested in fantasy or humor will certainly enjoy all of the Discworld series and this is a wonderful introduction to those crazy characters"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I have to admit that I'm a picky reader - I haven't read much not by Anne McCaffrey in three years because when I start a series I finish it before I move on to the next. But this book was a welcome diversion. Not only that, but Pratchett writes like I think: stream of consciousness. The Turtle Moves, kids... and it definately moved me"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Amazing; Pratchett romps with the old idea that gods derive substance from the faith of their believers. Such a simple idea, but Pratchett makes it sing. A god reduced to a the status of a turtle, who has only one beleiver, who is in turn, endangered by his belief while trapped inside a hypocritical Establisment that is devoted to the worship of that self same god.... Humor and satire layered like a fine pastry. This book rings like a bell"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods. Brutha, a lowly, simple-minded novitiate of a mighty religious empire, has just met his god face-to-face. Actually, heel-to-face, because the mighty god Om is really a not-so-mighty tortoise who is out to reclaim his empire -- with Brutha's help"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Every Disccworld novel is about the introduction of something that is a powerful modern element in *our * lives. And how it gets dangerously out of control, and dies. This is about philosophy and is an excellent view on both the Peloponesian Wars and the Inquisition. To show you the error of strict religion and free-thinking at the same time, while telling you slavery isn't altogther a bad thing, Mr. Pratchett has written this book, so do him the honor of reading it"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Prachett never ceases to please his readers.&quot;Small gods&quot; is no exception to that and is in factamong his better books. The humor is darker than usualbut is also sensitive and moving. I reccomend this bookhighly and praise Terry Pratchett once again."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"As an athiest I particularly enjoyed this book, since beneath the side-splitting humour there are a lot of observations about organised religion which are right on target. The way it makes people cruel and willfully ignorant, and the way the organisation takes over the actual god and becomes the real power. Why are so many outright evil things done in the name of a kind god? Because of people like Vorbis. Read it even if you're a thiest- Pratchett manages to do all this without rubbing your nose in it."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"the book came really fast and was in great condition, I cant wait to read it i would order from them again for sure."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he's created and the incredibly intelligent books. While I greatly enjoy the book itself, I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone. Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return. Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal. There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I am a huge unabashed Pratchett fan. I will admit to that. However, one of the reasons for that fact is this book.Most of the Discworld books explore themes of, quite simply, humanity, in a critical, though loving manner. Small Gods steps up the game significantly, investigating what it means to believe, how human nature interacts with that belief - converting it into religion and subverting it to its own cynical and political desires.As far as a philosophical argument goes, it's quite a heavy one. However, Pratchett injects a ton of humanity an optimism into the tale. Brutha's character (not coincidentally sounding like \\"Brother\\" and rhyming with \\"Buddha\\") is a wide-eyed, naive buffoon at first, that matures into a politically savvy religious leader with a keen understanding of what humans want and need.Not unlike the growth of most people coming to terms with religious beliefs and how they play into their being.Happily, you do not need to read Discworld's first books to properly enjoy this one; the in-jokes add, ofcourse, but the theme of the books remain. Unlike some other books (for instance, Night Watch, another master piece of his) you do not need the context and background of the characters to fully appreciate the book and the story.If you read only one Discworld book - make it Small Gods."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"It's hard to add much to what has been said already. But if you are looking for a good stand alone discworld book that is not bogged down with character and ideas from previous book this is a great place to start and is - in my opinion - the best the Discworld has to offer."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Nobody can discuss serious philosophical issues in hysterically funny ways like Terry Pratchett. Small gods is as intelligent exploration of theology and people's relationship to religion as you'll find but if that's not what you want to take from it you'll have a great time laughing through the book. The Turtle Moves."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I had a copy of this book some time ago and really need to read it again for the thrill that it always gives me, but I seem to have lost my copy. So I purchases another copy and read it front to back and still get the same thrill reading it now as I did when I first had a copy."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"People have been recommending Pratchett books to me for a decade and a half, but I never got around to picking one up until now (after Stephen King, I'm a bit leery of prolific authors). I have to say, I enjoyed this one: Monty Python's Life of Brian meets Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, with a little more of a plot. The humor is more light-hearted and irreverent than-laugh-out-loud funny, but Pratchett's thoughts on theology and the excesses of religion (including anti-religion) have an underlying substance that gets the reader to think. Highly quotable, especially if you're a Unitarian. Can anyone recommend another good Pratchett book?"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"(Should really be 4 1/2 stars.........)This review is for the Kindle version.So this was the second book I had ever read from Pratchett and being a philosophy major I found that I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. Other Disc-world novels all have wonderful humor and characters that are easily enjoyed and understood while this one has a bit heavier side to it than other Disc-world novels. That being said, while this book is set in Disc-world and does contain a couple of characters from other books, it is not at all important that you have any previous knowledge of anything disc-world to enjoy this book. You can safely read this book as an introduction in the Disc-world novels and Pratchett's style in general.As for the book itself, if you enjoy great humor (specifically British humor) and discussions about philosophy and religion, this book is for you. While the ideas that are brought forth in the book are hardly deep or original takes on religion or philosophy, it's still a well written story that takes a couple of unexpected turns. I particularly liked the main character in this book more so than other main characters from the Disc-world series.All in all I'd definitely recommend the book a nice stand-alone introduction to Pratchett and Disc-world."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Pratchett has quickly become a favorite of mine. His Discworld books are reliable entertainment. Each shares the qualities that make them quick reads, and yet each is quite different from others. Parody, humor, and clever use of story events to illustrate more serious subject matter are common, and they are all here in this one. Loosely, it is about a novice priest named Bruthe who serves in the city of Omnia. He becomes a reluctant figure in religious clashes with the city of Ephebe. Bruthe is a minor figure in Omnian society when we meet him, until one day he is working in a garden and discovers a tortoise...Lots of craziness occurs, and most of it is colorful and entertaining. Along the way, various themes are constantly turned inside and out, this way and that, and arguments are found within arguments on the ideas of religion, philosphy, warfare, good and evil, and human significance or insignificance. But it's quite difficult to take it all too seriously, unless that is what you concentrate on while reading. Trying to expand the mind while wading through the humorous moments and the many delightful characters is a major task for mortal readers. I confess to weakness, and vow to do better next time."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is the first Pratchett book I have read. I had avoided Pratchett for years because of his classification as a science fiction writer. I was surprised that this is NOT a sci-fi book. It is fantasy, and there is only a limited amount of that. Many mainstream literary authors (M&aacute;rquez, Pynchon) have a similar amount of fantasy in their works.This is a well-written book. The plot and characters develop and flow, it maintains interest, and is a pleasure to read. The ideas are original and there are thoughtful reflections about the human condition.That said, this book does show some elements of Sci-Fi fiction that make it genre writing. This book does not include a single female character, nor any substantial reference to women. The entire realm of sexuality, family, childhood and romance is avoided--as if entire worlds of men can exclusively focus on the \\"important\\" things of war, science, and adventure. This is the defensive world of 13-year old boys, and it is a major weakness of Sci-Fi writing. These limitations do not detract from this particular book, but I worry if the rest of Pratchett's books are similar.Mr. Pratchett is an excellent writer. You will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This should be required reading for all school children everywhere. It teaches them about humanity, appropriately channelled irreverence, and acquiring an essential survival technique- a sense of humor. Albeit at our own expense. Particularly at our own expense. Quite apart from the fact that it is also a jolly good fable of good versus bad.I wish the guardians of our educational policies and also- horror of horrors- of policing our children would have the sense to put an outstanding book like this in school curriculums. All the drivel that children are currently encouraged to read in the name of literacy and progress is mere politically and culturally sanitized mush."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"Terry Pratchett draws on a number of thinly disguised analogies to religious beliefs of ordinary people. I found it absolutely hilarious as well as somewhat thought provoking. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't sensitive to the religious puns."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"This is the 13th in Pratchett's Discworld series. It's also, technically, a stand-alone book (like \\"Equal Rites,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Moving Pictures,\\" \\"Small Gods,\\" \\"The Truth,\\" and \\"Monstrous Regiment\\"). The main character doesn't show up anywhere else in the series, but a secondary character, Lu-Tze, does. Also, the main thrust of the plot is fairly important in a few later books. You could probably pick this book up without having read any other Pratchett. But, I wouldn't recommend skipping it (regardless of my mere 3 star rating).Normally, I love anything by Pratchett. But, this book's a poser. It's VERY well written in good Pratchett style. It has a good plot, good theme, and a few nice twists and turns. My problem with the book is that it's not \\"nice.\\" In fact, it's depressing. The prevalence of rot and evil that the main character has to fight makes my stomache churn. I read Pratchett to lighten my life. This book doesn't do that. Technically, it's a VERY good book. I just don't like the subject material. Splitting the difference, I can only give it a rating of 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I've listened to the first thirteen books of Discworld, finding nearly all of them hilarious and read by some very entertaining narrators (Nigel Planer being exemplary at it) but Tony Robinson's recitation is absolutely miserable. It completely ruined the book. His dynamic range incessantly and frustratingly wavers from a quiet, indoor voice to a conspiratorial whisper, requiring the listener to make a compulsion of adjusting the volume: leaving it loud is no good, because Robinson's portrayal of Om is squeaky and piercing (though not a refreshing \\"loud\\" in the conventional sense, as Robinson puts no body or richness into the voice); leaving it at a normal volume means you miss 90% of the characters' dialog, since--apparently--they all stand six inches from one anothers' ears and don't know the definition of the word \\"project.\\" Even DEATH, the hyper-real, immutable fate of all life on the Discworld, is converted into the faintest whisper by Robinson....One would think that Pratchett's convention of writing Death's dialog in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS would give the narrator some hint of a clue. (Though I haven't read a copy of this book, so perhaps Pratchett decided to shrink the size of Death's words down to the faintest scratchings of an ink-less pen.)I advise the reader to buy this book read by another narrator, or to buy the paperback. Leave Robinson to whisper sweet nothings into a void of famous Discworldian anti-noise."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"this book should be worshiped as the bilble so that I dont have to go to church. the reason this book was so funny is becouse jokes are funnier writen down."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"I have read most of this series with great delight. However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the \\"REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE\\" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)"},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"It's easy to see why a lot of praise has been heaped on the novels of Terry Pratchett and this novel in particular. First of all, it's very humorous. Perhaps not as humorous as he thinks it is, and perhaps not always humorous when he's trying to be, but humorous nevertheless, and occasionally humorous in the laugh-out-loud, belly-guffaw way.More importantly, it tosses around a lot of post-modern, leftist, philosophical sound-bites that, simple-minded as they are, often pass for intelligence or insight in our benumbed society. This is what undoubtedly makes it so attractive: not only is it clever, but it also has a Lot of Important Things to Say, like, we all have to be nice to each other, man, and war is unhealthy for children and other living things, man, and religion can be used for bad purposes, man. It is not generalizing or over-simplifying to say this; it is literally, as we shall see, what it has to say.It's probably not necessary to summarize the loony plot as the plot isn't really the focus of the novel, but here goes anyway. The country of Omnia, which is dominated by cruel religious fanatics, is destined to be reshaped by a new prophet. He is the simple-minded acolyte, Brutha. Brutha is visited by the primary god of the nation, Om, who is at the moment manifested in his earthly (sorry, Discworldly) guise as a weak and slow-moving tortoise, because nobody really believes in him anymore except for Brutha. The more people who believe in a particular god, you see, the stronger and more powerful the god.Briefly, Brutha and Om take part unwittingly in a plot by the evil mastermind Omnian leader Vorbis to conquer the neighboring land of Ephebe, which is run by a democratically elected tyrant, and which is loaded with philosophers who wander around arguing vehemently with one another. Vorbis believes he must instill the will of Om to the Ephebian people, unaware that Om at that moment is traveling with him in the body of a lowly tortoise. Ironic, eh? Well, it goes on from there; needless to say, it provides Mr. Pratchett a grand forum in which to comment on the nature of gods and men, the uselessness or usefulness of philosophy, the nature of good and evil, the random arbitrary nature of fate, the . . . aw, you get the idea.As mentioned, the novel can often be quite funny, particularly the conversations between the caustic Om and his dimwitted protector, Brutha, the only person who can hear him. Om is stunned to learn all of the things that have been written about him and all the things he is alleged to have said; all he really cares about is getting a nice bite of lettuce and to avoid the eagle overhead that wants to make a meal out of him. Brutha, the one true believer in Omnia, is equally stunned to learn that Om doesn't seem to know or care about the things on which Brutha has based his entire belief-system. This is very funny stuff.Less successful are the various one-liners scattered throughout the novel which strike one as being \\"cute,\\" rather than clever. \\"Brutha obeyed immediately. Brutha did not know the meaning of the word disobedience. It was only one of a large number of words he didn't know the meaning of.\\" Cute. And some of the humor is cringe-worthy. The Ephebean god of wind, for example, is named, \\"Flatulus.\\" The messenger god is, \\"Fedechs.\\" Ho, ho, ho.Having said that, though, the book is at least entertaining, and if you go into it expecting nothing more, you will be pleased. But if you are expecting some sort of deep thought or meaningful insight you're going to be disappointed. Most readers will have worked out the, \\"god-or-man-who-came-first\\" conundrum in their teens or at the very latest in their freshman, Philosophy 101 class. And after the plot chronicles the long, starving journey in the desert, the hallucinatory meeting with the saint, the confrontation with the lion, the betrayal by Vorbis, and the reestablishment of Om as a great god and with Brutha as his prophet, we are left with nothing more than this feeble-minded observation: \\"I think . . . you should do things because they're right. Not because gods say so.\\" A couple of pages later somebody says, \\"But there's no reason to fight!\\" And somebody answers, \\"Yes, there is. Honor and revenge and duty and things like that.\\" Things like that. Obviously, the author has a rather disparaging view of warfare--under any circumstances--an illogical premise commonly shared by our modern-day, lock-step intelligentsia.Look, if you think Vonnegut is some kind of brilliant philosopher and Tom Robbins is the epitome of the clever wordsmith, you'll probably drool over this thing. But if you've long ago abandoned these seers to the dustbin of cheap thought, prepare with Small Gods to be mildly amused, nothing more."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."},{"Title":"Small Gods","review":"In my opinion, the worst book in the series. I read this book through just because I did not want to waste my spent money.do only buy it if you are a HARDCORE Discworld Fan."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"Reading The Lawless Roads reminded me of a comment from Albert Camus from his notebooks: 'What gives value to travel is its fear. It is the fact that when we are so far from our own country we are siezed by a vague fear, and an instinctive desire to go back to the protection of old habits'.This is Graham Greene in Mexico. Travelling through the dry, dusty, mosquito and tick fly riven states of Southern Mexico in the 1930s, a period when the Catholic Church was under severe persecution from the state, Green clings on to the two things that remind him of happier times and nations - his Englishness, and the Catholic Church. His prologue is set in England, the title of his book comes from a piece of verse, quoted at the start, by the Scottish poet Edwin Muir and throughout his turbulent journey he seeks solace in quintissentially English writers such as Trollope and William Cobbett.It is evident that Greene loathes Mexico. At one point he writes of the country 'No hope anywhere. I have never been in a country where you are more aware all the time of hate'. He finds, during his travels, a Godless, immoral and violently dangerous state. He retains a colonial contempt for the natives he comes across with their 'expressionless brown eyes' and is mistrustful of everyone. He defends the under fire Catholicism with extraordinary bias, declaring the Catholic Church 'Perhaps the only body in the world today which consistently - and sometimes successfully opposes the totalitarian state'. Remember this was the same period as the Spanish Civil war.He plunges the depths in Tabasco, a state where Catholic persecution was particularly strong - 'One felt one was drawing near to the centre of something - if it was only of darkness and abandonment'. And his personality undergoes a disturbing descent into increasing misery and intolerence. After travelling through numerous grisly towns (Puebla is the only place he has any affection for, the only place in Mexico Greene can imagine living in with 'some happiness'), being plagued by mosquitos and diarrhoea and undergoing hours on cripplingly uncomfortable muleback, he reaches rock bottom - 'It seemed to me that this wasn't a country to live in at all with only the head and desolation; it was a country to die and leave only ruins behind'.But Greene's vitriolic prejudices against Mexico serve as a blackly creative vehicle to contain his bluntly honest and hatefully evocative prose style. A more dispassionate, cheerful writer would not be nearly as successful in dredging up in striking detail the climate of this sinister Mexican age. Greene also owes a great debt to Mexico, for it was his travels in hell that provided the inspiration for one of his greatest novels 'The Power and the Glory'. In The 'Lawless Roads' we briefly meet the characters in the later novel - the 'Whisky Priest', the sweating dentist, the 'Mestizo' with two yellow fangs. This baleful travelogue highlights why Greene was able to use Mexico as the canvas on which to paint 'The Power and the Glory', a masterful tale of oppression, persecution, death and redemption."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"I read about this book in a New Republic article about Lopez Obrador, the leftist who recently lost in Mexico's presidential election. Obrador is from the southern state of Tabasco, an isolated, southern state that Greene visits in this book. Greene's interest in the state stems from the fact that in the 1930's the region's governor spearheaded one of the most virulent anti-religious campaigns in all of Mexico. Greene was commissioned to write about how Mexicans were coping during this period of intense suppression of religious expression. My interest in the book was purely historical and sociological; I wanted to better understand the ideology that led the state to clamp down on religious institutions and how ordinary Mexicans reacted to this. In that sense, the book did not quite live up to my expectations. Instead, in spite of the beautiful prose (which ensures a pretty quick read) and occasional sparks of wisdom, the book read like a bitter, disgruntled travelogue.For starters, as Greene himself concedes, his Spanish was apparently not so good at the time, something that obviously limited his ability to talk with ordinary Mexicans who knew no English (this is not to mention that many of the Indians in Tabasco and Chiapas did not even speak Spanish). Tabasco and Chiapas are both built up at as hearts of darkness; he announces at the beginning of the book his intention to visit these remote places, but he does not even reach Tabasco until halfway through the book, as the first part consists of his journey from Texas down to Mexico City. And then, when he finally does reach these places, the effect is rather anti-climactic, as he doesn't even seem to talk to any ordinary Mexicans about the religious situation. Obviously this probably had a lot to do with people's unwillingness to talk about such a politically sensitive issue, but it was still disappointing that he went to so much effort to reach such remote places, only to come away with so few real insights. In Tabasco and Chiapas, the only people Greene seems to befriend are odball expatriate Europeans and Americans. These were fascinating characters and the stories of how they ended up in the backwaters of southern Mexico are worthy stories on their own, but I think we would be critical of any contemporary journalist who only fraternizes with expats.Perhaps the most disturbing thing, though, is something that Sirin alludes to in his review (but surprisingly none of the other reviewers have mentioned), namely Greene's explicit hatred for the country and its people, which was quite unexpected. As I was reading it, I kept reminding myself of the context, since the book was written in the 1930's from an obviously colonial mindset. However, by the end of the book, when Greene is tired, ill, and ready to return home, the bitterness towards Mexico becomes hard to ignore. Virtually every behavioral trait he observes in Mexicans obviously hides sinister intentions. He has something bad to say about every place his train passes through. Again, I realize that the author was fatigued from his travels and ill at this point, but it still didn't make for particularly fun reading.I gave the book three stars because it does have many merits. As I mentioned, Greene writes beautifully (I have read and loved the \\"The Comedians\\" and plan to read some of his other novels in the near future). Also, the simple fact that he visited some of these remote places during this interesting period of Mexico's history makes the book intrinsically interesting. Overall, however, the book just wasn't quite what I expected."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"Greene is a consummate observer of humanity, and this chronicle of a trip he made to southern Mexico, an area deeply steeped in Catholic tradition, is nearly flawless. He went at a time of Socialist convulsion in Mexico, when the government actively worked to suppress the Church and destroy its influence, with the sort of results that have happened everywhere and in every time with such programs--life is merely made even more miserable for and incomprehensible to the poorest, who have little choice but to wait out this latest madness from the central authorities."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"Unfortunately I'm unable to compare with The Power and the Glory, because I haven't read it yet. this was my first Graham Greene book and i will definitely read more. The book is written in such a rich poetic style. Every sentence is precious and evocative. This is no ordinary travel book."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"The Lawless Roads is the second non-fiction travel book of Greene's that I've read, and the other, Journey Without Maps was also a great book about travel in Africa. Greene is a brilliant travel writer; he makes detailed observations about the countryside, people, and customs of Mexico. The way he traveled in the 30s makes you appreciate modern infrastructure and the advances of civilization that make godforsaken places livable. He was on assignment for a paper to report on the anti-clerical government that was persecuting the Catholics. It was form this experience that Greene wrote The Power and The Glory, which germinated from an antecdote he heard in Mexico about a whisky priest while on assignment."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"The Lawless Roads is a non-fiction account of a trip Graham Greene took in 1937 to report on the persecution of Catholics in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco. This trip was the precursor to and inspiration for his greatest novel, The Power and the Glory, about a whiskey priest who becomes the last representative of Catholicism in a blighted Mexican province.As journalism the book is thin and cursory. We don't get much framing of why the Marxist government decided to outlaw Catholicism in the first place. Did the priestly class milk the peasants? Was this ancient creed bogging the society down in ignorance and superstition and preventing material progress? Did any of the Bishops commit financial, personal or political indiscretions? Beyond a brief mention that it had to do with \\"a war...for the soul of the Indian\\" we aren't told.Although he attends a few masses, visits some ruined churches and meets with priests and bishops, Greene spends little time talking to average Catholics. Since not observing the Church's rituals is a big sin, these Catholics must have been living in an emotional pressure cooker, but we don't see it. And Greene provides no justification for why Catholicism, imposed under Spanish colonial rule, deserves a central place in Mexican culture. He seems to assume the answer is obvious. Obviously it wasn't to the politicians and landowners who sent out the army to shoot priests and destroy churches.Absent journalism, we get travelogue. It's clear that Greene is repulsed by the grubby sensuality of Mexico, and he doesn't like Mexicans. His Spanish is limited, which makes many of his interactions fraught and difficult. He is very often too hot or cold, irritated by dogs and rats, plagued by flies and mosquitoes, sore from mule travel over rough roads. His Mexico is a place full of hate and death. Being the world class writer he was, there are some compelling descriptions of flyblown mountain towns and the people in them, but throughout he is clearly more repulsed than emphatically engaged.The most fascinating question raised by Greene's dyspeptic travelogue is this: how did the bigoted, self-absorbed, biased journalist who wrote The Lawless Roads turned into the great-souled novelist who wrote the Power and the Glory less than two years later? In that novel, Greene turns empathy and vast compassion for the whiskey priest, his desperate flock and even the priest's persecutors into a masterpiece of world literature. Despite the outpouring of words by and about Greene, this transformation of sensibility has never been satisfactorily explained. The mystery of how a person can rise above the limitations of a small, demanding self to create something that endures through time is, like faith, powerful and compelling. Which is why it's fascinating and worthwhile to read The Lawless Roads and then read its metamorphosis into The Power and the Glory."},{"Title":"The Lawless Roads","review":"ahh, to have visited mexico in the 30's. palenque, bonampak, and all the other &quot;undiscovered&quot; sites of mexico. greene does an admirable job of describing all the sights of the mayan country of the south. however, stick to &quot;the power and the glory&quot; for the real thing."},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"I first read Catherine Marshall's Something More about 20 years ago and have reread it and saved excerpts from it over the years. Catherine, Peter Marshall's widow, starts this book with the death of her young grand child. She then reviews her Christian walk and provides a thought provoking encounter with a loving God who can allow the young, innocent and good amongst us to die and yet remains a God of goodness and love. She allows that callousness, bitterness and resentment are normal responses to disappointments but paints a broad, loving and caring canvass that facilitates overcoming one's own hurts and frustrations. I come away feeling refreshed and encouraged and recommend the book to anyone trying to cope with personal loss."},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"For Christians who are looking for answers to some of life's questions, or if you're just looking to further enrich your Christian walk, this book is for you. The author covers the subjects of: -Praising God, even when things are going bad and it doesn't seem like you have any reason to. -Forgiveness; if we don't forgive, we only hurt ourselves. -Obedience; how to jump out in faith instead of always questioning God. -Dreams; how God used them to communicate with His people in Biblical times and still is today. -The Enemy; S****, his characteristics and battle tactics that he uses against Christians. -Healing; why God heals some but not all. -Tithing; how to act as a &quot;channel&quot; of abundance and blessings. -The Holy Spirit; the third person of the Trinity. -Rebellion; the spirit brought to the earth by S**** and how it adversely affects our lives. Catherine Marshall intersperses her own experiences with each of these very pertinent subjects as she gives Biblical descriptions and references to each of them. I found this book to be an excellent source of material for personal and group Bible studies. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"A person who writes with such depth of understanding has lived the &quot;reflective life&quot; and has been able to process the various experiences encountered. Catherine Marshall left a legacy treasured by any Christian who reads her work with an earnest, seeking mind. When she doesn't know the answers and the mystery remains, she says so. Some things she doesn't understand and is honest about it.From the perspective of Christian stewardship, she writes about the joy of being a channel of blessing to other people and the importance of giving, even if it is out of poverty. On using one's talents she notes &quot;the essence of creativity is to seek Him first.&quot; She adds &quot;He will show us how to make the best use of our talents and create something that other people need or enjoy.&quot; He certainly did that with her talents. Her ministry continues posthumously. The books she's contributed continue to bless those of us who are still on this side."},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"I knew from the moment I heard the name of this book and read the other reviews that this was the next book God wanted me to read. I wondered how the three Amazon reviews could be about the same book, since they varied so. But in reading the first 5 chapters, I realized how Catherine Marshalls experiences shared throughout those 5 chapters, mirrored the walk of many Christians, and depending on what stage of sanctification you are in as you read it, different analogies, and experiences would reach you right where you are in your walk and speak to different people in different ways. I am amazed at how God uses different yet similar experiences in my own life to teach me many of the things Catherine learned. This book helped me to realize that God has the same things in mind for all of us because they are dear to His heart. He desires our obedience and that everything, EVERYTHING in our lives be submitted to Him, not because He is a control freak, but because it is for our own good. As I read the chapter where Catherine explains her struggle with another authors expression that \\"God is in everything\\", it hit home. Recently God had taught me a phrase through Chip Ingram \\"Nothing happens that God did not either allow or decree\\". As I read that chapter it reaffirmed what God was teaching me and I truly began to believe I was going to have to soon go through something...I thought with my own child. Not two weeks later, my daughters boyfriend was killed in a freak accident. I found comfort in rereading this chapter in Catherines book and shared it with my daughter. God had laid this book in my hands to be the help that we were going to need to make it through. We are nowhere near the end, and neither have I read the end of the book, as our lives have been on hold for awhile, but I am certain through Catherine's book, God will show us \\"our hope and future\\" and prove that God does indeed work for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Catherine is definitely a Godsend and a true woman of God. Anyone desiring to deepen their walk with God (and understand what they are going through) should have a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"Missing the mark...was I ever! Are you, along with me, seeking a book that is vibrant and alive, yet, one designed to challenge your Christian walk? This then is just such a book!Catherine Marshall's chapter 3, \\"The Oughts and the Anys\\" was the beginning of my conscience's eye-opener. It was a real \\"knee-jerk!\\" I literally went to my knees begging God to show me who I hadn't forgiven. The revelation came the next morning as I awoke. Every time something triggered an old negative memory of someone's offensive action or something I allowed to greatly annoy me, I would relive the entire incident, detail by detail. Yet, God forgives me my mistakes and refuses to recall them. I had some real homework to do!The next chapter that completed my moment of truth was entitled, \\"The Law of the Generations.\\" It brought me to the conclusion of why my prayers for my son were not being answered. Here is a quote from a list that a friend shared with Catherine:\\"For now, do not ask anything for your son. He is God's child as well as yours; God loves him even more than you do. Turn him over completely to that light of Christ within him.\\"Whenever you think of your son, picture the light spreading as God does His own work in this boy.\\"When I remembered that God wants me to forgive as He forgives me, and that He can't listen to my requests unless I do, this book has changed my prayer life."},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"arrived on time,excellent condition.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand and deepen their faith in our Lord and Savior."},{"Title":"Something more (The Catherine Marshall anniversary library)","review":"I was thrilled to hear about this book from a friend who suggested she was going to adopt for Advent a theme of thanksgiving and praise to God, especially for the negative circumstances in her life. I felt this was an answer to a prayer, since I'd been hoping to find some nice Christian fiction reading. So I found the book on amazon.com and bought it right away just in time for the start of Advent. The book initially seemed very good to promote these ideas. However, since I have an M.A. in Theology from a Dominican school, I had to try hard to overlook her harsh misrepresentation of Thomas Aquinas beginning on pg. 161. I set the book aside for a few hours and was able to return to it because I really enjoyed the earlier parts of the book. Then the author began again on pg. 173, and I just couldn't continue reading with her untruths. I had to wonder why she was so adamant about proving a wrong point, and whether the other parts of her book were as unfounded as this.To expound - To classify Thomas Aquinas with the likes of Kant, Calvin, Rousseau - is utterly ridiculous to anyone who has any familiarity with the discipline of philosophy. If her statement is that they are philosophers and think (use their minds) and hence brought on the Age of Reason, well, this is superficially true. Does she regret the Age of Reason?If her statement is that reason, when used to the exclusion of emotions, is unbalanced, her statement is true. However, she is unaware of Aquinas's lengthy treatment of the emotions and their itegration in what he calls the \\"intellect.\\" His definition of the intellect differs substantially from what we call the \\"intellect\\" in our post-modern culture. The \\"intellect\\" is much more expansive in his definition and does not act in exclusion to the emotions.In fact, when I began to read his analysis of the emotions, it was the healthiest description I'd encountered anywhere. He believes the emotions are all good, all very natural. The emotions are our very personal and individual response to the environment, to external stimuli, and they simple are what they are. It is our response to the emotion and our consequent actions which are considered \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" We engage our intellect to decide what is good to do in each situation. The emotions themselves are completely integral to our healthy lives and cannot be judged.I am disappointed in yet another \\"protestant\\" work which is misinformed about the very foundations of Christianity and chooses to bury an attack so deeply in its text. I was hoping for an uplifting and encouraging book to read.I will use this opportunity to suggest to ministers that the material you receive in your seminaries regarding the Catholic faith is incomplete and misinformed. Having spoken to numerous pastors about their scathing critiques of Catholicism, they have admitted that their beliefs are based on their learnings at seminary. I have informed them they are factually mistaken in their teachings and to research for themselves. I will grant to author Catherine Marshall that Thomas Aquinas' seminal work, \\"Summa Theologica\\" is a very difficult read. Perhaps she relied on hearsay to form her opinions. I would encourage you to read and determine for yourself so you are not proven fallacious in your beliefs. You might enjoy it; I found it quite beautiful."},{"Title":"The Maritime History of the World **Volumes 1 & 2**","review":"To consider writing the \\"maritime history of the world\\" is one thing, but how to go about it is something else altogether. Covering some 7,000 years - i.e. from 5,000BC to the present day, the vast subject of the world's maritime history is set out in strict chronological order which is a great help when trying to find something specific.These two co-authors enjoy a high reputation in their field and there is no doubt that they have surpassed themselves in this exceptional and authoritative work. With a Bibliography which runs to 8 pages, this enormous undertaking is set out in two volumes. The basic concept is to identify and explain those dates or periods in history when - and where, significant milestones were achieved in terms of man's endeavours as far as the sea was concerned. At the beginning of Volume 1, the dates are not entirely exact - but nobody was actually keeping accurate records in 5,000 BC. As we progress through the book, however, and on into Volume 2, so the dates do become more exact and the authors are able to include every important maritime event under it's year; Spanish Armada (1588), Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the loss of the USS Maine (1898) to mention just 3 important dates picked at random.From the earliest floating logs to the latest and biggest ships, they are all in here making this an important tool for anyone with an interest in ships and shipping.NM"},{"Title":"Legends of the Iroquois (Myths and Legends)","review":"My kid found this very helpful for a school project.

Halliday claims that new perceptions of Shakespeare were developed at fifty year intervals starting with his his contemporaries, then with Dryden in the Restoration, Pope in the Augustan Age, Johnson in the Age of Reason, and Coleridge in the Romantic Age. One of the surprising revelations is that it is only with Coleridge that Shakespeare is written and thought about primarily as a poet. It is Coleridge who too lays waste the conception that Shakespeare was a wild , careless genius with little concern for the artistic construction of his work.The second part of the work contains brief selections of criticisms about the individual plays.I found this work provides a sense of the overall development of Shakespeare criticism from its inception to the mid- twentieth century.A valuable work."},{"Title":"Snake Eyes: An Alex Stone Novel","review":"Snake Eyes will rock and roll readers through the soul and controversy of Memphis on a twisting ride of adventures and thrills.

For example, the author says that if you're eating at the house of a friend or family member and they forget to make gluten free accommodations for you that it's no accident. And then she goes on to give several sharp tongued comebacks that you might want to try. I really don't feel as though when people forget to make a dish without wheat that it was malicious, and they truly did just forget. This was not the only instance. There were several other parts of this book where I noticed a defensive attitude, as well demanding. Don't get me wrong, I have definitely had to learn to stand up for myself when asking what ingredients are in a dish in restaurants and other situations. But maybe showing a little grace and less attitude would make situations work out better?"},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"This book is great!

The recipes in it are great, the helpful tips are priceless, and Lowell's sense of humor and understanding is really refreshing. I bought a copy for my grandmother, who at almost 80, has finally acknowledged the extent of how gluten has affected her. I have recommended it to co-workers who are gluten intolerant, and to folks I've encountered who have family members who are celiacs, and need help understanding how to deal with it.

But, until I found this book, I felt a bit lost. The Gluten-Free Bible reads like you're talking to your best friend who just happens to know all you need to know about the GF diet. Finally I have a source that can answer all the little questions that my doctor didn't have the time or experience to answer himself. I recommend this book highly. I think the negative reviews here are a bit silly--no single book is going to be a \\"holy grail\\" of information for Celiacs. This one comes very close, but I'm sure Jax Peters Lowell would advise all her readers to double-check everything and take responsibility for their own health."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"This was a gift to my daughter who has been diagnosed with celiac disease.She says it is a wonderful resource."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"This book really helped me when I was new to Celiac Disease.

Her encouragement and wit helped me to take charge of my condition and my life. I highly recommnend this newer version. I find this book so helpful that I keep it on my sideboard and pick it up from time to time to read and remind myself of coping with the condition of celiac disease.I'm a very sensitive celiac and must guard against cross-contamination. The section of the book that tells the story of getting gluten from kissing was such a help-- I've had this happen with my husband, after he's been unable to stay away the butter cookies at a party. Thanks to Lowell's testament and guidance, I've been able to explain things to my family and to enlist their help in what needs to be done to keep me healthy.The section on other auto-immune diseases is also very helpful.CurtissAnn in OK"},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"Great book!

She mixes facts with humour and manages to make life with celiac disease seem like an adventure, rather than a curse.Not only are the basics here (safe and unsafe foods, related medical problems, internet resources, etc.) but she also deals with the emotional side of celiac disease and its effect on relationships with family and friends. After reading the first chapter, I bought an extra copy for my father, who also has celiac disease.For those who are newly diagnosed, I think that this book is an excellent place to start, and all celiacs can benefit from Jax Peters Lowell's take on the disease."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"I started with Bette Hagman's books and was under-whelmed, to say the least.

I followed her advise, recently and a 5 star, fixed price, 9 course dinner was designed especially around my needs! It was liberating, not to mention one of the most fabulous meals I have ever had. Everyone else had their goat cheese wrapped in a pasta sheet, mine was wrapped in nettle leaves. Everyone else had fancy herbed breads, I had fresh cornbread HOT from the oven. More than a few people asked why I was so \\"special\\" and my husband kept trying to steal my cornbread.You CAN still live with this diagnosis and live quite well, I might add. Jax gives you the tools to do it."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"Jax Lowell knows what it is to be a celiac. She knows how it feels to give up our favorite foods, to be the one who can't eat the stuffing, who can't run out for pizza with the gang from the office, to stand at what she calls \\"the fork in the road\\" and worry you'll never eat or be normal again. Reading this book I felt I was in the hands of a really smart, super positive friend, guiding me, reassuring me, teasing me, challenging me, pointing the way to great food, safe restaurants, support groups, letting me know I'm not crazy and I'm certainly not alone.

No more wheat or gluten---FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!!!! I was devastated. Who could live life like that? But my wonderful, wonderful doctor who happens to be a celiac himself, gave me his own (brand new!) copy of Jax Peters Lowell's just published book, \\"The Gluten-Free Bible\\". I have read it cover to cover ---TWICE! in 8 days. I now know that life without wheat and gluten can be just as satisfying as life with it--even when you go out to eat! It's chock full of great recipes and tips on getting delicious, gluten-free meals at restaurants--in any country!

The Gluten Free Bible is an engaging and instructive book; a worthy successor to 1995's Against the Grain. As the wife of a celiac, I am always looking for current information on the disease; as a former English major, I appreciate good writing. The Gluten Free Bible satisfies on both counts.From laugh-out-loud headings(\\"Fear of Frying\\"), to common sense advice on daily living (\\"discuss, don't demand\\" special requests when dining out), to touching vignettes of her own journey with celiac, Jax packs this latest book with valuable information and sass.Framing her points with deft humor and insight, Jax makes the concept of living with celiac seem somehow less formidable. She understands that, by laughing at fear, one shrinks it to a manageable size."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer. Enjoy!

Exhaustively researched, it contains all the latest information on living gluten free in today's world. Learning how to cope with family holidays, traveling and denial can be overwhelming to a newly diagnosed Celiac, and Jax's new Bible reads as easily as her wonderful novel \\"Mothers\\", and yet informs, reassures and gives us Celiacs the tools we need to make a happy life for ourselves. [...] I credit her with saving my life 8 years ago with \\"Against The Grain\\", and now the \\"Gluten Free Bible\\" with its updated contact lists, travel and restaurant information and just plain encouragement and positive spin will guide the newest generation of Celiacs to good health. We all are immensely indebted to her."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"I don't know if the years that have gone by and the experiences I have had with dealing with other celiacs and the gluten free diet have changed my perspective, but I am underwhelmed with Jax Peters Lowell's new \\"Gluten Free Bible\\", which is a new revision of \\"Against the Grain\\".When my family of four celiacs was first diagnosed, her book \\"Against the Grain\\" offered me a refreshing perspective on how to deal with this condition. At that time I thought that if I could raise my celiac children with her perspective, they would be fine. I thought that her determination and zeal in pursuing special treatment because she wasn't \\"ordinary\\" was admirable.In the \\"Gluten Free Bible\\", Jax falls flat. She sounds too preachy, too whiny, and she deals with some things too superficially to make this book a worthwhile addition to a celiac's library. She goes beyond addressing gluten-free issues to address her concerns with the fat and sugar content of the average American diet, her concerns with pesticides and chemicals, and her preoccupation with the macrobiotic food fad. This ends up leaving the original portions of \\"Against the Grain\\" with less sparkle, panache, and flair.In my opinion, eating the toppings off of canapes and the innards from sandwiches and trying to avoid eating the cheesecake crust are just not reasonable activities that even a starving celiac should be engaging in. A much better strategy for a celiac to use when out on the town is the boy scout mantra of \\"be prepared\\". I encountered many factual inaccuracies in the Gluten Free Bible that may be of great concern to celiacs. Products long known to be gluten free, such as Tootsie Rolls, Butterball turkeys, Starbucks coffee, and medications like Lipitor and Zoloft are described in the book as being unsafe for a celiac to consume.Some of the basic information in her resource pages at the back of the book is just simply wrong. I found spelling errors here and there. I have to wonder about just how much of a rush the author and publishers were in to get this on bookstore shelves. I was disappointed with her treatment of celiac disease and communion, particularly Catholic communion. While she seems to be more aware of cross contamination issues in this book than in Against the Grain, she is still writing about removing the contents of a \\"normal\\" sandwich and putting it between two slices of gluten free bread and eating it -- if you are not \\"too sensitive\\".She writes that she expects that copies of this book will be as well-worn and dog-eared and beloved to celiacs as \\"Against the Grain\\". I think not. I think my copy will end up in the round file. Newly diagnosed celiac patients who are looking for a good book about the gluten-free diet should try Shelley Case's book \\"The Gluten-Free Diet\\" or \\"Wheat Free, Worry Free\\" by Danna Korn."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free."},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"Whether this book is worth reading depends on what you are looking for.Jax Lowell is clearly a talented and enthusiastic writer who can make you feel upbeat about a gluten-free diet. If you want a \\"feel-good\\" experience or a mood-booster, this book could be the one.This update of her earlier book, however, still recommends practices that are dangerous for celiacs, such as removing sandwich fillings from between gluten bread and putting it between your own gluten-free bread. To the general public, this may sound a reasonable survival strategy, but research studies are consistently showing that even minute amounts of cross-contamination can keep the autoimmune response of celiac active and damaging the intestines. Even an amount of gluten so small as 1mg/day has caused continuing damage, according to one study.Instead of purchasing the \\"Gluten Free Bible\\", money would be better spent on: Danna Korn's \\"Wheat-Free, Worry-Free: The Art of Happy, Healthy Gluten-Free Living\\" or Shelly Case's \\"Gluten-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Resource Guide\\".

I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list.

It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children.

Tania Pineo"},{"Title":"The Gluten-Free Bible: The Thoroughly Indispensable Guide to Negotiating Life without Wheat","review":"Jax writes here as well as she does in her novel. Her anecdotes were vivid and lively. The image of her carrying a tiny spoon in her purse to avoid cross-contamination at buffets had me laughing out loud!Jax has chutzpah and charm when it comes to talking to waiters, no doubt about THAT! I can see her fixing her eye on a maitre'd and sweeping him along in her personal aura into complying with her requests. A breezy, easy style of floating into rooms and rising above all the dreaded gluten molecules makes a wheat-free life easier, no doubt about that, either.Unfortunately, this book seems to have been rushed to publication to take advantage of the new market of gluten-free eaters since popular magazines (Readers Digest, Self, Parents) began reporting on celiac disease last year. Product lists have inaccurate information about whether or not a product is gluten-free. This is dismaying in a \\"Bible\\" - what happened? Are these errors that slipped past the fact-checkers or the proof-readers at the publishers? Or did the author not think to update all her information? Better to contact the food manufacturers directly or consult regularly updated lists, such as the quarterly GF product list that the celiac folk at Delphi Forums produce as a community than to rely on this part of her book.If the easy-to-update-and-verify-information such as the product lists can't be relied on, it casts doubt on how well and how accurately any medical information has been reported, at least for me.I cherish Jax's joix de vivre, I admire her attitude - and I trust she would have written a much better book if it were grounded in solid information and more care were taken in this update."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"Nella Bielski's new novel will be noted for its ingenious plotting, concision of style, and use of historical scenes. But just as a life isn't a only series of discrete events but also a not completely comprehended network of perceptions, notions and emotions, this novel adds up to much more than its wonderfully handled novelistic elements. In this story, the historical and political forces of Europe, mainly during World War II, play upon the characters, moving them about; the characters push back with what is in their nature. It is their natures that are inevitable, not their fates. The same holds true for the voice telling this story. It withholds from us the too easy gratifications of character analysis and categorization; it offers the more rich pleasures of the feeling of experience, with its limitations and exertions. I approached this novel mainly because John Berger co-translated it -- and if you're familiar with his remarkable essays and novels, you'll also enjoy sensing his hand at work here."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"This novel is beautifully done. I immediately read it twice through. It's short and slightly elliptical. The first main character is a loyal German Army officer who fought in WW I and comes to hate and fear the Nazis. The second main character is a Ukranian pediatrician who was born in the old regime and lives through the 1917 revolution, its forward looking first fifteen years and then the repressions and horrors of the Stalin years. None of the above, however, really tells you what the novel is about because it's about the interior as well as the exterior life of the main characters."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"As if written by a beautiful butterfly enticing the reader by sensing the tale through a veil of history, humanity and inference. Three lives until the end when the force of generations becomes clear and affecting."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"This book strikes me as having been a first draft or proposal, but which somehow wound up as a finished product. I bought the book because I was taken in by a rather ambiguous blurb - allegedly by \\"John LeCarre\\" - on the dust jacket. I should have known better.Despite the positive reputations of the book's two (why two?) translators, I found the translation from the French - or whatever language the book was written in - to be severely deficient. It detracted from the already thin value of the novel itself.- Russian, apparently author Nella Bielski's native tongue, does not have the Latin letter \\"H\\", which is why, for example, in Russian the name Hitler would be given as Gitler. So, when we see in the book a German place called \\"Schansengof\\" it should be obvious that the \\"g\\" in that word was the Russian author's way of transliterating the German letter \\"h\\"; it should be \\"Schansenhof.\\" What professional interpreter(s) would not know this? Have they not ever been to France's next door neighbor?- The Russian term \\"vnuchka\\" in the book is translated as \\"little daughter\\". In fact, the word means granddaughter.- At one point a girl refers to her grandfather, grandmother, and \\"Babushka.\\" To a reader who doesn't know any Russian it makes it seem as if there are three people being referred to; actually Babushka is just the Russian word for grandmother. Is the average reader supposed to know this? How about the translators?- Why do he translators use the French spelling of a Russian name. The name of the hospital is given in the book as the \\"Botkine\\", whereas in reality it's Botkin in both in Russian and in English.With all due respect to the author, the book is just not edited or finished properly."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"This is beautifully written but this does not make up for the total absence of a story. Three characters in war and how their lives, interact. Reads like a series of notes rather than a completed work. If it is trying to convey the horror of war it fails. Deeply deeply disappointing - I feel I have wasted my time and been cheated."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"I try to read every WW2 era novel I can get my hands on, particulartly those from non-american viewpoints. This means I read action-thriller, non-fiction, plain fiction, etc. I am very pleased when a book includes much more than just battle scences and international intrigue. This novel however did not seem to be what it claimed in the dust jacket.Bielski's writing style is a bit different than some may be used to, but that did not necessarily take away from a wonderful and exciting storyline -- for the first half of the book. After that, it seems like she forgets why she was originally writing the story and goes off talking about something completely unrelated. This would have made sense if the storylines had been brought together at some point, but they were not.No mention of the characters or events from the first half of the book until the final 3 or 4 pages; and then it seems almost as an afterthought, as if trying to tie up loose ends. The end result left me with too many unanswered questions, and really no desire to see them answered by this writer.If you like artsy books that lead to nowhere, then this is for you. This story could have easily been done in any other year other than the year '42, and the reader would walk away feeling the same exact way."},{"Title":"The Year Is '42: A Novel","review":"I had high expectations for this novel. In a way, this novel works from an implied starting point, where two protagonists intersect. The body of events are a long string of occurences, set in 3 sections, which trace the intricate multiplicities that inform the place and time for events. The event itself, 2 characters meeting, is uneventful and not significant. Could it be just another event setting the table for the future? The effect is to foreground the lineage that informs each moment in our lives. The flurry of events are barely noticable to the characters, as they are to our lives. I give it 3 stars as the author fails to offer any interpretation regarding the significance of the events."},{"Title":"The Cowboy Cookbook","review":"Verne Carlson was not, strictly speaking, a cowboy. He was a well-known and respected cameraman in Hollywood, and his books on lighting and lenses are collectible masterworks.This book, too is collectible, and should be selling for a lot more than it is. Verne was an Old West buff - his love of food and his interest in the Old West led him to collect various recipes and compile them into a book that is one of the best of its kind.I have personally seen old saddlebums near tears while reading some of the recipes that Verne included in this book: \\"Why, that's jest like mah daddy's recipe!\\"I can't recommend this book enough, if you love campfire cooking, or even the semblance of cowboy cuisine (isn't *that* a malaprop?).Buy it now for a song, and enjoy it for a long time... you'll be carrying on a great tradition - and eating well!"},{"Title":"The Cowboy Cookbook","review":"I tried some of the recipes in the book and they were great.

The method Ruhlman uses here is similar to the two later efforts; he spends the same amount of time as his subjects at their craft. In this case, that means he is present at University School, a boys only school in the Cleveland , OH area, from just prior to first class, day one, through graduation and a faculty party afterwards.The difference in his approach in this effort is the lack of infiltration. Mr. Ruhlman is not posing as a student, or a faculty member; he has the Headmaster Richard Hawley's permission to wander as he wish, taking notes, asking questions, observing. This is completely different than the efforts Ruhlman takes to retain his anonymity from his subjects in &quot;The Making of a Chef,&quot; and the first section of &quot;The Soul of a Chef.&quot; One cannot help but wonder if a layer of two of self-consciousness wouldn't have been removed from some of the students and/or faculty members throughout if they were unaware of his intentions.Another similarity is the writing itself; Ruhlman does a great job of taking real people and developing them as fully three dimensional characters throughout his books. We see development in students, faculty, and the headmaster as well as observations by the author himself which show his developing ideas regarding his topic. Through his eyes, Ruhlman makes these people become ones that you care about; you want to know what has happened to them since graduation day in the same sort of detail that he has given you with this school year.In situations where there are large issues at the school, the problems are shown by every conceivable angle; student, faculty, parents, headmaster and occasionally his own thoughts. Philosophy and morality take up a great deal of time at the school. Some of the topics, as well as smaller issues amongst individuals, are followed throughout the book as they proceed and develop through the year.The one problem I had was a slight lack of confidence Mr. Ruhlman had in his own writing sporadically throughout the book. He would follow up a well written paragraph with a blunt recap as if he felt he was perhaps too subtle in his descriptions. The full text of the book is reminiscent of this as well as we get 18 chapters of the school year, with wonderful descriptions of the differences between Single Sex and Co-Educational school systems. This is followed up by an explanational 19th chapter that wraps up his opinions on the topic.This problem was a minor one however when compared to the lyrical writing, &quot;character&quot; development and subtle observations spread throughout the book.3.5 Stars."},{"Title":"Boys Themselves: A Return to Single-Sex Education","review":"Ruhlman brings the complexities of prep school to life in a manner in which few writers have accomplished. I both attended and have worked within some of the country's most notable prep schools. After my first year as an Upper School Head, I sat down one day and read the book cover to cover. Ruhlman's protrait of the teachers and students is fascinating. He takes the time to develop characters, especailly the indefteabable head of school, Richard Hawley. Ruhlman goes beyond just reporting what he sees. He engages himself and others in a dialgue that constantly questions the ethos of the school. In one interesting scence, he describes how a senior speech got out of control. Ruhlman gives us the fallout from this display of &quot;entitlement disorder&quot; from all the angles; students, teachers and administrators. Ruhlman also takes the time to venture into the debate over single-sex education. He handles this challenge with grace. However, for me this book was more like an ethnography of a school. Ruhlman provides the reader with a fascinating behind the scences account of a most interesting school. The appeal of this book should be wider than prep school audieance. However, if you are interested in independent school education this is a must read. Bravo to Ruhlman for doing justice to such a complex subject."},{"Title":"Boys Themselves: A Return to Single-Sex Education","review":"In 1993-94, Ruhlman returned to his alma mater, University School in Cleveland, to explore the workings of an all-boys school and study its headmaster, the famously idiosyncratic Rick Hawley. In this context, I'd be hard-pressed to outline all my issues with Ruhlman's project, but his \\"fly on the wall\\" presentation of teachers and classes is consistently evocative--real, familiar, and true to the private school life I experience as a private school teacher. However, Ruhlman stumbles as he explains. When he tries to make something of his observations--to comment on what's distinctive about boys schools or what Rick Hawley represents or what anything adds-up to--he teeters on rationalization. If, as he says in the book, Ruhlman wanted his readers to \\"fulfill\\" the \\"dramas\\" he presented, he should have let them. Better yet, he might have left this task to someone who was not an alum of the school."},{"Title":"Boys Themselves: A Return to Single-Sex Education","review":"I am a University School alumnus and attended the school when many of the people described in this book (including Richard Hawley) were there. Ruhlman has definitely caputured the ethos of the place. I question, though, whether the portrait makes a compelling case for boys' schools. In reading the book, I was reminded of undercurrents of intolerance and &quot;group thinking&quot; that may be part of all adolescents but which seem particularly pronounced when boys are amongst themselves. The book also reminded me of how a provincial, almost smug muscular Episcopalianism is the school's unofficial culture (the school is theoretically non-sectarian). While these negatives came out, there was nothing presented that suggested anything positive about an all-male environment. We are given a case study with little analysis of the importance of the all male culture. As a result, one sees the merits of prep-school, i.e. resources, small classes and attentive faculty, but is left with no sense of why being all male is relevant. And one does see some demerits of not having a coed school."},{"Title":"The New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs: English Standard Version (Premium Black Bonded Leather, Red Letter Text)","review":"The New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs is exactly what I needed for evening devotions and as a travel book, small enough to be unobtrusive but containing just what I use for my devotions: New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs.

I expected to be amazed and inspired at what architects and designers have done to the old barns but this book left me confused and disappointed. But if you are looking for a book to occupy your coffee table, at the bottom, then this is the book for you. I felt cheated because it lacked the overall quality and professionalism expected in a design book. It seems like this book was hastily put together with limited resources and wasn't carefully edited. For example several captions of the pictures are misplaced or don't correspond to any picture shown on the facing pages. The books title is, Old Barns-New Homes: A Showcase of Architectural Conversions. So why is there an entire chapter about new construction (Chapter 6)? The only thing they converted was a new metal warehouse into a house. About half of the pictures are worth printing and the rest of them are dark, grainy, reused or just plain confusing. I'd expect old before pictures to be faulty but the after pictures should be clear and sharp. Cropping out a portion of previously used picture, then blowing it up to a bigger grainy picture and the caption tells me to see the details left me feeling cheated. Or even the \\"cut and paste\\" picture on pg 108 looks cheap, what no photo-stitch? Confused about picture on page 19? Turn the book sideways."},{"Title":"Old Barns - New Homes: A Showcase Of Architectural Conversions","review":"I must confess that I have always harbored a deep love of barns; maybe it simply out of a longing for a simpler time, and all that farms and their barns represent, or maybe because I am a habitual packrat and I'd love to have all that storage! Regardless of the reason, when I saw this book as soon-to-be-released, I got in touch with the publisher and was able to see an advance copy. The photographs took my breath away, and the wide array of barns and geographical regions of the USA that it showcased really drove home that these historic buildings not only need to be preserved, but that in doing so, we can truly enrich our architectural lexicon. It features every kind of barn known to man, from round barns and dairy barns to onion and tobacco barns, all of which have been loving reclaimed and restored into warm and inviting spaces for a new generation. This book should not only graxe your coffee table, it should be read cover to cover by anybody with a love for historic structures and Americana."},{"Title":"Old Barns - New Homes: A Showcase Of Architectural Conversions","review":"I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Forms Of Devotion","review":"It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, &quot;Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)&quot; Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an &quot;easy&quot; book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as &quot;electric&quot;--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten."},{"Title":"Forms Of Devotion","review":"Diane Schoemperlen said she found inspiration for this book when her young son asked her how come her books never have any pictures. She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy. The results are stories that are compelling on their own but are perfectly enhanced by the pictures put in them. A great gift or coffee table book to be flipped through again and again."},{"Title":"Forms Of Devotion","review":"After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing."},{"Title":"Forms Of Devotion","review":"I found out about this author while reading a collection of shorts stories from 1998 with a forward from Garrison Keillor.

I tried the CD for two weeks, hoping that it would get better and thinking that maybe it was just me not being well prepared, but let me tell you, it did not improve during those two weeks. I just got very frustrated each time I tried a test. Thank god the official Exam Master website has a 30 day money back guarantee. I returned that baby far before the 30 days were up.

We become increasingly comfortable as well as increasingly alienated. Our planet is at risk.Young seeks to address the crises of our time by attempting to trace the history of our understanding of and relationship to the sacred starting with what we observe in the apes and stopping at ancient Greece. I'm inclined to label it essentially a work in anthropology.If I've understood him correctly, the crux of the theory is this. To the primitive mind, the fascinating encounter with the transcendent that he calls 'sacred' is essentially violent and dangerous. The two points at which we routinely encounter the sacred are war and sex. He would say that sex is analogous to war. We seek through both an encounter with the divine. When we open ourselves to the divine without proper ritual, it is destructive to society. Marriage and organized religion both sit uneasily with us and serve as valves which admit enough sacredness to assuage our longing, but permit it only within well-defined constraints. Without an effective religion, the male is prone to fulfill his needs outside the legal boundaries and explode into rampant violence. However, in modern times, the effectiveness of religion has been severely compromised by the scientific mind, and the leakage is seen both in the great wars of the 20th Century, as well as in the pleasure we take at ravaging the environment, which we enjoy for the same reasons we enjoy rape.His work is an attempt to understand and address where we're at by tracing how we got here."},{"Title":"Your Child: What Every Parent Needs to Know","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this book.

However, though you may call me old-fashioned, I still believe there is educational value to reading. And the book is educational. For openers, it provides us a picture of the world in which Dickens lived. It isn't a very attractive picture, but it is probably an accurate one. The city of Coketown was dirty; its inhabitants breathed polluted air; they struggled to make ends meet. There were a few exceptions among the upper echelon, like Bounderby who owned a country home to which he could retreat. But for the most part, the citizens of Coketown were trapped in a day-to-day mundane existence that didn't offer many bright spots. There's no way I would want to trade places.The book is also revealing in other ways. We learn of the class structures of Dickens' day. We learn of the silly pretensions and the airs people of the upper class put on. Morality and integrity seem mostly limited to the lower class, particularly the circus. Dickens gives us a picture of education that is dreary, directed at the head and away from the heart. The carrying out of justice seems somewhat elusive. In the words of Stephen Blackpool, \\"its all a muddle.\\" This could be a summary of the times. Things do seem to be pretty messed up.Still, the book has its appeal. I think for me, the best part was the descriptions of the characters. They definitely weren't complex or sophisticated. On the contrary, they were almost too obvious in their representation of the roles they played. They remind me of facades of a building on a movie set. Bounderby is constantly bragging that he \\"came from a ditch.\\" His character reminds me of so many people who thrive on a sense of their own importance. Tom was a whiner--please, spare me the privileged child who is never satisfied and always looking to be bailed out. Louisa needed to get some gumption and stop doing everything according to the book. For Pete's sakes, forget your upbringing and get a life! Sissy was fun; and Rachael was admirable. Stephen Blackpool got quite a bit of ink devoted to him. Had his character had a better command of the English language we might actually have been able to understand what he was saying. Oh, well. The best characters, without a doubt, were Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer. Mrs. Sparsit gets the Oscar for best female in a comedy role; Bitzer for the character everyone loves to hate. The circus people deserve at least a mention; they definitely add some color to the novel.So, no, its not a must-read, in my opinion. But I've definitely read a lot worse. You must take fair warning, though. Nearly everyone I know has to power through at least the first half of the book. Eventually it gains some momentum, and you'll probably want to finish it.

Someone somewhere might actually be impressed."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Pretty much, the beginning and the middle of this book is pretty dull. The thing that really saves it towards the middle. So I would not read this book if you are looking for something gripping or that will really make you eager to find out what is going to happen next. The book is simply put a drama with no positive turning points until the end. The ending of a book is really inportant to me. This book has a good ending , so that raises the from my point of view.The book was kind of hard to follow for me. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that there are too many characters. There is at least twenty. Some of these characters are Louisa, Mr. Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind, Sissy Jupe, and Stephen Blackpool. Stephen Blackpool's story was very sad and really affected my emotions as I read it. I also felt that Sissy Jupe went through a lot but stayed strong through her troubles.The basic storyline is this: Mr. Gradgrind opens a private school that teaches his philosophy: facts only! He is the father of Tom and Louisa. Louisa has been preplanned to marry Mr. Bounderby, a banker that is twice her age. She does not like this.This book also does not teach good morals and the reading level is pretty high. I would say that anyone who reads this book should be at least 15 years old. I pretty much have mixed feelings for this book."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing.

If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly.

The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"this book is hard to understand and boring"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is a book written in older Brittish convention style. The way this story was written I could hardly understand,because I'am not used to reading the older english version.A book like this one would be for someone who can definitly read,and understand almost every form of writing. It's mainly about innocent lives simply being tooken away.This included family, adults, and children,knowing at that time age didn't matter.If you were one of killer's victoms ,most likely you would lose your life.That is what made it so hard for many people to calmly contiue on with thier lives',because they were worried about their safty.Just letting you know, I would not recommend reading this book ,If you're someone like me who dosn't understand the old english version used in this text.This story included characters such as Mr.Marmel,the Welp,Mr.Grandgrind,Hart House, Mrs. Pegler and Rachel.They are all involved in those particular pressures of life in that city.

For the best critique of Dickens, read &quot;Against Nature&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority.

Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, \\"Hard Times\\" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper \\"Household Words.\\" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book at times was challenging to read due to its drab setting (Victorian England) and heavy (read: depressing) subject matter, but its clear message and singularity of theme helped keep me focused: all work and no play makes Jack (or in this case, the Gradgrind children) a dull boy. All in all, an excellent and convincing criticism of Utilitarianism. The characters were well developed and evoked genuine feeling, although ultimately you either hate or feel sorry for all of them. Poor Louisa was piteous, having bypassed childhood and forgone love to slavishly follow her father's iron rule; while Josiah Bounderby elicited the kind of loathing one has for a sleazy politician, the way he concealed his privileged background in order to appear self-made and humble.Despite being almost 150 years old, this tale wasn't dated one bit, and its lessons are appropriate today along the lines of &quot;stop and smell the roses.&quot; However, its teachings are not of the inspirational sort, and to read this I would suggest being free from distractions (you will need to concentrate to get through some of the slower parts), and keeping some sort of emotional pick-me-up nearby afterwards. Lastly, unlike some reviews I have seen, I thought it was seamless, despite its being published in installments."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Although critics dislike Dickens' novels for their twisted, drawn-out plots and his maddening penchant for creating soap-operas in the midst of otherwise realistic plots, these faults must be considered in light of the genre that Dickens wrote for: the magazine serial. Even if one is not fond of the structure of Hard Times, a closer example of the story as a period piece crafted to satisfy the tawdry tastes of the rag-reading public exposes a masterpiece of suspense and morality. A very important work and worth reading with or without this context."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I think everyone can agree right from the start that \\"Hard Times\\" is not Charles Dickens's greatest work. It is certainly nothing compared to works of a similar length, such as \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" or \\"Great Expectations.\\" But even Dicken's lesser works are gems, although a bit less refined.The tale spreads across three households, the upright and serious Gradgrind family, the wealthy blowhard Joseph Bounderby of Coketown, and the dismal, poverty stricken Stephen Blackpool and his wretched, drunken wife. Gradgrind is all facts, and raises his children to be without imagination or wonder. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed self-made man is all appearances, having dragged himself out of the gutter into station. Blackpool is all honesty, unable to commit even the smallest wrong that would bring his own happiness.Into this mix are thrown two strays, the orphaned but lighthearted Sissy Jupe and the immoral and charismatic James Harthouse. They are the catalyst for the downfall of the orderly lives built by Gradgrind and Bounderby, and the further descent of Blackpool. No good deed goes unpunished in \\"Hard Times,\\" but neither does an ill deed go rewarded.Dickens's shortest novel, \\"Hard Times\\" is only a small investment of time to spend with such rich characters. Lacking the light-hearted balance from his longer novels, the short length is a relief as too much more dreariness could be an undoing. At the same time, a deeper exploration of the lives and philosophies of the storyline would have made for a richer experience."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"It is unfortunate that HARD TIMES by Charles Dickens is not usually read outside the classroom. It is an unforgettable glimpse of an age that did not prize the worth of the individual over a collective society--sort of like today's emphasis on the same. What stamps HARD TIMES as the classic that it is is Dickens' continual focus on the rights of the individual and his championing of anti-child labor laws. In an age that routinely crushed individuals in the grinding gears of a society that was hell-bent on automating the factory system, it was only lone voices like Charles Dickens who, in his novels, cried out to stop the madness. In HARD TIMES, Dickens takes a savagely satirical poke at a then popular system of thought: utilitarianism, a philosophy which saw men and children as interchangeable cogs in a machine that demanded that all facets of life and output be reduced to facts, numbers, and quantifiable data. Thomas Gradgrind opens the novel by insisting that the students in his school be just like Officer Joe Friday from &quot;Dragnet&quot; fame: give me the facts, and only the facts. Those who can deliver advance. Those who cannot get routinely squashed flat. Josiah Bounderby is the villain as he represents the ultimate in a selfishness and fact-centeredness way of life. As typical of Dickens, there is a vast assortment of subplots that he manages to tie neatly together by the closing pages. What stamps HARD TIMES as relevant in this or any future age is Dickens' insistance that, regardless of technological advances, the individual will always matter. HARD TIMES says this as well as any other book."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times feels like a book that Dickens did not polish nearly as much as the many classics associated with his name. It's the story of the unhappy lives of two children of a father who raised them to speak and appreciate only &quot;facts.&quot; Imagination, fantasy, passion, and the like were all forbidden in their household.Their lives are unhappy, as you'd expect. But they also lack much narrative interest. The usual twists and turns of fate that Dickens invests into his characters' lives are mostly absent. As a result the book drags on. Hard Times also lacks the humor found in other Dickens books, his pithy observations of different persona of his time. So, in reading the uninspiring narrative, you find yourself wishing for something, anything of the old Dickensian magic. Alas, it does not show up.If you have other Dickens titles you're set on reading, read them first. You're likely to enjoy them more."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is a fantastic account of how social history intemingles with economic and politcal history as Dickens is a noted writer for the politcal atmostphere of Victorian Britain. This book takes a hard shot at Utilitarinism and with good reason. The imagery and description in this book are simply brillant. A definate read if you want a look at how it was in the Victorian Era."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This is a totally honest book of life between the lower and upper class. Having lived in the United Kingdom for more than 4 years, I truly appreciate Dicken's description of the physical environements of Coketown. It has so much resemblance of present day London's buildings, especially with regards to the North and South part of the city from Zone two onwards, except for the trailing serpents of smoke.As to the characters so vividly presented and the conversations that were exchanged between them in the course of the narration, I just enjoy the satire on fat old Bounderby, the game being turned upon the Gradgrinds, I think mainly to shame Mr old Tom Gradgrind for his stiff-necked beliefs in 'hard facts'. The consoling fact is he did learnt his lessons.Poor Mrs Gradgrind. It was a pity that she had to be killed off so soon in the story. If she had been alive till the end, what would she say to her daughter's divorce, her son's connection with the bank robbery and Bounderby big fat lies? Probably nothing but something she would never hear the last of!I don't know much on how to comment with a literature eye, but I think Dickens did write pretty well here. I would not hesitate to read it again but since I still have a lot of other books to peruse, I may just as well skip this second reading till later..."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"While this is certainly one of Dickens' shorter novels, that does not stop me from considering it an exquisite masterpiece. In all honesty &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is full of chilling passages and convincing characters such as Thomas and Louisa Gradgrind. There is not one single dull moment. Also, every chapter is full of striking images. In addition, the suspense and dramatic irony are well placed. To be sure, many of Dickens' full length books such as &quot;Dombey &amp; Son&quot; (1848) and &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853)are exquisite as well. But, don't let the thin length of &quot;Hard Times&quot; fool you. It is a masterpiece and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I initially lamented the fact that Hard Times was assigned to me in my British lit. class. I had read some of Dickens's melodramas like A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and enjoyed them, but everything I heard about Hard Times said this was nothing like those. This was supposedly just strictly social commentary. My interpretation of that: BORING.But then I read it.Hard Times isn't like Dickens's other novels, but I don't think that it has any less heart than those masterpieces. In fact, Dickens endured himself much further to me with this novel as he has his characters perform Thomas Carlyle's enduring philosophy.The novel follows the Gradgrind family who is raised adhering to FACTS and living in a society which worships the manufacturing machine. As the novel progresses, connections are made and broken, and the characters come to the realization that there is much more to reality than the material facts.Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society (this novel feels really modern), and the underlying philosophy is one which is so needed in our post-modern world. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"\\"Hard Times\\" belongs to the second half of Dickens's writing career, in which his work becomes rather more somber and, by common critical assent, more mature and satisfying. Personally, I prefer his earlier work and his very first novel, \\"Pickwick Papers\\", is to my mind his greatest. Surprisingly, \\"Hard Times\\", despite its title and reputation, contains some brilliant flashes of Dickens humour, especially in the earlier part. The descriptions of Bounderby and Gradgrind, and the early dialogue with the circus folk, are genuinely hilarious.This is Dickens's shortest novel, about a third of the length of each of his previous four. Themes, subplots and characters are introduced without being fully explored. The author was perhaps feeling the constraints of writing in installments for a periodical, although he was well used to doing that. This relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.There are the large dollops of Victorian melodrama and the reliance on unlikely coincidences that mar much of Dickens's work. Also the usual tendency for characters to become caricatures and to have names that are a little too apt (a teacher called Mr. McChoakumchild?).The respected critic F.R. Leavis considered \\"Hard Times\\" to be Dickens's masterpiece and \\"only serious work of art\\". This seems to me wildly wrong, but such an extreme opinion may prompt you to read the book, just so that you can form your own opinion.I read it because I had just finished \\"The Jungle\\" by Upton Sinclair, which deals with the plight of Chicago factory workers, and I wanted to compare the two. Sinclair's book has greater immediacy. It takes you much closer to the suffering of the workers. In the Dickens novel, the mill workers and their plight are distanced; they are relegated to being the background to a family drama, which is what really interests the author. A third, and still greater work, that examines the same themes, is Zola's \\"Germinal\\". I recommend all three. Together, they give real insight into the social conditions that led to the proletarian political and revolutionary movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens creates a novel that virtually revolutionizes literature of the 1800's. At a time where most writers wrote in a stuffy prose full of unrealities and a jaded outlook, Dickens dares to tell with honesty what he sees through his window.Hard Times has yet a misleading title. It gives one ideas of harshness, depression, poverty, and social decline--although the actual reality of then-London, still not something you would choose to read. However, Hard Times has as much depression and poverty as any of Dickens' other works. It is just in this case that Dickens chooses to remind the world that in the deepest despair there is beauty yet to be seen.Dickens was a strange author. In his supposedly inspiring books, you get an overdose of sadness, and in his depressing books, you find beauty. It is this case with Hard Times.It is a poor, honest man's search for justice in a world where only the rich have merit. It is a girl's search for true love while battling the arranged marriage for money. And lastly, a woman's search for recognition against her favored, yet dishonest brother. It is these searches that at last come together and become fufilled. And, while at the same time telling a captivating story, it comments on the then--and still now--presence of greed and total dishonesty one has to go through for money.The title of this review sums up Hard Times. Its beauty comes from the pure searches for truth, the sorrow comes from the evil the characters most overcome to get there, and the honesty is both the truth with which Dickens portrays life and the the overwhelming truth that these protaganists create.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych. ProfessorGeorgetown University, Johns Hopkins Inst."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Always concerned with issues of class, social injustice, and employment, Dickens shows in Hard Times, written in 1854, a broader concern with the philosophies and economic movements which underlie those issues. Three parallel story lines reflect a broad cross-section of society and its thinking.Mr. Thomas Gradgrind runs a school founded upon the principles of rationalism, a belief in the importance of facts, the antithesis of romantic \\"fancy\\" and imagination. Basically a good man, he denies the importance of emotion--for himself, his children, and his students. Only Student #20, Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus clown, fails to conform to his notions, and in a hilarious, satiric scene at the beginning of the novel, Dickens shows the absurdity of Gradgrind's teachings.Gradgrind's friend, Mr. Bounderby, is a banker and factory owner, aged fifty, who claims to have risen from the gutter to his present lofty position through hard work. Bounderby treats the employees of his Coketown factory as machines, rather than as humans, and his eventual marriage to the teenaged Louisa Gradgrind is seen by both as a marriage of \\"tangible fact,\\" having nothing to do with affection.The third story line involves Stephen Blackpool, a worker in Bounderby's factory, trapped in a marriage to an alcoholic who periodically appears and extorts money from him. Stephen is in love with Rachael, an adoring factory worker, but his appeal to Bounderby for help in ending his marriage is met with cold, rational pronouncements. Shortly after, Bounderby fires Stephen \\"for a novelty,\\" forcing him to seek employment elsewhere.As the story lines overlap and intersect, often with consummate irony, Dickens keeps a light enough hand to prevent the story from becoming a polemic, though his criticism of hypocrisy, corruption, and \\"progress\\" at the expense of humanity is clear. His humor, often dark, keeps the plot moving, and several of his characters, which are often caricatures, do grow and change. Characteristically, Dickens uses names symbolically-Gradgrind grinds the emotions from his graduates, hires Mr. M'Choakumchild as a teacher, and lives at Stone Lodge. Mr. Bounderby proves to be a bounder. Some of the circus performers, like Sissy, live at Pegasus Arms.The dramatic conclusion, which involves the pursuit of an innocent character widely believed to have committed a robbery, draws all the themes together, showing the parallels, contrasts, and ironies which connect these characters, regardless of their social level. Less epic in plot than some of Dickens's other novels, Hard Times provides an intimate look at a changing economy and an important commentary on the philosophies of the times.

Dickens.There's no way that any self-respecting booklover, as I style myself to be, can take a Charles Dicken's novel and tell you that it's &lt;shudder> boring, or even not all that great. Unless the book lover in question happens to be a particularly honest one who doesn't mind the Dicken's squad clicking \\"unhelpful\\" over and over again...Let's proceed.Hard Times begins promisingly, as it slams the education system about as hard as I've ever seen (and almost as hard as it deserves), as teachers Gradgrind and Choakumchild (yeah, I know) try to throttle the imaginations of their charges and fill them instead with sand-dry \\"Facts.\\" But then, Hard Times loses the trail of its narrative, following one of the school kids for a while, then another couple of kids, then another character, then another.... It skips around so often for so long, introducing one character or another (and pausing for social commentary) that it seems as though it might never develop a plot.Near the end, it does take on a plot utilizing all of its developed characters, and the energy of the novel picks up considerably, but less-hearty readers will likely have given up long before then. One of the current \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" for this novel currently states: \\"[The] relative brevity, together with the youth of some of the central characters, make this book a good introduction to Dickens for young readers.\\" No, no, no. A million times no! It's not that the novel is awful--it's decent, despite the dismal pacing of the first three quarters, and some of the comedy is gold (Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is precious!)--but this is *not* a good novel for children, most of whom won't have had enough experience with real-life Bounderbys or perspective on formal education to fully enjoy the satire. This is not the novel to use as an introduction to Dickens for just about anyone, let alone a young reader.Unless, of course, you have sympathy with M. Choakumchild's pedagogical philosophy.In the hands of a child, this novel will likely stifle any appreciation for classic literature, Charles Dickens, and perhaps reading, itself, that might otherwise develop. Start with A Christmas Carol--it has ghosts--and then move on to A Tale of Two Cities--all around better book (and it has decapitations!). Hard Times is for mature, well-read individuals who want to see \\"what else Charles Dickens wrote.\\"A decent novel with some genuinely great moments, but on the whole fairly dry. As with medication, a blessing and a boon to mankind, it's best to keep this out of the reach of young children."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"HARD TIMES has its own special place in world literature, even as it does in Dickens's own oeuvre. Its brevity contrasts with the longer works for which Dickens is more famous, and its satiric skewering of rampant capitalism leaves an imprint on the reader's mind not soon forgotten.Dickens holds up Thomas Gradgrind for us, Sir, a singular member of the industrial community of \\"Coketown,\\" a man who is so obsessed with Facts that he never allows his children to Feel. They are to \\"discard the word Fancy altogether.\\" To ensure this strict materialistic philosophy, the children are taught by a schoolmaster named \\"McChoakumchild.\\" In Gradgrind's friend Josiah Bounderby Dickens gives us possibly the most layered, complete and abhorrent hypocrite in all of English literature. Moliere's Tartuffe is the height of sincerity compared with Bounderby, who seems really to have convinced himself of his own myth after many years of browbeating others with his pompous false modesty. The fact that he is a factory owner who mercilessly exploits his workers only makes him the less endearing. And this is the man Tom Gradgrind gives his daughter to in marriage!The book's narrator clearly distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys, all in an effective effort to show that humans need to appreciate sentiment and sympathy much more than they need to worship dollars and cents. In 1854 HARD TIMES showed the triumphalist British industrialists their dark side. It stands today as a treasured statement against cost-benefit ratios and anti-intellectualism in a world where CEOs \\"earn\\" $10 million bonuses the same week 4,000 workers lose their jobs. It will stand tomorrow anywhere people are scorned for showing their feelings, beaten down in body and spirit, or victimized by rank injustice."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This novel, like much of Dickens, is hard to pin down in a concise statement as to what exactly it's about. Dickens is often accused, by his critics, of being a sentimentalist and two-dimensional character scrawler. This judgment, I would submit, is quite correct as far as it goes. But the greatness of Dickens, it seems to me, is that each one of his novels conveys a feeling, envisions a world, that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This is especially true of Hard Times.The most common interpretation of the book is that it is anti-utilitarian. This take on the novel is quite true, to an extent, but to say that this stance constitutes all that the book concerns is, in itself, a utilitarian interpretation! It reduces the book to a fictionalised polemic. And the book is surely far more than that!There are always, in Dickens's works, depths opening up amidst the simple plots and the simplified (and whimsically named) characters that bring one to a stop. When Louisa finds out from her brother Tom that Bounderby (the most deliciously named character herein) is set to propose marriage to her, the chapter ends thusly:\\"Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he has spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes.\\"This passage alone should serve notice that something deeper is going in the world of Coketown. I truly don't think I can proffer to the prospective reader a glimpse of the depths that lie beneath the simplified characters and simplistic narrative structure than by quoting the last words of Stephen Blackpool, addressed to his Muse-like Rachael, as he lies dying, after having been raised from the disused mine opening known locally as Old Hell Shaft:\\"I ha' fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old folk now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' hundreds...When it were in work, it killed wi'out need: when \`tis let alone, it kills wi'out need. See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!\\"Coketown, perhaps, resembles our own world a bit too much for our own comfort and self-satisfaction. Look at the tag on the shirt you are now wearing. It was most likely made in a Southeast Asian sweatshop by a human being, with hopes and dreams much like your own. More importantly, for the significance of this book, gaze out into the world around you where people die, \\"thousands an' hundreds\\" every day, for no particular reason other than that they fell in a sort of shaft or hole: financial, medical, physical.Why is Coketown, why is the world as it is, with no apparent rhyme or reason? Why is it, in short, a muddle? That is the deeper question which Hard Times leaves us mulling: Why must they always exist?"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens was a great rhetorician, but not a very deep social thinker. _Hard Times_ is the novel in which he tries to tell us that there are a Whole lot O' Things Wrong with Britain in the nineteenth century. You've got people living in wage slavery! You've got educators who can't raise their own children! You've got amoral, rakish aristocrats! You've got unprincipled politicians and businessmen! When Dickens is taking on each of these subjects individually in his other works, he's wonderful; when he sews up his complaints against them into one big bundle and convinces himself that it's a Social Theory, he's a tiresomely shrill satirist and all of his characters turn as flat as paper before one's very eyes.This doesn't, of course, mean that the book isn't worth reading - after all, it's Dickens. There are some very sweet and descriptively rich passages about a traveling circus and although one finds it difficult to give a hoot about any of the characters aside from Mr. Gradgrind (who might have been developed much more richly if Dickens had cut down on the windy deploring a little and worked harder to make him seem like less of a cipher) the plot thunders along at the usual absorbingly breathless pace. But if you haven't read _David Copperfield_ or _A Tale of Two Cities_ yet, then for God's sake don't start out with this relatively second-rate effort."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"In this novel set in industrial revolution era Great Britain, Dickens is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Unlike some of his other social commentary, where he wraps his point in a gripping, twisting, and entertaining plot, Dickens goes right for the jugular in &quot;Hard Times&quot;.In this novel he lashes out against the dehumanization of our children through &quot;education&quot;, as well as the still very real gulf between the well to do and impoverished. Even the names of his characters are none-too-subtle jabs. The local teacher, Professor Gradgrind, seeks not to educate or enlighten, but to hammer home facts and turn his children into automatons. His counterpart in the business arena is Bounderby, a blustering, egomaniacal, and ultimately vacuous man. Their countermeasure is a young orphan girl named Sissy Jupe. She is a lovable character that embodies compassion and humanity, but is very nearly broken by the their overbearing influence.This is not a &quot;fun&quot; book to read, and if you're looking to be entertained in traditional Dickens fashion I strongly reccomend looking elsewhere (i.e. David Copperfield). The novel is relatively straightforward and simple of plot, and his scathing social commentary cannot be missed. The most compelling reason to read &quot;Hard Times&quot; though is the fact that the same mentality criticized here is still very much in existence today, and this makes the novel just as relevant for the 21st century as it was when first penned."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This product had a few marks where passages were underlined but overall it was in very good condition.

Not only do you get a handsomely presented copy of Hard Times, but articles and criticism about the work in one package.For me Hard Times becomes the indispensable Dickens. The relationship between Sissy Jupe and the Gradgrind children is something that is relevant today as it was 165 years ago. That the Education system can ruin children is absolutely a point that needs to be addressed in modern times. The Gradgrind academy only cares about facts, and only turns out vacuous twits. Only Sissy Jupe comes out of the academy with a head on her shoulders. Young Tom Gradgrind shows the folly of removing morals from the schools. He has no understanding of anything but how to take advantage of any particular situation. What is worse, his Father Old Tom Gradgrind tries to cover for him. How is that not relative to today's world?Besides getting the novel, one also gets the critical articles in the back, which help make sense of the whole thing. I am not saying that Dickens, in any of his works is hard to understand, but I especially like the articles from the time period in which the works were written. For teachers of literature, this book is a must. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I needed this book for a college class. It was shipped quickly and was in great shape when I got it. Also, it was very affordable, much cheaper than other carriers. However, I would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. I personally did not enjoy this Dickens tale."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"The book itself is nicely down by Everyman's Library, a nice attractive volume. As for the story...a classic of course, on the plight of the poor, industrialism, etc., in England. Great charatcters."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I totally didn't get this book. Ordinarily I like Dickens but now I simply couldn't figure out what each event had to do with each other, nor did I understand the end. However the single segments, especially those with Louisa in them, were interesting. It is even funny reading the beginning of the book when Mr. Gradgrind teaches that imagination is useless and only facts are important. If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"_Hard Times_ is a familiarly sentimental work by Dickens. This is especially the case regarding the character of Sissy Jupe, an overly sweet, innocent young girl who is abandoned by her father. Dickens seems determined to tug at the heart strings with this character.Dickens does an admirable job in covering new ground concerning the factory owners and bankers exploitation of the poor, as well as exploring the beginnings of labor unrest in 1850's England. There is much for the factory laborer to be unhappy with in Cokestown, where the factories belch out dirty, polluted smoke all day long. Dickens combines these issues with his examination of the difficulties inherent in parenting and gives truth to the old adage that how the branch is bent, so grows the tree. Through much grief and contrition years later, school master Thomas Gradgrind learns that a cold, no nonsense approach to bringing up his daughter Louisa and his son, Tom, was wrong. Louisa has a good heart and dotes on her younger brother, but is otherwise very distrustful of humanity and exists in the world suffused in apathy; Tom is simply, as Dickens calls him, \\"a whelp\\", and a dishonest one at that. Louisa marries Josiah Bounderby, a banker who turns his nose up at the factory hands and mocks their aspirations to move up in the world. Bounderby refers to these individuals as trying to put a \\"gold spoon\\" in their mouths. The actions of Bounderby and the Gradgrinds directly lead to tragic consequences for Stephen Blackpool, an honest and courageous loom worker, who merely chooses not to be involved with the townspeople or their labor leader. Another old truth that there is no justice in the world is as real today as it was in Dickens' time."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from &quot;civilized society&quot;. Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"&quot;Death by verbosity&quot; describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"The fact that Dickens wrote \\"Hard Times\\" in weekly installments, more than probably means that there was a time and space constraint. It must not be a coincidence then that this is among his shortest novels. I suppose this is why at times, his characters wind up being caricaturesque, and not as complex and real as some of his other very memorable characters. By the same token, some of his subplots do not fit in to the main plot the way they do in most, if not all, of his other works.Dickens is trying to explore and provide us with a picture of the effects of utilitarianism on different types of human characters, and in my opinion he does a good job, but only as far as individuals go. We can see the impact of the post romantic victorian social system on all of the novel's characters, and this makes the book interesting. The downside, however, is that when Dickens tries to extrapolate and paint a picture of the social struggle going on, he falls quite short. He tries to oversimplify too much, and in my opinion, fails at that.The \\"nothing but Facts\\" system psychologically castrates most of the main characters in the book. In one way or another, they all have their share of \\"Hard Times\\", and this can surely be attributed to a dehumanizing system, where people are statistics or simply gears within the machine which represents the newly industrialized world.It is no surprise that there are absolutely no happy people in this novel. This is definitely not one happy book, but overall it's really worth reading. If what you're looking for is a book that easy to read and to understand, and a page-turner, just stay away--read John Grisham instead ;-). If you want to read Dickens, this is more that probably not his best, but it's still good."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Considered by 19th century critics to be one of Dickens' more artistic and literary triumphs, Hard Times can be viewed in present time as a blistering polemic against the rise of industrial society and the dominate philosophy that rose in tandem with the industrial age, utilitarianismIt is well known that Dickens was a chronicler of his times, and his mode of expression, the novel. An intensely emotional individual, Dickens was known to be a power walker, starting in the afternoon, covering miles, to return home just before sunrise. It was during these extensive walks that he witnessed the utter poverty and squalor scattered throughout the streets of London. These walks brought inspiration for many of his novels, particularly, Hard Times.In this novel, Dickens explores the applications of utilitarianism in its highly rational, and in many ways, brutal forms. The novels general theme is that a philosophy that is only concerned with happiness and survival for the majority, will attempt to quash any and all individual thought and effort. Individual ideas, emotion, imagination and creativity must be ruthlessly rejected in order for the majority of people to think alike, work alike and behave alike to attain a status quo of happiness for all. Rationality must prevail because imagination promotes individuality, which is anathema to mob concerns.This polemic against utilitarianism is expressed clearly and persuasively in the practice of education. In the opening chapter for example, \`The One Thing Needful\\", the reader is introduced to this dictatorial emphasis on the rational:\\"Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will be of any service to them.\\" (p. 47)Romanticism was now on the wane and utilitarianism and the rise of rationalism infiltrated every aspect of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics.Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely. Dickens was reporting, and speaking against a potentially destructive sway in society away from basic humanity and the importance of the individual, towards the highly mechanical and rational \`mob' philosophy of Utilitarianism during the Industrial revolution.In our so-called modern times, Dickens message continues to be relevant. Our societies emphasis on rationalism and the exclusion of emotion, can only lead to destruction. A balance must be found."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"A most interesting book, and not the &quot;downer&quot; one might expect from the title. The story begins with the issue of what might happen to children raised in a setting where the non-logical human qualities are repressed. This is blended in with the relationship dynamics of those who own the factories and those who make the factories actually produce something to sell. Further, related issues are added. These various topics are intermingled in a moving story."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Despite the explicit title, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is not so much an ode to poverty and misery as it is a commentary on the increasing impact of industrialization on the fragmentation of society and on the dehumanization of education. The result, as Dickens implies, leads to lives hollowed by the emptiness of work for work's sake and wealth for wealth's sake.The setting is Coketown, a factory town befouled by industrial smog and populated by underpaid and undereducated laborers. The novel's most prominent character is one of the town's richest citizens, Josiah Bounderby, a pompous blowhard who owns a textile mill and a bank and whose conversation usually includes some boastful story about his impoverished childhood and the hard work that led to his present fortune.Bounderby is the commercial projection of Thomas Gradgrind, a local schoolteacher and an extraordinarily pragmatic man who instills in his students and his own children the importance of memorizing facts and figures and the iniquity of indulging in entertaining activities. Gradgrind offers to Bounderby his son, Tom Jr., as an unwilling apprentice, and his daughter, Louisa, as an unwilling bride.On the other end of the town's social scale is Stephen Blackpool, a simple, downcast man who works as a weaver at Bounderby's mill and slogs through life misunderstood and mistreated. When he refuses to join his fellow workers in a labor uprising, he is ostracized; when he criticizes the economic disparity between Bounderby and the workers, he is fired and forced to leave town; when Bounderby's bank is robbed one night, he is suspected as the thief. So halfway through the novel, Dickens grants his reader an interesting, albeit somewhat contrived, plot element to embellish the narrative.If this novel contains a ray of sunshine, it is in Sissy Jupe, a girl abandoned by her father and adopted by Gradgrind, whose oppressive educational method nearly breaks her. However, she grows up with her own intuitive sense of propriety, which she uses as a tool to eject a dishonorable character from the novel. Her strong and independent spirit will allow her to do much better in life than Louisa, who withers away in an unhappy marriage, and Tom Jr., whose boredom renders him vulnerable to temptations.Compared to his other novels, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is relatively short and straightforward and has few characters, as though Dickens felt that what he had to say was so important, it had to be said quickly and bluntly. He is less interested in realism than in making a point, and it's really the poetic power of his prose that enables him to get away with the overbearing sentimentality and often ridiculous caricatures that accompany his poignant human truths."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Some critics go so far as to say this is not an important part of Dickens. In my opinion this is a serious error. If anything, this is one of his best creations. The characters are plausible. In addition, the passages are dramatic and chilling. Dickens also fills this work with suspense, powerful images, and dramatic irony. Not one page is wasted. Don't let the thin length of this book fool you. This is a phenomenal masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"As a previous writer said, this is probably not the easiest Dickens novel to read, as it lacks the charm and appeal of the more popular works like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, but it still occupies an important place in Dickens's oeuvre. It is basically an expose of the evils of the unrestrained capitalism of the period, as Dickens portrays the lives of the poor who are held captive, oppressed, and ultimately crushed by it.In this book, although it speaks mostly from the oppressed working class and lower middle class, characters from all walks of society mingle. Although Dickens describes the dismal and oppressive working conditions of the time, the economic realities really take a back seat to the intimate story of the families, and of their trials and tribulations and failures.Fallen, old-family aristocrats like Mrs. Sparsit serve crass, nouveau-riche boors like Mr. Bounderby, whom she despises, and criminals and even circus people have important roles, such as in the case of Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a clown. The characters, however, aren't formulaic stereotypes but are real people who love, hate, make mistakes, fail, and live to regret and apologize for their mistakes.The novel takes place during the second phase in the industrial revolution which led to the development of the power loom. One of the main characters, Stephen Blackpool, is a power loom operator, and the new productivity of this device put many formerly skilled, manual loom operators out of work, further worsening an already bad unemployment situation.Gandgrind, the schoolteacher, is a rationalist representing the 18th century enlightenment ideals, and his philosophy of \\"fact\\" is shown to be a loveless and dispiriting sham. His views are ridiculed by Dickens, and his daughter ultimately rebels. In a sense, the novel is as much about the false and destructive ideals and beliefs of many of the main characters as it is about the economic vicissitudes of the time.Dickens's stories about the conditions in the factories and the lives of the workers were an important influence in changing things for the better. Eventually, England passed laws restricting child labor (to 11 hours a day), redistricting the so-called \\"rotten bourroughs\\" (whose seats in Parliament were sold by the wealthy landowners), and chattel slavery was abolished in the early 1830s, although economic slavery continued to exist in the form that Dickens depicts it in this novel. Laws were passed that didn't limit election to Parliament to landowners, and the stage was set for a fairer representation of the worker's interests.The Chartist labor movement attempted to obtain justice by smashing the looms and machines, but it ultimately failed to achieve its goals. The later labor movement was more successful in calling attention to the plight of the workers and in creating badly needed changes.By the way, an odd piece of trivia on Dickens that I read once. Just as today, back in Dickens's time even otherwise intelligent people believed in all sorts of pseudoscience. One of these was the supposed effects of magnetic fields on biological organisms, which still persists today. It was thought that if one slept with one's body aligned with the earth's magnetic field, that one would reap significant health benefits. When Dickens came to America to go on a speaking tour, the maids who came into his hotel rooms were surprised to find that he had completely rearranged the furniture so he could align the bed north and south with the magnetic field. Dickens kept a pocket compass with him so he could do just that.Unfortunately, there is no basis for such a claim although speculation about the health benefits of magnetic fields persists today. Also unfortunately for Dickens, it's too bad that there were no real positive health effects, otherwise he might have lived longer--his exhausting speaking tour wore him out and he became ill and died soon after returning to England. I've also read that he was paid $100,000 for this tour--an enormous sum of money at the time."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickins was a master of satire. He routinely lampooned the social structure of his time. Hard Times deals with the philosophy of utilitarianism. You can enjoy this book without any history lesson but for full effect read a little about Jeremy Bentham, James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill. You will undoubtedly notice the parallels. This book savages the unthinking, uncaring effects of unchecked capitalism. I'm no Marxist but this book is a fine arguement not just for balance in economic thinking, but in our daily lives. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Here is a stunning indictment of soot-covered early Victorian England. Its relevance today though should not be underestimated. Parallels abound both here at home and the world over. Hard Times is brilliant and multifaceted. Dickens is both dreadfully serious and stingingly witty. And yes, a thorough Marxist reading is certainly possible. Dickens cared deeply about the world in which he lived and his humanity shines through in every line. This book, and all that Dickens wrote, is worthwhile if only for the beauty of the prose. Those forced to read it in school are unlikely to see its value as anyone forced to do anything against the will is going to be resentful and rejecting. Be deeply suspicious though of the reader from Madison Wisconsin, Hitler, or anyone who advises the literal trashing of books."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This review is for the audio book narrated by Martin Jarvis. This is one of the better audio books I've listened to in a while from the perspective of the narrator doing excellent voice characterizations. Jarvis was able to make each character sound distinct and they each sounded just like I would have imagined. Bounderby was thunderous, Tom Gradgrind sounded like a whelp, and Blackpool sounded meek and humble. It made for an enjoyable listen that made it very easy to follow the characters.I've always been a fan of Dickens and have read most of his books, but this was my first time through \\"Hard Times\\". As with most of Dickens novels, the characters are almost caricatures, but this method does a good job of pointing out human strengths and weaknesses. This is a short novel for Dickens, but still did a good job exploring the impact of what would happen if science is emphasized too much over emotional education.He once again highlighted the problems with class distinctions in English society at that time. I like how his humble characters have more wisdom than those that are rich or of high social position.I highly recommend this audio book as a great way to be introduced to Dicken's \\"Hard Times\\"."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown.

It's definetely not Great Expectations or David Copperfield as the entire thing is depressing, morose, and a bother to read. Dickens throws in characters that don't furthur the plot (do I hear paid by the word?)The characters aren't real, I mean nobody could be worse off than Stephen Blackpool; the allusions are driven home, the Bounderby as wind motif; and its basically hammered out. Luckily, its the shortest one of Dicken's works and I wouldn't recommend any teachers forcing this upon students...it will make them flock to their nearest Cliff's Notes retailer (Amazon.com...) in droves.

I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel.

The continued presence of Ms. Sparsit on the payroll after she has been made redundant; Blackpool's reason for defying the union; and Sissy in her entirety, for instance.Still, this is not a bad tale and parts of it are enthralling.What I found intriguiging was the obliquely described opium session between the cad and the whelp; Dickens' use of the word 'noodle' as mid-1860's vernacular slang; the mention of walnut ketchup which is still being made today and is something that I should like to try; and an introduction to a pretty decent alcoholic drink, to wit warmed sherry with lemon peel and nutmeg.I used cream sherry to make a concoction very much like a smooth-edged hot toddy; it comes highly recommended to anyone in need of a hot toddy.What I find I like even more is plain, unheated, cheap cream sherry and lemon peel which is a surprisingly excellent combination.Having said that, this book did re-introduce me to the spice nutmeg which is heady indeed--the Chinese would call it 'heaty'--and deeply satisfying."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"This is a gem and for those readers out there who are tempted to try Dickens, then, apart from A Christmas Carol, this is the only book by him that can be read in a day (unless you are an insomniac).

For sheer brilliance, Pickwick Papers, David Copperfield, Bleak House and in my opinion Little Dorrit. But for something transcending literature - a deep social and political commentary - try Hard Times. Plus you won't grow old trying to finish it as it's about 300 pages (220 in somew versions)."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens has an incredible energy that, after putting away a few dull contemporary novels, should be immeadiately striking to anyone. And with the wonderfully satirical opening of Hard Times, \\"Now, what I want is, Facts....\\" he continues to begin a book better than anyone. That energy does not dissapate as the novel progresses.Hard Times is set in the industrial but fictional Coketown. Its central point of concern is a certain ultilitarian/Victorian sensibility, a point of view that reduces everthing to rationality. This reaches is most tragic moment when a father must watch her daughter literally crushed by a \\"economical\\" marriage that he encouraged. Rationality also dictates the divisions of labor and class, that become dehumanizing.But while this book is satirical, and does have a social agenda, Hard Times can't be reduced to that agenda. It isn't merely a collection of opinions. There is too much here for that. Characters are shamed, outcast, forced into \\"sensible\\" but unfulfilling lives, and commit crimes while letting others take the fall. Unlike some of our contemporary satires, Hard Times doesn't just mock. There is heart and tragedy too. Further, no one, rich or poor, gets off the hook. Whether its Slackbridge the union leader and a group factory workers, or a wealthy banker, anyone who lacks humanity is shamed. Probably the richest and most aristoratic character, James Harthouse, is judged indifferently. Dickens isn't a partisan.Hard Times is the shortest Dickens novel and its brevity is a double edged sword. While one is not exhausted at its conclusion (As I was with David Copperfield), and there are less story lines to confuse, you a don't know the characters as well as you do with the longer novels, and the cast of characters isn't as wide. Also absent is some of the jolly or quirky characters that are Dickens staples. This accounts for why some call it a dreary novel, though I disagree.This isn't his best, and there will be some moments when you shake your head (why does everyone seem to die with perfect timing?) but Hard Times is still great. When I criticize one of Dickens' novels, I compare his low moments with his high ones, not to other writers. I will continue to read his novels and love their energy and wit."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"If you read Hard Times for the sole purpose of being entertained you will probably be highly disappointed. However, if you understand what was happening during this time period, you will realize that Hard Times is in reality, a long commentary. The Industrial Revolution was starting to show its down side. There was rampant poverty and disease, from the overcrowding of the cities. Children of the poor had to work long hours in unsafe factories rather than go to school. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots was very wide. The middle class was only beginning to be a distinct group.This then was the backdrop of Hard Times. Dickens is making a social and political statement. This is a statement against the mechanizing of society. It starts with Dickens repeated use of the word fact. It is facts that have meaning. Human conventions like feeling, compassion or passion have no meaning or looked down upon as an inconvienent waste of time. If a situation cannot be put down on paper as in an accounting ledger it should not be considered.This is where the conflict of the book comes in. Which helps humanity more compassion or fact. Is Bounderby a better person than Blackpool? Bounderby, who by his own admission was a self-made man. Untrue as this was he said it enough to make it his own reality. Or Blackpool, a weaver with an alcoholic wife, who was in love with another woman. Facts made Bounderby rich, compassion made Blackpool human.Louisa presents another conflict. Louisa was educated only by fact. No wonder or inquisitiveness was ever allowed. She was the perfect robot. Doing what she was told when she was told. Just another piece of the machine, however, the piece broke, emotions came out, and they broke down the wall of fact that Mr. Gradgrind had so carefully constructed. Because the feelings have finally been acknowledged things really break down. She finds that not only has she married the wrong man but also the man she did marry is a buffoon whom she cannot respect nor live with.The reader is left wondering if there is no one who will not be ruined by all the worship to fact. The whelp has certainly been ruined to the point he feels no responsibility to anyone but himself. If a situation can not be used to his advantage then he has no use for it, as a matter of course, he will run when he believes he will have to take responsibility for his own actions.The gypsies have not been ruined by fact. But only because they live outside of society, they do not conform to the rules of society. These are the people who value character over social status. The gypsies do not value Bounderby and Bitzer with all their pomp and egomania. Rather they value Stephen Blackpool and Cecilia whom can show compassion and kindness no matter a person's station in life.Hard Times can be used to look at today's society. Are we, as a society more worried about our computers, cell phones, faxes, and other gadgets than our neighbor's well being? Do we only get involved to help others when there is a personal benefit? Or, are we like the gypsies who can look into the character of the person and not worry about the socio-economic status? While Dickens' wrote Hard Times about 19th century England the moral can easily fit into 21st century America"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Charles Dickens visited Preston during a strike. So, this book is written largely based on his observations. People tend to go from one extreme to the other on this one. They tend to either really like it, or really dislike it. While it lacks the artful improvisation of some of his works like \\"The Pickwick Papers,\\" \\"David Copperfield,\\" or \\"Our Mutual Friend,\\" it is good in a different way. Right away, we meet Thomas Gradgrind who thinks that FACTS are the answers to all the questions in life. While he may seem harsh and brutal, he does have a conscience, and he honestly believes in what he does. We then meet Sissy Jupe and Bounderby. Sissy Jupe is pretty much the opposite of Thomas Gradgrind. She is one who hangs onto sentiment and hope. Bounderby on the other hand is the more dark and extreme version of Gradgrind. (Though it is hard to hate Bounderby because we can see the society that created him.) Through clever wording, Dickens describes the darkness and sadness of the area. Interestingly, the dark Bounderby has one notable redeeming feature. He is good to his housekeeper Mrs. Sparsit. We later meet Stephen Blackpool who has worked 12 years in Bounderby's factory. He is a good honest man who suffers because he can not go along with any extreme. He loves a woman named Rachel, but he is already married. (And of course the marriage is not a happy one.) Stephen then has a dream that foreshadows his fate. One of the most disturbing events of the book then takes place. Under her father's advice, the 20 year old Louisa agrees to marry the 50 year old Bounderby. (Charles Dickens could have hardly known that some time later he would marry the young Ellen Ternan, but we won't go there.) Later, we learn that Slackbridge is stirring up a mutiny in the factory and poor Stephen Blackpool is cast out because he will not join. And even Bounderby will not help poor Stephen. (What a situation!) Louisa (now Mrs. Bounderby) gives Stephen some money to help him, but Tom Jr knows that he can probably use Stephen's slowness to his advantage. James Harthouse starts to grow close to Louisa, and we can see the tension rising. The bank is then robbed, and poor Stephen Blackpool is suspected, but it doesn't take much for us to know who really did it. Interestingly, Mrs. Sparsit (Bounderby's servant) continues to use Louisa's maiden name. Louisa knows that her brother probably robbed the bank, but she can not bring herself to tell. The tension between Bounderby and Louisa begins to increase, and we can guess that the marriage does not have much longer. In a well written chapter Louisa has an emotional breakdown due to her upbringing, and the good in Thomas Gradgrind starts to show. His intentions were good, but he realizes he was wrong. (Thomas Gradgrind is not exactly a Murderstone or a Uriah Heep.) In a rage, Bounderby ships Louisa's stuff back to her father's, and we can see the marriage is over. But there is more to come. Stephen Blackpool is still suspected of robbing the bank, and fleeing did not help the situation. He makes his way back to proclaim his innocence, and he has a fatal accident. Poor Thomas realizes that his son robbed the bank. And in a moment of irony, the circus (that Gradgrind scorned so openly) is hiding his son. There is a brief and tragic reunion, and Thomas Jr is sent out of the country where he can hide in safety. And if it's any small consolation prize to Mr. Gradgrind, Thomas Jr does mend his ways. While the book does not exactly end in utter happiness, the characters do grow in a sense, so it does not end in utter sadness either."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I'm surprised by all the two and three-star reviews appearing on this site. For me, &quot;Hard Times&quot; was enjoyable right from the start and memorable long after. The writing is evocative and fluid, and although it can be easy to get lost due to some of the anachronisms in Dickens' writing, in general the writing is excellent. The characters, while not subtle (it's pretty easy to sum them up in a few words) are all memorable and tug on the heartstrings quite a bit. Sissy, Mr. Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby, Stephen, Tom, and Louisa are great characters (and just because they're easily defined, they are no less human or believable). Finally, the story itself is a bit sobering (as it was intended to be) but it's also very human and shows the possibilities of redemption quite nicely.In short, &quot;Hard Times&quot; is excellent. I'd recommend it to any fan of Dickens or just anybody who likes good literature."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I love the ending of this novel by Dickens when he says:\\"Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not. Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn cold and grey.\\"This novel is all about what one would think of as a dreary life in a north England mill town (fictitiously) called Coketown. It is named after the seemingly endless plumes of thick coal smoke being emitted from many different mills in this small lifeless town. But true to Dickens style he gives us a delightful set of characters that we can love or hate but who keep us entertained through a quick read of about 300 pages.There is method in the madness, in that Dickens tries to push us in the direction of accepting that fate was not preordained for these folks and they could choose a better life if they so desired. He includes many biblical references and references to the mid 1800 culture to keep it all upbeat and entertaining.I was expecting a more depressing plot to reflect the title \\"Hard Times\\", but in many ways it is good times for some of the characters, and as Dickens says at the end that he can hope for a positive outcome for their lives - the precise details of which he leaves us guessing.Entertaining 5 star read at a bargain price by a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"... of English literature? I read \\"Hard Times\\" -- the 1969 Penguin Classics edition, which I still own and which is still intact -- roughly 40 years ago, in the midst of a Dickens binge, and I'm surprised to find that the humor in it has gotten angrier from aging on my book shelf. The anger has a lot of targets: industrial pollution and ugliness, the smug hypocrisy of the wealthy, the connivance and impotence of lawmakers, the class inequity of the Law, the dysfunctional divorce laws of England, the inaccessibility of education for the poor, the 'utilitarian' social philosophy of the era, the sort of education that crushed a child's creativity under the thumb of intellectual conformity and economic utility. In fact, a lot of the humor of \\"Hard Times\\" is of the bitter, scornful variety -- no less funny for being preachy -- while the tirades of anger are bedecked and bedizened in the drollest caricatures and exaggerations, as if Mr. Pickwick were asked to expound the utopianism of Charles Fourier.But I admit that I had remembered \\"Hard Times\\" inaccurately. I recalled it as being a tale of 'labor agitation' in a mill town, rather like Emile Zola's great protest novel \\"Germinal\\". There is indeed a brief episode of labor protest, scarcely a chapter in the middle of the book, but the narrative focuses far more on the family affairs of the utilitarian philanthropist Gradgrind with his two children and the despicable mill owner Josiah Bounderby, boor, boaster, bully, buffoon. Gradgrind has raised his daughter and son, by the most systematic repression of their imaginations and sympathies, to be paragons of utilitarian values. The son inevitably turns out to be a self-centered scoundrel and the daughter a frigidly dutiful automaton. Gradgrind weds his beautiful young daughter to the far older and dictatorial Bounderby, and plot complications ensue. \\"Hard Times\\" encompasses three tales of woefully failed marriages, a thwarted seduction and hopelessly obstructed romance. There's really only one \\"working man' in the cast of \\"Hard Times\\" - the honest but 'limited' weaver Stephen Blackpool, whose eventual fate provides the pathos readers must have expected in a novel of 1854. The 'introduction' to my ancient Penguin Edition, by David Craig, perceptively challenges Dickens's own inability to assign a well-rounded self-determining 'humanity' to his lower-class characters, for all of his purported sympathy with their plight. Blackpool has the virtues of a victim only, a dumb beast. The circus performers, who appear in the novel at the beginning and who return at the end, are likewise morally admirable but incomplete. Frankly, if one stops too often to think about the reforming zeal of Charles Dickens, one can get frustrated with the man, especially when reading his earlier novels like Hard Times. He was, I fear, as hidebound in his assumptions of social class as anyone in Victorian England; he merely had a warmer heart and a much sharper pen. There's a brisk current of influence from the literary works of Dickens to the political and sociological notions of Progressivism, the Social Gospel, the Temperance Movement, and all the elitist reformers of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.Do not, however, let analysis of any Dickens novel inhibit your pleasure at the vitality and inventiveness of his words! That's another thing I'd forgotten over the years since my first Dickens binge: just how damned well the aptly-named \\"Dickens\\" could write!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"A book called \\"Hard Times\\" doesn't sound like the type of book you'd pick up for some light, cheerful reading, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover - or its title either. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly deals with a difficult subject, but thanks to the genius of Dickens, it never becomes unbearably depressing.At the centre of the novel are the upheavals of the mid-1800s that changed the world forever: the rise of the Industrial Revolution, mass manufacturing and capitalism, and the rural-to-urban flow that led to compulsory schooling and shocking living conditions for vast amounts of the English population. The Enlightenment was gaining in popularity, as was the bourgeois class, which was gradually outing the old aristocracies. It was a time of drastic social and economic change, and inevitably many less-fortunate people fell down the cracks in the new system. With all this as his background, Dickens creates various characters of differing classes and the impact such social changes had in their lives. Exploring the phenomena on individual, familial and social levels, Dickens reveals some of the pain and misery that plagued his time-period, and is still very much relevant to our present day condition.What is vitally important to understand is that reading \\"Hard Times\\" is reading history - in more ways than one. As a philanthropist who investigated the factory conditions of the working class, Dickens not only vividly describes the situation as he saw it with his own two eyes, but threw light on the cruelty that was at work to the general public (before there was investigative journalists, there were novelists). It was partly because of the publicity that Dickens raised in regards to factories and workhouses that philanthropists came to the aid of the poor and that laws were passed in order to secure better conditions for the lower classes. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.Thrown into the mix of this great social and political satire are a range of vivid (though often one-dimensional characters) of all classes and situations who all dwell in the industrial town of Coketown, described as \\"a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it...a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.\\" Out of this miserable place comes Sir Thomas Gradgrind, a man uninterested in anything but facts - at school, at home and in life in general. His children Louisa and Thomas are the products of a strictly factually-based education; as a result she is clinically depressed (as we would describe it in modern terms) and her brother turns to cards and drinking in order to alleviate his boredom with the world. Among the lower-class is Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking older man who is in love with fellow worker Rachael, but because of his class is unable to divorce his drunken wife. Providing the lighter side of this dreary existence is the circus, which brings colour and enjoyment into the lives of the Coketown residents simply for its own sake, personified by Sissy Jupes, the daughter of a clown who brings a sense of fancy and spiritual understanding into the lives around her that mere facts don't even begin to provide.All of these lives, plus many more eventually collide in typical Dickens melodrama, with the clear message that imagination (or \\"fancy\\") and the need for simple pleasures in life are essential for the good of humanity. Whether it is in the strict classroom, the dismal workhouses or the familial unit, the human spirit will be crushed without some measure of light, laughter and enjoyment. As an extra bonus, \\"Hard Times\\" is one of Dickens's shortest novels; if you are a steady reader it shouldn't take you more than a week to complete!Some critique \\"Hard Times\\" as being too transparent in some of its themes and messages, and though this is probably true (with his characters representing different points of view, rather than being three-dimensional figures), this is precisely the point of the novel. Unlike \\"David Copperfield\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\", this is not a story that revolves around one particular character and their development, but rather an assemble piece that has the \`hard times' as its main focus. Therefore, characters do not need to be anything but a representative of worldview; Mr Gradgrind as the strict rationalist, Bounderby as the hypocritical bourgeois member, Blackpool as the angelic poor man, Mrs Sparsit as a member of the fading aristocracy and Slackbridge as an ignorant trades-union agitator (proving that although Dickens had sympathy for the poor, he still believed that giving them *too* much power was a dangerous thing).These were hard times indeed, but this novel attempts to show that there is hope for humanity to see such times through to the other side."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"To write an outline of Hard Times or Dickens' work would not be necessary. His writing has withstood the test of time, and is well know. To give encouragement to would-be Dickens' readers and Hard Times readers does seem like time well spent.Hard Times ventures from other Dickens' books in the writing style lending a departure from Dickens' previous descriptive formats. In this particular book, Dickens lends skill, imagination, and panache to English language usage. He breathes life in to the language of the novel, and he remains a master of dramatic setting and story line. When people say, \\"Read good books, it will rub off on you.\\" Hard Times comes first to my mind. Therefore, a reason to read Hard Times would be to improve your own reading and writing.I admit some of the character's lives are depressing. When I looked back upon the entire book, and wondered if Hard Times would differ if set in present day with cell phones, PDAs, the Internet, electricity, airplanes, automobiles, and so many distractions. My guess would be - probably not. Would Louisa Gradgrind's life have taken a different course if she were living in today's world? My guess would be, perhaps, a slight shift on her circumstances, and, again, probably not. Dickens' charms include being able to put his finger on a character type and bring it to life. This is why I'd call certain present day figures, \\"A Mr. Bounderby\\" or \\"A Gradgrind\\". The Whelp or Tom Gradgrind remains alive and kicking; I've met him.My recommendation: Read Hard Times. You will be a better reader and writer for it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Although not one of his more popular novels, Charles Dickens' Hard Times still stands as a classic among classics. Carrying on with his highly prolific writing style, this novel is a bit more bleak than his other renown works, but enjoyable from the start, especially with Dickens' excellent choice of character naming.Suitable for most ages, this classic should not be passed up. And with the Norton annotations and notes, this edition will help readers understand better the context in which the author writes in."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times was written in 1854 by England's greatest novelist CharlesDickens (1812-1870. It is the shortest of his novels. The novel was originally published as a weekly series in \\"Household Words\\" periodical edited by Dickens. The novel reads quickly telling a story that is still relevant in our own post-industrial 21st century Western Society.The novel is set in fictional Coketown set in the English Midlands. The first scene is set in a classroom where children are being taught by rotelearning. Only FACTS yells Mr. Gradgrind who has raised his two children the feckless Tom and the more impressionable Louisa to eschew the emotions of art and the heart to stick strictly to practical learning.Enter into the town Mr. Sleary's circus. Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is a young girl whose father is employed by Sleary to ride horses. He deserts Sissy who is adopted by the Gradgrind family. Sissy befriends the lonely lass Louisa. Louisa is forced into a loveless marriage with the bloviating humbug industrialist Josiah Bounderby. Bounderby has crafted a false story of a difficult childhood while disdaining the love of his mother who lives in the country.We also met the tragic Stephen Blackpool a miner who is wed to an alocholic wife. Stephen is in love with the beautiful and kind Rachael. He will be framed for the robbery of Bounderby's bank which was really robbed by Tom Gradgrind.The novel is divided into three parts covering several years. Many of the characters come to a bad end. The novel attacks industrialism, the state of British education and the necessity for entertainment in the lives of everyone.All of Dickens fictions are worth reading. Hard Times is a good introduction to the second half of his career in which he moves to more serious themes. A Victorian classic which will be enjoyed by the discriminating reader."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Dickens wrote some diverse plots, that's for certain. \\"Hard Times\\" certainly DOES portray some hard times. Everyone knows \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and I had read and loved \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" years ago. This book is something altogether different.Dickens has a knack for creating memorable characters. I had to read this novel for a British Literature class a year ago, and Bounderby, Sparsit, Blackpool, and the Gradgrinds are permanently ingrained in my mind.This novel would have been more enjoyable had my class been able to read it at a slower pace! Pay careful attention to the characters' development.Also, a word on the Norton editors: I really like the way they organized the additional material at the end of the book. There's even a reading by Darwin. It's all related; I think Dickens would have liked it."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a \\"Uriah Heep\\" or \\"Fagin.\\" Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Hard Times is first and foremost a burning indictment on industrialism and the total reliance on reason without consideration for emotions. It is also a great novel. I didn't get quite the same connection with the characters as in Great Expectations - I can't readily recall their names after a few months - but I know them and can remember vividly the scenes that he painted them in.Again there are several sub plots which drive the point home and wrap the novel up in such a tight and well thought out way that only Dickens could have written this. The main character, for me, is Louisa, raised under conventional wisdom on only dry facts and reason. As such, she is completely unable to cope with real life. She is married to Bounderby, who owns the local bank while her brother, Tom, works for him. Bounderby claims to been raised in the gutter, abandoned by his parents, and to have raised himself up by his bootstraps. Each character has built for themselves a house of cards which are destined to come tumbling down revealing all the flaws, all the lies and the fundamental errors of their thinking. The only person left unscathed is the abandoned circus girl who, like Biddy in Great Expectations, reminds us that the people we overlook may just be the best ones out of the bunch."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I was forced to read Hard Times for my English class. Although I was skeptical at first, this book turned out to be pretty good. Dickens manages to create an engaging story with believable characters. He definately does an excellent job satirizing England during the Industrial Revolution. This book is not perfect, but is clearly a fine work of literature. A word of CAUTION: If you have a hard time reading wordy, descriptive passages in the Victorian writing style, this book is NOT for you! (I generally enjoy novels written during this time period.) A further note: If you are not assigned to read this book and really want to read some good Dickens, I would choose GREAT EXPECTATIONS, which I think is superior by far. Otherwise, enjoy the novel!"},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Coketown is \\"the inner-most fortifications of that ugly citadel where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence.\\"Hard Times takes place in 1854, six years after Karl Marx first published his ideas in the Communist Manifesto. Marx revolutionized the way people looked at history. His historical science was a radically new way of looking at human history, our past, our present, and our future. Marxist themes are plentiful in Hard Times, everything from the Bourgeoisie to the Proletariat are represented in this account of the industrial revolution.Dickens provides an excellent portrayal of real-life people faced with hard times amidst an economic boom. This is a touching story, giving names and faces to the people who are creating, being replaced by, and being abused by the industrial revolution. The Communist Manifesto is not complete until you have read Hard Times."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"Still not a bad story, but rather more depressing than most of his books, there is very little to make this an enjoyable read, as Dickens usually is. Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I just finished this book, it is the third of Dickens novels that I have read. It is one of his shortest so it was easy to get through reading it in a decent amount of time. I enjoyed the characters he introduced, but I found myself getting a tad bit lost in some of his phraseology trying to figure out what was being said and understand exactly what was going on. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this novel of Dickens, but the one thing I do like about Dickens is you can't breeze through any of his novels without putting some effort into concentrating on what is being said-or else you get lost! This being said, It isn't the most light hearted of his novels, but If you enjoy reading Dickens, you will most likely like reading this one, too, even if it isn't necessarily his best one."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"I read this book later than I read novels such as Great Expecatations and David Copperfield, but I don't remember it as well. Hard Times is a fine novel - short, often miserable (but that's the reason why this novel is so important), but with a good message. It's also an effective satire that actually does have its moments of humor as well as pathos (such as when Stephen Blackpool dies). I do recommend it, but as good as a book it is, it'll never be one of my favorite Dickens novels."},{"Title":"Hard Times","review":"\\"Now what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life...Stick to the Facts, sir!\\" With this opening, Dickens shoves his message down the gullet of the reader of Hard Times which is indicative of the entire story line, characters, and the social message that he is trying to shout out to his audience. The book is an allegorical message in every sense of the word where his descriptions of the character's physical traits bring their personalities to life. Dicken's description of the story's setting, Coketown, and those who live and work there, also illustrates the bleak and dismal attitude surrounding the Victorian Era and the changing social structure of the time.The tale begins in a school, barren of the delightful faces usually evident in children, due to the staunch efforts of Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. M'Choakumchild, the proprietor and schoolmaster of Coketown's school. Their quest is to instill nothing but facts into the children of Coketown \\"until they were full to the brim.\\" They attempt to create an environment in which no child will be allowed flights of fancy or fits of imagination. The fruits of this quest are strongly apparent in Gradgrind's own children, Thomas and Louisa, who are encouraged to learn facts, and not allowed to participate in activities that other youths would see as a necessary part of life. Following their education, the two are given over to the control of Mr. Bounderby, a self-proclaimed, self-made man, proud that he has pulled himself up the \\"corporate ladder\\" and into a better life than he claims to have come from. Louisa becomes Bounderby's wife at the insistence of her father, and Thomas, an employee at Bounderby's bank. The one wild card added into the equation is Sissy Jupe, the daughter of a circus performer who has abandoned his station in life and his daughter, as well. Gradgrind takes in this pure, young soul in order to prove that his methods can be used to teach respect and proper behavior, even in a girl raised in an environment such as the one in which Sissy has been raised.Along the path, Dickens introduces some of the other residents of Coketwon, including Stephen Blackpool, an honest and hardworking, virtuous man who lives in misery due to bad choices made in his youth. His friend and co-worker, Rachael, is also hardworking and honest, and although there is romantic interest evident, Blackpool's unwise decisions of younger days keep them apart. Also mired in the plot is Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby's house keeper, and a truly despicable and pathetic character. And last in the line of detestable characters that Dickens adds is James Harthouse, an upstart from another place whose sole purpose in the novel is to wreak havoc on the lives of the others while remaining absolutely clueless to his part in their misery. The story continues as the characters trod along in their lives with only suspicion that there is another way of life, until Dickens casts his redemption spell in the form of Stephen Blackpool's martyrdom for society and Sissy's powerful moral character that affects Harthouse so strongly that he leaves Coketown.Throughout the tale, Dickens so strongly exerts his opinions and hopes that at times the book left me feeling ambivalent towards almost every charcter introduced. And his use of language, although allowing the tale to be vivid in the mind of the audience, also makes the reader wonder if he wasn't being paid by the word, rather than by the page."},{"Title":"Teaching Science in the Block (Teaching in the Block)","review":"This book provides a detailed explaination of what a block schedule is.

Neither is it the &quot;dismal science&quot; that Thomas Carlyle claimed it was back in the days when Britannica still ruled the waves. Economics is a social science, a &quot;historical&quot; science, a science that can seldom rely on experiment to test its theories but must make do with observation. We do not know whether a tax cut for the rich, for example, will be good for the economy as a whole. It can be tried and when the results are in some years or decades down the road, we may come to some conclusion; but because we could not also see what would have happened had there been no tax cut or a different sort of tax cut, we really cannot be sure that it was the tax cut for the rich that led to economic growth or (as the case may be) revolution.Nonetheless, while the knowledge we receive from a rigorous and disciplined observation of facts and events gives us nothing like certainty, it does lead us to know how to place our bets. And in an uncertain world that is really all we can expect. Even in closed systems like mathematics there are things unknown and not fully understood; and even in the most rigorous of the sciences such as physics, there is no presumption to absolute knowledge.This attractive pint-sized publication from The Economist includes an opening essay entitled &quot;The Joy of Economics&quot; by Matthew Bishop that summarizes the current thinking of economists and presents a report on the state of the art. Unlike many essays written by economists, it is easy to read and directed at a general (but, of course, educated) readership. It serves admirably not only as an introduction to this volume but to current economic thought as well. I especially like his point that &quot;better measures of economic success or failure&quot; than &quot;a purely monetary measure&quot; such as GDP are needed, most clearly some measure that takes &quot;environmental and other non-monetary factors into account.&quot; (pp. 8-9) Also good is his question about what effect the information explosion will have on economic thought and practice.After Bishop's essay there follows hundreds of mini-essays and definitions arranged alphabetically on matters economic. If one compares these entries to those in the similar, but larger Dictionary of Economics also put out by The Economist, one quickly sees that there are fewer entries here but they are presented in a more readable fashion. This is then a less technical publication and not as inclusive; yet for most readers I would say it makes the ideas of economics more accessible.Furthermore, Matthew Bishop, who wrote the entries has a slightly different slant on some economic ideas than those of the editors of the Dictionary of Economics. For example, on &quot;adverse selection&quot; Bishop concentrates on the market failure likely to be experienced by insurance companies selling insurance to, e.g., &quot;55-year-old male smokers&quot; while the Dictionary of Economics zeroes in on what it calls &quot;the lemon problem.&quot; In both cases the problem is that one side of the transaction has an advantage that results in an adverse selection for the other side. In the former case, the insurance company that sells insurance to someone who is in poor health is at a disadvantage; and in the latter case the buyer of the poorly-made or maintained car is at a disadvantage.In another example, the &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; of game theory is explained and related to the problem experienced by oligopoly (that of setting prices) in perhaps two hundred words. In the Dictionary of Economics twice as many words are used and a table is included. How to choose between the two explanations? The answer is the same for choosing between the two books: simply how technical do you want your explanations, and how readable?Clearly this is the handier book. The type is a little larger. It takes up less space, and it does not cover the more esoteric ideas of economics that the non-specialists may profitably skip over. Furthermore, this quality paperback book has built-in front and end flaps that work as book marks for keeping your place. Cross references are in capital letters, which I think is the most straightforward way of pointing to them.Bottom line: handy, accessible and just right for those of us who have degrees in something other than economics."},{"Title":"Essential Economics (Economist Essentials)","review":"I am a very avid reader of the Economist magazine. I bought this book to give me a deeper understanding of economic theory, but the list format makes this book rather useless aside as a pure reference \\"dictionary\\". It covers topics on a cursory level. It's too brief for the novice and likely too basic for the expert."},{"Title":"Essential Economics (Economist Essentials)","review":"This book delivers what it promises: a brief overview of the essential economic expressions of our time. Most interesting are its style and format. It certainly delivers on The Economist's guarantee of quality writing and the encyclopedia-like entries make it simple to find what you want, jump from one topic to another (even easier thanks to the cross references are in capital letters) or simply skip around the book.I would say that this is a non-technical publication, perfectly accessible for the interested layman. Not as comprehensive as the bulkier Dictionary of Economics also published by The Economist, but a great reference title on its own. It covers basic topics but also some more unusual ones like positional goods or the tragedy of the commons.A good companion would be The Economist Guide to Economic Indicators that goes more into depth on several subjects. Also interesting is that you can find a shorter online version of this book at The Economist's website, called Economics A-Z. It is not as comprehensive but certainly quite handy.Unlike other reviewers, I did not like so much the author's introduction on the dismal science... In any case, throughout the volume, the author's style is brilliant and most effective when covering complicated terms, as he beautifully summarizes the essentials of each expression.

These ten careful pages constitute a virtual primer on economic discussion in broad historical outline and the state of the question today.Entries from A ('Absolute advantage') to Z ('Zero-sum game') then fill out this handbook-sized volume with intelligent summary and effective cross-referencing.Brilliant, concise, unapologetic, sized for the desk, shelf or briefcase, ESSENTIAL ECONOMICS is worth its modest price, which should prove no 'barrier to entry' to dismal scientists and lay enthusiasts in virtually any 'optimal currency area'."},{"Title":"Essential Economics (Economist Essentials)","review":"Economics is often, for better or for worse, referred to as \\"dismal science.\\" Over the years I have come across numerous explanations of the origin of that phrase, but have never been able to ascertain for sure what was the original grievance that provoked such a bleak view of economics. It is fair to say, however, that most people don't have much of an appreciation for economics, and this extends even to some highly educated individuals. There are a few good reasons for such a view, but for the most part economics is unfairly singled out amongst the various academic fields. In fact, there are very few disciplines that can compete with economics for the usefulness in everyday life. When you properly understand what economics is all about you start to realize how many of the daily events - personal, national, and global - have at least some economic underpinnings. In the light of that, having a basic grasp of the essential economic ideas and terms is at the very least a sign of well-rounded education.There are numerous resources on economics today, and with the Internet within almost everyone's reach, it seems unnecessary to get a hard-copy desk reference book on this subject. Nonetheless, \\"Essential Economics\\" is a very well presented and designed handy reference work that you may want to acquire for those moments when you don't feel like going online to check up a basic economic term. This book is not written as a textbook, but as dictionary of essential economic terms. Thus the aim of the book is not to present a unified overarching explanation of economics, but rather to inform the reader about those economic terms and ideas that he may find useful or relevant at any particular point. Nonetheless, the book is written in a very crisp, legible style and it could be read cover-to-cover. Most terms are cross-referenced and this makes it easy to find connections between various concepts. Economics is a rapidly evolving field, and the book is a bit dated because of that, but it can still be used for basic information. The format of this book is also very compact and accessible, and it can be used as a quick first reference."},{"Title":"Essential Economics (Economist Essentials)","review":"I teach at the college level, and have made this reference a mandatory part of my class in \\"Pocket Economics\\".

I am amazed at what this child had to go through before someone recognized that she was dyslexic and needed help in order to learn to read. It made me wish that every child had a place they could go where they felt safe and cared about, where no one would make fun of them because they could not read or write or do math, skills that most children take for granted. It made me realize that schools should provide every child a place to go where they felt safe and cared about, a place such as the resource room and teacher as described in this story. It also made me realize how important it is that teachers learn to recognize signs of dyslexia in children in their classrooms and bring it to the attention of appropriate school personnel. This is a wonderful book that I would highly recommend for teachers, parents, and educational/school psychologists to read."},{"Title":"The Safe Place","review":"There is a mistake in the 1st review- the girl's name is Kinneret, not Nava. please correct it."},{"Title":"The Safe Place","review":"The Safe Place,written by Tehila Peterseil,is about a young girl named Nava who has problems with learning.

Eclipsed by the simultaneous Great Chicago Fire, and because few eyewitnesses actually survived to tell about it, the Peshtigo firestorm never achieved the notoriety it should have and there are not many books about it. This one builds a suspenseful narrative out of the more reliable accounts and anecdotes of the fire, and is studded with unforgettable images -- the self-herding house cats, the pretty girl running down the flaming boardwalk, the farmer who momentarily left his wife and children alone in the wagon ...The shipwreck story is a bonus."},{"Title":"Fire and Ice: Two Deadly Disasters (Fire at Peshtigo; Shipwreck on Lake Michigan)","review":"This &quot;two volumes in one&quot; book deals with extreme opposites on the tragedy scene in Wisconsin.&quot;Fire&quot; refers to the Great Peshtigo Fire of Peshtigo, Wisconsin.

It is about finding out what is our 'mission' in life, about destiny and following our dreams - whenever one wishes something, the whole universe conspires to its realisation. Everything is possible as long as we really want this to happen.At the first level, the story seems to be very simple, and as Coelho himself said it, &quot;simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them&quot;. But it is by far a very complex story with very deep meanings.One of the things suggested here is that people who don't dare to follow their dreams, their 'Personal Myth', will have a superficial and empty life.It is also about being courageous to meet your destiny, to dare making your dreams come true and following the road that has been made for them, and find God while searching for their destiny and their mission on earth.Another important issue in this book is finding your soul-mate and love - the core of existence and creation. When we are in love we try to improve ourselves: &quot;I love you because the whole universe conspired for me to come close to you.&quot;I think this book can be enjoyed by everybody, because we all find ourselves in Santiago, the main character of the book - we all have dreams, desires and perhaps some us dont have the necessary courage to follow our dreams - and courage is the language that helps you most in understanding the world.I recommend this book to everybody who thinks that life is still beautiful and even to those who believe the opposite - Im sure it will make you change your minds."},{"Title":"L'Alchimiste (Coffragants) (French Edition)","review":"Sure this is an interesting book.

It focuses on one particular branch of Gypsies and the clan warfare that made their clan the ascendant one and its leader, Tene Bimbo, the self-proclaimed King of the Gypsies.The author presents an unvarnished look at Gypsies. He notes their insularity and clannishness, their lives lived on the fringes of mainstream society, and the classic cons by which they survive. Scorning education, nine-to-five jobs, and anyone outside of their cultural milieu, they are a fascinating group of people with their own complex rules and regulations by which they live.The book also relates an ongoing and violent family feud, between Tene Bimbo's son, Carranza, and his grandson, Steve, Carranza's son. It is a feud that was exacerbated when King Tene Bimbo died and left his legacy to Steve, bypassing Carranza. What was more surprising was that Steve had rejected the traditional Gypsy lifestyle and was trying to lead a more mainstream life, urging others to do the same.This is a well written, well researched book that provides a fascinating glimpse of a group of people and a lifestyle about which little is known. Gypsies definitely live lives that are outside the parameters of accepted norms of behavior. Those who have an interest in other cultures, as well as those with an interest in the true crime genre, will certainly enjoy this book, which has six pages of black and white photographs."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"By the author of SERPICO and THE VALACHI PAPERS.The incredible but true story of the mysterious, intrigue-filled world of the gypsy -- a world of bloody tribal vendettas and vicious swindles that swirl unseen and unnoticed around us.Most gypsies cling to centuries-old taboos and rituals, don't pay taxes and can't read or write. Yet they flourish from coast to coast, drive Cadillacs and Lincoln Continentals, and have turned thievery into an art form. You will learn how they do it in this irresistible book.A masterful play-by-play expose of gypsy violence, revenge, con games, and shams as well as an amazing collection of gyspsy folklore.A book, like all of Peter Maas novels, that was turned into a movie starring Sterling Hayden, Judd Hirsch, Annette O'Toole, Annie Potts, Eric Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Brooke Shields, and Shelley Winters."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"The Bimgo clan of Gypsies is perhaps the most notorious of allthe clans, according to Peter Maas. For one thing, they operate inNew York and Chicago - gangster towns. But they differ from the Mafiain that they pare primarily con artists and thieves - not murderers(unless cornered) and their women are never prostitutes.SinceGypsies have begun traveling in cars instead of horses and coveredwagon caravans, they've become even more invisible. There are Gypsiesnow on all of the continents of the Earth with many tribes - theKalderasha, the Lowara, Tshurana, Muchwaya, among others. Mostanciently, they were musicians, fortune tellers, coppersmiths - butnever farmers. Now they are all of the above as well as con artistsextraordinaire.&quot;The success of any good con hinges on takingthe victim where he wants to go,&quot; quotes the author from a policereporter. &quot;These women are very, very good. You can even go inthere knowing it's a setup, and they'll have you unstrung in minutes.Sometimes when they're operating like that, I think they believe itthemselves.&quot;Popular wisdom says they came from India sincetheir Romany language has Sanskrit roots, but they all count in Greek(probably beginning from the time when Alexander the Great brought atroupe of Gypsey musicians, actors, fortune tellers, and metelsmithsto Macedonia). They have intermarried and absorbed cultural practicesfrom every country they have traveled through, but the Roma remaindistinct and independent - and obstinately illiterate. They refuse tosend their children to &quot;Gadje&quot; schools (a Sanskrit wordmeaning warrior - or 'non-gypsey'). If pressure by the local populaceto put their children in school becomes too great - they move on. Butthey didn't move fast enough during the holocaust because almost asmany Gypsies as Jews went to the gas chambers.This book chroniclesthe true story of King Tene and Queen Mary Bimbo - the King and queenof the Gypsies in New York, where they rented store fronts and thewomen practiced the Boojo - an elaborate con game designed to separatewealthy Gadje from their money. In an interview with an old Gypseymatriarch, Aunt Hazel, Maas recorded her statement that, &quot;Allright, she said with a massive shrug, &quot;it's true that we stealwith the hands, but you Gadje - you Americans - YOU steal with thepencils.&quot; Her voice rose. &quot;And how many Gypsies you seegoing to jail for 20, 50 years for murderings and rapings andmuggings?&quot;King Tene Bimbo and Queeen Mary had a son, CarranzaTene, an alcoholic, who was disliked by other Gypsies and wasparticularly brutal with his own family. He forced his daughters tomarry while he pocketed the large bride prices (women are veryvaluable to Gypsey cultures as they are ususally the primarybreadwinners - especially now in modern society). Carranza's son,Steve Tene, freed one of his sisters from a hateful marriage, therebyincurring the wrath of his father. But then the old Granfather died -King Tene - and bypassed Carranza, his eldest son, and on hisdeathbed, gave the gold ring and medallion of Gypsey Kingship to hisgrandson, Steve Tene, who is the subject of this bookCarranza putan uncharacteristically Gypsey contract on his son's head - attemptingto kill him many times - but the Gypsies honored the old man's lastwishes and gave Steve Tene his grandfather's gold medallion and ring.(There is a picture in the book of the handsome Steve - he looks likeOmar Sherif) wearing the ring and holding the medallion with a bemusedexpression on his face. He didn't WANT to be King of the Gypsies.His only pronoucements as King have been to encourage Gypsieseverywhere to become educated and get into the legitmate professions.They are a very intelligent people. Steve has his champions and hisdetractors. All this stuff is still going on and last I've heard,Steve Tene is still alive and still King.I can't imagine why thisbook is out of print. The author is also the author of *Serpico*. Anexcellent movie was made by the same title and is still available onamazon.com. It stars such notables as Susan Sarandon, Eric Roberts, ayoung Brooke Shields, and even Shelly Winters. The film takes someliberties (has Steve throwing the ring and medallion into hisgrandfather's grave. Didn't happen). But for the most part, themovie follows the book, which is a true story, and yet many are underthe impression that the movie is wholly fiction. It's not.Foranyone who has become as fascinated as I have with this most ancientculture (and I believe their origins are much more ancient than India)this is a must-read. These are real interviews with real people and anumber of interesting photographs of real Gypsies are included - notsome scholarly tome to be moldering away on the shelves of theunread.Peter Maas put all the the investigatory power and insightthat went into *Serpico* into this book, and I think it should see asecond printing..."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died.

But words--once they are written--will always bear weight. And stereotypes, unfortunately, will continue to exist unless they are challenged. While King of the Gypsies is well-researched (the author used actual news files to document his sources), it continues to promote the same familiar stereotypes of Gypsies. Again we see Gypsies portrayed as stealing, conniving, mafia-like people engaged in organized crime, fortune telling, and deadly tribal vendettas. While I do not doubt that this portrayal is supported in police records, I do wish the narrative had been better balanced. Not all Gypsies are thieves. Just like not all Italians belong to the Mafia. Nor all Muslims are extremists. I know intrigue is what sells books, but a little inclusion of alternative points of view/realities can make for even more interesting reading."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"This is from the same author as Serpico, and he is noticeably more comfortable when writing about police procedure and entanglements with the gypsies than their actual lives. However, Maas does give a good intro to life of the Roma in America and is quite informative with regard to the way roma sustain themselves in America. The lives of American Roma are vastly different than those of European Roma. The personal narrative of Steve Tene is powerful as a story on its own. And as any rom knows, there are no kings."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"This is an intriguing work of non-fiction about Gypsies and the lives that they lead here in the United States.

It's divided into four parts. Parts I and IV are primarily about a youth named Steve Tene whom author Peter Maas befriends. Not only is Steve a gypsy, he is gypsy royalty. But because of a loutish, abusive father, Steve makes a break with gypsy life and tries to become part of mainstream American society.Part II is a short history lesson of how gypsies over the centuries have lived as nomads traveling from their probable place of origin in northern India, through the Middle East, into Europe and Northern Africa and eventually to the New World. This part of the book also gives descriptions of classic gypsy swindles and even cites, in detail, real life con jobs taken from actual court proceedings.Part III is about Steve Tene's grandfather King Tene Bimbo, the self proclaimed leader of American gypsies. It describes his crime ridden life and his heavy handed efforts to achieve and hold onto power. To the surprise of gypsies everywhere, while on his deathbed, King Tene bequeaths the symbols of leadership to none other than his prodigal grandson Steve.Of course, \\"The King of the Gypsies\\" is not a scholarly text. There isn't a single footnote and much of what is presented is anecdotal at best. It does, however succeed at being quite entertaining while at the same time giving some very interesting insights into how gypsies have maintained their identity over the centuries despite having no flag, no homeland and no religion of their own.One cannot read this book without being conscious of the fact that gypsies are the only ethnic group it remains okay to talk about in disparaging terms. When the antisocial behavior of members of any other ethnic minority is discussed, it is done so with the understanding that outside factors like poverty, racism, discrimination, etc. are very much a large part of the picture. Moreover, it is always made clear that the individuals exhibiting bad behavior do not accurately represent the ethnic group as a whole. Not so with gypsies.This book reinforces and expands on the widely held perception that antisocial behavior comes part and parcel with gypsy culture itself.Examples of such negative perceptions are: Gypsies do not pay taxes nor do they answer census questionaires. They do not send their kids to school. They refuse to participate in gainful employment. Their sworn testimony in a court of law is meaningless. And most importantly they have nothing but utter contempt for the gadjo, that is anyone who is not a gypsy.I found this cogent, easy to read work to be exceedingly thought provoking. Why does political correctness apply to discussions of every ethnic group except gypsies? And what can gypsy culture teach us about the very concept of ethnicity?"},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"I had this book in Hard copy and it got lost some years ago,I love the book and will probably by another hardback, but the paper back will do for now."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"I believe that not all Gypsy people are evil or criminals but this book gives a great insight to the lifestyle.

What was more surprising was that Steve had rejected the traditional Gypsy lifestyle and was trying to lead a more mainstream life, urging others to do the same.This is a well written, well researched book that provides a fascinating glimpse of a group of people and a lifestyle about which little is known. Gypsies definitely live lives that are outside the parameters of accepted norms of behavior. Those who have an interest in other cultures, as well as those with an interest in the true crime genre, will certainly enjoy this book, which has six pages of black and white photographs."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"I bought this book on ebay, as it's been out-of-print for years. Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's. The telephone psychic industry probably cut into the market for fortune-tellers, so I wonder if the women now have regular jobs?"},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"Peter Maas (author or Serpico and the Valachi Papers) writes a startling true tale of Gypsies in America. Anyone interested in true crime, or organized ethnic crime groups, or the trials of people swimming upstream into assimilation after arriving in America will find this book fascinating. Candid without being crude or bigoted, the author treats the subject matter and his protagonist fairly and respectfully. A great companion to &#60;Hastened to the Grave&#62; a true crime paperback about the living cousins of this book's protagonist."},{"Title":"King of the Gypsies","review":"This is the biography of someone who was really a Gypsy...a Gypsy \\"King\\", no less. A lot of New Agers, Wiccans, occult types try to claim the stories about Gypsies and their occult con games are propaganda. This book tells the real story of Gypsies and their bunco swindles, and it comes straight form the horse's mouth. It details how Gypsies used con games (apparently right up until 1978 when the book was written and beyond) to earn a living, including phony \\"occult\\" scams played upon gullible non-gypsies or \\"bujos\\", such as fortunetelling, psychics, curses, and also more mundane scams, such as having their kids swallow diamond rings at posh jewlery stores and later collecting the \\"rewards\\" as nature took its course. A must have book for anyone interested in debunking the occult."},{"Title":"An Antebellum Plantation Household: Including the South Carolina Low Country Receipts and Remedies of Emily Wharton Sinkler with Eighty-Two Newly Dis (Women's Diaries and Letters of the South)","review":"This book was very interesting! I particularly enjoyed the letters back and forth between Emily and her family in PA and seeing how much cooking has changed (and not changed!). There are a couple of the 'receipts' I intend to try when I can for my family meals! I also was fascinated by the pictures of the family and actually getting to put 'faces' with what I was reading! Good book and excellent value to add to my library (-:"},{"Title":"James Dean (Sutton Pocket Biographies)","review":"I concur with the other reviewer on most points stated. It's an easy, simple read, and unobtrusive mentally as well as physically. However...I feel that some subjects ARE danced around, rather than dealt with. Issues of sex/sexuality are, at best, skimmed. I have no interest in minute by minute detailing of sexual encounters. But to bypass whole realms of sexual exploration of such a dynamic young man is unfair to the curious reader. I also disagree with the notion that this IS OK for a first time reader. I'm of the mind that your first venture into someones life (especially Dean!) should be commited and enlightening. Here you will find little more than could be learned from a 30 minute t.v. blurb on Dean. I voraciously consume all Dean bios, hence I bought this regardless of my suspicions (and later confirmations) about its shortcomings. I 'liked' the book, but can see no REAL NEED for this book in a serious collection. It's fantastic for someone doing an essay or report on Dean-it might even make them a true fan. But please buy a book that will not only draw you in completely, but leave you with a full knowledge of all sides of James Dean. Buy &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot; by Joe Hyams,&quot;James Dean-Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; by Paul Alexander, and &quot;James Dean-Mutant King&quot; by David Dalton. These are of a worthy caliber to display proudly in a personal collection of LITERATURE."},{"Title":"James Dean (Sutton Pocket Biographies)","review":"The editor describes the Sutton Pocket Biographies as \\"Highly readable brief lives of those who have played a significant part in history, and whose contributions still influence contemporary culture\\". This phrase neatly summarizes &quot;James Dean&quot; by William Hall very well.It is a short book, about 100 small pages. Almost 50 years since his death, James Dean still has a substantial influence on contemporary culture. The book covers the principal facts and chronology of James Dean's short life. There is no whitewashing of gay issues, no unsubstantiated unsavory speculations and no new material. As such it is a useful and inexpensive book for someone who wants \\"Just give me the facts, m'am\\". It is a useful introduction to the life of James Dean if this is the first biography that you are reading. True die-hard fans will want more."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2","review":"This edition of Oscar Wilde's work - in addition to its inclusion of much personal correspondence - is a fascinating look at the author and, notably, his personal travails.The novel, of course, and the plays are classics, but I found the letters to be a juicy narrative all their own. The twists and turns of his doomed affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, affectionately called \\"Bosie\\" in touching - and bitter - love notes from prison, are here to peruse. Reading them, you get a sense of Wilde's personal feelings at the time of his famed trial and arrest for sodomy, his anguish at losing Bosie and going to jail. It's fascinating, juicy stuff - made all the more touching by the fact that it all occurred without shame, in plain view, over 100 years ago.Wilde's a great character, a great author, a good role model for gay life and a hysterical wit. And this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2","review":"Edited by Richard Aldington. Stories include the picture of dorian gray, salome, the importance of being earnest, de profundis, many poems and the selfish giant."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2","review":"For the reader who has never experienced Oscar Wilde's work before, this collection serves as a fabulous in-depth introduction. Included are Wilde's most well-known works, including \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\" Both are absolutely superb pieces of literature. Also included are a fascinating letter written by Wilde while in prison, an essay on art and criticism, poetry, and personal letters and anecdotes. Serious students of Wilde might want to considering reading a more complete collection, but for a casual fan of classic literature, it's hard to beat this selection. Oscar Wilde should definitely be read by anyone who appreciates a sharp wit and profound intellect."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2","review":"The Penguin/Viking \\"Portable\\" series make for great intros to many of the world's finest writers, and this edition is no exception. Wilde was a tortured man, living a double life which ultimately led to his imprisonment and bankruptcy in Victorian England. His writings reflect the dichotomy he faced in both is personal life and artistic endeavors during that period.Beginning with a solid life intro, and discussion of the writings by the editors, the collection begins with his essay \\"The Critic as Artist\\", setting the stage for the follow on plays, prose and poetry that follow.The next work is \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" in its entirety. The novel reads reminds this reader of Dostoyevsky, and examines the duality of a life artificially lived, and the hiddenness of the soul and the effect of sin on the soul and visage of the man. Somewhat biographical to all men, Dorian Gray takes on even more poignancy when read against the backdrop of Wilde's own life.Also contained in the compilation are the plays \\"Solome\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", one a tragedy and the other a comedy. Included in the poetry is \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\", a haunting expose of the prison life and soul rending experience of Wilde while in prison. There are other short stories and a collection of letters as well, including a letter to his lover entitled \\"De Profundis\\".In all, this is a great intro to Wilde. I had never read any of his works prior to picking up this volume, and am now richer for the experience. A fine author, and a tragic figure - his tribulations come through in his work, and provide the reader with an appreciation of the man and his times."},{"Title":"The Portable Oscar Wilde: 2","review":"Oscar Wilde was a master of prose. No student of English literature should ignore him; they might not agree with him on a thousand things (even Wilde felt it was perfectly acceptable for him to disagree with himself) but his wit, his humor, and most importantly his love of beautiful things, must not be tossed aside. Wilde was a genius and a master of the English word."},{"Title":"A Fistful of Agates","review":"This moving, emotional book should be required reading for every parent!It is a collection of letters and essays Wipf wrote to her son, Tommy, during and shortly after his death from a rare genetic disease. It is incredibly powerful. You will cry, you will laugh, you will be touched and changed by this book. In my opinion, Wipf has given us one of the most intimate, touching and honest books ever written.Mostly, of course, her letters are heart-breaking in their joy and love for her son, but the greatest gift is her honesty. At times she is angry. At times her Tommy is... well, a little boy, full of mischief and profoundly annoying. He may be sick with a deadly disease, but he still wants what he wants, right now! Those letters, by themselves, will be profoundly healing for anyone who has lost a loved one and feels guilt or confusion or shame over the range of their emotions, which naturally include anger at times.Having read this marvelous little book, I am changed. The morning air seems fresher, my wife's touch seems warmer and more precious. As the Buddhists say, all things are &quot;impermanent&quot; and we must hold onto the joys and riches of life while we can.Do yourself a favor and get this little book! First, read it. Then, share it with people you love. Give a copy to someone who has lost a loved one to illness or tragedy. Ms Wipf has done something magnificent and those who read her words will be wiser and more joyful for it.I was amazed and a bit disheartened when my local bookstore didn't have it. I was even more surprised when I found I was the first one to review it at Amazon! This book deserves to be on your shelf - for your own growth, and so you'll be able to give to someone who needs it when the time comes.

I love the cover and the story behind the agates which in its own way sets the tone for the entire book. Jane is indeed a most gifted writer, and I thank her for sharing her intimate journey with all of us. Her letters to her young son are her way of dealing with her grief over his terminal illness and his eventual death, but they are so much more. They are a gift to all of us who have ever suffered a loss or who have ever had to hold fast to our faith when we found ourselves on an unfamiliar journey where we had to find our way step by step.

This book allowed me see death from a different perspective and helped me through an unexpected death of a loved one just months after I finished the book. Thanks Jane for opening your heart to all of us!!"},{"Title":"A Fistful of Agates","review":"The book is a very touching book that deals with a mother's dealing with a child born with a terminal illness, but the book could have used a good edit as many of her entries seemed repetitive.

If you've ever read \\"A Study in Emerald\\" by Neil Gaiman and enjoyed it, then, the Anno Dracula series is for you. Gaiman, in fact, help plot the first story, which is full of winks and nods to the fiction of the time.In any event, the story of What Happened After Dracula is fascinating. Told from a half-dozen different perspectives (all which wind up intertwining), Kim Newman crafted an intricate, enjoyable universe. His prose is tight, and he doesn't bother trying to explain everything off the bat. Personally, I like having to pay attention to what I'm reading, so this was fun.I'm almost through \\"The Bloody Red Baron,\\" the sequel to this book, and I'm still enjoying it.

At times it seemed that the author was trying to pull in every character (real and fictional) of the period that they possibly could, which made the book very difficult to follow and distracted from the development of the main characters. The book is quite descriptive of gory and almost gratuitous violence. Definitely not a book that I would read again, and I have no interest in the sequels."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"It wasn't a bad read...a little weird sometimes, but it was a book about vampires so it needed to be weird.

I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net.

I bought the book as I am a big fan of both Holmes and Dracula stories, but despite the sometimes colorful characters, it was a tedious read."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I'm no \\"Grammar Nazi,\\" but if you're going to write a period novel as a follow-up to one of the most beloved English-language horror stories ever written, then your English grammar had better be spot on. Not to mention the story is, of course, SET in England and is written by an English author - hey, it's YOUR language, Newman! Learn to write it!Having struggled through 40 of so pages of meandering run-on sentences, dreary soliloquies and confusing dialogue, I had to put this book down for good. After all, one can ask oneself, \\"Wait, who the heck is talking now?!!\\" only so many times before losing interest.I understand that the author is trying to emulate Stoker's style, but the writing comes across as cluttered, clumsy and dull. I'll just say that this is the first book I've not finished in... well, I don't know how long! Great premise, interesting cameos... but BOO! BOO to the writer! Poorly written and tedious - literally, TEDIOUS to read.Dental work with a dust jacket, that's my summary of \\"Anno Dracula.\\"Looking for a beautifully crafted period novel with a supernatural theme? Try Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.\\" Just leave THIS dreary Dracula book in its crypt.

I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I bought Kim Newman's book 'Dracula Cha Cha Cha' a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it so much I resolved to buy the other books in the series. However, they appear to be out of print, and 'Anno Dracula' was only available through Amazon's (excellent) second hand book sales facility.I was delighted when the book arrived, and the book itself lived up to my anticipation. There are so many literary and historical allusions to the era (1880s / 1890s )and part of the fun is seeing how many you know or can understand. They add to rather than detract from the excellent story telling.This book should really be reissued."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Kim Newman acknowledges Howard Waldop (among many others) in the back of this book, with the note, \\"I'm not worthy.\\" I disagree. Newman has his own take on alternate history, and there's room enough for him, even around the legendary Waldrop. In all actuality, Anno Dracula isn't alternate history--it's alternate fiction, because Newman's stepping off point from the norm isn't in any history book, but Bram Stoker's Dracula (in fact, on page 249 of Leonard Wolf's annotated edition, recently updated as The Essential Dracula). To compare Newman with another author, you might say that Anno Dracula is the horror novel that Philip Jose Farmer would have written if he still did that sort of thing (instead of collaborating with that ... Piers Anthony), for Anno Dracula also pulls in Inspector Lestrade, Dr. Jekyll, Dr. Moreau, Mycroft Holmes, among others. In fact, after awhile, I started wondering if my pulp education had missed something in that I did not recognize where the protagonist, Charles Beauregard, came from (although I did finally recognize the origin of Genevieve from the references to Camilla). There's one page that reads as an homage to all the vampires in fiction, and any vampire trivia fan's nightmare. But Anno Dracula is more than a mere bundle of literary in-jokes. It's also a well-written adventure novel, in the vein (pun intended) of Tim Powers, to mention yet another author. While it is marketed as a horror novel, and has a requisite amount of gore and teeth, I felt that the noveau term \\"dark fantasy\\" fits it better, or even steampunk, to once again compare it to Powers and books like The Anubis Gates and Jeter's Infernal Devices. I used to read Interzone fairly regularly, and Newman was quite a staple of that magazine in recent years. I was never overly impressed by his writing there, although I recognized that he had talent. Given Anno Dracula, however, I'd be willing to give Newman several other chances."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"One of the best vampires books ever written.

Now it's 'in' to be a vampire, and vampires areappearing in all walks of life, but someone in Whitechapelis killing off the vampire whores. We are re-introduced tothe characters from the original Bram Stoker novel, but asan added bonus to history and literature fans, there arecameo appearances from some of the greatest characters fromthe literature and history of the Victorian era, from Jackthe Ripper to Sherlock Holmes, and even a friendly jab atAnne Rice. A definite MUST read for any vampire/history/literaturefan."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully &quot;out&quot;. Living people (referred to as &quot;warm&quot;) flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"When an author bases a large part of his story on characters 'borrowed' from someone else, it's usually a bad sign. Nine times out of ten it means the author couldn't create something original and so resorted to piggy-backing on the success of a better writer.Fortunately, Kim Newman is an exception to this rule. He works with other people's characters because it's something he does very well. The 'celebrity cameos' come across as real people, true to their original authors, and he resists the temptation to overuse them - several of the most famous remain in the shadows, never actually named in the novel.His &quot;what-if&quot; treatment of a world where vampirism is no secret is also convincing and thoroughly researched; bloodsucking and the machinations of Victorian England make for a weird and wonderful combination. What happens to society when the leading players no longer die to make room for a new generation? How do the 'warm' deal with vampiric friends and colleagues?As other reviewers have noted, Newman's main weakness is in his endings. The story starts well, gets even better as it builds and builds... and then suddenly it's as if he had to finish it before he hit the back cover. On a second reading the ending seems a little less abrupt, but a less hurried tying-up of ends would still have been appreciated. That's a minor criticism, though, of what's otherwise a very good book. If you haven't read any of Kim Newman's work before, this is a good place to start; the good news is that the sequels are just as good as the original."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This was a unique take on the Dracula tale, a sort of continuation of the Stoker version but with a major twist: Dracula marries Queen Victoria. Instead of being fearful specters of the night, vampires become a sort of social fad--everyone's doing it. The author creates a social hierarchy of vampires, providing interesting descriptions as to their bloodlines to their style while holding true to historical Victorian social ettiqute, at least for the mortals. Newman definitely expanded the original Stoker concept of what and who is a vampire. I particularly enjoyed Genevieve's character. She is a feisty female who shows both the positives and drawbacks of being a vampire. The characters were engaging, as was the storyline--until the end. The story ended too quickly, especially with all of the buildup to the climax. I would love to read a sequel! The author does provide an alternative ending, but I would still like a sequel as to how Genevieve's life continues."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"If you don't like to mix timelines or book heros then this is not for you but if you like to mix it up this is the one."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I hate vampires but I liked this book. Once you get past the first several chapters of meeting characters and back story, things get moving. The literary allusions are fun when you catch them,( and if you don't, you can check the last pages of the book after you finish the story). The story which really gets rolling after several chapters is rich and well structured. The characters are real and a bit unpredictable. I found that I really did like more of them than I thought I would. The relationships between people - vampires and not -- are fascinating. I think becoming a vampire heightens the good and the bad in the people. I found myself really caring about what would happen to them. To me, that is one of the marks of a good book. The depictions of power and power relationships is convincing. To say more would be a spoiler so this is it from me on this book."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Purchased it because Amazon suggested it.

I feel it my duty to comment on the last 20 pages, which are as deeply haunting as they are unforgettable. In those pages, the detective protagonist finally confronts the Prince of Vampires, and Kim Newman shows he is a true wizard of imagery. Dracula's court is a mixture of Bram Stoker's vision and an Hieronymous Bosch painting, and leaves an undelible mark on the reader."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This book, one of the best vampire books ever writen will captivate your mind and your body for the whole ride. Prepare yourself for the knowledge of what happened after Bram's book, why Bram's wrote it and a lot more"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Finally a literature piece about a halfway decent, but realistically scary story with a very moving plot."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"In 1885, Count Dracula came to London to spread vampirism into the heart of Victorian England. But in this retelling of (literary) history, Van Helsing did not defeat Dracula; rather, Dracula succeeded, marrying Queen Victoria and becoming Prince Consort. Now, in 1888, vampires fill positions of power--but also the streets of Whitechapel, where a murderer is killing and mutilating young vampire prostitutes. The attempt to catch him brings together a upper class adventurer named Charles Beauregard and an ancient vampire elder named Genevieve Diuedonne. A clever concept that intertwines alternate history with horror and includes many familiar faces (including, of course, Jack the Ripper, known here as the Silver Knife), this is a promising political intrigue enrichened by vampires that, unfortunately, falls flat. Although the horror is indeed gruesome, the plot is detailed, and the vampires are skillfully conceived, the book's premise is impossible to believe and the writing style is cheap at best (and desperately in need of an editor at worst). This is a swift read and holds a lot of promise, but it is also, frankly, quite bad. I don't recommend it.This premise as well as the character cameos create a promising and interesting starting place for the book. The Victorian setting, touching both on high society and the slums of Whitechapel, the characters which range from vampire elders to Jack the Ripper to minute appearances from even Oscar Wilde, and finally the vampires, conceived in thoughtful detail and as well as gruesome horror, certainly seems promising. And to his credit, Newman conceives and explores his plot well: it's a detailed combination of horror and history and politics, knitted together neatly but not too simply, and so remains interesting, readable, and both logical and unpredictable.But the premise does not live up to its potential by a long shot. Instead, the book is bogged down by an underlying fault in the premise as well as poor storytelling. The premise's flaw is that Queen Victoria married Count Dracula prior to the start of the book, and that by the time of the book his plan to take control over England has proceeded largely without difficulty. Vampires roam the streets, and more are being reborn into vampirism every day--including those in the upper class. All of this, despite the fact that Dracula remains excessive, appalling, and violent as ever. Why is there no social resistance to vampirism? The book makes a big deal of it, but there is clearly no major social backlash--or the vampires would not have gotten so far. Jack the Ripper killing vampires makes more sense than anything else in the book, including the social struggles between the vampires and the \\"warm\\" and new politics including vampire rulers, in particular a vampire as Prince Consort. Despite the careful scripting and weaving of disparate threads and concepts, the result is a premise and plot that are, for lack of a better word, impossible, thus tainting the rest of the book with the reader's disbelief.Worse than the premise is, unfortunately, the writing. The book depends on short chapters to keep the plot moving and repeated ellipses to create a sense of urgency (especially in the later chapters), and with constant errors in punctuation and capitalization it is in dire need of an editor. By contrast, there is nothing about the writing that stands out as artful, skillful, or even simply good. To an extent, the short chapters and simple writing keep the book moving smoothly and help to simplify what could be an overly complex plot, but on the whole the bad writing style is just that: bad. So, despite the promise of the premise, the unfeasible plot and the poor writing make this a disappointing, lackluster novel. I appreciate the attempt, but I didn't enjoy the product, and I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"the vampire novel and the alternate history. Those that accuse the author of name dropping must realize that it is customary in a &quot;what-if&quot; story, just to see who survived the change from the reality we all know and expect. Newman's skill lies in tapping the richness of real and literary Victorian London. His other smart move was keeping Dracula off-stage for most of the book. As one character states, Dracula has his own gravity, and the mere whisper of his name has ripple effects throughout the story, as it does in real life. Fans of horror and speculative history should really enjoy this book and the sequels that come after."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I, like many of the other reviewers here, had never even heard of Kim Newman...until &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; caught my eye in the bargain-bin at my local half-priced book store. It looked like it might be interesting, so I wagered the 50 cent cost that it would be. Well to my pleasant surprise it was good! Newman does an excellent job weaving fiction and non-fiction...particularly the events surrounding the real-life Jack the Ripper, a topic I too have always been fascinated with (in fact I found myself not only reading this book for the pure enjoyment of it, but also often stopping and comparing Newman's version of Jack the Ripper with non-fiction books on that subject I also own...he did an impressive and believable job with his &quot;alternate/vampire&quot; version). I guess the only thing that was distracting for me was Newmans portrayal of vampirism as simply another way of &quot;life&quot;...to the point that it was commonplace in society...even &quot;tres chic&quot;. But after finishing the novel and reflecting on it, as written it does make sense. But I have to admit it took a long time for me to &quot;familiarize&quot; myself with his version of vampires...took at least 100 pages just to figure out exactly what was going on in his world! (e.g. vampires having careers, working alongside regular people, etc. I guess I'm still biased to the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; notion of vampires as purely evil and scary who live in coffins...not as furry, shapeshifting hookers, genial newspaper reporters, or possible girlfriends as is the case with Newmans vampires!). But anyway, I'm glad I stayed with it though the potentially confusing initial setup, because the novel as a whole turned out to be a fun and thoroughly enjoyable read. I recommend it, too. (Oh, and I'll also admit that the &quot;name-dropping&quot; of famous people of that era who pop in and out of the story at any given time (those both fictional and non-fictional) added to the fun too...but I will say that having the Elephant Man &quot;save the day&quot; at the end was really pushing it!) :-)"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Too much filler.

The pecking order among the undead is based on their time after re-birth.Strength grows as time passes."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Newman offers a vivid recreation of the Victorian era, but with a sly twist. Jack the Ripper prowls Whitechapel killing prostitutes in a most brutal manner. But, as it turns out, this madman is Jack Seward, one of the vampire hunters known to devotee's of Bram Stoker's Dracula. In Newman's universe, however, Seward and his pals, Harker and Van Helsing, are defeated by Dracula. This Prince of Wallachia, also known as Vlad Tepes is now Prince Consort, Lord Protector and, husband to Queen Victoria. For the elite of society it becomes important to cultivate prominent vampire friends of the Prince, and if possible to convince one of these creatures to \\"turn\\" them. This social game goes on at all levels. Even the prostitutes killed by Jack the Ripper are vampires - although a diseased, sickly variety - whose lives remain as hellish as before.There are many characters mixed up in the race to find the Ripper and stop the killings. Among these are two of note, one a \\"warm\\" police detective, McKenzie, who does his duty while cringing at the brutality of Dracula's minions, and the other, Kostaki, a soldier companion of the Prince who \\"turned\\" at the same time, and goes about doing Dracula's bidding - impaling still the punishment of choice. Yet in their efforts to track the Ripper, Kostaki and McKenzie find a grudging respect for one another. Kostaki even demonstrates a glimmer of a conscience reawakened through his association with the mortal detective.One of the most charming characters in recent vampire fiction is Genevieve, who received her dark kiss 500 years before, making her even older than Vlad Tepes. This gives her a bit of an advantage in society for among vampires age is greatly revered. She works as a nurse among the poor, a ministering angel loved by warms and vampires alike. It is she along with her mortal lover Beauregard, who must in the end confront the evil Prince Dracula.This story engages on many levels. Besides being literate and witty it describes the social swirls that pervaded the late nineteenth century. Newman also gathers an ensemble of Victorian characters - historical and fictional. Part of the fun of reading this novel is seeing where they will pop up. The author has created an engrossing, entertaining story that will appeal to a wide variety of readers. (A shorter, earlier version of this story appeared under the title Red Reign in the anthology, The Mammoth Book of Vampires, edited by Stephen Jones.)"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"For me, Steampunk started with this book. It brought to me the beauty and anachronisms of the Victorian culture mixed with the surprises and action of modern sci/fi. My wife, who loves vampire stories probably even more than I do, had never read the book and when I went about trying to find a copy of it for her, it seemed impossible. Thank god for the internet (and to a lesser extent, Amazon). I was finally able to get a used hardback for a sum that wasn't too insulting. My wife tore through it and loved the weirdness as much as I do. It is crazy that this book has not had a recent reprint. Who ever is responsible for that should be slapped once or twice."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This was a real find for me. Having loved and taught the original \\"Dracula,\\" I was transfixed by every page. Not to say that you need to have studied the original to enjoy this one - it's a thrilling, multi-layered novel that any fan of good writing should love. However, if you are a fan of the original story, this is an absolute must. This edition is also very special, as it contains annotations at the conclusion that explain all of the different characters and ideas referenced in the novel, as well as Newman's thought-process as he constructed this extraordinary world. I was amazed to find that it had gone out of print after its original publication; I suppose we can credit the current vampire craze to its being reissued. Regardless, it's a must for genre fans!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. How would the presence of vampires change Victorian, England? This is exactly what Mr. Kim Newman tackles in his thriller novel 'Anno Dracula'. Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this! I hope they continue with the sequel Anno Dracula: The Bloody Red Baron, which takes place in 1918, or I will have to get crafty and find an old copy myself!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I'm a fan of alternate history more then I am of vampires. But having always had an interest in Bram Stoker's Dracula I was surprised to learn via a documentary on vampire novels that the two had been combined together into one novel by British critic and novelist Kim Newman. Anno Dracula is a fine example of the alternate history genre, combining the what might have been in reality with one of literature's great tales of horror.The novel's premise is a simple yet interesting one to be sure. What if Van Helshing and his followers failed to stop Count Dracula and the vampire took over Britain? Newman combines this with the Victorian London (and to a lesser extent Britain) of both real and fiction. The plot hinges on the mysterious murders of vampire prostitutes being committed by the serial killer known first as Silver Knife and then as Jack The Ripper. Newman has clearly done his research as he creates an entire panoramic portrait of this world that combines the best and worst of the era with vampires. Perhaps even more surprising is how seamlessly everything fits together, changing a detail here or there to fit this nation overrun by vampires. Newman's version of the society is a perfect example of this as people of all classes begin converting to being vampires in an attempt to rise in social status. In fact perhaps the novel's best written section is chapter thrirty-eight which in incredible detail shows us the aftermath of a character choosing to take this action for herself. All of this means that Newman's Victorian London under vampire control is one of the most incredible worlds to ever an alternate story.Newman fills this world with a massive cast of characters. To start with there's the lead characters of the vampire Genevieve Dieudonne and the human Charles Beauregard who are sent to investigate the Ripper murders. While they couldn't be much more different from each other ( Genevieve is a vampire older then Dracula in the body of a sixteen year old while Charles is a thirty-five or so year old adventurer) the two of them share a great chemistry, particularity as both are world weary from their respective lifetimes. It is through them, and their respective views of this world, that the reader is shown not only this world but the large cast of supporting characters. These supporting characters includes those who really existed such as Sir Charles Warren, Florence Stoker (wife of guess who), the victims of Jack the Ripper and Oscar Wilde amongst others. Then there's the cast of fictional characters including characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories (such as Inspector Lestrade and Mycroft Holmes plus the occasional reference to the great detective himself), Inspector Mackenzie and the good doctors Jekyll and Moreau who not only say true to the original characters who fit into this world almost seamlessly with the real ones. There's also characters from Stoker's original novel as well including Dr. Jack Seward who plays a major role in the proceedings of the novel. Queen Victoria and her Prince Consort, the infamous count from Transylvania himself, only appear in the novel's ending but their appearance is well worth the wait as it makes for an incredible and unforgettable finale. The result is a novel that is not only full of an incredible setting but a lush and diverse tapestry of characters as well.In my opinion, Anno Dracula suffers from only one major flaw. While Newman spins an incredible vampire run version of Victorian London is truly fascinating, unfortunately there are a few times when the plot gets hung up on the details of this world which can bring the novel to a bit of a stand still. In short, the details of set dressing overwhelm the plot on a few occasions. Thanfully, and much to Newman's credit as well, he is able to practically pick things up again quickly, which helps to minimize the effect. Which the exception of that occasional flaw, there's little to see wrong with the novel.Anno Dracula is an incredible read to say the very least. It is an alternate world of a Victorian Britain turned vampire occupied by a large cast of characters. The characters, made up of people both real and fictional, make this world truly come alive right down to the novel's incredible finale. While it does get perhaps too marred in details at times, one thing is certain. Anno Dracula is a fine example of not only the vampire novel but alternate history as well."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"\\"Anno-Dracula\\" is an alternative fiction of what might have befallen London if Van Helsing and his fellow vampire-hunters had been unsuccessful in slaying Count Dracula of Bram Stoker's novel. It is now 1888, just a few years since Dracula's invasion of England, and the Vampire King has seduced the widowed Queen Victoria to become the Prince Consort. Now the true power behind the throne of the British Empire, Dracula has brought his medieval sensibilities to Britain, enforcing a draconian rule and consigning his political enemies to concentration camps. Vampires from all over the world have poured into London, where they can live openly. There is a vampire on every street corner, and more people choose to \\"turn\\" every day. But immortality is hardly guaranteed, as these new-borns often fall victim to squalor, violence, or disease.The population is divided into \\"warm\\" and \\"cold\\", living and undead, who co-exist in an uneasy peace. A serial vampire killer is on the loose, eviscerating young vampire prostitutes with a sharp silver implement, one of the few things that can kill a vampire. The Silver Knife is the talk of every strata of London society. The police pursue him, as do more secretive and powerful societies. The Prime Minister, the vampire Lord Ruthven, has put his ambitious prot&eacute;g&eacute; Arthur Holmwood, Lord Godalming, on the case. The Diogenes Club, an organization that serves the Queen behind closed doors, has asked their agent Charles Beauregard to try to find the killer. Meanwhile, a medieval French vampire, Genevieve, cares for sick new-borns and laments the \\"degenerate\\" vampire who now occupies the throne.Kim Newman has overstuffed \\"Anno-Dracula\\" with so many ideas and characters that the reader can hardly keep up. Many of the plot-lines hardy seem necessary and do no more than create confusion. That is the book's shortcoming. The main plot-lines of the Silver Knife, political intriguing against Dracula's regime, Charles' and Genevieve's romance, and Arthur Holmwood's ambition seem more than enough for one novel. But this world where living and un-dead live side-by-side, where people must navigate rapidly changing social norms to advance or preserve themselves, is surprising and fascinating. The social and political upheaval gives no hint of abating. This vampire nation, ruled by pre-modern, un-dead men, attempts to make up for in terror what it lacks in administrative ability. The resulting speculative politics and social mores make \\"Anno-Dracula\\" a must-read for \\"Dracula\\" fans."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This is an obscure books for those into vamp novels. It's set in Victorian England. The characters are superb and the tone is chilling. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"1888 London, and Dracula is hanging out with Queen Victoria, while in Whitechapel, prostitutes are dying strange bloody deaths...It's obvious that the author had a lot of fun writing this, and I had just as much reading it. Historical fact mixed with Newman's particular sense of whimsy and walk on parts from fictional characters from the Victorian era, it's a tremendous mixture.The ending comes a bit too quickly, and old Drac becomes a bit of a comic parody of a vampire lord, but all in all I loved it."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"There are books one simply shouldn't attempt to describe to the casual reader; regardless of merit, they sound not just uninteresting, but deeply silly. In eighth grade I was reading Harry Turtledove's Worldwar tetralogy, and a well-meaning classmate mentioned to our history teacher that I was reading a book about World War II. I was left to explain, \\"Yes, it's an alternate history where World War II is underway... and then aliens invade.\\" Mercifully, I've forgotten what Mr. Dennett's reaction was.The other day I was in the car, reading the new edition of Kim Newman's landmark vampire alternate history Anno Dracula, and I happened to read a passage out to my mother. (For readers familiar with the book, it was the exchange of insults in the pub.) She asked what the book's premise was, and I dutifully replied: \\"Well, it's like Dracula, except Dracula wins and he marries Queen Victoria.\\" Mother was not amused.I suppose it does sound ridiculous, but it isn't really. Dracula was a prince, and his ambitions were not small; had he not been defeated by Van Helsing's merry band, he might well have ingratiated himself with the British royal family, and the consequence would have been the world Newman portrays: a country where vampires have emerged into everyday life, where the best way to advance in high society is to \\"turn\\" and vampire-resisters are dragged off to concentration camps, where the prostitutes of the East End are as likely to offer blood as sex. Unless they're vampires themselves.The story around which Newman's evocation of this alternate England is woven is the author's second quirky stroke of genius: Jack the Ripper is active in this world as well, but all his victims are vampires. The police, urged on by the government, are desperate to find this madman and potential folk hero, and so is the Diogenes Club, a secretive organization devoted to the national interest. The Club's agent, Charles Beauregard, finds himself working alongside the centuries old vampire Genevi&egrave;ve to find the Ripper. But their investigation is complicated by the sheer range of suspects, not to mention a vendetta against Genevi&egrave;ve and an increasingly repressive palace regime.As one might expect, the characters of the novel include several from Dracula-- those, at least, who have survived, including Dr. Seward and Arthur Holmwood. But other Victorian and Edwardian literature is amply represented. One of the police detectives is Inspector Lestrade, while two doctors consulted about the murderer's knowledge and motivations are named Jekyll and Moreau. Vampires from other fiction have flocked to England for safety and freedom. Readers who don't like this sort of cameo appearance are advised not to read Anno Dracula, which is littered with them. For those who enjoy the game of tracking down references, there are plenty of semi-obscure names to identify. Historical figures, from Oscar Wilde to Sir Charles Warren, also appear.But the novel is much more than a complicated game of Where's Waldo. Its world-building, in which real-world issues like sodomy raids and child prostitution are given a vampire twist, is ingenious enough, but it also includes vivid action sequences, intricate political intrigue, and a well-thought-out investigation. The Ripper's identity (itself a brilliant notion) is revealed to the reader early on, turning the book into a howcatchem rather than a whodunit, but allowing a powerful, disturbing insight into the killer's motivations. Anno Dracula is a fast-paced, delightful entertainment, a marvel of storytelling for those who like this sort of thing.The book, first published in the 1990s, has long been out of print, but was recently released in a new edition by Titan Books. In addition to the original text, the new edition includes a number of bonus features: annotations by the author, identifying some of the more obscure references; an afterword on the novel's genesis; an excerpt from the novella \\"Red Reign,\\" which preceded the novel and has a slightly different ending; extracts from Newman's unproduced screenplay for a film version, which includes a few new sequences and some altered characters; \\"Drac the Ripper,\\" an essay on other Ripper/Dracula stories; and \\"Dead Travel Fast,\\" a short story featuring Dracula that, while not formally part of the Anno Dracula universe, could fit into it, and is in any case a sharp, nasty piece dealing with a less-appreciated trait of the vampire.I mention the Anno Dracula universe. Newman followed the original novel with two sequels: The Bloody Red Baron, set during World War I, and Dracula Cha Cha Cha (released in the US under the dull title Judgment of Tears), set in the 1950s. A fourth novel, Johnny Alucard, bringing the series into the present day, has long been in the works. Titan Books now plans to publish the entire series. Anno Dracula came out this month; The Bloody Red Baron (containing a never-before-published novella) will follow in October 2011, while Dracula Cha Cha Cha (with another new novella) will appear in April 2012 and Johnny Alucard in October 2012. Fans of Wold Newton-esque vampire fiction have much to look forward to."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"At the moment I write this, Kim Newman's \\"Anno Dracula\\" is out of print. (Hopefully, by the time you read this, it will be available again.) It baffles me that such a wonderful recent novel (1992) could easily slip out of publication, especially when it is still very popular: apparently used bookstores can't keep this one their shelves for more then a day. With the huge success of Alan Moore's graphic novel \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" you would think this similar blending of Victorian personages, both historical and fictional, would widely available. This is really the dark fantasy version of Moore's heroic graphic novel, and anyone who enjoys either 1) alternative history, 2) vampire novels, or 3) dark fantasy will adore this book and never let their copy out of their greedy reading hands.Mr. Newman imagines Victorian England if the bloodsucking count had been the victor in Dracula. The Count marries Queen Victoria and becomes ruler of an England rapidly becoming the territory of \`new-born' vampires, who seek to be \`turned' so they can rise in rank. Dracula opens up a reign of terror reminiscent of a medieval monarchy, yet still filled with traditional British Vicotrian attitudes. It's a delightful mixed brew of history and gothic darkness.Into this thrilling setting slinks Jack the Ripper (also known as \`Silver Knife'), slashing vampire girls in Whitechapel. Charles Beauregard, a human (or a 'warm' in vampire terms) who works for a secret society, and Genevieve, a vampire of an ancient boodline who has great distate for Dracula's reign both search for the murderer.

It's a Victorian literature lover\`s dream come true -- and one for any fan of dark, exciting, BLOODY good fantasy and horror. Look for a copy, and let's hope it will be back in print soon!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Kim Newman's &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; has one of the most audacious plots imaginable -- let's assume that Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; was non-fiction, and that Dracula defeated his nemesis, Van Helsing. Then, let's assume that Dracula &quot;seduced&quot; Queen Victoria and is now the Prince Consort, effectively ruling Great Britain. Throw in Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Jekyll, John Merrick (the Elephant Man), Jack the Ripper, and even a brief reference to the Lone Ranger(!), and you've got one heck of an amazing world to spin a yarn.Newman's Victorian England is populated by vampires and &quot;warm&quot; humans, and there is little shame in being a vampire. But not every vampire becomes a &quot;lord of darkness&quot; -- Newman shows many vampires scraping by, selling themselves just like the &quot;warm&quot; cheap harlots of London's lower neighborhoods.In that murky world, Jack the Ripper is butchering vampire prostitutes, using vicious silver blades. Two kindred spirits, the &quot;warm&quot; adventurer Charles Beauregard and the ancient vampiress Genevieve, pursue Jack and seek to put a stop to his diabolical ends. Beauregard works at the behest of the mysterious cabal known as the Diogenes Club, a group dedicated to the removal of Dracula's power, while Genevieve chases Jack out of mercy, trying to save the vampire-girls Jack seems hell-bent on savaging.Newman packs &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; with action, unlike other &quot;alternate vampire histories&quot; (granted, a limited genre) like Brian Stableford's &quot;Empire of Fear.&quot; Beauregard's prowess with a sword is easy to grasp, but Genevieve, an &quot;elder&quot; vampire even more ancient and powerful than Dracula, has powers far beyond the grasp of even other vampires. And even Genevieve meets a vampire that she cannot fend off for long, a Chinese horror sure to give more than a few readers nightmares.A detective story that takes place in a London ready to explode in civil war where the &quot;warm&quot; take on the vampires and the vampires fight among themselves, &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; is a lark. Packed with enough gore and gothic eroticism to satisfy the vampire afficionado, &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; rarely goes over the top and manages to stay fairly grounded. A terrifying climactic stand-off between Beauregard, Genevieve, and Dracula ends ominously - Dracula is still out there, and he's not going to take his lumps lying down. Here's looking forward to the next in the series!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I have a terrible habit of half reading books. I started \\"Anno Dracula\\" years ago, only to become distracted and set the story aside. Yet the novel's compelling premise stuck with me: What would have happened if Van Helsing and company had failed to eradicate Dracula?I had to find out. So I exhumed my old paperback and devoured it afresh.Much has been written about Dracula as Victorian \\"invasion\\" literature. Anno Dracula is set in a world where that invasion has succeeded and vampirism has become mainstream--indeed, there is great pressure among the higher classes to turn or be left behind. Needless to say, many of the \\"warm\\" are not pleased, and vampirism becomes a focus of social unrest.The tagline of the new edition's cover (\\"A Gallery of Rogues and Scoundrels\\") sums up a large part of what makes the work so appealing: It would have been a fine alternate history novel on its own, but author Kim Newman doesn't stop at picking up the Dracula storyline.An amazing number of figures from Victorian and vampire fiction are deftly woven into the story--mostly in minor but enjoyable roles alongside fine original characters--creating a metafictional feel. Also, the pages are filled with references to historical figures, social undercurrents and repurposed real-life happenings (for example, much of the plot surrounds the panic caused by a re-imagined Jack the Ripper who preys on undead harlots). Probably, few readers will catch all the references (I sure didn't), but this approach adds depth to the story and supports Newman's vision of a fully realized alternate world.With familiar characters and real people and ideas put into the service of a gripping narrative, Anno Dracula offers, under the guise of fantasy, a brilliant examination of the anxieties and injustices of this fascinating historical period."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"I'm very glad to have discovered this original, complicated but enthralling book by Kim Newman. In this take-off of Bram Stokers Dracula, the Count survived execution and went on to become the consort of Queen Victoria in 1888. England is made up of the \\"un-dead\\" and the \\"warm,\\" and when a killer 'Silver Knife' begins murdering vampire prostitutes, they must work together to track him down. Many names from the original Dracula, as well as other literary works find this way into the story, which is fun.I had a little trouble sticking with this book at first--it is quite complex and with many characters--but once I got pulled in, I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this for fans of the original Dracula."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"First off, let me strongly urge you to actually read Bram Stoker's Dracula before reading this. Don't settle for watching a movie, most of them get it wrong enough that they'll just confuse you. If you simply refuse to read the original (and its an excellent novel, you really should) at least read through the cliff notes. It will enhance your appreciation of this immensely as you will already be familiar with the characters and events everyone references.Anno Dracula picks up two years after the original novel, except that in this world Dracula was not defeated but instead triumphed. Now he has married Queen Victoria and rules England as Prince Consort, making London a haven for the world's vampires who no longer need hide in the shadows. And it is here that the genius of Kim Newman really comes into play, for London's new vampire population is made up of numerous actual historical figures and every literary character (vampire or no) that Newman could beg, borrow, steal or vaguely reference--from Lord Ruthven to Lestat de Lioncourt, from Dr. Henry Jekyll to Mycroft Holmes, they all show up here. And the result is much better than it sounds, I promise. Very well written, very ingenious premise....I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, \\"Anno Dracula\\" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks.

Having read most of the others I found myself compelled to read it.Anno Dracula is a very rich & character filled novel. Set in 1888 England, the story is what happens Dracula hadn't been killed by van helsing & his friend's but rather survived & went on to marry queen Victoria. Now vampirism runs rampat & Dracula is the prince consort. Add to this the whitechapel murders, jack the ripper & so many extra characters (fictional & non-fictional) & you have anno Dracula.I really enjoyed the book however it was occasionally over laden with so many characters. I was lucky that my newer addiction had an index that defined all the people, characters & names the author was referencing.I would have liked to have seen Dracula & queen Victoria more, that being said the ending is powerful with their presence.I recommend this book especially if you like alternate history."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"When I picked this up, I initially had my reservations. The cover looked decidedly contrived, on reading the blurb I formed the opinion that I was going to be subjected to a rip-off of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and I thought this was going to be a particularly low-brow read.I don't think it has ever been more appropriate to use the idiom \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\".Set in 1888, this book seamlessly marries up the wonderful fictional worlds of Dracula, Sherlock Holmes and many others, drawing in characters from other vampire tales and notable fiction of the time; as well as factoring in events from history and other factual occurrences. If you can spot all the references to other works, then I would suggest that you are a bigger geek than me! The author, Kim Newman, helpfully provides an annotation at the end of the novel as a \\"Who's Who\\" for the reader!Anno Dracula has as its basis the supposition that Dracula was not defeated by Van Helsing et al. In fact, Dracula goes on to marry the widowed Queen Victoria and becomes Prince Consort. Vampirism is not only rife throughout London but is socially acceptable, desirable to many and becoming more dominant in Victorian society. Vampires throughout the novel include Oscar Wilde, the notorious outlaw Billy the Kid, Elizabeth Bathory, and there are numerous cameos from vampires of fiction such as Lestat and Graf Orlok. There are also star turns from numerous other figures from Victorian stories but I choose not to reveal these for fear of ruining the experience for you.It is no secret that my first passion was history and was indeed what I had planned to study at university before finding an aptitude for my current profession. Although this work is fiction, it is impressively rich in historical fact ... and twists much of it to its own end. The novel is not strictly speaking steampunk but is set in an alternate Victorian era as it were.Anno Dracula introduces us from the start to a character very much based in historical fact: Jack the Ripper. Here, The Ripper is preying on the vampire prostitutes conducting their business in the dingy backstreets of Whitechapel. With Sherlock Holmes interned at a work camp along with notable minds and authors of the time such as Bram Stoker, investigation of the murders falls to Scotland Yard and the powerbrokers at the mysterious Diogenes Club; the latter directing Charles Beauregard to uncover the true identity of Jack the Ripper.From the very beginning of the novel, the identity of The Ripper is known to the reader. However, this does not detract from the feel of the book which is, as stated earlier, rich in both historical fact, and characters from fiction and notable figures from the era, with a plot that develops well as the story progresses. The novel itself reads as a detective story set in the 19th century with a distinct horror element.Finding fault with this novel is difficult. Newman has obviously spent time researching this thoroughly and his prior preparation and planning has shone through. I have only one true criticism of the book and that is the finale. It felt rushed and over too quickly. Perhaps this is what Newman was aiming for; leading the reader to that point where they were left wanting more. If so, objective complete and I will most definitely be buying the follow up books.It is quite clear that Newman is keen for this story to be adapted for the big screen and in fact, a script for Anno Dracula has been penned; an excerpt of which was available appended to my copy of the novel. The film rights have been optioned but Newman has stated \\"I don't know if there's much movement on it...Over the years, I've had a few comics people say they'd be interested and even an occasional game nibble, but no one has ever come up with a solid deal.\\"If you haven't guessed, I was thoroughly impressed with this novel.Adhering to factual accuracy as much as is possible in an alternate universe populated by vampires is no mean feat but Kim Newman achieves this and in doing so, manages to tell a fantastic story at the same time."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"An interesting premise and good pacing make this a quick and enjoyable read; however, the story lacks the coherence needed to be truly impressive. It wasn't disappointing, exactly, but what could have been quite the impressive mashup of Victorian literature eventually shows itself to be, like its title character, a hollow shell of pretension.Part of the trouble is the large cast of characters. Many seem tossed in simply as a wink to some iota of Victorian history or literature, and the reader is never given any indication of their personality or even a real reason to be interested in them. The novel also takes its time deciding who the major protagonists will be, although to its credit, when it finally settles on a lead couple about halfway through it finds ways to dispose of many of the extras. The intra-story editing left this reader with a slight sense of befuddlement (\\"...why did I spend all this time reading about these people if they were just going to die?\\") but it did make the second part of the book rather more streamlined. Still, the narrative shifts far too often away from the central characters; and the occasional birds-eye-view segment, while probably intended to give background, simply adds to the choppiness and lack of cohesion.Another problem is the beginning and ending, or, really, lack thereof. The opening is slightly misleading, letting any reader familiar with Dracula assume that the story's format will follow the original text much more closely than it actually does. Similarly, the story is left frustratingly open-ended, with less than a page of proper d&eacute;nouement, and a generalized sense that the author simply got tired of writing the story and slapped on a \\"The End\\" without taking the time to properly tie up the threads.Even with these flaws, however, it was a surprisingly enjoyable read. The action moves along at a good clip, and the author manages to create a couple of memorable and sympathetic lead characters. The novel's ambition is laudable, but sadly never quite leaves the realm of \\"potential\\". Still, for fans of alternate-historical and vampire fiction, this one may be worth seeking out."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"The big boxoffice flop in '03 was 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', which was VERY loosely adapted from a comic book by Alan Moore. If you liked the movie or the comic, well, this is ten times better than both of 'em put together! The whole thing takes a 'What if?' look at the original Dracula novel, freely injecting any and everyone Newman can come up with into a great alternate timeline tale. Look for cameos from history and literature, from Sherlock Holmes to the Lone Ranger. Some of these references are oblique, some are blatant (probably for copyright reasons), but really, all that's fun and games, and it wouldn't mean diddly if the plot didn't deliver. And it does! This take on Jack the Ripper in a world of vampires is genuinely creepy at times, and the romance between the leads (A mysterious government operative and a beautiful vampire) works pretty well. I have the short story version of this story, and I think the novel is an even better story, with more plot twists and turns. It's kind of BUSY at times (I mean the book is crammed with plots and subplots) but Mr. Newman somehow keeps it all running smoothly. There are numerous sequels to this, but they aren't nearly as good. If you like tales of Saucy Jack, or if you just got tired of Anne Rice's pretty boy vamps a long time ago, you would probably enjoy this."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"What if, on that fateful night in the 1880s, Van Helsing and company had failed to slay the bloodthirsty Count Dracula? What if he escaped and began spreading vampirism as a plague across the world? This is the germ of Newman's brilliant \\"Anno Dracula\\" series, which blends not only Bram Stoker's work, but also the work of H.G. Welles, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Ian Fleming, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Joss Whedon and even a dash of Charles Schulz (if you look closely enough) in a generational epic that tells the tale of this new, Nosferatu-infected universe.This first book in the series focuses on the years following Bram Stoker's tale, as the vampires have risen to prominence but have not yet been touched by the 20th century. The whole thing is blended seamlessly with events both real and fictional, including the Jack the Ripper case, and the whole package comes together quite nicely."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"The book has a simple plot - Helsing (and his vampire slayers) failed and Count Dracula survived to become the new consort of Queen Victoria. Now the Prince has made the British Empire his own and London has become the haven for the undead. Vampires of all shapes and sizes rub elbows with Dr. Jekyll, Dr Moreau, Mycroft Holmes, Professor Moriarty and, of course, Jack the Ripper.Besides the vampires who live within the pages of this book, there are many references to others, such as Camilla and Saint-Germain, to help fill out the setting. Even such WARM, livingHeros as Quatermain are mentioned once and awhile. Think 19th Century pulp adventure mixed with horror."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"This book series may be popular with violent action fans, but the lack of substance prevents me from reading further books in the series. The circus of weird characters are barely developed - they are all one dimensional and hollow. This reads more like a graphic novel (minus the pictures) than a novel.Most of the gay characters are outdated negative stereotypes - \\"caked in makeup\\" and \\"effeminate\\" (whatever that means?!?). Why not \\"androgynous and attractive\\"? When Dracula finally appears at the end of the novel, he's nude except for a skimpy, open cape, and the author gives us a detailed and salacious description of his genitalia. It made me wonder if the author is a repressed/latent homosexual, himself!?!Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has written an excellent series of vampire novels. She reads like Dostoevsky compared to this hack author! Even Anne Rice's \\"Queen of the Damned\\" is vastly better written. People, PLEASE be more discriminating and don't waste your money on this trash. It's so badly constructed that it's just barely entertaining."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"The book was used but it looked ok to me. I'll buy the second book in a few days. Everything is great!"},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Vampires have become my most loathed protagonists within the horror canon and I put the blame for that squarely on the shoulders of Anne Rice, the godawfulUnderworld (Widescreen Special Edition)movies and a terrible television series starring Sarah Michelle Gellar. Its with great trepidation that I pick up a vampire novel these days, as you can guarantee that 99% of everything written in the sub-genre is absolute crud. Luckily 'Anno Dracula' - which is an oldie but a goodie - sits squarely within the 1% that aren't crud. In fact, Its probably one of the four greatest works in the field ever written (the other's being Stoker's original tale of the Wallachian prince, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend and Stephen King's'Salem's Lot). You could classify it as both a parallel world novel and a sequel of sorts as it speculates on what Vlad Dracul's influence could have been on Victorian England had the nefarious plans to spread his canker to the cradle of the British empire succeeded. In short, Dracula - who remains tantalisingly absent within the novel until the closing pages - legitimises his reign by taking Victoria as his bride and becoming Prince Consort; vampirism gains a coercive air of semi-respectability amongst the general public and the established order as only those who receive 'the dark kiss' stand a chance of prospering within the rigidly hierarchical political, military and social establishments; all who resist this re-ordering of society are put to death or sent to concentration camps. The genius of Newman's story sits within the way he mixes his encyclopaedic knowledge of Victorian London and its mores with that of the fantasy genre to produce an astounding work of metafiction in which real people such as Oscar Wilde, Frederick Abberline, John Merrick, Sir William Gull and Lord Shaftesbury rub shoulders with the likes of Bill Sykes, Graf Orlok, Fu Manchu, Mycroft Holmes, Edward Jekyll, Daniel Dravot and, at one point, a Victorian analogue ofKolchak - The Night Stalker. In fact, part of the joy of the novel is spotting the various allusions to characters from other works of fiction. I spotted many, many of them: probably my favourite was the cameo by one of the hopping vampires from the legendary CantoneseMr. Vampirefilms. But there's much more to this novel than star turns and vague allusions. It has a very fine, intricately rendered plot which ostensibly concerns the hunt by various agencies for a mysterious killer of vampire prostitutes in Whitechapel, known only as 'Silver Knife', whose reign of terror threatens to destabilise the newly established (anti)social order. If you want to know more, you'll need to pick up a copy and I highly recommend that you do. I currently have Newman's two sequels to the book,Bloody Red BaronandJudgment of Tears:: Anno Dracula 1959, stacked and ready to be devoured at my leisure. And I can't wait."},{"Title":"Anno Dracula","review":"Very impressed the quality of this book showed very little wear. It was well worth the savings from a new book.

Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the &quot;TEST&quot;, which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them.

We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual.

House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Armed Response: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Firearms for Self-Defense","review":"After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future."},{"Title":"Armed Response: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Firearms for Self-Defense","review":"This is a book that should be a part of the library of any gun owner (or possible gun owner).

The police do a fine job, and most I know are hardworking, underpaid, and truly dedicated to law enforcement. The problem is there's only so many of them to go around. For instance, if you're attacked at home (with no firearm and training), and it takes the police 10 minutes to get there, you and those you love will likely be dead or mortally wounded by the time an officer can arrive.\\"Armed Response\\" is the training guide for the novice, as well as those well informed about firearms. Mr. Ayoob has written an easy to understand guide to take you from what firearm to consider for personal protection, to the legal ramifications of using a firearm for self defense. Don't let Mr. Ayoob's ethnic name fool you. He knows EVERYTHING about the American situation involving everyday dangerous situations, as well as being a firearms expert.This book is the next best thing to having a personal firearms trainer.

I had ordered the Ayoob files, a collection of columns written by Massad Ayoob, a frequent expert witness in self-defense cases. Ayoob contributed an introduction to this volume, which is possibly the reason I ended up with this book. I received this book several years ago, and I decided to just keep it. I did not actually read it until 2009, and I found the book very good. I should have read it earlier.Armed Response is a sober, practical book that has lots of good things to think about for anyone who owns firearms. Lots of details about the workings of the law, how to properly use a firearm, and helpful suggestions. I wish I had read this book when I was actually a beginner, because the author explains a lot of common terms used by firearm owners that were mystifying to me once. I spent a number of years tracking down answers to questions that are contained in this book. That reinforces the answers I found, and makes me willing to recommend this book, because it matches my own experience and knowledge.You can find information about different kinds of firearms, their pros and cons. Different holsters, different ammunition, different stances. There are even suggestions for training. One would do well to heed the many warnings contained in this book. This book is intended to help keep you out of trouble of any kind. The best way to win a gunfight is not to be in one.Lots of good references, the websites and addresses of quality accesories manufacturers, and lots and lots of experience can be found in this book. Highly recommended. Just remember, IANAL. YANMC. TINLA.I am not a lawyer, you are not my client, this is not legal advice, if you want legal advice then hire yourself a lawyer.

The final parts of the book cover competitions, consequences of a shooting, other safety tools and gun control.Some unique items in this book you will not find in others...what to do after the bad guy drops his weapon and surrenders? The reality that empty hands skills are necessary regardless of what you carry and a realistic discussion on stopping power and ammunition selection.Overall, this is a very good book written by a responsible citizen.

It's also about the possible threats to your survival and constantly assessing their potential impact on your situation.One of the best chapters in this book is about the dreadful impact of using your gun for self defense.

Unfortunately, the book title is seriously misleading. I can only remember not finishing about 10 books in my life, and I read at least four or five a month - but this one is about to make the short list.This book really glosses over just about everything it touches, and on top of that, it is so male-oriented as to be next to worthless for a female reader, particularly when it comes to concealment options. Women may want to seeEffective Defense : The Woman, the Plan, the Gun.The basic concepts of the book? Don't trust gun magazines; they have to please their advertisers, and both the magazine and the author are generally in it for the money. A person can cross 20 feet in 1.7 seconds. Know how to defend yourself unarmed because altercations may start or end up that way, and you won't always have time to get to your weapon. Buy a gun you shoot well. Shooting well means being able to pull from a conceled holster, not just at a range at a target. The stress of a real altercation has serious phsyiological and psychological effects that will have an impact on your shooting. Get training in combat-type situations. Know the law in your area regarding self-defense shootings. Keep track of your training.I think you're probably better off readingIn the Gravest Extreme: The Role of the Firearm in Personal Protectionby Massad Ayoob if you're looking for a comprehensive look at self-defense shootings. Then readOn Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and in Peaceby Grossman for a good look at what actually being shot at or attacked does to your body and mind, and how it affects fighting back.

Not that this is necessarily bad, as new readers will be happy to potentially pick up some new pointers, but again this material might not be of much benefit to people who are allready CCWing.I did enjoy, and find particurally helpfull, Ayoob's discussion on the consequences of having to defend onself, as well as his analysis of the steps to take in this type of situation. He was helpful in determining how to conduct oneself immediately after the situation, and the effects of certain phrased sentences/statements.Overall its a good starting choice if you are considering purchasing a book of this nature, but if you allready have multiple ones, you might want to flip through this book to determine if there is any additional beneficial information.Some good sections of the book that I found helpful:Responsible use of Force- This included classifications, situations, etc.Discussion of Trigger systems- nothing really new here, but nice to have it included in one concise reference.Properties of Survival- discusses the color system of alertness"},{"Title":"Armed Response: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Firearms for Self-Defense","review":"What does a book have to do with workmanship? Plenty, when it is absent.For one thing, this book is replete with printing and/or proofing errors. A by no means complete list: text is missing on pp. 77, 79, 84, and 101; duplicated on pp. 81, 86; and p. 22 is entirely missing (instead, we get a repeat of p. 12). Minus one star from this review for these errors -- and I do feel I'm being generous.In addition, the author, to be blunt, is not a very good writer. You may be an expert in your field, but if you can't write in grammatically correct sentences, you need a competent editor. Otherwise, you'll only muddle your message and hurt your credibility. Subtract another star.Another annoying tendency was the author's use of incorrect laymen terminology. For instance, he consistently refers to loaded rounds (cartridges) as \\"bullets.\\" Hey, guy -- the bullet is the thing that exits the barrel; a loaded round has other components too. Is it too much to ask that a how-to book employ proper terms of the field?For the most part, the author knows his stuff, although much of the information is rather elementary. But his opening advice to believe only half of what you read is most apt to his own book. Some of what he claims is highly debatable, if not actual misinformation. The most jaw-dropping to me was his claim about semi-auto pistols on p. 46: \\"In the last few years, a new fad of double/single-action triggers has become inexplicably popular.\\" Forget the redundancy of using \\"fad\\" and \\"popular\\" in the same sentence; in a book copyrighted 2005, this claim is indisputably false. DA/SA trigger systems have been very popular and readily available for at least the 40 years that I've been shooting pistols. To confirm my own memory, I consulted my old dog-eared copy of George C. Nonte's \\"Pistol and Revolver Guide\\" (1975). Nonte lists numerous DA/SA semi-autos, from makers such as Astra, Beretta, Heckler & Koch, Mauser, Smith & Wesson (including the Model 39, which I myself owned back in the '70s), and Walther. As Nonte notes about the latter maker, the Walther PP and PPK date back to well before WW II. What I can't find in Nonte's book -- and what seems a new fad to me -- are the DA-only pistols that Kenik favors. I'll put his preference for DA-only in the debatable category; I favor the old DA/SA triggers myself.In the highly debatable category, I'd place his advice to grip a handgun hard enough to make your fingers turn white when shooting near the top of the list. In 40 years, I've never heard any firearms instructor give that advice. How would you do that without inducing tremors in your hand and (probably) jerking the trigger? Kenik also advises to release a manual safety only after acquiring the sight picture. Meaning, your thumb motion will inevitably cause you to lose the sight picture, and you'll have to re-align your sights. I can think of a faster way to shoot without compromising safety.Overall, not a bad book. But I'd definitely advise waiting for a competently-written and -printed version before shelling out your money. I plan to ask Amazon for a refund due to all the defects."},{"Title":"Armed Response: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Firearms for Self-Defense","review":"good information and primer on the subject of firearms in self-defense.

Although the book starts with a bang, it squibs in the middle -- with previously well-covered material -- and picks up again toward the end. It is not comprehensive in terms of depth as it claims; it is an overview. Truly, books by Ayoob and Spaulding have covered this ground better.The author's dislike of the \\"new\\" double action/single action trigger systems and unreliable 1911 single action triggers for defense is just plain odd. The author is at his best when he is \\"real-world\\" voice and speaking from the place where personal truth lives.If you have been around guns for a while, you will find most of the middle of this book rudimentary. I give it three stars for being average and leaning a bit toward silly in some regards.

Armed with these choices, the informed carrier can decide for themselves what will work best for them.He continues on with important narrative on confrontation techniques that will win in a gunfight but having done that, what the shooter will be faced with in the aftermath.

Not so much. Common sense? Yep, likely in abundance, right up to the point of editorializing at the end. This is a tough book to review, the subject is so charged politically. So starting off with the non-controversial stuff, mechanical production. The book was poorly published. Where page 22 should have been page 12 was reprinted. And insert page, smaller, was tucked in after the second page 12. Even it didn't line up with page 23. From that point forward there were several pages that never mated to the following or prior page. Certainly words, if not paragraphs were missing. This was disturbing as the book was recommended by my instructor and I really wanted to read what Kenik had to say.Everything up to the chapter on Gun Control was very good...5 star. Book production 1 star (it made it to print). I have no doubt that David Kenik is expert in this field. With the exception of chapter 32, I got a tremendous amount out of the book. I've been on this planet many decades, voted in dozens of elections and never once heard of someone elected or otherwise try to 'take my gun away', or my brother's or his girlfriend's. I was either pre-teen or early teen when I took a rifle shooting class at the YMCA. As a teen I had a .22 which is still around. I realize that sometimes bad things happen to good people. I also realize only fools go looking for it, see title of review. But sometimes it happens anyway. Since I've twice referenced chapter 32, let me comment on that.If nobody had guns, nobody would get shot. How can anyone argue with that? The operative word there is nobody. Nowhere in that sentence did it say good people. There are many people that should not, maybe never, be allowed to possess a weapon. I believe that is the point of the license and finger print and criminal background, mental health check. Simply put, that's the point of making it 'not easy'. Not easy is not the same thing as impossible. Getting a weapon that can kill from a distance because your, then current, girl friend has other prospective suitors, is a bad reason and pretty much goes to intent. Getting one because unknown person(s) are showing up at your residence with malice at 2am, and escalating, is a much better reason. The acquisition of this means of self defense and protection of life or property I don't believe anyone has an issue with. A girl friend is not property and anyone feeling that way is way more dangerous than a gun. My instructor was approached by just such a person. Guns don't kill people, people kill people. No issue there, but that is why some people shouldn't be allowed to have weapons that make the process easier. One last point, Assault weapons. I believe there are a class of weapon that, by their design, can be easily converted to fully automatic. There is an adage about perception becoming reality. If an AR-15 is perceived as more dangerous than a .22 and more sexy to the 18 to 30 'outlaw' type and can be converted to full auto easily, then the perception it is more dangerous than a .22 becomes reality. (a marksman with a .22 is far more lethalthat a kid with a .44) And being in the liberal bastion of Massachusetts, one wouldn't expect it legal to own an AR-15, yeah it really is so long as it meets a few questionable conditions. I am sure that doesn't do the rationale justice but I am equally sure it was not a couple of old dudes that like their Scotch old and women young that got together one evening and made that decision. Government is the collection of people we elect to make the rules. They don't always get it right, but they also don't always get it wrong.Chapters 1-31 are very good. It is unfortunate this is such an emotionally and politically charged area. If you want a reason to hate people with guns or hate the people that hate people with guns, skip 1-31 and go straight to 32. If you want to learn more about responsibly using one and understanding the mechanical, physical, legal and moral issues with having one, focus on 1-31. What scares me the most, is not the gun, but the person that sees this through the lens of vitriol, disgust, and loathing of those that don't agree with them....from either side. Defending one's life has no political affiliation. Adding chapter 32 did the author a grave disservice."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"As a continuation of Crucial Conversations this is an excellent book. It gives solutions that can be put into practice in every area of my life. It is a very powerful book. With practice, the choice of responding rather than reacting becomes second nature."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"Having read both this book and \\"Crucial Conversations\\" more than once, let me say that they are both worth reading more than once! In its latest reading, I used this book for a book study at work, guiding my team (I'm their boss) through the book and the lessons in the book. The team had been largely dysfunctional, had serious problems with communication, apparently had no idea of how to deal with confrontations, and might very well have imploded completely. Over the course of a few months, we read this book chapter by chapter (with some breaks), discussed each of the lessons, and started to put them into play.Today, the team communicates far better, has become highly functional, has improved their interpersonal skills, and are a joy to work with.Several of the team said that they were already starting to put some of the things they'd learned into practice in their personal lives, and I can see them applying them at work daily.The lessons that you can glean from this book are HUGE. If you find yourself struggling to have real conversations about issues small and large, if you have a relationship that is in some jeopardy, or if you just want to be more effective in a leadership or teaming role, read these books.For instance, the idea of mastering your stories... what is it that you assume about the motivations of the other person, and how do those assumptions generate feelings which drive YOUR behaviors? Learning about your \\"stories\\", how to discuss them with others, and how that affects you could be the start of something wonderful for you.Read these books.

Both are indispensable tools in creating a culture of performance. With its universally applicable principles and practical skills for resolving broken promises, violated expectations and bad behavior, it provides the diagnostic keys to unbundling seemingly complex issues that hold individuals, teams and organizations at a distance from their preferred futures. Beyond the welcome relief that comes from just cracking the code on a performance or relationship issue - these tools actually have the power to \\"knock people into gear\\" by making visible some of the long-term (seemingly invisible) costs associated with more typical coping or carping strategies.

Also in the \`before' phase, you are asked to master your emotions by considering not only \`your story', but also by considering the other person's context and thus \`their story' - are they really doing this because they want to fail with you? Probably not - they just have an entirely different perspective (their story) on the situation!The \`during' step requires that you confront with safety and stay with the facts; assuring the other party that mutual respect and mutual purpose are present. The \`after' step requires agreement on an action plan and follow-up. Along the way, there are tools to avoid getting side-tracked, with ample examples of situations that may arise and suggestions for dealing with them.

This is just one of the tools we've identified for resolving drama. When these tough conversations are the best solution, this book and its companion are great tools for achieving successful communication with coworkers about a not-so-pleasant subject.- Kaley Klemp & Jim Warner, Authors, \\"The Drama-Free Office: A Guide to Healthy Collaboration with Your Team, Coworkers, and Boss\\""},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"\\"Crucial Confrontations\\" is an important book because we must communicate. We are social beings who share space, time, and the journey of this life.Nothing is more disheartening than when someone breaks a promise, violates an expectation, or just behaves badly towards you. How do you respond? Some people, perhaps too many, just let it slide. Then, what was promised becomes conveniently lost in translation. The expectation becomes a disappointment. The bad behavior reinforced.Perhaps this cycle explains the lack of accountability in American society today. Confronting someone can be hard but if you do not, problems often persist and get worse. Why? Clementine Paddleford is quoted as having said, \\"Never grow a wishbone... where your backbone ought to be.\\"Interpersonal communications is skills-based. No one is so good at it that they succeed the first time, every time. This axiom remains true whether you are at home, in the boss's office, or in the Oval Office. No one always gets everything.Perhaps it is because human beings are not omniscient that self-respect is a good premise to start with. No one wants the reputation of being a wall-flower or a door mat. Believing in your own self-worth, knowing that your perception of the world matters is as valid a reason as any for engaging in a confrontation that sets your world aright.\\"Crucial Confrontations\\" is about accountability. The approach is candid and courteous; it unfolds in an environment of safety, and, by honoring the reality of consequences, the interpersonal skills this book teaches help the reader \\"bring predictability to a turbulent world.\\"The authors acknowledge there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in this book. We employ these communications tools when we are at our best and there are times when walking away is appropriate. \\"Crucial Confrontations\\" reminds us how to communicate better when life goes off script.Communicating can be difficult, but we do it all the time. Having a crucial confrontation may not guarantee success, but it will help you stand tall and move forward on your shared journey of this life."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"I can't praise these authors enough. In fact, they are due for another book and I look forward to reading it. Having already read , \\"Influencer\\" and \\"Crucial Conversation\\" , I knew what to expect from these excellent writers with Crucial Confrontation.General OverviewThe reasons I love these books are because at the end of each book, they do a beautiful job of tying all together. For me this is extremely important. After reading 300+ pages, at the end they tell you, what does it all mean to me and how can I use these wonderful skills in my own life. They summarizes it all and give you specific examples that you can use NOW to become better skill person on handling high stake conversations or confrontations or influencing people or a group of people.They tell you to practice one specific skill a week until you get the hang of it. So many books spew theories and concepts and at the end say thank you very much and I hope you use what we just told you and you like what. How? where do I start? there is just too much information, etc, etc. On the opposite side, these incredible authors tell you exactly how to use the skills, they will say if there are two things you walk away from this book, they are, (example in this book, establish safety and describe the gap) and give you examples. There is so much I can say and praise these three books and especially Crucial Confrontation( my favorite)but I say only that I strongly recommend for you to pick one up and find out for yourself.Crucial ConfrontationThere is a three concept model that you use and these are the skills that good and excellent practitioners use when there is a crucial confrontation.The model has three component of Confrontation: The Before, The During and The After- with a Side Bar for unexpected contingenciesThe Before: This is when you plan how you going to confront this person, who betray your trust, or , started rumors or is out to get you. Is the WHAT and IF concept.WHAT exactly happened, and WHAT issue are you going to confront-get the facts, and usually there are many issues involved, that need to be confronted , they talked bad about you, they told a specific lie , but I believe the bigger issue is the relationship, this is a person who you trusted and is lying about you, The confrontation many times is the relationship, and that is what should be confronted. Also, it talks IF , you should confront the person. Is it worth it? what will you lose if you don't, how much is it bothering you.The second part of the equation, is not to get angry , you have to leave your emotions out of it. This is done what the authors call, MASTER MY STORY, think of reasons why this person is doing it ( besides being just evil), the question to ask , why would a decent rational person do this. The idea is to make the person , human and not a villain and it that way to approach it in a more normal conversation and not going in there half cocked and ready to do battle.Real important in this phase is to ask yourself: What do I really want out of this confrontation? This will keep you focus. Also, a technique you can use in this phase is called CPR: C=Content( facts) P=Pattern( this is the second time) last R= relationship(trust).During the confrontation: the authors called it, DESCRIBE THE GAP. this is where you tell the story (facts) not conclusions, just the facts-of what is expected and what happened. The most important part of this is to create safety. Safety is created by stating the mutual purpose you both have and thinking before hand -what is the worse this person think I am saying and use contrast to say what you mean and not mean like I'm not accusing you of lying but I want to get the facts. Start with the facts (how you start, the first 10 seconds are crucial and set the tone for the confrontation it should start and end with a tentative question) and by ending with a question, it helps diagnose the problem. After you listen, look for motivation and ability. Make it motivating and make it easy for them and this has to do more with work , them personal relationships. The book says look at six sources of influence.After the confrontation- AGREE ON A PLAN AND FOLLOW UP. This basically means that you can tell the person, I can count on you for support - most important, Who does what , when and who will follow up and ask the question, are we leaving out any barriers or unforeseen things. Let discuss this in 30 days and we where we are, this is very important-remember mutual purpose.And the side bar, STAY FOCUS AND FLEXIBLE, and what that means, they might throw in another problem and you have to decide deal with the new problem, is it more serious (if you do, you bookmark the original problem and say we'll get back to that later, let discuss this new situation I was not aware of) , if the new problem is a small or distracting tactic, you get back to the original problem.I love this book, Buy it, read it and it will definitely improve your life with people.."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"I haven't spent a lot of time reading about soft skills, but knowing I could improve, I picked up \\"Crucial Confrontations\\".

I believe that Crucial Confrontations are a crucial tool/mechanism that any successful leader should have in his arsenal. If used effectively, it helps promote a culture of accountability which usually entails high performance and high engagement. This book explains in depth the process from start to finish both within a personal and work setting. The reason I gave this book a lower rating despite the very valuable content, is that I felt that the material could have been more condensed and presented in a shorter more story-like format.

I could only read this book when I have free time and it took me over 2 months to complete this book. However, I could easily follow and recall the trend of thoughts and arguments, and make easy references to remind myself of steps that I have forgotten or would like to refer.The only thing that I found this book does not address is that the approach might be difficult to apply in a selfish political dominant culture."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"The first half of this book was excellent. Part I was titled \\"Work on me first\\". Under it was Chapter 2 \\"Master my stories: How to get your head right before opening your mouth\\". It talks about the stories we tell ourselves to explain what is happening around us. These stories can have a profound influence on your life. Negative stories tend to become self fulfilling prophesies. I'd heard about these stories in a talk. The speaker asked us not to share what we had learned. So I was pleased to see it in another source. The second half of the book I suspect was written by another author. Perhaps if I'd been practicing their suggestions it wouldn't have felt like formula writing.

A good step by step in how to manage such interactions."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"This is the second book by the same authors, the first being Crucial Conversations. This book expands upon the first one by examining confrontations specifically be they at home or in the workplace (or any other place). The premise of the book is that everyone can improve their ability to handle crucial confrontations if they learn to apply specific skills. Like their first book I wish I had begun studying this one a long time ago.The authors are a group of researchers who have been studying this topic for decades. Essentially what they have done is study people who are very good at dealing with crucial confrontations and compare what these highly skilled people do that is different from everyone else. The result is a detailed step-by-step guide that teaches the principles for handling these situations so that they result in successful resolution of the problem and enhance the interpersonal relationship.Crucial Confrontations is full of examples from the author's collective case studies. These examples are integrated into every section of the book enabling the reader to immediately see the situations where the skills are put to use. Also at the end of the book the authors talk through several very difficult situations. Through it all \\"Crucial Confrontations\\" provides some deep insights into interpersonal interactions that are very enlightening."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship.

Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"I found the book very limited because of the kinds of confrontations presented. For the narrow focus, the information was good, although not as concise as I would have liked. There are so many other confrontations which were not addressed. How does one answer an employee who always wants a bigger raise or more time off? How does one handle an employee who is never satisfied with the work environment?

Your right to use this work may be terminated if you fail to comply with these terms.\\"That's right noncommercial and personal use only. Even though the book gives examples of commercial use of the work, its not for commercial use. Which is contradictory of the books examples, but really wise to state because most commercial use would be by employees of commercial corporations and confrontations are something that commercial corporations and their managers do not tolerate. So, use the work to improve your personal life, but don't try it at work on in any commercial use because not only your use of the work may be terminated but your employment may be terminated as well.The publisher, McGraw-Hill, also includes the following special warning in all capital letters (which is really nonsense if you have even a grade school understanding of the meaning of capitalization in English).THE WORK IS PROVIDED \\"AS IS\\" McGRAW-HILL AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF OR RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USING THIS WORK,....There's much more to this warning notice, but I'm not typing it all because I think I've made my point.

The fact is, this book is a re-hashing of Crucial Conversations; however, this time, the principles shared seem more applicable than they were before.I think that this book is the real and better application of the authors' main principles. It is an easy and quick read and the language is very simple and direct. The book discusses ways to have a confrontation in which results are gained and friendships are not lost. It is a win-win approach. I do believe that this book can and does help. I did not particularily like the Crucial Conversations because it wasn't real earth shattering and seemed to simple. This time, however, the subject of \\"confrontations\\" seems more open to the authors' intentions-- thus a better read.This is a good book to read and a better book to apply."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"I surprised myself by reading almost the entire book during a two-week trip to Thailand w. The authors do a great job of showing how NOT stepping up has allowed catastrophic consquences to result. For example, the co-pilot who chose not to speak up when the pilot was preparing to take off in freezing weather with ice building up on the wings. All that survived was the cockpit tape that has the copilot hinting at the danger and not taking a powerful stand with the pilot. Our circumstances are not likely to be that drastic, but it is really very serious business.I like that the book recognizes that speaking up can be risky and talks about how to make reasonably sure that you won't hurt your career or relationship when you choose to speak up.The keys to managing the conversation so you don't get off in the weeds and get a valuable result begin with stepping back for a moment and remembering how you got to your reaction. The authors say we start by seeing or hearing something, draw come conclusions, react and then take action. If you review what exactly are the facts you started with and what are the interpretations or conclusions you came to, you are free to share it as a story the other person can understand. If you speak as if your conclusions are facts, you can lose the rapport you need to have a good outcome.I like the question the authors suggest asking yourself to get to how to start a conversation that doesn't amount to an attack: \\"What would cause a reasonable, rational and decent person to act like this?\\" Answering that question puts me in a frame of mind to begin with an attitude of mutual respect.The other major key for me that I got out of the book is realizing that when someone does react badly during a conversation like this is that two key safety issues could be percieved as missing: mutual respect and mutual purpose. If you are ready to restore a sense of mutual respect and mutual purpose, then you can get back out of the weeds of someone reacting in ways you don't intend or that surprise you.Providing a way of knowing what to do if things go wrong in the conversation is key to my being willing to take on having the conversation in the first place. Most people just keep quiet and there is a cost to that. Some people hold back until they blow up and that doesn't work very well either.That is my three paragraph teaser about the book. I like that the book is based on over 20 years of studying people who excell at this type of conversation and distilling how they do it."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"As I read this exceptionally informative book, I was again reminded of the fact that the Chinese word for \\"crisis\\" has two meanings: peril and opportunity. Since posting the review, a reader's comment (please see below) identifies an essay that brings into doubt the common belief in the dual meaning to which I referred. However, I remain convinced, linguistic issues aside, that every crisis does pose both peril or opportunity and that how we respond is for us to determine.* * *As those who have been or are now involved in process simplification initiatives already know, every problem encountered offers a valuable learning opportunity. The same is also true when encountering \\"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\\" either within or beyond the workplace. The authors of this volume address questions such as these:What's a \\"crucial confrontation\\"?What to do before one occurs?How to know when -- and when NOT -- to initiate one?How to \\"get your head right before opening your mouth\\"?How to begin a crucial confrontation?How to involve and engage others to take appropriate action?How to make keeping commitments (almost) painless?What to do when others \\"get sidetracked, scream, or sulk\\"?What to do after a crucial confrontation?How to gain commitment and move to action?How to solve \\"big, sticky, complicated problems\\"?How to deal with the truly tough? (i.e. the twelve \\"yeh buts\\")The authors also provide four appendices: A self-assessment for measuring confrontation skills, \\"The Six-Source Model,\\" \\"When Things Go Right,\\" and discussion questions for reading groups. Although any one of the appendices is worth far more than the cost of this book, their greatest value will be derived when the information and counsel are correlated with the material which the authors share in the nine chapters.My own experience in the business world suggests that \\"broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior\\" really do offer both perils and opportunities. A careful reading of this book and then an equally careful application of the advice which the authors offer will, in my opinion, help reduce (if not eliminate) the former while helping to achieve effective fulfillment of the latter."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"The ideas presented in this book seem to be excellent ways to have critical oonversations, but I found two things lacking. First, reading about conversations and making them happen are two different things. Although it's no fault of the book, I think it will be difficult to put these easily into play without practice.Second, there are no examples I noticed where the outcome WAS as bad as it could be. For example, one conversation centered on a man who suspects his wife of an affair. He confronts her only to find that she has a valid excuse for her actions, and is not in fact unfaithful. What if she had said \\"yes, I'm having an affair\\"? There's no follow up when the answer IS what you've hoped it won't be. Those seem like they could be the most critical conversations of all."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"We all have confrontations to deal with in our daily lives, both at work and at home. I head technology audit for a company and confrontation is a daily fact of life. Holding people accountable for actions, inactions and trying to change behavior is a stressful part of many people's jobs. This book provides an effective approach to handling all aspects of confrontation.It even provides the often overlooked need for (effective) confrontation. Book illustrates this point with the example of the Challenger space shuttle tragedy (could have been averted had known issues been raised) and the tragic-comic example of a patient who went into hospital with an ear ache and came out with a vasectomy - because he wouldn't speak up!Importantly, the authors provide practical approaches that can be applied in the real world in everyday life.

This book has helped me in developing my skills in confronting people on performance issues. Even though the book may make it seem easier than we all know it is, it lays out very clear fundamental steps on what to do. I think the outline is the fundamental part we all miss when we seem to fail at crucial confrontations.

I love the concept of keeping the conversation \\"safe\\". Its amazing that I can confront my children on issues that before they would blow up, but now we are able to agree and see things the same way. I love to end with the question - Do you see it the same way, or have I missed something? This helps them to know that I really have their best interests at heart.

A pleasant, nonconfrontational attitude that eventually kills you. Are you too \\"nice\\" to confront failure? The authors promise to equip you \\"never to walk away from another conflict again\\". Their message is good news for both the work place and our personal relationships. They note successful leaders rarely if ever use their power to motivate people. Having just listened to a sermon on I Peter with its themes of treating people with gentleness and respect, I thought how biblical this was. We're encouraged always to think the best of others and to refrain from telling \\"ugly stories\\" about their motivations, aka \\"The Fundamental Attribution Error.\\" When we let others down, of course we make concessions for our behavior. Generally speaking, we fail to take similar situational factors into account when others let us down.How do you know when it's necessary to confront someone? We have to determine whether their failure (the authors refer to it as \\"the gap\\") was one of ability or of motivation. And just because you determine ability was the problem, don't assume motivation wasn't involved as well.AMPP: Ask--to get the ball rolling (What's going on here?); Mirror--to let the other party know you're not seeing what they're saying (I'm not upset!!!!); Paraphrase--for understanding; and Prime--to make it safe. Do this by guessing their story.Typically, people misbehave in confrontations when they don't feel safe. Safety is ensured when respect and mutual purpose come together. Many times, message content gets through, but intent is received as either disrespectful or as failing to address what's important to the other party. When people don't feel safe, they may react with silence or violence. Either reaction dooms the confrontation.When a confrontation becomes disrespectful, you have a new, more pressing problem. And a wise person will step out of the original problem and shift focus to the newer problem. Contrasting is known as the \\"Killer of the fundamental attribution error.\\" If you're trying to establish mutual respect, and you suspect the other party may feel defensive, imagine what they might conclude. You must immediately say what you DON'T mean, and then follow up with what you do mean. If you believe they don't trust your purpose, start out with what's important to both of you.If you have to confront someone in authority over you, or if the content is volatile, ask for permission first. The authors remind us what a powerful form of respect this is. Finally, create a safety valve. A strategic delay is not a retreat. Determine follow-up: is it to be a \\"check back\\" or a \\"check up\\"?The authors do a terrific job of summing this all up in the final two chapters and include 4 appendices to make this book appropriate for a study. What's to lose? We can either toggle between silence and violence, or we can master our stories, master our emotions, and thereby become masters of our behavior."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"Although confrontation is difficult for many people, it is often necessary. Failure to confront someone over bad behavior may be misinterpreted as approval. Confrontations can help bring people back to a better, more productive course. However, confrontations also can go off track and become shouting matches (or worse). Authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler outline a method for approaching confrontations when the stakes are particularly high; those are the crucial confrontations. Boiled down to its essentials, the methodology consists of focusing on facts, remaining calm, listening to the other person with respect and working to motivate the other person and to enable a change in behavior. The book is light, anecdotal and easy to read. Yet, we find that it offers so much sound advice that any manager, parent or spouse could find something useful."},{"Title":"Crucial Confrontations","review":"Easy to read and follow, a bit repetitive but not annoyingly so, this book touches on so many confrontation styles and how to have them more effectively. I thought I was pretty good at confrontations but I learned that I still could use some work. There are some really great practical ideas that can be used for home and work environments. Coming out of silence and confronting people in a honest and non-threatening way can make all of our lives easier. This is a great tool for supervisors, leaders and line workers as well as parents and couples. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book.

Additionally, some are more confrontational than others regardless if those contentious talks are occurring within a team, organization or family environment.

Soundview recommends this read because it provides useful information to handle a wide range of sticky confrontations including: medical errors, safety violations and cost-cutting mistakes.

True, she didn't make any A-movies, but like Marilyn, embodied that woman who drew a fine line between good girl/bad girl and crossed the lines as easily as one drank Coca-Cola. Unlike Marilyn, Bettie survived, but like Marilyn, her legend lives on for one simple reason: she dropped out of sight in 1957 following the fall of Irvin and Paula Klaw by the Kefauver Committee on indecency and pornography and refused to have herself be photographed as she is now. Thus, she is remembered as she was back then. And as her life has become simpler, she values her privacy. She says so as much in the hand-written foreword, at the same time surprised and honoured that so many people are interested in her.Karen Essex and James L. Swanson book is a great place to start for those curious about Bettie Page. Basically, it's a biography accompanied by lots and lots of colour and b&w photos, many of them topless. There are two of them which has her completely nude. She also posed for countless magazine covers and photographers. Art Amsie's photos are the best of the lot here. Bunny Yeager is touched on briefly, but that woman has a book on herself so... Looking at the early Bettie, before she became a pin-up from 1947, is also quite a revelation. She is still beautiful, but in an ordinary way, like a typical girl growing up in 1940's America.There is clearly a dualism going on here. There's the pretty wholesome girl in the bathing suit or maybe not, and then there's the darker leatherbound fetish girl, be she receiver or giver. That latter half led to her downfall. The point also was that she enjoyed her work, mainly the lighter beach stuff. You can see it in those twinkling eyes and smile of hers.The last section of the book features models who have been influenced by her, be they in clothes or just looking like her. Of the lookalikes, Eva Herzigova, Debi Mazar, and Janice Dickinson have got it down to the bangs, (it's the bangs that did it for Bettie, after all), long black hair, and prominent eyebrows.Apart from being one of fantasy artist Olivia's favourite subjects, Bettie's images appear on album covers by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult and the David Lee Roth Band. Her three videos, Teaserama, where she acts opposite stripper legend Tempest Storm, Varietease, and Strip-O-Rama have come out. She'll live on, no doubt about it.Anyone interested in Bettie Page-start with this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"Within moments after my wife proposed gifting this book to our business partner last Spring, I seized it for myself. She had run across the only copy left in one of those funky shops which cater to the growing interest in cultural icons.The authors, Karen Essex and James L. Swanson, render a definitive biography of one of the most enigmatic figures of our memory. Their slick 288 page paperback version lovingly portrays the images and life of Bettie page. You can take this book two ways:On the coffee table, it presents a seductive collection of family photographs and pulp covers documenting the pin-up icon.In bed, it seduces you to learn about the studious young woman who triumphed over family heartbreak to become a legend.In the Fifties, I was one of the multitude of pre-adolescent boys who furtively witnessed her near-perfect body and impish smile - without knowing who she was. Now, more than forty years since her last session, Essex and Swanson answer some of the questions and heap on plenty of deja vu in the process.The authors expose a life of someone who is noble and genuine. The &quot;real&quot; Bettie Page turns out to as fascinating as her ubiquitous image. Secretarial stints, jobs in Hati, persistent self-improvement and disappointing husbands propel her into a series of vicissitudes worthy of a Henry Fielding novel. Amid the rich and varied photographs, drawings and memorabilia, Essex and Swanson weave an engaging tale of someone quite surprising. Her guileless and genuine approach to life are almost Zen-like when viewed from our age of media hype and agents. Here is the story of a bright, beautiful, autonomous loner who deals directly with her life, shunning pretense, flattery and victimhood.The Bettie Page you discover in this book, as her beautiful visage, is both accessible and mysterious.Maybe I'll follow through with the gift idea my wife had last Spring."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"I have been looking for hard to find pictures and information about Betty Page for many years. A friend gave me this book and I was amazed. The pictures are top-notch quality, and the text is precise and in-depth. The book shows how Betty Page influenced Art and America, as well as other artists's use of her looks for their own style. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone with even the slightest of interests in Betty Page or Pin-up Girls"},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"This is the definitive book on the life and all too short career of Bettie. After reading this facinating book, I feel like I know Bettie. If you are a Bettie fan (read: can see with at least one eye) you must have this book. This is the jackpot friends. A word of warning. The text is sad on occasion. Some horrible and tramatic things happened to Bettie during her life. The reader's heart cannot help but go out to her. The fact that Bettie could relate this to the authors bears witness to her strength of as a human being. I love this book so much that I hope the authors will come out with a second volume."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"This is the ultimate book on Bettie Page. This book is for every true Bettie fan. Even contains an introduction from Bettie herself.If you really want to follow the history of legend, this is the ultimate book on Betty Mae Page!"},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"So said one of her photographers. What a marvelous book. If you're like me, and have been a Bettie fan for years, you've been waiting for this book. For years one could find stuff on her only in comic shops and the like, dealing in old memorabilia from the Fifties, or in various &quot;alternative&quot; shops that sold her image on T shirts. As a teen that's where I learned about her, thanks to &quot;The Rocketeer,&quot; the comic &quot;The Bettie Pages,&quot; and psychobilly trash-punk band the Cramps, who for a short time had a bass player the spittin' image of our fair maiden. Now that we've finally opened our eyes, we can buy several books on her, this being by far the best. It is the ne plus ultra of Bettiebooks, of pin-up books in general. What a trend-setter; a humble, troubled, open and honest woman who was not exploited, who has not turned herself into a PC victim--she's idolized by smart, hip young women who see in her freedom, sexuality, playfullness, life itself. This book had better be reprinted--it's an absolute crime to be unavailable. Get this book by any means necessary!"},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"After years of seclusion, most of the secrets of, by and about Bettie Page are revealed in this well-composed and long overdue profile of the most photographed model in history.Ms. Page may still wonder at the inspiration and sensation (and consternation from members of Congress) she caused in the mid-1950's...what this book clearly does, is testify as to why her image is still sought after by fans and collectors.Easy, lively reading and plenty of pictures rates this as the best book available on the Page rage."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"I bought this book for my husband's birthday last year; he has always thought Bettie Page was great, and he is the one who enlightened me about her. As an artist, I was drawn to her style and unpretentiousness, and have drawn her twice so far.This book is well-written and leads the reader through Bettie's life; from her start and to her present day in a respectful and fascinating manner. I came away from this book understnanding the appeal she had to men, and wanting to draw her portraits over and over."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"Pictures, pictures, pictures. It makes a grown man cry, butthe Story is &quot;remarkably&quot; the best part of the book.The history and life of Betty Page has never been laid outbetter on paper....and oh, that face !It is definitive from cover to cover and her life story andmysterious disappearance are all answered by Betty herself.Could you get better facts, the answer is no. I thought someof the photography could have been left on the cutting room floor though.It seems during the fetish photo shoots the actual quality andcontent of the pictures was third rate.She is a great icon and fastly becoming a cult superstar,if you want or had to know more about the legendthis is the only book you would need.Marilyn Monroe fans eat your hearts out.The first Queen of pin-ups is here."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"For men of a certain age, Bettie Page was one of the most beautiful women of the 1950's Era. She wasn't a big Hollywood movie star, but she represented the dream girl next door. She was beautiful but more than that, she was nice. She may have posed for pin-up pictures in bikinis, skimpy underwear and nude, but she looked like she was playing at the job. If the picture was a fetish photo she appeared to be giggling, or at least about to giggle at the absurdity of the poses she was being photographed in. She was just as happy posing for a mostly male photography club at a public beach as she was posing for professional photographer. She typified the amateur fun loving model. She was beautiful but refused to take her beauty seriously. Her big, warm smile would light a dark room. Her happiness was contagious. She just was. Posing for pin-up pictures was fun for her.It was good clean fun, not anything dirty or unseemly. She was like Eve in the Garden of Eden being tempted by the serpent but coming through the temptations untouched and with snapshots to prove it. She was a great play actor enjoying herself while being the center of attention and mildly teasing men through her photographic persona. Some of the men's imaginations may have been in the gutter, but that wasn't her fault. She was happy little Miss Sunshine.She was a nature girl. She was a sun worshipper and everyone at the time believed she was a happy nudist and she wasn't at all shy about showing her healthy body. Cameras loved Bettie. This is one of the best collections of her work that has been published. Most of the pulp magazines she appeared in are in the final process of dissolving because of the cheap sulfur filled paper they were printed on. Here is a well done, high quality coffee table collection of many of the magazine covers on which the image of her smile and healthy body graced.It's nice to see that the Bettie Page hairdo is becoming popular again 60 years after she made it famous. This book will send men of the 1950's back to their dreamy youth and the innocence that was the United States before Vietnam and the radical 1960's changed America forever. Long live Bettie Page via the art and cartoon icon she has since become and which is also documented in this excellent bit of visual history. It's nice to read and see what Bettie thought about her world as well. The hand written introduction from her was a nice touch. The long-hand note seems so Bettie Page."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"This is an outstanding summary of Bettie's life and her impact on modeling, art, pin-up, photography, and those needing encouragement in overcoming obstacles. The book is a nice way to learn about Bettie Page and those individuals she worked with during her career and growing up. It stops short of telling about recent events, but gives one a good understanding of the lady. The information is factual and well written. Much speculation has been made about the time she walked away through the present, but this is a nice account with the facts that we know to be true without the speculation. The pictures within this book are amazing and many won't be seen anywhere else. The information about those individuals she touched, encountered was interesting as well. Good read."},{"Title":"Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend","review":"It's hard to believe it is almost 16 years since this fantastic BP hardcover debuted. Very well written with tons of great pics from chidhood up till the late 1950's ( I would guess), this publication to date is the standard the pretenders are to be measured against. That being said ,it is not perfect but close. In 1995 there was still a lot of the whole Bettie Page story that wasn't known, specifically from the late 50's forward. For more on that Richard Foster has written the Real Bettie Page which appeared a few years later. Still The Life of a Pin-Up Legend delivers on so many levels. It brings us the Modelling pics, the fetish pics the & home photos as well. This BP source throws the net deep & brings in so many examples of artists, models, actresses & movies that have borrowed from the Bettie aura. Really up till this book came out very little if any cash came back to the legend that made it all possible. Karen Essex & James Swanson have zeroed in on what about Bettie made her special. The bulk of this book centers on the fifties ( though other time frames are dealt with accordingly) when all the good stuff went down as well as some bad. A very positive read, I really liked it. There was a lot of work that went into this book, it really shows from page 1 to 288. Visually Bettie became every Man's dream girl. Her expressions , movements, posing & improvisation put her in a category no one else belonged & that was what all the fuss was about. Femme Fatales magazine did a superb double issue tribute to Bettie as well a number of years ago, that would make a good companion to this HC. The writers of the Life of a Pin-Up Legend know their core audience & I think emphasized the highlights of an icon through words & Pictures very well. An absolute steal at $40 US back in the day but worth whatever seems reasonable, this is one product you will treasure & come back to time & again, I know I have & it never gets old, my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Poems of Power","review":"Based on her theosophic and new thought principles, these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence. Truly a most inspirational woman!"},{"Title":"Poems of Power","review":"I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. I deleted it soon after."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Instant Russian Audio Pack","review":"I admit I found this kit initially attractive for its promise to teach conversational Russian minus the difficult grammar and other &quot;messy bits&quot;, and was lured by the 45 minutes a day, six week claim. Such a program has its benefits, but after all was said and done, I was left wishing that I had taken the time to begin with the basics.Apart from an unexplained alphabet chart in the introductory chapter and a very few flash cards, &quot;Instant Russian&quot; doesn't bother with Cyrillic letters, using instead a phonetically spelled equivalent of each word. The strategy is to allow a better mastery of tricky Russian pronunciations; I was left feeling ultimately hindered by the method. After completing the course, I was able to recite words and phrases but had absolutely no idea how to recognize the majority of my new vocabulary as it might appear on a store front sign or restaurant menu. I feel that I would have fared much better with at least a basic understanding of the Russian characters.Also, I was unsure of the exact sounds of some of the letter groupings, as the female voice on the cassette has a British accent. Several of the english word examples given, especially those in the section pertaining to vowel sounds, contained words that are pronounced differently in Britain than in North America. This isn't a HUGE problem, but for those outside the UK, it's something to consider.That said, I give &quot;Instant Russian&quot; three stars because it delivers what it claims - important words and phrases without the bother of difficult grammar. It is neither for those with a serious interest in studying the language nor for those that would prefer to learn Russian using the Cyrillic characters, something I highly recommend doing.I understand how this program might be greatly appreciated by travellers wishing only to grasp the basics of conversational Russian, but wanting more, I have decided to invest the time and effort into exploring a more traditional approach to the language."},{"Title":"Milton's God","review":"As best as I can remember, I read most of the Bible at age 10 (I am now 68) and became an atheist. When I was in graduate school (English), I found myself in a seminar on Milton. We were directed to review a book on Milton and present it to the class. Although the class and professor were highly esteemed, I was quickly deciding that a doctorate in English led directly to the \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" Dejectedly wandering through the University of Washington Library stacks I chanced upon Empson's MILTON'S GOD. After glancing through a bit of the book, I realized I had encountered a masterful icon smasher (my main goal all through my life) and seized the book with glee.When Empson identified \\"God\\" as a bully, I thought, \\"OF COURSE!\\" I felt that my atheism (never pallid or wimpy) had suddenly been turbo charged. I've been meaning to get around to re-reading this book for many years. As I get old, I am not sure I will actually read it againt before I die, but my intentions are bad and there is still a very warm place in my heart for it.As far as I can tell, all versions of God (which I without doubt regard as inventions of human beings) contain strong elements of bullying (though some believers are trying to clean up their act). I am glad God does not exist; if he did exist, he would clearly be a monster.When I made my report to the graduate seminar with youthful arrogance and sarcasm (a disgusting trait I have never lost), the professor stared at me aghast (with a look I can only recall as conveying \\"WTF . . . God, why did you throw this monster into my class?) though he said not much of anything, and actually passed me (in hope he would never see me again . . . which came true as I dropped out of grad school in disgust).However, one fellow student (obviously an evangelical Christian) looked at me with kind sadness and gently said, \\"If I were you, I would not be so sure there is no God.\\" This of course is just another formulation of \\"Pascal's Wager\\"; the universal argument that fervent Christians like to use to scare us atheists into fearing \\"God the bully.\\"I've always thought, if that is what God is, it's my duty to burn in Hell. Satan had a point, when you think about it."},{"Title":"Treasure Chests: The Legacy of Extraordinary Boxes","review":"A lovely book. The title may mislead - it's really what I would think of as large-scale boxes, carcass work. Old and new designs, from blanket chests to campaign chests. Usually enough photos of each piece to give a real sense of it, too. (I hate feeling like I've missed seeing 2/3 of what's there.)"},{"Title":"Treasure Chests: The Legacy of Extraordinary Boxes","review":"I really enjoy this book. I am a woodworker / furniture maker and I read a lot of this style of book. The author does a fantastic job of illustrating each box and providing a bit of background on each box. The photos are all in color and very well composed.The boxes range from a tea box recovered from the harbor at the Boston Tea Party to HO Studley's over-the-top tool chest to a standard GI foot locker.The book is well-organized. There is little wood working technique described so if you are looking for a how-to book, this ain't the book for you. However, the author briefly describes uncommon techniques such as lapstrake construction (common in shipbuilding but almost unheard of in furniture making)."},{"Title":"Treasure Chests: The Legacy of Extraordinary Boxes","review":"This book is truly enjoyable to read.It is a beautiful &quot;coffee table&quot; book -- after all, who isn't intrigued by antique treasure chests and other historical boxes.I really enjoyed the history behind the various boxes types, and learned a lot about the benefits of the different construction types."},{"Title":"Treasure Chests: The Legacy of Extraordinary Boxes","review":"I ordered this book from Russia.

It covered a lot of variety of types of chests and provided interesting historical and culture facts, as well as personal stories for specific chests. The pictures to text ratio is perfect.

I still own a copy, although it's ratty from being dropped in the bathtub and carried around for the past 14 years."},{"Title":"Colsec Rebellion","review":"This is the final book in the ColSec triology, a middle-school level sci-fi series. The first two books are Exiles of ColSec and The Caves of Klydor. In the future, Earth is controlled by a repressive government that sends criminals and dissidents into exile on other planets. These exiles are assigned to different planets to form colonies by ColSec (short for Colonization Section). The government then reaps the benefits of whatever resources the colonists find or produce. However, the colonists have been plotting to take their destinies into their own hands.Cord MaKiy and his friends hijack a ColSec ship and return to Earth to gather allies for the rebellion against Earth's government, called The Organization. They turn to the societies that they came from, little groups of outcasts on the fringes of Earth's society. Cord's people, the Highlanders who live in the wild areas of Scotland without modern technology, welcome them, and many of the young people are interested in joining the colonies, seeing other worlds, and living in freedom. Similarly, the rebels find more friends among the Vampires, the youth gang that lives in the Bunkers (what's left of the old subway system under London). However, the Streeters (a youth gang in the Chicago area) are a different story. Although many of them want to escape their little hideouts in the urban jungle called Limbo, their leader, Tuller, is unwilling to give up his relatively comfortable position of power. When he betrays the rebels to the government, the others have to decide where they stand and if they're willing to take the risks necessary to gain their freedom.This is a fun series, and readers will cheer on Cord and his friends as they struggle to gain independence for themselves and others considered rejects by society."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"Ivan and September are two kids who live with their dad in a small town in Alaska. Since they live in a remote area they must be very careful with their choices they make. When their father goes out on a long fishing trip the children stay at home alone. On one of the days they are alone Ivan's video game batteries go out so he hooks up the radio battery to it, even though he is not supposed to since that is their only way of communicating with the outside world. When he does this the radio breaks and they go out to get a new radio. The only way Ivan and September can go anywhere is on a boat but they are not supposed to and dig up clams to earnm money to get a new radio. On one of the clam digging days there is a large storm but since they do not have a radio the do not know the weather so they get in the middle of a very large storm."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"Tom Bodett's latest opus is a slender volume, and in fact it's really a longish novella. It has the same tone and pacing of his End of the Road tales.The story concerns two young adolescent siblings, September and Ivan Crane. They live in the &quot;bush&quot; of Alaska, the wild and untamed areas far from power lines and telephone hookups. Their father, a commercial fisherman, must of necessity leave the children unattended for weeks at a stretch.They stay in touch via radio communication, at least until Ivan fries the transceiver. Now, the kids have only a week to make enough money to repair the radio before Dad calls again. That means trips across Bag Bay, and in the autumn of the year, the dreaded, violent storms known as williwaw can spring up at a moment's notice. One such storm claimed the children's mother seven years before.For a mainstream novel such as this, I was surprised at the total absence of any objectionable material. This book could fit very comfortably of a middle-school library shelf -- and yet it is not a &quot;children's&quot; book. This is a book for any reader who enjoys a page-turner."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"This is a strong message book - with the message being that even teenagers have to have moral character and live or die by their word. It's a story that is timeless, but is told like a folk tale, with country aphorisms and speckled with crusty old timers and real life problems. A good book for all ages, but particularly appealing to teenagers who should be able to relate to the problems of the teens in this story."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"Hello Parents,I was recently having a brief conversation with a friend, and I realized that many of us as parents are probably experiencing, and in some cases struggling with, the same issues related to assigned book reports for school. Issues like children procastinating to read the selected book, complete a written report, or prepare for oral report, etc.Last year, a serious reading comprehension problem was recognized for my son. He did not enjoy reading AT ALL. His book selections were lower level grade reading. Unless a book at his grade level had been made into a movie (i.e., Harry Potter, Holes), he did not enjoy reading it. I realize now that after seeing the movie, he could then more readily visualize the storyline as he read the book.This fall, my husband accompanied our son to the San Ramon Library to select a book for a 6th grade book report. Coincidentally, a book by Tom Bodett was on display in the library. Yes, Tom \\"We'll leave the porch light on for you\\" Bodett. As it turned out, it was an excellent selection. The plot is about siblings, 12 and 13 years old, and the choices they make while left alone. The book \\"Williwaw!\\" The book report was a success.During the holidays, I purchased \\"Williwaw!\\" because my son enjoyed it so much, I knew he would read it over and over. I also purchased another book by Mr. Bodett, \\"Norman Tuttle on the Last Frontier.\\" The oral book report that he is preparing for now was written completely on his own -- two pages, let me repeat, completely on his own! Success again! Norman is a teenager growing up in Alaska.I highly recommend you check out these books. And if you do, I hope you have the same success as my son. I know we'll be checking out other books by Tom Bodett. Thank you Mr. Bodett!"},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"Williwaw!By: Tom BodettReviewed by: Parth ShahPeriod: 1If you and your younger sister had the whole house to yourselves, would you remember what your parents said not to do? That was the case for Ivan and September because their dad who was a fisherman was delayed at sea. He told the children to not do two things. To not hook up any video games to the radio batteries. Or to not go near the bay. Obviously, kids don't listen to their parents when they aren't home, and Ivan decided to hook up his video games. And of course when you don't listen bad consequences can happen, and Ivan ended up breaking the shortwave radios, which was the one link to the outside world from Alaska. Ivan and his sister had to quickly repair the radios before their father came home otherwise he will be mad! That only meant one thing. They have to sneak back and forth on a little tiny boat across the Bag Bay.So Ivan and September waited a day or two until the skies were clear. But autumn is an unpredictable season and they would soon find out that heading their way is the most violent storm: a williwaw!I liked this book because it is interesting to find out if Ivan and his sister make it in time to fix the radio before their father comes back. I also like it when they had to find out a way to survive the storm. There is so much action and adventure and homour to this book.I didn't like this story that much because there were many boring parts of this book. For instance, the storm and the part when he hooks up the video games all go by fast.My favorite part of this book is when Ivan and his siter find out that they are home by themsleves and it is cool to see what they do. I like this part because it was very funny. I also like the parts when Ivan and his sister are adventurous and the story is full of action!"},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"Absolutely charming book, great for all grade levels.

But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids."},{"Title":"Williwaw!","review":"This book was great. I live in the bush in Alaska and even homeschool.

Considering its length, it has two major strengths:1. It concludes with excercises paralleling Reiky II. The comparison of the practice of Kundalini (e.g. through Hatha yoga) to the manipulation of Ki, especially in Reiky, is IMO a very important one. The more angles this esoteric topic is shown through, the better the understanding. Kudos to Ravindra Kumar.2. Many excercises are given in this booklet that yoga practitioners would define as peripheral to mainstream [Hatha] yoga practice. However, Since Kundalini is all about taking the best out of each type of yoga, this makes for a really wonderful -- better still, irreplacable -- anthology. You simply can't cover more topics than that without a guru.To conclude, this book complements Hiroshi Motoyama's &quot;Theories of the Chakras&quot;, with its impressive chakra-opening-guide appendix by Swami Satyananda.The book &quot;All You Wanted to Know About Hatha Yoga&quot; by the same author is also recommended. It's very handy, and Hatha yoga is, well, probably very good for you."},{"Title":"Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Guide To Livin' Real Good","review":"I made the mistake of buying one book as a gift. I'd heard how good Ruby Ann's books are, and I have a pal that is a big Martha Stewart fan, so I ordered this book for her. When it arrived I started to wrap it up, but paused to glance at it. The pictures caught my eye and after just one page I was hooked. Not only didn't I wrap the book, I took it to my bedroom to keep for myself on the nightstand. I first tried to read it as fast as I could before our gift exchange, but with each page my feeling of personal possession grew stronger. I ended up having to buy a second copy to give to my pal, and additional copies to give to my other friends as well. The lesson here is that if you plan on giving &quot;Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Guide to Livin' Real Good&quot; as a gift, don't open it up, or just pick up two copies, one for the gift and one for you. I've already told all my friends to get me her other books this year. Now if they just come through. Ruby Ann Boxcar is 100% fall-out-of-the-bed-with-laughter funny regardless if you live in a trailer or not."},{"Title":"Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Guide To Livin' Real Good","review":"After seeing Ruby Ann on the John Walsh Show, I ran out and picked up her &quot;Livin' Real Good&quot; book to give as a gift to my mother in-law. Before I wrapped it up I thought I should give it a quick read just to make sure it was actually something my mother in-law would enjoy. I ended up reading the entire book, and decided to keep it myself. I haven't laughed like this since I read my first Erma Bombeck book. Ms. Boxcar had me in tears. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. She had been funny as all get out when she cooked on John Walsh, but I wasn't sure if this was a cookbook or just what. Well, let me tell you that it is not a cookbook. She does have a few recipes in it, but for the most part, with her tips on make-up, gardening, decorating, tipping, dining out, entertaining, and money matters just to name a few chapters, it is more of a Martha Stewart type book with a sense of humor. For example, who else but Ruby Ann would think to make a bird feeder and a matching birdbath out of old tires and trashcan lids? The Elvis shrine made from an old pop bottle is a must for any Elvis fan. And I bet you won't find a gingerbread trailer home how to in any of Martha's books. The only bad thing about this book is that it will make you want to go out and buy all her other books. Did I mention I'm hooked on Ruby Ann Boxcar? As you can guess, every adult on my shopping list is getting one of her books this year including my father in-law who loves to grill (He gets her &quot;BBQ Cookbook&quot;). So basically I will be giving the best gift anyone can give, the gift of laughter. As for my mother in-law, she is getting the entire set. I have a feeling that after this Christmas I will become her favorite daughter in-law. My only hope is that Ms. Boxcar keeps writing more books so my gift giving will be this easy every year."},{"Title":"Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Guide To Livin' Real Good","review":"After seeing Ruby Ann on the John Walsh Show I ordered her book. My mother was over at the time and Ms. Boxcar had both of us in tears from laughter. So as soon as the show was over both my mother and I ordered her book, I purchased this one and my mother purchased &quot;Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Cookbook&quot;. Can I say that the books were even better then she was on TV. My mother and I couldn't put them down. And the funny thing is that neither of us has ever lived in a trailer park, but we still get the jokes and the humor. Eventually we swapped books with each other. All I can say is that both books were pure pleasure, and the food is pretty good as well. My mother and I have already ordered all her other books and soon we will have two sets, one for me and one for my mother. We can't wait for our next Ruby Ann fix. If you enjoy eating as well as laughing, then this book is a must."},{"Title":"Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park Guide To Livin' Real Good","review":"This is the book you sit down and read any part you wnat when you want a good laugh.

I've gotten multiplied times more useful information off the internet.Add to that the fact that the manual was damaged when I got it (looks like a truck had run over it several times), and I'm really not impressed.I'll continue to use Haynes Manuals when I can, but this one is a bit of a disappointment."},{"Title":"A Fly in the Soup: Memoirs (Poets on Poetry)","review":"Charles Simic, A Fly in the Soup (University of Michigan, 2000)Charles Simic is a fantastic poet; a case could be made that he is, in fact, the best poet working in the English language today. Pick up any random book of Simic's poetry and you'll be holding a wonder; you might even be holding a masterpiece. He's written enough of them. Which is why I find it so surprising that, while one can't call A Fly in the Soup a mediocre book, it seems to be lacking some sort of spark that turns Simic from a gifted poet into one of the planet's best.A collection of essays previously published in various spots collected and made into a memoir, A Fly in the Soup presents some truly harrowing pictures; Charles Simic did not, to say the least, have an easy life. Those who cringe at the present spate of \\"poor, poor pitiful me\\" memoirs will probably find this one a breath of fresh air, as Simic, even in moments of deepest sorrow, looks back on these situations with wry amusement and a touch of cynicism (his relation of an encounter at a writers' workshop with Daniel Hoffman-- who was flying one of the jets that bombed Belgrade during Simic's WWII childhood-- is itself worth reading this book for). The book is suffused with that same wryness, and while these events are not depicted through rose-colored lenses, they're not seen through the gunmetal grey of many recent memoirs, either; there's much here to like.And were it any other author, really, I'd call this one of the best memoirs I'd seen in quite a while (not the best; Charles Burns' Black Hole takes that cake). And if I'm going to be fair about it, it really is. It's intellectually engaging, readable, and will at least keep you entertained.What it is not, though, is great. I know the folly of looking at a great poet and expecting him to be a fantastic short story writer, or vice versa; Bukowski was a much better poet than short story writer, as much as my admitting that is going to destroy my cred. Raymond Carver is a brilliant prose stylist, but his poetry often leaves me banging my head against the nearest sharp metal object. The number of people who can do both with equal grace and talent is a handful, at best. So when I read this and see a great poet who is a good prose stylist, why do I feel so let down? Eh, I'm raising my review half a star on the general principle that I shouldn't let my expectations rule my impressions. ***"},{"Title":"Five Star Stories #1","review":"Newtype and Animage are my favorite anime mags, and now I get to read the amazing FSS manga that appeared in them!

The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book has a more than one person biting their lips when found in tenuous situation. The writing is more than a little bland, and repetitive with a glossed over account of the actual crime which is approximately three pages long. The totality of the remaining 90% of the book is having us follow the interrogation and temporary arrest of one of the witnesses and the reverent, caring, Normal Rockwellian family through their grieving and processing. Nothing about the perpetrators lives or motives is recounted in anything but the barest of details. Mostly this could suffice as a very long diary entry about a family tragedy, but does not really need to be fashioned into a book. It was hard getting through this one."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"About 10 years ago I became a real fan of the true crime genre. I was on a flight from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles and bad weather delayed our flight in Dallas and I had to spend the night in a hotel at the expense of American Airlines. I didn't have a book with me so I wandered into the magazine store of the airport which had maybe 20 books on a rack. One of them was by Ann Rule. I had never bought or read a true crime book in my life, but this one almost kept me up all night and through the plane ride into LA the next day.I have read a lot of true crime books since then, including all of Ann Rule's books (she is the Queen of True Crime after all), but it wasn't until last night when I stayed up reading A Rip in Heaven, that I felt I had found a book that I literally didn't want to put the book down.Others here have described the story and it is incredible, particularly the part of the surviving victim who gets accused by the police of the horrific crimes on no evidence.I write instead to defend the author, Jeanine Cummins' writing style and her decision to write in the third person. Although she was a first time author when this book was published I found her writing to be fluid and compelling. I also thing the third person approach was an excellent way to bring a bit of objectivity to the story.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"At the end of the book, the author stresses how the purpose of the book was to focus on the victims, rather than the sensationalism of the crime. Yet, throughout the book, I found very little to help me to connect to the victims, whom I'm sure were wonderful girls. I think the book would have reached me more deeply had it been written from the first person voice, rather than the author referring to herself in the third person. I also wonder about her insights on scenes during which she was not present. Nevertheless, the book touched me and I pray for the victims and the families involved. I believe her portrayal of the media was right on target."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I applaud the author's courage in wanting to tell the story of her murdered cousins & her brother & the way the horrible tragedy of the murders impacted her family. The story is well-told & plainly written, but the author's decision to write in third person (even when writing about herself) is clumsy & tends to distance the reader in ways that feel counterproductive. A much better read in this vein is Strange Piece of Paradise by Terri Jentz which blew me away with both the author's courage & her skill as a writer."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I don't often get teary-eyed from reading a book.

I couldn't put this one down until I'd finished it.This is the story of the murder of two young women in St. Louis a little over 10 years ago and the horrible aftermath of the tragedy.

Jeanine (Tink) Cummins literary device of writing in the third-person omniscient is grating to say the least. A compelling story of murder, rape, and police malfeasance is sidetracked by a gimmicky POV. Miss Cummins wants to be Truman Capote. Still, its a good story. The police again prove themselves to be clowns and the guilty parties are brought to justice by sheer luck. Gee! What a surprise... cops acting self-righteous and stupid. I swear, law enforcement must recruit at the Special Olympics. The account of their boorish and pompous behavior that almost sent an innocent person to jail should be a warning. THEY ARE NOT ALL HEROES!!!!!! In fact, very few are. Some cops are decent I'm sure (I'm still looking) although this account should dispel any notion that the police are always on the side of the angels. Jeanine Cummins' book is worth the price of admission if it causes the reader to look at police with a more jaundiced eye.Nevertheless, the fact that Cummins writes a first person account from an overly self aware third-person viewpoint is just plain distracting. Miss Tink, the story itself is interesting. Knowing that you cried a...well...a Mississippi River worth of tears and threw up a bazillion times adds nothing to the story.One other thing. If I were Tom Cummins, your brother, I'd want to hide under a rock after reading your account. Tom is portrayed as the biggest wuss on God's green earth. Tom can't fight, Tom cries when the police swear at him, Tom can't handle a night in a holding cell, Tom was humiliated, Tom felt like throwing up, etc. Thanks a heap, little sis, you've succeeded in totally emasculating your brother for all the world to see. In Tink's attempt at painting a sympathetic picture of her brother she has turned him into the biggest pansy imaginable.Okay, so what does reccomend this work? Thanks for asking. Jeanine Cummins is a capable writer. The story sucks the reader in and her sense of pacing is very good for a first time author. The book holds your attention and flows easily with only a few exceptions. So, criticisms aside, buy A Rip In Heaven. I look forward to reading her next book."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I thought the author paid a wonderful tribute to her 2 cousins and did a great service to victims of violent crimes and their families. The story is heart wrenching and terribly sad, yet at the same time, it makes you feel that Julie and Robin would have been proud of their family members and what they have done to bring into the light the injustices that a victim's family often endures in the media and in the justice system. Although I did not personally know the victims, I think they would have been proud to know that, in the end, their lives were bigger than their limited years. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I could not put this book down! The story is riveting and heartbreaking, and the writing is fantastic -- this reads like a novel more than a true crime. I felt like I was right there as the horrifying events unfold, and as the family deals with the tragedy and the injustices that follow. What I admired most is how the author, herself in the center of the story, manages to be so generous in its telling. We go into the heads and viewpoints of each family member as well as the four killers, and as a result we get a nuanced, thoughtful and balanced portrait of that fateful night and resulting tragedy. The killers are living breathing men whose lives and personalities converge to create this crime -- a senseless tragedy that robs the world of two amazing, spirited young women. The author calls the book her \\"personal memory stone\\" to her cousins, and it's a beautiful, heartbreaking tribute."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I remember when this happened near my home in St. Louis. The murders of Julie and Robin Kerry were front page news. This book gives the details from the family's perspective, from the personalities of the victims, to the inexcusable idiocy of the police investigation. It also gives an eyewitness account of how these young women died needlessly at the hands of violent thugs. Once you begin reading this book, you won't be able to put it down until you've finished it! Possibly the best book I have read in years."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"In this third-person narrative, Jeanine Cummins describes her family's horrendous experience with murder and its aftermath. While on a visit with his family to St. Louis, the author's brother, Tom Cummins, meets up with his teenage cousins Julie and Robin for a last-minute, after-hours jaunt. They end up at an old, abandoned bridge called The Chain of Rocks. It spans the Mississippi River, and that's where their nightmare begins.After viewing a poem (ironically, about human unity and peace) that Julie has grafitied on the bridge, the cousins encounter four young hoodlums who are feeling restless and \\"ready to hunt.\\" The cousins' innocent and friendly conversation with these strangers provides a strong counterpoint to the sudden brutality with which they are attacked. A sense of the surreal pervades the rest of the story, as it follows the struggles of the cousins and their family's ongoing ordeal.In penning this very personal story, Jeanine Cummins has done a remarkable job: her point of view is well-balanced, and the people are defly drawn individuals that we come to care about. This book is particularly excellent at highlighting the similarities between random violence and a legal system which can mindlessly grind up both individuals and families."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Jeanine Cummins reads like a dream--seemingly effortless, splendidly scintillating, her prose carefully drawn: her account of the crime itself is almost hallucinatory in its vividness, and her narrative arcs to encompass each emotion of this terribly sad tale of the death of cousins and the arrest of her brother. This reads like the literary offspring of Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" that it is--except that Cummins doesn't need to draw upon elements of fiction for her facts; only her lovely prose, which captures so well its subject, owes to fiction its spare, gorgeous manifestation here."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"The pacing of the book seemed a little uneven with the book starting out slowly. But the pace picked up and I think the author did a good job of connecting us to the victims of the crime and putting us right there at the scene with them.Even though the author is related to the victims, she did a fair job of background and perspective on the perpetrators of the crime. A significant amount of the book is devoted to aftermath of the event to help explain the impact on the victims.overall this is a quite well done book for a first work from a young author."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This was truly a riveting and interesting book. I could not put it down. The author had me in tears through parts of the book and laughing in other parts. It is a very thought provoking book and is a very wonderful tribute to the victims in this true story!"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Although this is a true crime book and heartbreaking, it is also a heartwarming story. The love and concern Ms. Cummins had for her brother and cousins radiated from the pages as she told the story of the death of her cousins and near death of her brother. I was so moved by the story that I sent Ms. Cummins an email to let her know how she touched me and that I wished her a great future as an author. I was so surprised a few months later to receive an answer back, thanking me for my email. What a class act and her family should be so proud. May her cousins rest in peace and her brother have a wonderful life."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I found the book to be very interesting and couldn't put the book down. I enjoyed reading further to find out what happened to Tom and if the girls survived. I didn't realize that the law system and judicial system could be manipulated so much and look for easy answers. I recommend anybody reading this book, it will open your eyes to a world that we sometimes choose not to see.Forever changed"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This is a harrowing and chilling account of one family's devastating encounter with 4 evil & future-less criminals. This is a very well-written book. Like another reviewer, I live on the other side of the country and I had never heard this story before. I feel for the family for the suffering they went through, both through the crimes themselves, and the aftermath. The part about &quot;Amnesty International&quot; scheduling &quot;Die-Ins&quot; to protest the execution of these murderers is particularly galling.Tom, in particular, is a character tested beyond the limit of human endurance. After I read this book, I looked up &quot;RipinHeaven.com&quot; to get an update on how the family was surviving and if they were able to ever lead &quot;normal&quot; lives again. The restraint and class that Jeanine shows time and time again in her even-handed approach is a credit to her family. She gives these victims a voice and a life they were so sorely robbed of. I highly recommend this book, and look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Bought this book while stranded in airport, and finished it before I even got home, so it's a fast read. However, there are a few things within the story that are either glossed over and not addressed, or jump so quickly that you are left in doubt as to how the revelations unfolded.When did Tom finally discover his hip was broken?Why were the police to readily willing to convict Tom, when it was obvious he was a victim?How could a PD that was so willing to convict someone innocent, immediately jump from the bus driver with the missing flashlight and connect it to Richardson? That story seemed strange to me.This story is wonderful from the perspective of promoting victim's rights. As one who's family was a victim of crime (thankfully not as horrendous as murder) it boggles the mind when you see an outpouring of sympathy for criminals, especially when they know full well the repercussions of their actions. In a small way, Tink has reclaimed some dignity for Tom, Robin and Julie."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"The heart of this book is chapters 4 through 11, where we are given a taut, detailed account of the brutal attacks and of the hours of abuse suffered by the surviving victim at the hands of St. Louis homocide detectives.Chapters 12 through 15 (about 60 pages) cover the investigation, apprehension, and trials of the vermin responsible. Unfortunately, the author goes on to tell us all about parole hearings and execution stays and Ricki Lake and Court TV and thus manages to actually drain away some of the disturbing power of the tale she has so skillfully told."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"While I find the story itself to be compelling, this memoir is extremely flawed, and I felt it was actually a bit exploitive. Jeanine Cummins basically used a family tragedy to get herself published and sell books. From the beginning, it is apparent that she is feigning a relationship with the Kerry sisters that never actually existed. If you read the book carefully, you will see that the vacation in which the tragedy occurred was actually the only contact Jeanine had with the Kerry sisters in many years. Yet Jeanine tries to make it seem like they were close, and it's obvious that they weren't by her trite, two dimensional portraits of them. According to her the Kerry girls were two saints, which is how they would appear from the perspective of a distant family member after they were murdered since people rarely speak ill of the dead. Yet this portrayal actually robs them of their humanity, and allows the reader to distance themselves from what occurred. In my opinion Cummins should have stuck to the description of how the events affected her brother (who was close to Julie Cummins) instead of trying to insert herself into the tragedy and make it about her. The fact that several Kerry family members wouldn't assist her in the writing and publication of the book, including an older Kerry sister, underscores the fact that she was not close to the girls and was using this family tragedy for her own ends."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This is a memoir of a True Crime written by a member of the victims' family. So, it is understandable that she would not in any way want to glorify the perpetrators. So, the reader sees pictures of the victims' Happy Family (of whom I had to make a chart, as the writer throws a whole bunch of names and ages at you right off, and expects you to \`get it\\" and remember this \\"who's Who\\" forever more) \\"before\\" and the locale of the crime, but. perhaps in a sort of permutated \\"Son of Sam\\" statute philosophy, there are no pix of the perps!This reviewer reads and reviews lots of True Crime, and I want to see pix of the perps! Attempting to google up these pix took forever, I still didn't find them all, and in that unsuccessful attempt, I learned WAY more about the case than I wanted to before reading the book.So what's the point in reading it now?I already know what happened to all the participants.This may be a lovely book, and an indictment of whatever portion of the Law & Order process with which one disagrees, but be warned that it is in a realm of its own. For an example of balance in True Crime reportage, read Rule's newest: *Green River, Running Red* /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"On page 2, the author says \\"I don't pretend for a moment to be unbiased\\". That was an understatement. While her bias is understandable (her brother is an alleged \\"victim\\"), Rip in Heaven should not be considered a \\"memoir\\". Those familiar with the case will know that Tom Cummins (the author's brother) was initially treated as a suspect in the April 1991 deaths of Julie and Robin Kerry (the author's cousins). I actually found it to be quite offensive that this book reads as little more than an emotionally charged and highly embellished defense of her brother Tom Cummins, who is still considered by many to be responsible for the deaths of the Kerry sisters. It's a whitewash and nothing more.This is reality as Ms. Cummins would like it to be, indeed as she probably believes it to be. However, the other side of the case presents and equally compelling argument (and in my opinion, more compelling). Don't buy this book expecting it to be \\"objective\\" in any sense of the word, it's completely biased and embellished to point that I think it should be categorized as fiction."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"As a St. Louis resident during this crime, I was especially interested in this book. I was very disheartened when I heard Ms. Cummins interviewed on the radio and a police detective called in and challenged her account, claiming that she misquoted him. It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I am a big fan of true crime and this book did not disappoint in terms of the \\"I can't believe this is a true story\\" element you look for in a true crime book. Jeanine Cummins and her family went to visit their cousins for spring break. One night, her two female cousins and her brother were attacked on the Chain of Rocks Bridge that spans the Mississippi River just outside of St. Louis and thrown over the side. Tom survived but the two girls were killed. That didn't end the nightmare for Tom or his family, when in a shocking twist, Tom became the focus of the police investigation. This book provides everything you want in a good memoir, written by someone who was personally impacted by the events that took place. I read this book in one sitting, not being able to stop reading it once I started. It is extremely sad (as you would expect) but also an interesting (and horrifying) look at police procedure and prejudice."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This story will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn't let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed. The lesson to be learned from this book, is that the majority of us at one time or another have walked to the fringe and escaped unchanged and luckier then we can imagine . A horrific tale that hopefully will save others a simliar FATE, It's difficult to comprehend that this is just one family's tragedy out of the thousands of cries of anguish that go on in silence. Trust me (or not), don't miss this book !"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I had this book on my book shelf for a while and hesitated to read it because I knew that it would be painful and depressing. This is the first book that I have read regarding true crime where you really feel to the core the effects and aftermath on the living. This book is excellent, well written, and one of the few books you read that will stay with you and effect how you process stories that you read and watch in the future. After reading this, you truly comprehend the pain and lasting effects that violence has on everyone left behind."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I have little to add to the other reviewers here. But as one who has written about victims myself, I believe this is the best account I've ever read of the devastation criminals leave in their wake.Read this not merely to learn about a heinous crime or evil men. Read it to meet two wonderful young women, or maybe three -- Julie and Robin, the victims, and Jeanine Cummins, the author."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book was a very mind opening read. It helps a person understand the torment and pain a family can go through when such a tragedy befalls them. I have always thought that the death penalty should be sought for all \\"cold blooded murders\\", but after reading this book, I think that the victim's family should have a say in the matter."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"As an avid reader of true crime, I am used to reading the cold, hard facts of crimes written by authors who get the whole story well after the trials have finished. This book is a breath of fresh air, as it is told by someone who lived through it day to day. It was so interesting having the story told in that way. You don't often get this perspective, and I eagerly read this book all the way through. Wonderfully written and painstakingly honest, this book is a must read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"What can I say? A must read! A superbly written account. From humor to stomach churning at the turn of a page. It's a real eye-opener, it's easy to read, and in my opinion it opens avenues for further works. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. Well done. I am eagerly awaiting the next publication."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I read the review on this book in People Magazine and finished it in three days. It was a very well researched book and a real tribute to the Author's family. The whole family has a gifting in the written word, Tink, Robin, &amp; Julie. The book was an easy read. I recommend you check it out."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book was written to share the 2 lives lost in a tragic manor. The family of these 2 girls will for ever be changed but the author wants to share there story with the readers."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"A very sad story of 2 lives lost,but they are remembered by there family. VERY true but sad story. RIP Julie and Robin Kerry."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I am a devotee of true crime and have an extensive library. I put my \\"exceptional\\" books on the top shelf... A Rip in Heaven will be on that shelf!!!Once I started reading Jeanine Cummins' A Rip in Heaven, I could not put it down. Her personal family involvement in the story made it quite touching, too; the author did an exceptional job of describing each of victims due to her close ties. I felt that I knew them and I grieve at the loss of three such fine young people. Very seldom does a true crime book bring me to tears... this one did! The tragic story is told in an exceptional writing style and I look forward to reading another book by Ms. Cummins.I only hope it won't be too long before I have that pleasure."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Kudos to the woman who was able to put all her personal feelings into a tellable report, for us all to share. The telling of such a personal,heart-wretching experience had to be a very final chapter in grieving for her.It's a story that needs to be studied on every college campus,nation wide. We young people think that nothing like this could ever happen to us. We know deep down, that it's just not so. Read this, cry with this family, and get angry with the violent people involved."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book was referred to me by a friend and it turned out to be a story that I coulnd't put down. From the beginning, it is a great story that captured my attention and brought a new realization to the happenings of the world around me. Overall, it was a fantastic read and something that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good book based on a true story."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Very heart breaking story. However, awesome book. This paved the way for me into real life kind of stories. Originally I liked young readers book but this was an easy transition."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"\\"An excellent memoir and true crime saga. It made me think about some issues, such as the death penalty and victims' rights. It took me about 50 pages or so to really get into it, then I couldn't put it down.\\""},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"The story was indeed captivating and tragic. This book is recommended on Ann Rule's website so I trusted that it would be a \\"good read\\" but skeptical because it was the first book of a young author. Well, I was not disappointed. Tink's writing is excellent. I was constantly amazed at her ability to make me feel like I was there and that I knew the characters well. She is a very gifted writer (as were the victims) and I hope she continues to write. Trust me - if you like non-fiction or/and true crime, this in a book you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I too read this book quickly, staying up one night until 2 or 3 in the morning, and I was riveted. I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book was one of the best written literary works I have ever encountered. Knowing people involved first hand I was moved more so then I thought I would. Jeanine, or Tink as she is referred to in the book told her family's story in a seamless, nonjudgemental way. This must have taken hours of research to get all the small details to the case and must have been hard to deal with. The end result is a wronderful book!"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Admittedly, I am addicted to true crime books. I have to say that this one was the best I've ever read. It kept me glued to the book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Tink (Cummins) did an outstanding job of documenting a terrible event and the aftermath that affects the victims and their families. She invites the readers into her tight-knit family with open arms and once you are in the family circle, her vivid description of this horrific night and the years that follow consumes you. This book is a great eye opener for all of those &quot;psycho-killer&quot; followers (American Justice or Cold Case Files viewers) and gives a very balanced and poiniant perspective on the people who matter -- the victims."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Not all, but most of us have grown up with fond memories of family gatherings - whether frequent or infrequent, with cousins near in age whom we admired or admired us, all of the good times thought about during the course of our daily lives.For this family, happiness and normal life as they knew it came to a sudden hault as a horror they never expected unfolded before them. Read this book. The author is able to give you a true account of what really went on because she is the sister of one of the victims, Tom and cousin to the other two victims, Julie and Robin.This story will give you an idea of how the justice system can sometimes work under pressure to solve a murder case. Eventually the truth comes out but a lot of people can go through a living hell before that happens.After I read a true crime story, I try to find as much information as possible regarding the case, written by other sources. I was sickened by some of the information I found fighting for the lives of those convicted of this horrific crime. That is just a personal opinion though.You will get to know the deceased through this book, and perhaps question your higher power on why such valuable lives are taken in such a violent way. I felt I came to know the victims as if I'd gone to school with them. I never knew them but I miss them."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"So much of what we see in the media today sensationalizes the brutality of crime and in some sense celebrates the monsters who commit them. The stories become about them, and the victims and their families are all too quickly forgotten.Thanks to Jeanine Cummins, we get an insightful look into one family's ordeal, their struggle to come to terms with the sensation that rose up around the case and how the media focuses all too often on the criminals.But at its heart, this is a loving tribute to her lost cousins, Robin and Julie. This book serves, beautifully, in taking their story and remembering truly what has been lost. For over a decade, the focus has been on the bad guys who she portrays quite evenly given her closeness to the subject matter. Now the story has been take back as a fitting memoir to her cousins, told with an insight into what it means to be victimized that we could all stand to learn from."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"It was a good idea when Jeanine Cummins decided to write this very informative and true story of what happened to her cousins on the awful night during Spring break on the Chain of Rocks Bridge in St. Louis. It is one thing to hear the media views and what you see on the television, but this however, is an heartfelt account told by the Jeanine \`Tink' Cummins. She tells us of the day-to-day agony of what these families went through during the investigations, and how this trial affected their lives. Not only for the girls who were thrown off the bridge, but for poor Tom Cummins as well, who at first was held as a suspect. I felt every bit of pain that I imagined he and his family suffered,but I was glad for the wonderful tribute that Tink paid to her cousins enlightening the truth of the principles that Julie and Robin Kerry stood for.Jeanine Cummins did a great job with this story for the peoplewho never got to hear the real truth.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 03/01/05)"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"The author takes a very personal story about the murder of her cousins and produces a a well-written book that honors their memory.The story is interesting and Ms. Cummins tightly versed book keeps your interest with no overdone or lingering sections often found in books. She is a very talented writer who should have a long and brillant career in the writing field."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"A job well done for a first-time author. I know that it must have been extremely difficult to write about something so close to home and actually have to document some horribly graphic details about violations that happened to people she loved and loves. She's a very strong person for having the courage to write this book in efforts to tell readers about her cousins, be a voice for her brother, and describe how tragedies affect families, not just individuals. It's easy for us review-writers to sit back and say whether a book was great or it sucked or we think she's doing this for &quot;fame and fortune&quot; (directed to Alert Reviewer from Bridgton, MO). The fact (and &quot;The Truth&quot;) is that we would never have the balls to do what she has done and I don't think any of us would want to go through what Julie, Robin, Tom or their families have gone through in exchange for any amount of fame or fortune. Anyone who thinks that this is the sole reason she went through five years of writing and research hell, ridiculous interview questions from dirty cops, and cold shoulders from some family members needs to put themselves in her shoes. Would you go through all that for what a first- author gets paid for their book?(Which is not much -- I can assure you.) No one with their right mind would. We would only do it to memorialize the ones we love, to help other families who have suffered tragedies themselves, and because our brother, who has to live with the memory of this incident for the rest of his life, asked us to. Just like Tink."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Not being from that part of the country, I was unfamiliar with the crime and had never heard of the Kerry sisters until I picked up this book. Now I feel like I've been privileged enough to get to know them in a small way. What a wonderful tribute to these girls, and what an amazing thing the author did for her cousins and brother by writing this book to give them a voice. If anything ever happened to me or one of my loved ones, I could only hope that we would have a champion like Ms. Cummins to make sure we were not forgotten. The book also made me examine my own thoughts and feelings on the justice system and capital punishment. Very thought-provoking. I've been recommending it to all my friends."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Being that I knew people involved I was nervous about reading the book, and learning about the horrible and destructive things that had happened. But I couldn't put it down. It took my breath away, the horror of it all. I felt as thought I had truly missed out on the chance of encountering these truly amazing women. I was also touched deeply, at the authors ability to envelope me into this tight nit family, made me feel their sorry, their fear, their anger, the resolve, and the love they have for each other. A truly well written book, I look forward to more from her."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these \\"mystery 4 men\\". I was glad to hear a book had been written from \\"their\\" point of view. When I say \\"their\\" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"Amazingly written. A heartbreaking story of a violent attack and a family going through the worst experience of their lives. Beautifully written. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I loved this book! The story is sad but not morbid. The writer (a close family member) does an excellent job of describing the events, and you feel like you personally know all the people involved. It's not overly dramatic or sensationalised - just a really well-written account of the deaths of two young women, and the ongoing effect on family members and friends."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This true account is well written, riviting, and perfectly clear. What happens to the young man is beyond understanding. Crime on top of crime is what comes to mind. But he survived to tell the story."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This is a very well written book that will take you from tears of pain to tears of joy and back again. Wonderfully written in a way that will keep the book in your hand well past midnight.. The voices of the victims and families effected by tragedy are given their chance."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I'm so glad this wasn't one of those books where a murder occurs and it tears the family apart. The Cumminses are a great group, you can tell, the way their family only grew stronger through everything. The book reads like a mystery and memoir simultaneously, and the emotions felt by all the characters are very powerful--and absolutely interesting. The courtroom drama to it all was pretty neat, again, I was really glad it was courtroom drama and not family drama. It slightly ticked me off that it wasn't until the trial that we learned that Julie had a best friend--way to not focus on someone else this directly affected. The other thing that weirded me out was that Tink, the author, referred to herself in the third person. This would be slightly bearable, except whenever something happens that directly affected her in the story, she interjects her thoughts and draws attention to the fact that she is the one writing this, which made reading the book a little awkward and annoying at times. Tink was extremely brave to actually take the time to write this, not as a publicity stunt, but for her own personal healing as well as justice to Robin and Julie. The last two paragraphs of the book are some of the best, most powerfully honest, pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure to read. It's a fantastic memoir that, at times, moves along a little slowly, but is well worth the read.Rating: 4/5(And the other thing that creeped me out? The murders, they happened on my birthday, the exact date and year.)"},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"As one reviewer has noted, this is not a typical addition to the true crime genre. It shares much in common with Strange Piece of Paradise in that both are attempts by a victim/family member to depict the aftermath of a crime. Where Terri Jentz had to confront years of not knowing who her attacker was, Jeanine Cummins and family had to face having a beloved family member being accused of killing two other beloved family members.It's hard to review a book such as this without a certain amount of sympathy entering into one's judgment. It is for me, at least. This is not the best written non-fiction book you'll ever read, nor is the prose in it the most fluid. It is also, because of Cummins' decision to tell this in the third-person, the most emotionally wrought. But it is better written than most first person accounts I've read. Cummins takes considerable pains to bring Julie and Robin Kerry to life, to make the reader feel the loss Cummins and her family felt. The horror of their deaths (and the nature of their deaths) is compounded when Cummins' brother is accused of their murders.This is the story of the death of innocence, both literal and figurative. By the time the murders are caught, turn on each other and three are sentenced to death there little sense of justice for the family. Two girls have been gang-raped and murdered, one of the bodies has never been found. The survivor of the attacks has been first branded the likely suspect by the press then must relive the events over and over, in the trials and the subsequent parole hearings. As if this isn't enough agony, they must endure having the convicted murderers still claim their innocence and blame one of the victims. The question of Why? remains unanswered by the perpetrators and possibly unanswerable."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This book was hard to put down. It is very well written and it will have your blood boiling."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I have not read this book yet but added it to my wish list. I'm from the St. Louis area and was in high school when this happened. I had also been on the Chain of Rocks bridge around that time frame. It is thoroughly creepy knowing the girls died there. I have also seen inscriptions on the bridge where people wrote a final message before they jumped off and killed themselves.As someone who is also a survivor of homicide and was a victim of attempted murder, I totally sympathize with the writer and her family. People make a big deal out of the fact that her brother was a suspect. If you had experience with dealing with this situation you'd know the police treats everyone like a suspect. I had an uncle that was treated as a suspect in my mom's murder even though I told police it was not him that attacked her. They did believe me when it came to light that I had knowledge of damning information.I think people need to realize this happens to all sorts of families. You never know when it could happen to yours."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"I read this book in less than 24 hours and still can't get the horror of what happened to the Kerry sisters out of my head. I didn't know how good this book would be, having been written by the victims' relative, but it is very well-written and hard to put down. If what happened to the writer's brother, Tom Cummins, is true (about the police brutality that forced him to give a \\"confession\\" and fail a lie detector test), that is very frightening as well."},{"Title":"A Rip in Heaven: A Memoir of Murder And Its Aftermath","review":"This is a page turner. I am not a \\"true crime\\" reader, so perhaps I can't speak as to how this book fits in the genre, but it seems to me that this book is something different than that (although it's true, and there was a crime). This book's purposes are i) a personal history and memorial, (ii) a therapeutic telling of a family tragedy, and (iii) an advocacy piece. Even as I write this review, the underlying story is still making headlines as one of the convicted murderers is heading to the death chamber (in two days) and claims innocence. And, the newspaper accounts still carry a suggestion that one of the victims might have some explaining to do - a dimension of the story that the book sheds a lot of light on. One important comment; I was interested in the book because of a local connection and I wanted to know the story better, but I was grateful that the \\"crime portions\\" provide minimal detail. The whole thing is gruesome enough."},{"Title":"Days of our years,","review":"It came just as expected and it seems brand new, I am almost afraid to open it!
